00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Voiceover] I would like to welcome you

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
to Biology at Khan Academy.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.300
And biology, as you might know,

00:00:08.318 --> 00:00:10.600
is the study of life.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.526
And I can't really imagine
anything more interesting

00:00:13.526 --> 00:00:16.124
than the study of life.

00:00:16.124 --> 00:00:17.200
And when I say "life,"

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.200
I'm not just talking
about us, human beings.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.810
I'm talking about all animals.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.921
I'm talking about plants.

00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:24.258
I'm talking about bacteria.

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:26.464
And it really is fascinating.

00:00:26.464 --> 00:00:30.929
How do we start off with
inanimate molecules and atoms?

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.162
You know, this right here
is a molecule of DNA.

00:00:33.162 --> 00:00:34.825
How do we start with things like that,

00:00:34.825 --> 00:00:38.217
and we get the complexity
of living things?

00:00:38.217 --> 00:00:39.181
And you might be saying,

00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:41.703
well, what makes something living?

00:00:41.703 --> 00:00:46.669
Well, living things convert
energy from one form to another.

00:00:46.669 --> 00:00:49.758
They use that energy to grow.

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:52.010
They use that energy to change.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.390
And I guess growth is a form of change.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.356
They use that energy to reproduce.

00:00:58.356 --> 00:01:01.357
And these are all, in and of themselves,

00:01:01.357 --> 00:01:02.434
fascinating questions.

00:01:02.434 --> 00:01:03.740
How do they do this?

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.936
You know, we look around us.

00:01:04.936 --> 00:01:06.782
How do we, you know, eat a muffin?

00:01:06.782 --> 00:01:09.245
And how does that allow us to move around

00:01:09.245 --> 00:01:11.115
and think, and do all the things we do?

00:01:11.115 --> 00:01:13.457
Where did the energy from
that muffin come from?

00:01:13.457 --> 00:01:17.236
How are we similar to
a plant or an insect?

00:01:17.236 --> 00:01:21.803
And we are eerily or strangely similar

00:01:21.803 --> 00:01:22.956
to these things.

00:01:22.956 --> 00:01:25.648
We actually have a lot more
in common with, you know,

00:01:25.648 --> 00:01:27.091
that tree outside your window,

00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:30.105
or that insect, that bee,
that might be buzzing around,

00:01:30.105 --> 00:01:31.555
then you realize.

00:01:31.555 --> 00:01:32.689
Even with the bacteria

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.812
that you can only even see

00:01:35.812 --> 00:01:37.809
at a microscopic level.

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:39.686
In fact, we have so much bacteria

00:01:39.686 --> 00:01:41.930
as part of what makes us, us.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.672
So these are fascinating questions.

00:01:43.672 --> 00:01:47.099
How did life even emerge?

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:48.989
And so over the course of what you see

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:50.776
in Biology on Khan Academy,

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:53.567
we're going to answer these fundamental,

00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:55.132
fascinating questions.

00:01:55.132 --> 00:01:58.169
We're going to think
about things like energy

00:01:58.169 --> 00:02:00.915
and the role of energy in life.

00:02:00.915 --> 00:02:04.609
We're going to thing about
important molecules in biology.

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:06.513
And perhaps most importantly,

00:02:06.513 --> 00:02:11.498
DNA and its role in reproduction
and containing information.

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:14.232
And we're going to study cells,

00:02:14.232 --> 00:02:17.587
which are the basic
building block of life.

00:02:17.587 --> 00:02:19.309
And as we'll see, even
though we view cells

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:21.923
as these super, super small, small things,

00:02:21.923 --> 00:02:25.202
cells in and of themselves
are incredibly complex.

00:02:25.202 --> 00:02:27.358
And if you compare them
to an atomic scale,

00:02:27.358 --> 00:02:28.852
they're quite large.

00:02:28.852 --> 00:02:31.899
In fact, this entire blue
background that I have there,

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:34.216
that's the surface of an immune cell.

00:02:34.216 --> 00:02:37.095
And what you see here emerging from it,

00:02:37.095 --> 00:02:39.972
these little yellow things.

00:02:39.972 --> 00:02:44.635
These are HIV viruses,
emerging from an immune cell.

00:02:44.635 --> 00:02:46.091
So even though you imagine cells

00:02:46.091 --> 00:02:48.497
as these very, very
small microscopic things,

00:02:48.497 --> 00:02:50.178
this incredible complexity.

00:02:50.178 --> 00:02:51.102
Even viruses.

00:02:51.102 --> 00:02:53.123
Viruses are one of
these fascinating things

00:02:53.123 --> 00:02:56.687
that kind of are right on the
edge between life and nonlife.

00:02:56.687 --> 00:03:00.513
They definitely reproduce,
and they definitely evolve.

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:03.403
But they don't necessarily
have a metabolism.

00:03:03.403 --> 00:03:04.729
We'll learn a lot more about that.

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:07.104
They don't necessarily
use energy and growth

00:03:07.104 --> 00:03:09.738
in the same way that we
would associate with life.

00:03:09.738 --> 00:03:12.419
And then perhaps one of the
biggest questions of all is

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:13.924
how did life come about?

00:03:13.924 --> 00:03:15.549
And we will study that

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.815
as we look at evolution
and natural selection.

00:03:19.815 --> 00:03:23.800
So welcome to Khan
Academy's Biology section.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.767
I think you're going
to find it fascinating.

00:03:26.767 --> 00:03:29.625
You're going to realize
that biology, in some way,

00:03:29.625 --> 00:03:32.904
is the most complex of the sciences.

00:03:32.904 --> 00:03:35.786
And in a lot of ways, the one
that we understand the least.

00:03:35.786 --> 00:03:39.470
It's going to be built
on top of chemistry,

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.900
which in turn is built on top of physics,

00:03:44.986 --> 00:03:49.478
which in turn is built
on top of mathematics.

00:03:51.748 --> 00:03:53.674
And biology is one of our

00:03:53.674 --> 00:03:55.288
Frankly, even in the last hundred years,

00:03:55.288 --> 00:03:57.298
we're just starting to scratch the surface

00:03:57.298 --> 00:03:58.250
of understanding it.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.901
But what's really exciting

00:03:59.901 --> 00:04:02.384
is where the field of biology is going.

00:04:02.384 --> 00:04:04.422
As we understand things at a deeper level,

00:04:04.422 --> 00:04:05.796
at a molecular level,

00:04:05.796 --> 00:04:07.037
we're going to start thinking about

00:04:07.037 --> 00:04:09.365
how can we even do things
like engineer biology,

00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:10.860
or affect the world around us?

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.574
It's going to raise all sorts of

00:04:12.574 --> 00:04:15.486
fascinating and deep
and ethical questions.

00:04:15.486 --> 00:04:17.160
So, hopefully you enjoy this.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.236
Biology is one of the most, arguably,

00:04:19.236 --> 00:04:21.342
maybe the most fascinating subject of all.

00:04:21.342 --> 00:04:22.015
I don't want to offend

00:04:22.015 --> 00:04:23.474
the chemists and the physicists out there.

00:04:23.474 --> 00:04:25.430
I actually find those
quite fascinating as well.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.144
But we're going to answer, or
attempt to start to answer,

00:04:28.144 --> 00:04:32.243
some of the most fundamental
questions of our existence.
