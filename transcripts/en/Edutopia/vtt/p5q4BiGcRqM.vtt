00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:10.556
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What have we got today?

00:00:11.156 --> 00:00:13.136
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It's a big
day for these students

00:00:13.136 --> 00:00:15.476
at Rockledge Elementary
in Bowie, Maryland.

00:00:15.786 --> 00:00:18.556
It's the day they open
an envelope full

00:00:18.556 --> 00:00:22.196
of paper monarch butterflies
made by students in Mexico.

00:00:23.716 --> 00:00:28.326
&gt;&gt;Teacher: She lives in Mexico,
and she's given us her address,

00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:31.896
and how many think they could
write a note back to her,

00:00:32.056 --> 00:00:35.356
because wouldn't you like to know who
is going to get the ones you made?

00:00:35.696 --> 00:00:39.046
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The arrival of these
symbolic butterflies mirrors the

00:00:39.046 --> 00:00:42.456
annual migration of monarchs
from their winter home in Mexico

00:00:42.456 --> 00:00:44.516
to North America each spring.

00:00:44.936 --> 00:00:49.116
Following the migration is
just one part of Journey North,

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:53.956
a comprehensive set of project-based
learning activities delivered free

00:00:53.956 --> 00:00:56.346
to schools across the
country via the Internet.

00:00:56.346 --> 00:00:58.296
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, let
me bring the map up.

00:00:58.296 --> 00:01:01.386
What we're going to do is we're going
to follow the path of the monarchs.

00:01:01.656 --> 00:01:04.066
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Exploring
the interrelated aspects

00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:07.186
of seasonal change,
students follow the migration

00:01:07.186 --> 00:01:10.996
of several different animals and
add their personal observations

00:01:10.996 --> 00:01:13.306
to the global Journey North database.

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:16.236
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth: And I really appreciate
the incredible power of the Internet

00:01:16.236 --> 00:01:20.626
as a communication tool, because you
can be speaking to kids up in Alaska

00:01:20.626 --> 00:01:23.726
about the snowstorm that just hit
up there and the whales that are

00:01:23.726 --> 00:01:26.796
on their way, and even a
kindergartener seeing their first

00:01:26.796 --> 00:01:29.106
robin is of importance
to everybody else.

00:01:29.526 --> 00:01:31.676
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Another state
where the monarchs are going

00:01:31.676 --> 00:01:32.936
to be visiting; Kyle?

00:01:33.236 --> 00:01:34.076
&gt;&gt;Kyle: West Virginia?

00:01:34.376 --> 00:01:37.446
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Frances Koontz has
used Journey North in her classes

00:01:37.446 --> 00:01:41.656
for the past seven years to touch
on everything from science, math,

00:01:41.656 --> 00:01:44.496
and social studies to
ecology and English.

00:01:44.976 --> 00:01:46.946
For Koontz, Journey North works.

00:01:47.026 --> 00:01:50.156
&gt;&gt;Frances: Because it's authentic,
because we actually write letters,

00:01:50.156 --> 00:01:53.376
for instance, the children
take an ownership of that.

00:01:53.486 --> 00:01:55.206
Their writing is better.

00:01:55.296 --> 00:01:58.176
Because they know somebody really
is going to read that letter,

00:01:58.576 --> 00:02:02.306
they're much more careful
about their penmanship,

00:02:02.306 --> 00:02:04.306
about their grammar, about spelling.

00:02:04.646 --> 00:02:08.406
So I'm able to bring all of those
language-arts skills into an activity

00:02:08.406 --> 00:02:09.826
that is real and authentic.

00:02:10.496 --> 00:02:12.466
Social studies comes
in with the butterflies

00:02:12.576 --> 00:02:15.316
because Journey North
people are just wonderful

00:02:15.426 --> 00:02:18.976
about bringing us information
about the children in Mexico.

00:02:19.516 --> 00:02:24.566
&gt;&gt;Teacher: [Speaking Spanish]

00:02:25.066 --> 00:02:27.556
&gt;&gt;Child: The air temperature
is 63 degrees.

00:02:28.056 --> 00:02:30.726
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students get a
chance to act as scientists,

00:02:30.726 --> 00:02:34.046
making observations of natural
phenomena right outside their

00:02:34.046 --> 00:02:37.716
classroom door and sharing
their findings with their peers

00:02:37.716 --> 00:02:39.556
and scientists around the globe.

00:02:39.736 --> 00:02:43.256
&gt;&gt;Frances: The science is just
extremely rich, so really,

00:02:43.256 --> 00:02:47.616
almost every part of my curriculum
can be brought into Journey North,

00:02:47.616 --> 00:02:50.946
and Journey North can be
integrated in some way into it.

00:02:50.946 --> 00:02:56.316
And it meets the state's standards,
which is, of course, my benchmark.

00:02:56.316 --> 00:02:57.856
&gt;&gt;Go all the way down.

00:02:58.176 --> 00:03:01.346
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Another Journey North
activity is a geographical game

00:03:01.346 --> 00:03:02.956
called The Mystery Class.

00:03:03.396 --> 00:03:07.366
Teams of students compete to
identify a secret spot on the globe

00:03:07.646 --> 00:03:11.266
by deciphering scientific and
cultural clues to the locale.

00:03:11.266 --> 00:03:13.756
&gt;&gt;Girl: We were trying to guess
where our mystery class was.

00:03:13.756 --> 00:03:15.256
It could be anywhere in the world.

00:03:15.396 --> 00:03:19.156
Now we think it's Malaysia in Kuala
Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia.

00:03:19.156 --> 00:03:22.776
&gt;&gt;Boy: And the weird thing about
the photo period is each time,

00:03:22.776 --> 00:03:25.446
it increases one or two minutes.

00:03:25.446 --> 00:03:28.036
&gt;&gt;Girl: And that means
it's by the equator.

00:03:28.106 --> 00:03:31.296
&gt;&gt;Frances: Then I can step back,
now that they have this knowledge,

00:03:31.646 --> 00:03:36.956
and just let them interact with
each other and bring out a product.

00:03:37.056 --> 00:03:40.106
It's just wonderful to watch.

00:03:40.106 --> 00:03:43.086
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While Journey North
relies on sophisticated technology

00:03:43.146 --> 00:03:46.146
to deliver information,
there is no substitute

00:03:46.206 --> 00:03:49.766
for a first-hand experience
of nature's small miracles.

00:03:49.766 --> 00:03:50.566
&gt;&gt;Frances: What does that tell us?

00:03:50.806 --> 00:03:51.436
&gt;&gt;Monarchs are here.

00:03:51.436 --> 00:03:53.176
&gt;&gt;Frances: It might be a monarch.

00:03:53.776 --> 00:03:56.436
&gt;&gt;Frances: We were lucky enough to
have a patch of milkweed in the front

00:03:56.436 --> 00:04:01.926
of the school, and we found 57 eggs
and larvae and brought them in.

00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:04.646
We actually were able to watch one

00:04:04.646 --> 00:04:06.776
of the butterflies
emerge from its chrysalis.

00:04:06.776 --> 00:04:08.716
That's something they'll
never, never forget.

00:04:08.896 --> 00:04:12.666
