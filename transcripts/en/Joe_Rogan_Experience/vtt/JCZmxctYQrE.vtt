1
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.100
The Joe Rogan experience. Cause I,

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.540
I went from football to strong man and in football we'd never done dead lifts.

3
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.820
It was all hang cleans and power cleans. Which by the way,

4
00:00:09.821 --> 00:00:12.220
just quick little tip dead lifts the fear,

5
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.830
if you're dead lifting to be about a dead lift are fine.

6
00:00:14.831 --> 00:00:17.980
If you're not doing that for deadlifts sake, then don't fucking do it.

7
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.300
The risk to reward ratio is a joke for deadlift, for deadlifts.

8
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.590
And a lot of people aren't gonna like that. I'm saying that.

9
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.510
But if you go into any NFL gym in any division, one college football gym,

10
00:00:28.511 --> 00:00:32.560
in any athletics where people are actually getting paid and it matters what

11
00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:35.560
they're doing, they're not dead lifting their hand clean in a power cleaning.

12
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.140
Why is that? Because the, the risk reward ratio, like there's,

13
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.270
it's so hard to be a great dead lifter and to not rescue low back and, uh,

14
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.670
to be using your upper back properly and you know, just there's so many little,

15
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.200
uh, um, chances for you to get hurt, you know, hamstring stuff. That was,

16
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.650
that was me. Uh, my first world's strongest men.

17
00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.090
I was the only rookie in the finals, Perot, China. How much weight is that?

18
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.180
That was 880 pounds for me and my pink chucks.

19
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.030
And you're way less than that now. I'm less of a bowling ball though.

20
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.400
<v 1>Really? Wow. The, well, they made those waits.</v>

21
00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:15.690
Ridiculous looking too,

22
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.740
<v 0>right? Well, nothing. That right there is something we overhead press too,</v>

23
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.880
so they'll take some of the weights out of it and it's so flimsy when you clean

24
00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:24.090
it,

25
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.300
it's like basically like holding that earthquake bar that you have out there.

26
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.370
It's just like that and it's, it's fucking brutal. Disneyland

27
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.420
<v 1>on Instagram the other day,</v>

28
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.270
dudes are going out on Disneyland and this one guy punched a check to see people

29
00:01:38.271 --> 00:01:40.230
feminine to people were filming it in.

30
00:01:40.231 --> 00:01:43.160
These people were throwing down in front of their kids at Disneyland.

31
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.650
Terrible technique too. Everybody's terrible. Terrible. I love that. The

32
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.790
equally disappointing aspect of it. Oh, it's terrible.

33
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.040
It's the most disappointing. It's like guys, if you're kind of find,

34
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.650
it's just learn some technique. Yeah.

35
00:02:00.651 --> 00:02:03.620
I mean it's like someone's stealing the stage and playing a bad guitar.

36
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.050
You'd be angry when. Yeah, sure. Of course. See what I'm saying? Yeah, I get it.

37
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.720
No, I'm, I'm in complete agreement.

38
00:02:08.721 --> 00:02:12.290
I think that that is kind of equally important because, hey man,

39
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:15.440
if people are filming, yeah, people would like a consensual fight.

40
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.820
You look like you're trying to pretend you know how to fight. Yeah. And the,

41
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.200
the the worst is the pulling off of the shirt.

42
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.890
I don't even know how that even becomes like an indistinct.

43
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.380
It's actually a good move. Well it's to keep you slippery, right?

44
00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:28.540
So you can like, well you want, yeah.

45
00:02:28.541 --> 00:02:30.860
You don't want anybody choking you to death with your own jacket.

46
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.800
Oh that's true. Yeah, that's true. Oh, okay.

47
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.490
But I mean I guess in the videos that I've seen, it's been mostly about like,

48
00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:41.420
hey check, she's jacked. I am. And like, yeah, yeah.

49
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.070
I kinda looked like this dude got choked out but I couldn't quite tell what's

50
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.913
going on here.

51
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.440
Cause he went down quick cause that's security and he might even been off for a

52
00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:53.390
second. So he's pulling that girl's hair. See? Oh yeah, he's all cold. Cold.

53
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.750
Oh, you dropped him. His head banged off the ground to that ball.

54
00:02:56.751 --> 00:02:59.710
Dude choked the shit out. And he's like, well, I just killed that guy.

55
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.500
I better get out of here. But yeah. No one ever choked.

56
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:05.830
No charges were pressed because no one wanted to say what the fight was about.

57
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.850
Hilarious was that.

58
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.780
So it was a guy that was holding a girl's hair at the, he was gay. He got sick,

59
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.790
he got spit on and then he went crazy. Oh Wow.

60
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.580
I don't know if that was say a whole thing. Not Funny. That's all.

61
00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:22.860
It takes a little bit of water. A little bit of, yeah. It's funny. It's,

62
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.810
I got all the things that make people go crazy spit in someone's face.

63
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:30.430
It's like, wow, we were ready to go to war here. Yeah. I mean it's,

64
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.000
it is pretty quick not approved biological weapon back in the day.

65
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:35.970
If you had some like smallpox or some shit. Yeah.

66
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.200
Like how dare you potentially infect me.

67
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.750
There was this thing with vox where Carlos Mesa was a

68
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.880
<v 2>men minimizing, um, the,</v>

69
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.000
the impact of Antifa and kinda joking around about it.

70
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.400
And making it seem like it's just no big deal.

71
00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.180
And he got really upset because Steven Crowder was making fun of the fact that

72
00:03:56.181 --> 00:03:57.014
he's gay.

73
00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.830
And the fact that he talks with the list and that Crowder mentioned that along

74
00:04:00.831 --> 00:04:05.390
with mocking his stance on Antifa and then it became this gigantic thing that

75
00:04:05.391 --> 00:04:06.980
Steven Crowder's gay basher.

76
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.930
But what didn't become a big deal is that this guy is minimizing violent

77
00:04:11.931 --> 00:04:15.200
fascists. And that's what I mean. That's how I feel about this.

78
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.240
When you're trying to enforce your own ideology on other people and you have no

79
00:04:20.241 --> 00:04:23.540
tolerance for anybody with a differing opinion, particularly journalists,

80
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.010
that is fascism.

81
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.520
It's so ironic to call yourself an antifascist when you're literally enforcing

82
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.810
your own particular ideology to the point of violence and you're wearing masks

83
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.470
and you're running around hitting people and pretending that you're being

84
00:04:39.471 --> 00:04:43.910
inundated with Nazis and white supremacists and that this is all necessary.

85
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.230
Like that old man that was just driving and they're directing traffic and

86
00:04:48.231 --> 00:04:51.830
forcing him to abide, obey them, and then when he doesn't want to,

87
00:04:51.831 --> 00:04:55.670
they chase after him and assault him. It's fucking bananas.

88
00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.320
And the fact that this city has not stepped in and recognize that they have a

89
00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:04.820
real problem because this has got momentum behind it and the people that are

90
00:05:04.821 --> 00:05:09.290
involved that are nonviolent. You got to speak up. They've got to speak up.

91
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.340
If you're a person that really believes that there shouldn't be homophobia and

92
00:05:13.341 --> 00:05:16.010
there shouldn't be violence and there shouldn't be white supremacy,

93
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.450
good for you. You probably got involved in this for all the right reasons,

94
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.660
but if you don't recognize that someone like you yourself who is a person of a

95
00:05:26.391 --> 00:05:29.240
different ethnicity, you're not a white person. You're Vietnamese,

96
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.450
you're a gay man and you've got assaulted for no reason.

97
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.130
You didn't do anything that mean.

98
00:05:34.131 --> 00:05:38.270
It's almost like a test of where do your values truly lie.

99
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.560
And if you think it's okay for a person like you to just get assaulted for no

100
00:05:42.561 --> 00:05:46.460
reason, you are the problem. You're the problem.

101
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.620
You're mindset is the problem.

102
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.840
It's not whether or not there should be white supremacy.

103
00:05:50.841 --> 00:05:51.800
Of course there shouldn't be.

104
00:05:51.801 --> 00:05:56.180
It's not whether or not there shouldn't be people be able to freely express

105
00:05:56.181 --> 00:05:59.090
themselves. Of course should be. That is not what the issue is.

106
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.360
What the issue is is group mob mentality.

107
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.230
When you get people together and you let them wear masks and you tell them that

108
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:10.250
they're fighting against some evil and then they feel justified in hitting a

109
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:11.440
person like you, it,

110
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.650
it is really sickening and there's this diffusion of responsibility thing that

111
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:19.190
happens when one person hits you and everybody feels like it's okay to hit you.

112
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.960
It's a mob mentality thing and it's, it is extremely common with human beings.

113
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.630
I've, I've been in mob situations,

114
00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:29.090
it's terrifying because you feel it in the air.

115
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.460
You feel the chaos in the air when you're in some sort of a a large scale brawl

116
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:36.500
type situation like anything can happen.

117
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.930
People just run up on people and start punching them.

118
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.070
It's not like two people alone in a, in a,

119
00:06:42.071 --> 00:06:46.220
in the like an open area where they can talk and work things out. No,

120
00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:49.640
it's chaos and there's some weird animal activity.

121
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.380
There's some weird weird animal instinct aspect to it that is very unique to

122
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:58.970
humans and when you see something like this and see a guy like you just getting

123
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.020
peppered with milkshakes and punched in the head and it's fucking disturbing.

124
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:08.150
And for these people to dismiss that and not stand out, not stand up and say,

125
00:07:08.151 --> 00:07:10.610
hey, this is not what we're supposed to be about.

126
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.700
This is not what I signed up for. They become a part of the problem.

127
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.360
I'm sure there's people listening to this that are upset at this because maybe

128
00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:20.900
you, you, you've support Antifa you support their ideology.

129
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.940
Think about what you actually support.

130
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.490
Think about what this is really all about.

131
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.760
What you shouldn't be supporting is people wearing masks,

132
00:07:28.761 --> 00:07:32.000
running around fucking hitting people. You ain't changing shit with that.

133
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.540
All you're going to do is call for more people with masks from the other side.

134
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:39.800
If people feel like right wing people are being attacked and I don't think

135
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.530
you're even right wing, are you? I mean, what are, what will you, what would,

136
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:48.440
if you had a gun to your head or a mace to your face, what would you just say?

137
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.850
You're a centrist, what would you say?

138
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.420
I think it's fair to describe me as center. Right. Center. Right. Okay.

139
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.540
Which is fine. It should be okay. I mean, there should be,

140
00:07:56.541 --> 00:08:01.541
we should be allowed to have disagreements of ideologies and of political

141
00:08:02.661 --> 00:08:07.160
persuasions, political leanings. But this is,

142
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.780
it's twisted and it's twisted. The way it's being depicted in the media.

143
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:15.530
It's very strange how it's being dismissed. It's very strange.

144
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:20.300
And that there's really people in 2019 debating whether or not it's okay to

145
00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:23.810
assault journalists. Jorge Mossville, Mazda Dao,

146
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.460
where he said after the fight,

147
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.370
but he said he would smack him if he saw him at whole foods. I think,

148
00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:32.960
I think it's just a little too much. You want, I, I,

149
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.520
I don't know their history. The history is rough. [inaudible] excuse me.

150
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:43.040
It's like 10 years of them. Uh, given him a hard time of if I'm, uh,

151
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:47.480
Ben asking, given miles, but all corn to Mazda doll, a lot of talking shit,

152
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:51.440
which some people think is friendly in Moundsville Wall Street.

153
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.260
Jesus doesn't fuck around. All right. You want to talk shit.

154
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.460
You want to shit to street Jesus.

155
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.680
He will fucking make fun of you after he flat lines here.

156
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.160
And that's what he did. He flat lined him in five seconds,

157
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.820
made him the fastest ever Kao in UFC history and then mocked him afterwards and

158
00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:07.630
said he would smack him if he saw him at whole foods.

159
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:12.690
But see we're talking about it. So Mazda is smart. This is a,

160
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.770
this is an amazing marketing ploy. I mean he's,

161
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.450
he's become in one fight the most talked about fighter in the sport

162
00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.970
<v 1>because he did something in the sport that's been around for a little bit that</v>

163
00:09:24.971 --> 00:09:26.500
nobody's ever done before. Yeah.

164
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.943
<v 2>He was undefeated,</v>

165
00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:33.060
undefeated and Mazda doll comes out flat lines like that and talk some pretty

166
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.320
<v 1>vicious shit after the fact and even mimicked him laying on the floor,</v>

167
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.720
which looks scary the way he was out.

168
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:44.750
<v 2>[inaudible] yeah. Mazda doll will say, Ahhh, calls out easy.</v>

169
00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:49.310
Conor McGregor. I want to break his face. Yeah, that would be,

170
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.820
that's a rough fight. That's a rough fight for Connor mas.

171
00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:54.980
Woodall was a big fellow too. I mean he's,

172
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.920
he really belongs at one 70 that's where he's fighting.

173
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.900
He fought at one 55 but really tortured himself to make that weight. Right.

174
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.983
He's a big guy.

175
00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.910
You're talking about a guy who knocked out cowboys Serone knocked out Darren

176
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.960
till knocked out Ben Asprin.

177
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:14.210
I mean he's knocking out big welterweights big Darren till's a big welterweight.

178
00:10:16.701 --> 00:10:20.990
He's big. He's not a guy coming up from 155 pounds.

179
00:10:20.991 --> 00:10:25.120
He's never making 150 copies. Weight 55 one 55 sorry. Yeah,

180
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:30.130
so he's one way class heavier and he's really running into like the last few

181
00:10:31.101 --> 00:10:34.610
fights. He's coming into his own. He's like really becoming something special.

182
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:38.660
He had a real close, uh, decision loss to Wonderboy.

183
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.320
Wish I could remember how that fight went down,

184
00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.480
but I just think it was a decision.

185
00:10:44.481 --> 00:10:46.910
I don't know if it was a split decision or unanimous decision,

186
00:10:46.911 --> 00:10:49.160
but I think it was just Wonderboy out pointed them.

187
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.460
I don't think there was any knockdowns right? No smiles with, oh yeah,

188
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.383
that was monster doll.

189
00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:58.390
But Wonderboy is a particularly difficult guy to fight and especially for three

190
00:10:58.911 --> 00:10:59.744
rounds.

191
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.110
<v 1>And I went to Bali right after,</v>

192
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
cause I have some flown island friends and I stay out there for a week.

193
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.380
That's an amazing place. That's a place I want to go to. Flies, Bali luck.

194
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.230
Cause I almost went there last summer we decided to go to Thailand instead.

195
00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.630
But have you served before? No. It's a, it's scared.

196
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:16.300
It's a great place for surfing. You're not scared of sharks? No.

197
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:21.210
Oh No. Shark yesterday. No. Don't do this to Jamie.

198
00:11:21.211 --> 00:11:25.860
25 to 30 feet long. 5,000 pounds. Wow. What? Yeah,

199
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.990
like jaws is real straight. Tell us is real the biggest shark ever, right?

200
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:35.100
It's gotta be what did, when did this get soft? Someone said it to me yesterday,

201
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:36.580
I remember watching on my phone.

202
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.280
And you just like set it and it popped right in my head.

203
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:39.810
What's the biggest shark ever?

204
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.600
It's like the Shaq of human beings for the sharpish.

205
00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.770
Put exaggerating those numbers, but that's what it says here. Here's the tweet.

206
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:51.420
What is this from Twitter? Twitter. Martha's vineyard shows does exist.

207
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.720
Watch how big fucking thing is. Okay, here go.

208
00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:01.480
There's the tail right here. Martha's vineyard. Isn't that split? It was, yeah.

209
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:06.130
Oh my God. Dude, it's so big. Oh my God. Wow.

210
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.930
Oh my God. Oh my God.

211
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:16.360
That is so big. Do you not just fuck with people who are that big? It's hard.

212
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:21.120
Perspective wise, does numbers could be slightly exaggerate. Listen that,

213
00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.180
that 25 to 30 feet, 5,000 pounds. How do you know who's saying this?

214
00:12:25.181 --> 00:12:29.740
Who's posting this? Uh, what is this Gregory Long. Oh, does he do, I don't know.

215
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:31.990
I'll look up. And what do you do, Gregory? What is this?

216
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.950
What is his actual credentials at that? He's doesn't seem to be a sharp guy,

217
00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:40.390
but it's his Wednesday wisdom. How's that wisdom? Ah, Greg,

218
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:44.140
what are you talking about, Greg? The drunk guy. Great. You drop it.

219
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:49.270
Find out though. Greg's drunk at work. That might've just been 15 feet.

220
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:52.420
It might be a regular grape. Either way. It's fucking giant.

221
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.530
Might not have been really 21 in Hawaii that they monitor. Right.

222
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:59.350
They have a chip and it's called like deep blue or big blue or something like

223
00:12:59.351 --> 00:13:02.050
that. Something like that. Yeah. And that's the biggest one that know of.

224
00:13:02.051 --> 00:13:06.450
Correct. Yeah, but I thought that was significantly smaller. Like 20 feet. Yeah.

225
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:10.270
This is on a bunch of websites. Ran this story. Oh, okay.

226
00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:13.480
What Twitter user. Gregory Long posted a video.

227
00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.630
But there's no perspective though. It's,

228
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:19.210
there's not a boat that you can look at. We can say, oh, this is a 15 foot boat.

229
00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:22.480
Look at it's 10 feet longer than the boat. Yeah. Come on Greg.

230
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:24.790
Stop being drunk at work.

231
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.760
Either way. Fuck sharks, man.

232
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:38.600
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>
