00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Over the course of this class and in the forums,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
a number of you have asked me about research

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
or what I do to nominally push forth the boundaries of human knowledge

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and make the world a better place.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And now I'd like to give you the chance, the opportunity,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to participate in just such a project.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Oh, fellow travelers on this voyage of discovery,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I stand before you, hat in hand--well, metaphorically, at any rate--

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
asking for your help, for your participation.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Let me set the stage for you.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Imagine that you have a job as a computer scientist

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and you have a program that you'd like to work on.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It could be some Excel macros to make a better spreadsheet.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It could be a game you've always wanted.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It could be an assignment from your superior.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Probably you will think hard about the problem--

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that's what we hope everyone does--find examples online, write your code,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
debug it, and then, typically later, you may have to make some changes.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
All of these stages--except perhaps thinking about the problem--involve reading code.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It turns out that in industrial practice, more time is spent reading code

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
than on any other activity, especially writing it.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
By some estimates, up to 70% of time is spent just reading existing code.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And as a result, the readability of code has a huge impact on productivity.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Readable code doesn't just look good; it has an economic impact.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
That makes it unfortunate that we really do not understand code readability at all.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
We have some intuitions for natural language readability--

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
when something is at the 3rd grade level versus the 7th grade level--

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
but we'd really like to understand code readability more.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I think that one way to do that is to ask people like you, ask people in the real world,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
"What do you think? Is this code readable or not?"

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and from that build a formal mechanical model that we can use

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
to evaluate existing pieces of code and make representations.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The largest existing study on code readability--more than 70%

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
of the work of industrial software development--involves only 100 participants.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I think that we, free online education, can do better,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and I'm going to need your help.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The survey we'd like you to participate in consists of a number of examples

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
of snippets of code from real-world programs.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The survey is completely voluntary and anonymous.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
We're not going to store any identifying information.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Instead, we'll present you with a number of snippets of real-world programs

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
written in either Python, Java, or CUDA.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
You're already familiar with Python, but you may be less familiar with Java or CUDA,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
a language for programming graphics cards.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
You don't need to be an expert. You don't need to be familiar with those languages.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
In fact, you don't even need to have heard of those languages.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
We're very interested in gathering your intuitive notions of software readability.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So we'll show you a number of pieces of code,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and after looking over each snippet, you'll rate it on a scale of 1 to 5,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
where 1 indicates less readable and 5 indicates more readable.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
The exact notion of readability we are leaving up to you.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
For example, perhaps you'll see a snippet like this and decide that it's a little less readable.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Perhaps you'll see a snippet like this and decide that it's a little more readable.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
We're really interested in what you think about this subject.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So the survey takes about 15 to 30 minutes,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and it's totally anonymous and confidential.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
We're not going to store any important information

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
that would help us trace these numbers back to you.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
It's not related to this Udacity class in any way.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
In fact, it's not worth extra credit. It doesn't influence your grade.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
It's solely to try to make the world a better place by increasing human knowledge,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
by helping us to understand when code is readable and when code isn't--

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
a really important part of software development.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I realize that many of you are quite busy; you've got other things to do.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Not a problem at all.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
But if you are interested, if you're not busy, if you have a few moments to spare,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
I would really personally appreciate it if you would take them and help us out.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Even if you're not particularly comfortable or an expert with these languages,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
you're just as necessary.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Those data points are critical.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
So if this isn't worth extra credit, why should you participate?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
A number of people on the forums have suggested that,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
based on my reasonable radio announcer voice, I should consider singing a bit more.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
These people are clearly doing their best to flatter me,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
because my singing is not all that and a bag of chips.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
But the graduate student who is leading this project,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
who is helping me out, is a pretty good singer.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
So what we have agreed to do or what I would be happy to do

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
is if we're able to get the required number of participants--

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
if 1000 people help us out--we will happily sing the song of your choice.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
We have no shame if it will help us push forth the boundaries of human knowledge.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
So if you like Irish music, [singing voice] "Oh, it is the biggest mix-up

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
"that you have ever seen. Holy mo, me father loves Nikita Kruschev. Holy moly me."

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
If you like Bollywood musicals, [singing voice] "Pretty woman, dekho dekho na."

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
If you like it un Francais, [singing in French].

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
If you prefer it in Spanish, [singing in Spanish].

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
If you like Japanese, [singing in Japanese].

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Or if you just like more English or American folk music,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
[singing voice] "Lemon tree, very pretty."

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
We'll do anything you want.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Whether it be the theme to The Muppet Show

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
or whether you'd like to hear me butcher romantic Mandarin songs,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
[singing in Mandarin], we will do it.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Start a thread in the forum and vote for your favorite.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Participate in the survey, and I will happily do almost anything

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
in order to make the world a better place with future research.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Please participate if you do have a few minutes,

00:06:04.000 --> 09:59:59.000
but it is by no means required. Thank you.
