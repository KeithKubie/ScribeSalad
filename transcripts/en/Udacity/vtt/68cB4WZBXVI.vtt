What we know from unit 1 that the circumference of a circle is 2&lt;i&gt;π&lt;i&gt;r.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
If the radius is 1, well that's just 2&lt;i&gt;π--so that's 6.28, but let's not think of that.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Let's think of this as 2&lt;i&gt;π.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now, if the units of this circumference of the radius were meters for example.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And now I was a little man walking along this circle--that means I would have to walk

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
2π m to get back to where I start.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
In fact, this is how we define the radian.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This angle which previously we may have called 360°--we now call 2π radians.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
If this is all you remember about radians, you can do everything else.

00:00:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I'm not saying this is all you should remember but this is enough.
