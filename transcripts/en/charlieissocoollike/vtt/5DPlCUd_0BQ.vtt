00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.720
MURMURING

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.620
Hello.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.300
Welcome back to
the white void. 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.880
So, again, I am not here
to entertain you today. 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.540
I am here because I am feeling really
great right now about myself 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.740
and my life and my plans and
I want to talk to you about it. 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.090
So the thing about people is that
eventually they grow up,

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.440
and at least what I found is that
if you like someone the way that they are, 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.920
watching them go through that change
can be a bit weird and uncomfortable, 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.740
but at the same time,
it's inevitable. 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.020
People do change, and I think if
you try and ignore that fact,

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.150
then you're going to find
yourself pretty unhappy, 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.000
which I think is basically what
ended up happening to me. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.260
I am not that cute little British boy making
YouTube videos in his bedroom anymore. 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.880
I have a mortgage.
I pay taxes. 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.730
I have an accountant.
I go to work in an office. 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.620
I have a full time job. I mean this,
it's a bit of weird one, but it's still that.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.730
You know, I wouldn't consider myself an
adult really, but I'm clearly not a kid either.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.220
And honestly, now that I can
finally admit that to myself, 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.840
I feel like this massive weight
has been lifted off my chest. 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.280
Like last year for me I think was
sort of an exercise in me 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.730
trying to mimic my younger self because
that's what I thought people wanted to see,

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.050
but it's not what I want to do because
that's not the person that I am anymore. 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.220
The time has finally come,
I think, for me to make stuff 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.610
that really reflects how
I feel I've change, 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.730
and I've been trying to make that transition
a bit already sort of in small ways,

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.000
but to really push myself,
I've come up with this slightly mad plan

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.520
to take me through
the rest of the year, 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.000
one that I am both very excited and
more than a little bit nervous about. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.590
You may remember once
upon a time I said I was 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.240
working on a screenplay
for a short film, 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.240
which, no, I still haven't finished,
but narrative filmmaking is still something 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.790
I really want to have a
proper go at. 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.910
It's the thing I get most excited about when
I'm working on anything at the moment, 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.900
and so what I'm going to do is
instead of making a short film, 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.740
I am going to make five of them,
one every two months

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.390
for the rest of the year,
starting in April. 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.700
To go with those, I also want to make a
behind the scenes video for each of the shorts 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.590
and, you know, I want to continue to
make whatever I want to make as well. 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.310
Your regular
YouTube content,

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.840
what you've come to expect
from me on this channel, 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.090
that is not going to stop.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.070
Although, it may be a bit more
mature or more immature. 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.030
I haven't really
decided yet,

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.060
but basically, you will see something
from me every one or two weeks.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.870
And that is a commitment I have
made publicly, so that's good. 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.730
My goal with all of this, ultimately,
is just to connect with you 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.270
in the best way that I possibly can
by doing and making the things 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.240
that make me happy and
sharing them with you.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.050
You know, I want to
challenge your expectations 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.460
of what it is that you
expect from me,

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.210
and I mean really what I want
to do is stop talking about it 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.750
and show you that I'm serious
about this by just doing it. 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.870
But just before I go, I do want to say
thank you so much for sticking with me

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.800
through this "I'm Scared"
phase of mine. 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.840
It really, really does
mean a lot,

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.070
and I guess I just want to ask you to get
excited to see something new from me 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.590
because I'm really excited to
make something new for you. 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.090
Ugh...
It's going to be great. 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.420
My body is ready
for the short films.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.840
Good.
And on that note, goodbye. 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.150
STEPHEN FRY VOICE: You've just had the almost
imponderable joy of watching charlieissocoollike,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.940
which makes you, like, cool.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.330
 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.440
CHARLIE: I'm very excited to be
filming this video, 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.740
and it's over now,
but I don't want to stop.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.060
So, ugh...
Ughh! Doo!

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.740
I haven't felt like
this in a while. 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.880
This is good. 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.750
I should really
stop this. 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.233
Okay, goodbye.
