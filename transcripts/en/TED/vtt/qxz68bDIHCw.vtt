00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.960
You know me.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.536
I am in your friendship circle
hidden in plain sight.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.216
My clothes are still impeccable --

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.320
bought in the good years
when I was still making money.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.776
To look at me you would not know

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.896
that my electricity was cut off
last week for nonpayment,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.416
or that I meet the eligibility
requirements for food stamps.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.696
But if you paid attention,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.936
you would see that sadness in my eyes --

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.640
hear that hint of fear
in my otherwise self-assured voice.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.456
These days I'm buying
the $1.99 trial-size jug of Tide

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.696
to make ends meet.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.000
I bet you didn't know
laundry detergent came in that size.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.176
You invite me to the same
expensive restaurants

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.336
the two of us have always enjoyed,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.816
but I order mineral water now
with a twist of lemon,

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.840
not the 12-dollar glass of chardonnay.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.056
I am frugal in my menu choices.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.776
Meticulous, I count
every penny in my head.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.336
I demur dividing the table bill evenly
to cover desserts and designer coffees

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.360
and second and third glasses
of wine I did not consume.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.720
I am tired of trying to fake appearances.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.376
A friend told me that I'm broke not poor,
and there is a difference.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.736
I live without cable, my gym membership

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.016
and nail appointments.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.880
I've discovered I can do my own hair.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.176
There is no retirement savings,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.480
no nest egg.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.096
I exhausted that long ago.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.416
There is no expensive condo to draw equity

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.240
and no husband to back me up.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.960
Months of slow pay and no pay
have decimated my credit.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.456
Bill collectors call constantly,

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.856
reading verbatim from a script

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.016
before expressing
polite sympathy for my plight

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.680
and then demanding payment
arrangements I can't possibly meet.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.536
Friends wonder privately
how someone so well educated

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.840
could be in economic free fall.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.136
I'm still as talented as ever
and smart as a whip,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.496
but work is sketchy now,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.736
mostly on and off consulting gigs.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.240
At 55 I've learned how to fake cheeriness,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.440
but there are not many
opportunities for work anymore.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.936
I don't remember exactly when it stopped,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.376
but I cannot deny now having entered

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.680
the uncertain world
of formerly and used to be.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.440
I'm not sure anymore where I belong.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.736
What I do know is that dozens
of online job applications

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.640
seem to just disappear into a black hole.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.856
I'm wondering what is to become of me.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.656
So far my health has held up,

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.920
but my body aches -- or is it my spirit?

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.816
Homeless women used to be invisible to me

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.776
but I appraise them now with curious eyes,

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.600
wondering if their stories
started like mine.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.016
I wrote this piece a year ago.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.656
It's a composite of my story
and other women I know.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.336
I wrote it because
I was tired of pretending

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.496
I was all right when I wasn't.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.120
I was tired of faking normal.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.096
I wasn't seeing myself
in the popular press.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.880
Nobody I knew was traveling the world
or buying a condo in Costa Rica.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.016
Very few of my friends
had set aside the 15 to 20 percent

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.200
experts tell us we need to maintain
our standard of living in retirement.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.216
My friends, many in their 50s and 60s,

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.496
were looking at a downward mobility,

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.296
a work-for-life proposition,

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.280
just a job loss, medical diagnosis
or divorce away from insolvency.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.776
We may not have hit rock bottom,

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.376
but many of us saw a sequence of events

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.320
where rock bottom
was possible for the first time.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.296
And the truth is,
it really doesn't take much.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.496
The median household in the US

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.056
only has enough savings
to replace one month of income.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.656
Forty-seven percent of us

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.055
cannot pull together 400 dollars
to deal with an emergency.

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:31.935
That's almost half of us.

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:36.000
A major car repair
and we're standing on the abyss.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.896
You wouldn't know it to look around you --

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.176
I'm not the only one in this situation.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.016
There are people in this room
who are in the same predicament,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.256
and if it's not you,

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.120
it is your parents or your sister
or maybe your best friend.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.120
We get good at faking normal.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.136
Shame keeps us silent and siloed.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.216
When I first decided I was going
to come out with my story,

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.456
I did a website

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.376
and a friend noticed
that there were no photos of me --

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.240
it was all kind of cartoons like this.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.136
Even as I was coming out,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.200
I was still hiding.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.280
We live in a world
where success is defined by income.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.616
When you say that you have money problems,

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.936
you're announcing
pretty much that you're a loser.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.096
When you're a graduate
of Harvard Business School as I am,

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.920
you're some kind of double loser.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.936
We boomers hear a lot about
how we have underfunded our retirement;

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.776
how it's all our fault.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.856
Why on earth would we draw down
our 401(k) plan to cover the shortfall

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.416
on our mother-in-law's nursing home care,

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.536
or to pay for our kid's tuition,
or just to survive?

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.736
We're accused of being
poor planners and deadbeats --

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.416
all that money we spent
on lattes and bottled water.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.120
To shame and blame
is so deliciously tempting.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.176
Many of us don't even wait
for others to do it

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.176
we're so busy doing it to ourselves.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.256
I say let's own our part:

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.416
we all could have saved more.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.576
I know I could have saved more,

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:27.776
and if you were to rifle through
my life over the last 30 years,

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.040
you would see more than one
dumb thing I have done financially.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.016
I can't change that now

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.936
and neither can you,

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.336
but let's not mix up
individual, isolated behavior

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.256
with the systemic factors

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:49.176
that have caused a 7.7-trillion-dollar
retirement income gap.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.496
Millions of boomer-age Americans
did not land here

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.400
because of too many trips to Starbucks.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.656
We spent the last three decades
dealing with flat and falling wages

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.336
and disappearing pensions

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.936
and through-the-roof cost

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.880
on housing and health care and education.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.816
It used to not be like this.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.336
We all remember the three-legged
retirement income stool

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:21.296
which had the savings
and pension and social security.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.576
Well, that stool has gone wobbly.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.256
Take savings -- what savings?

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.736
For many families,

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.400
there's just nothing left to save
after the bills have been paid.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.976
The pension leg of the stool
has also gone wobbly.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.936
We can remember
when many people had pensions.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:43.120
Today only 13 percent of American workers
are employed by companies that offer them.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.936
So what did we get instead?

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.736
We got 401(k)-type plans

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.696
and suddenly responsibility
for retirement planning got shifted

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.760
from our companies to us.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.856
We got the reigns
but we also got the risk,

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.856
and it turns out that millions of us
just aren't that good

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.776
at voluntarily investing over 40 years.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.976
Millions of us just aren't that good
at managing market risk.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.416
And really the numbers tell the story.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:19.016
Half of all American households
have no retirement savings at all.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.256
That would be zero.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.960
No 401(k), no IRA, not a dime.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:28.416
Among 55-to-64-year-olds
who do have a retirement account,

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:33.816
the median value of that account
is 104,000 dollars.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.136
Now, 104,000 dollars
does sound better than zero,

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.976
but as an annuity,
it generates about 300 dollars.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.256
I don't have to tell you
that you can't live on that.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.736
With savings down,

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.616
pensions becoming a relic of the past

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.616
and 401(k) plans
failing millions of Americans,

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.176
many near-retirees
are dependent on social security

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.240
as their retirement plan.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.096
But here's the problem.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.616
Social security was never supposed
to be the retirement plan.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.896
It's not nearly enough.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.856
At best it replaces
something like 40 percent

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.840
of your pre-retirement income.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.096
Things have changed a lot

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.936
from when social security
was introduced back in 1935.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.176
Then, a 21-year-old male
had a 50 percent chance

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.560
of living until he was 65.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.136
So he retired at 60,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.736
did a little fishing,
kissed his grandkids,

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.416
got his gold watch --

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.960
he'd be dead within five years
of receiving benefits.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.776
That's not the pattern today.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.176
If you're in your late
50s and in good health,

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.616
you're going to live easily
another 20 or 25 years.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.256
That's a really long time
to make ends meet

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.520
if you are broke.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.376
So what's the play if you've landed here

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.240
and you're 50 or 55 or 60?

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.976
What's the play
if you don't want to land here

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.136
and you're 22 or 32?

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.520
Here's what I've learned
from my own experience.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.200
The cavalry's not coming.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.816
There is no big rescue,

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.216
no prince charming,

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.056
no big bailout in the works.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:24.336
To have a shot at something other
than being old and poor in America,

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.160
we're going to have to save
ourselves and each other.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.080
I've had to come out of the shadows,

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.936
stand here openly,

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.936
and I'm inviting you to do so as well.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.216
I'm not going to tell you
that it's not easy.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.056
I ventured though to tell my story

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:51.696
because I thought it would make it
a little easier for people to tell theirs.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.896
I think it's only through
our strength in numbers

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.576
that we can begin to change
the national "la-la" conversation

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.880
that we are having
on this retirement crisis.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:08.536
With so many of us shell-shocked
and adrift about what has happened to us,

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.696
we're going to have to build up
from the grassroots,

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.656
forming what I think
are resilience circles.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.896
These are small groups
of people coming together

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.096
to talk about what has happened to them,

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.536
to share resources and information

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.160
and to begin to figure out a way forward.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.936
I believe from this base
that we can find our voices again

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.536
and sound the alarm --

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.016
start pushing our institutions
and policymakers

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:43.120
to go hard on this retirement crisis
with the urgency it deserves.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.416
In the meantime --

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.536
and there is an "in the meantime" --

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:52.416
we're going to have to adopt
a live-low-to-the-ground mindset,

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.696
drastically cutting back on our expenses.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.456
And I don't mean
just living within our means.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.800
A lot of people are already doing that.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.096
What is called for now is to,

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.416
in a much deeper way,

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.736
ask ourselves what it really means

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.896
to live a life
that is not defined by things.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.640
I call it "smalling up."

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.176
Smalling up is figuring out
what you really need

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.576
to feel contented and grounded.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.616
I have a friend who drives
really beat-up, raggedy cars,

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:36.296
but he will scrimp and save
15,000 dollars at one point

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.536
to buy a flute

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.800
because music is
what really matters to him.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.240
He smalled up.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.736
I've had to also let go
of magical thinking --

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.736
this idea that if I just
was patient enough

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.016
and tightened my belt

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.416
that things would go back to normal.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.576
If I just sent in one more CV

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.816
or applied to one more job online

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.656
or attended one more networking event

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.720
that surely I'd get the kind of job
I was used to having.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.040
Surely things would return to normal.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.496
The truth is I'm not going back
and neither are you.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.680
The normal that we knew is over.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.696
In this new place that we are,

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.136
we're going to be asked to do things
that we don't want to do.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.056
We're going to be asked
to take assignments

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.936
that we think are beneath
our station and our talent

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.376
and our skill.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.680
I have had to get off my throne.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.096
Last year, a good friend of mine
asked me if I would help her

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.616
with some organization work.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.456
I assumed she meant community organizing

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.576
along the lines of what
President Obama did in Chicago.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.576
She meant organizing somebody's closet.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.016
I said, "I'm not doing that."

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.000
She said, "Get off your throne.
Money is green."

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.896
It's not easy being part
of the advance team

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:06.136
that is ushering in this new era
of work and living.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.096
First is always hardest.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.376
First is before there are networks

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.776
and pathways and role models ...

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:20.536
before there are policies
and ways to show us

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.000
how to go forward.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.176
We're in the middle of a seismic shift,

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.480
and we're going to have to find
bridgework to get us through.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.696
Bridgework is what we do in the meantime;

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.256
bridgework is what we do

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.840
while we're trying
to figure out what is next.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.056
Bridgework is also
letting go of this notion

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:45.656
that our worth and our value
depend on our income

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.680
and our titles and our jobs.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.136
Bridgework can look crazy or cool
depending on how you were rolling

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.416
when your personal financial crisis hit.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.256
I have friends with PhDs
who are working at the Container Store

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.376
or driving Uber or Lyft,

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.256
and then I have other friends
who are partnering with other boomers

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.880
and doing really cool
entrepreneurial ventures.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.960
Bridgework doesn't mean that we don't want

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.256
to build on our past careers,

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.000
that we don't want meaningful work.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.656
We do.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:24.136
Bridgework is what we do in the meantime

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.480
while we're figuring out what is next.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.696
I've also learned to think
strategy not failure

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:36.720
when I'm sort of processing
all these things that I don't want to do.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.456
And I say that that's an approach

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.256
that I would invite you
to consider as well.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:46.616
So if you need to move in
with your brother to make ends meet,

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.976
call him.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.496
If you need to take in a boarder
to help you pay your mortgage

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.016
or pay your rent,

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.256
do it.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.616
If you need to get food stamps,

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.576
get the darn food stamps.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:06.440
AARP says only a third of older adults
who are eligible actually get them.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.720
Do what you need to do
to go another round.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.136
Know that there are millions of us.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.456
Come out of the shadows.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.696
Cut back,

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.056
small up;

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.480
think strategy, not failure;

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.136
get off your throne

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:29.800
and find the bridgework
to get your through the lean times.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.296
As a country, we have achieved longevity,

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:39.536
investing billions of dollars
in the diagnosis, treatment

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.320
and management of disease.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:46.136
It's not enough to just live a long time.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.160
We want to live well.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:54.256
We haven't invested nearly as much
in the physical infrastructure

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.240
to ensure that that happens.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.576
We need now a new way of thinking

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.800
about what it means to be old in America.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:09.976
And we need guidance
and ideas about how to live

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.176
a richly textured life

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.240
on a much more modest income.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.336
So I am calling on change agents

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:20.415
and social entrepreneurs,

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.296
artists and elders

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:23.816
and impact investors.

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:28.480
I'm calling on developers
and disrupters of the status quo.

00:17:29.079 --> 00:17:31.599
We need you to help us imagine

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:39.215
how to invest in the services
and products and infrastructure

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.736
that will support our dignity,

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.936
our independence and our well-being

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.120
in these many, many decades
that we're going to live.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:53.456
My journey has taken me
from a place of fear and shame

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.736
to one of humility and understanding.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.896
I'm ready now to link shields with others,

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.496
to fight this fight,

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.656
and I'm inviting you to join me.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.056
Thank you.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:11.120
(Applause)
