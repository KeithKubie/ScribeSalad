00:00:00.444 --> 00:00:01.860
Let's think a
little bit about how

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.730
we can tell whether our body
is processing glucose properly,

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.797
and whether maybe
we have diabetes.

00:00:09.797 --> 00:00:11.380
And I want you all
to take all of this

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.420
with a huge grain of salt,
because I am not a doctor.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.110
This is not medical advice.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.840
My goal here is to kind of just
explore the subject with you,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.160
and to try for all
of us to get a better

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.450
understanding of things.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.820
So let's think about what might
happen after we have a meal.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.130
So let me draw a
little chart over here.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.170
So let's call this hours.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.960
And then on the
vertical axis, I'm

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.260
going to talk about our
concentration of sugar

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.110
in the blood.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.710
So blood sugar concentration.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.680
You could call it
glucose concentration.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.090
Blood sugar concentration.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.090
When we're talking
about blood sugar,

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.271
we're talking about glucose.

00:00:55.271 --> 00:00:58.220
And let me draw a couple
of points on this chart.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.680
So maybe this is 50.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.220
And our units are going to
be milligrams per deciliter.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.100
Actually, let me
just do it this way.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.560
Let me just say that everything
is in milligrams per deciliter.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.140
And we'll talk in
future videos about how

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.040
we can relate these
units to everyday terms.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.900
But let's say that
this right here is 50.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.020
This right here is 100.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.070
This right here is 150.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.382
And let's mark it
right here at 200.

00:01:32.382 --> 00:01:34.840
So let's think about what would
happen for a normal person.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.500
Let me mark some
hours over here.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:46.640
So hour 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.320
That's probably good enough.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.860
So in a normal person, when
they haven't eaten anything

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.810
for a long time, let's
say greater than 8 hours--

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.310
so their fasting
blood sugar will

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.520
be right around 80
milligrams per deciliter,

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.216
give or take a little bit.

00:02:01.216 --> 00:02:02.840
There's a range around
that, but I just

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.090
want to show you what would
happen to a normal person.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.690
So at 80 milligrams
per deciliter,

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.789
their blood sugar
will kind of be--

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.240
should, hopefully, be
right around there.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.262
And sometimes this
fasting blood sugar--

00:02:14.262 --> 00:02:16.470
and maybe we're assuming
that this is in the morning.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.540
So maybe this hour one
is 7:00 in the morning.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.956
So they haven't
eaten for a while,

00:02:19.956 --> 00:02:21.890
and that's why it's
fasting blood sugar.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.531
This is also-- you'll
sometimes hear doctors,

00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:27.530
I've heard my wife say
this word without knowing

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.280
what it meant-- they'll
sometimes say preprandial,

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.140
which is a very fancy word
which just means before a meal,

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.840
prandial is literally
before eating.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.240
After the meal, you're
talking postprandial.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.750
So it's a very fancy word for
a very simple idea, eating.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.420
So let's say at hour two, this
individual eats breakfast.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.070
So this is where the individual
is going to eat breakfast.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.430
Now in a normal person, when
that person eats breakfast,

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.530
there'll be some carbohydrates
in that breakfast,

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.750
and it will be broken
down into glucose,

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.170
and that glucose will
enter the bloodstream.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.580
And so their blood
glucose will go up.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:15.489
It'll slowly go up.

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:16.780
And I was reading some studies.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.919
They say it kind of spikes at
about 45 minutes into a meal.

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:21.460
So let's see.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.340
45 minutes is over there.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.650
So maybe it'll go
up to about there.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.600
And in a normal individual,
the blood glucose really

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.206
shouldn't go up above 120
milligrams per deciliter.

00:03:32.206 --> 00:03:34.590
And there's obviously
exceptions to all of these.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.600
We're just kind of saying,
a normal breakfast,

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.310
a normal person.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.860
They're not eating
a pint of honey.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.000
They're not doing
something crazy.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.100
So let's say 120 would
be right around there.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.060
A normal person, someone
who does not have diabetes,

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.510
it would be unlikely that
it would go above that.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.800
And then actually,
after about two hours,

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.760
they're getting pretty
close to normal.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.340
They get back under 100
milligrams per deciliter.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.230
And then you go
beyond two hours,

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.560
they just kind of get close,
back to their baseline,

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.170
to that 80 milligrams
per deciliter.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.820
So once again, this is normal.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.200
And of course, don't
freak out if you

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.260
were to take a blood
test one morning,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.089
and you were at like 85
milligrams per deciliter.

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:21.281
You're still not
far off from normal.

00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:22.780
So obviously, there's
some variation

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.410
from person to person.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.810
Now, if someone has diabetes,
if either they have type 1,

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.480
they don't have enough
insulin to actually process

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.060
the glucose, or if they
have enough insulin,

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.380
but their body is
desensitized to it.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.480
The insulin isn't being
processed properly

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.250
so they can't
process the glucose,

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.860
we've seen that the glucose
concentrations will go up.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.030
And so, in general, if you
were to wake up one morning

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.100
after not having eaten
for more than eight hours,

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.950
and you were to prick
your finger with one

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.980
of those little glucose monitors
you can get at the drug store,

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.710
and in your finger,
the blood sugar levels,

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.860
if you were to find
them to be-- Let's say

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:14.720
you were to find them to be
at 140, that's 140 milligrams

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.812
per deciliter.

00:05:15.812 --> 00:05:16.770
It's a good indication.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.010
I mean, you shouldn't freak out.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.759
You should do multiple
tests and make sure

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:22.116
that it wasn't a false
reading or any of that.

00:05:22.116 --> 00:05:23.740
And you should
definitely see a doctor.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.777
Once again, don't view this
as any type of medical advice.

00:05:26.777 --> 00:05:28.110
That is not the purpose of this.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.350
The purpose of this
is just to understand

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.820
a little bit of what's going on.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.510
Don't change your lifestyle
based on anything I tell you.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.260
All right.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.610
But if you do experience
that, it looks

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.580
like, at least just from
that one data point,

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.810
that your body isn't
processing sugar properly.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.580
Because you've had over eight
hours to process the sugar,

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.160
for insulin to go into
your bloodstream and allow

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.740
glucose to be taken up and get
back down to a normal level.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.840
But it still hasn't gone there.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.811
So if you were to test
a value like that,

00:05:58.811 --> 00:05:59.810
you should be concerned.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.760
In general, the threshold, and
I've seen multiple thresholds

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.340
here, are between 100
and-- I've seen high,

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.630
kind of mid-120s to 130
milligrams per deciliter.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.740
So that's kind of-- let
me do it in this range.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.052
If your fasting blood
sugar is above this line

00:06:16.052 --> 00:06:18.010
right here-- remember,
the fasting blood sugar.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.260
Not after you've eaten a meal.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.070
Your preprandial,
before a meal--

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.390
if it is above that
threshold right over there,

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.100
then you should at least-- you
should definitely see a doctor

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.050
and make sure that they can
see if you have diabetes.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.640
But this would be
cause for concern.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.200
Another thing is
if after a meal,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.060
it spikes well
beyond that, we're

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.545
talking if it gets beyond 180.

00:06:40.545 --> 00:06:42.420
And once again, these
are all just thresholds

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.035
that doctors have come up with
and researchers have come up

00:06:45.035 --> 00:06:46.910
with that say, hey, this
is a good indication

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.170
that somehow you are not
processing glucose properly.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.669
So 180 is up here.

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:55.210
And I'm drawing it
as a squiggly line

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.418
because it's kind of a range.

00:06:56.418 --> 00:07:01.360
It's not like if your blood
glucose is 124, you're safe.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.490
And all of a sudden at
125, you have diabetes.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:03.990
No.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.781
They're not that
different than each other.

00:07:05.781 --> 00:07:09.770
But they have to set
up some threshold just

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.950
to kind of have a
threshold, I guess.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.850
So if your blood sugar,
after eating a meal,

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.320
were to spike up
to, let's say 200,

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.770
once again, that would
be cause for concern.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.330
So in general, if
someone has diabetes,

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.770
because they're not processing
the glucose properly,

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:29.470
their blood glucose might
look something like this.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.780
So maybe their
fasting blood glucose

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.145
is right around 125, 130.

00:07:34.145 --> 00:07:35.930
It can move around.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.510
Then they have a meal.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.500
Then it might spike up.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.500
Obviously, they can process
some of the glucose.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.050
Otherwise, they would die.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.120
But it's not being
processed properly.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.000
So the glucose levels don't
go down to where they should.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.134
And maybe some glucose gets
taken up from the blood.

00:07:55.134 --> 00:07:56.800
Obviously they're
living, so their cells

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.510
are metabolizing something.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.860
But it never gets down to
the normal 80 milligrams

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.170
per deciliter.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:07.410
It might settle down, back
to something in the 120 range

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:10.570
or something like that, which
would be cause for concern.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.940
And in general, if
you're someplace--

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:17.530
I've seen the threshold if
you're above 100 on a fasting

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.160
basis, that's cause for concern.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.940
You should maybe
adjust your lifestyle.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:27.880
And if you're above 120,
130 after meal, once again,

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.550
you should also be
slightly worried

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.330
that you might maybe
are prediabetic

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.440
or you have some risk
of developing diabetes.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:40.360
So if someone has
blood sugar like this,

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.850
they're probably diabetic.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:43.970
And if someone has
blood sugar like this,

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:46.240
they should be worried.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.400
But once again, I
