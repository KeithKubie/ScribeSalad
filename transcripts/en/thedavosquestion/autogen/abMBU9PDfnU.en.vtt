00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:09.690
 in the year 2000 and worldwide 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.170
 I was invited to found the question 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.870
 next that is the greatest resources 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.500
 they are used in Latin America very 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.449
 interesting question I think your people 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.970
 particularly the young women 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.630
 and minorities the face of america 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.730
 latina is a young face on 19.5 of the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.560
 population of latin america is today not 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.170
 only surpassed by Africa by 20 by 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.700
 percent however 82 percent of 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.550
 the young people of latin america are 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.460
 unemployed or underemployed the case of 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.399
 the least the same unemployment are 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.860
 god percent above the average and 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.530
 of the 570 million inhabitants of 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.360
 latin america there are 218 million 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.940
 people outside the systems of 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.110
 integration and social protection that's why 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.610
 I think the solution is 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.610
 basically in two areas 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:08.299
 the creation of productive employment and 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.299
 also economic
