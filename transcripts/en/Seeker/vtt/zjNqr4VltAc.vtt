00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:01.869
Food grows in nature.

00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:02.869
Bugs crawl on it.

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:04.330
Fish poop all the time.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.870
Cows lick things you wouldn't want to touch.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.850
And fruits and vegetables literally grow in
dirt -- DIRT YOU GUYS.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:20.570
Hey flavonoids, Trace regurgitating some food
science for DNews today.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.910
We all know food comes from the earth, so
why do we expect it to look perfect?

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.950
Ugly food, or food that doesn't "look right,"
doesn't get sold, and it makes up a ton of

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.620
our food supply.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:36.750
According to the USDA 133 billion pounds and
161 billion dollars worth of food was wasted

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.970
in 2010 by retailers and consumers.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.079
That's about 30 percent of all food production!

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.220
Ugly food is part of that waste.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.450
Reducing food waste could help us feed more
of our population, without increasing food

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.580
production, and ugly food is a first step
on that path, but it has a big climb to be

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.780
accepted, because some humans have cognitive
bias; we don't roll with the uggos.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.483
Humans assume attractive people are smarter,
and have fewer diseases, so it would make

00:01:02.483 --> 00:01:06.450
sense that we'd also assume attractive food
is better.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.840
There's a principle restauranteurs and chefs
use called plating or presentation -- chefs

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.380
place the food on our plates to make it look
good.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.380
And it works.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.410
A study in the journal Appetite and another
in Flavour looked at the importance of the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.829
aesthetics of food.

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.389
They found not only does good looking food
positively affect the flavor, but the actual

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:27.429
plate it's on also affects how people feel
about it.

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:31.500
Unfortunately our cognitive bias for attraction
likely goes far deeper than people, plating

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.200
or the plates themselves.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.219
Even potatoes have to look good.

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:39.770
Since it's founding in 1862 the U.S. Department
of Agriculture has been a source of regulation,

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.189
standardization and knowledge for how we grow
and consume food.

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.969
Today, it fights to comprehend and regulate
the U.S. food systems, but some of its original

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.119
regulations don't make sense anymore."

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.549
The USDA ranks food by freshness, appearance,
color, and size -- among other things.

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.060
Grade A milk, for example, can be used for…
well, milk.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.810
While Grade B milk and lower is used for butter,
cheese and so on.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.899
The idea being to protect the consumer.

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.060
Milk in liquid form is more susceptible to
bacterial infection.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.560
But some of these regs don't make sense.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.170
Take cauliflower color, for example.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.450
Color 1 cauliflower should be "bright white
to creamy white," according to USDA standards.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.380
But not for a specific reason!

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.860
The silly thing about USDA recommendations
is that cauliflower left in a farmer's field

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.730
doesn't stay white, it has to be harvested
early to meet this standard, because the sun

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.200
turns it a dull yellow!

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.030
Yet, "yellow or other abnormal color [that]
materially detracts from the appearance" is

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.310
unacceptable, says the USDA.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.560
Our bias against ugly food goes all the way
back to regulation.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.310
The USDA says this is so we can share a "common
language" for our food.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.940
But, yellow cauliflower is just as nutritious
as white.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.450
Another regulation states that green peppers
have to be 90 percent green.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.010
Again, same nutrition, just regulated this
way for common language.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.770
So, because it can affect the grade, and thus
the price, this ugly, perfectly nutritious

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.170
food stays in the field to rot.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.550
Any number of things can cause this, from
the wrong color, the wrong shape, not enough

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.780
leaves or too many.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.790
On top of that bushels of fruits and vegetables
never leave warehouses due to blemishes, bruising,

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.730
or discoloration.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.600
Wasted food has a value of 1 trillion dollars
worldwide, and could feed billions more people.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.520
Now, the “ugly food movement” to get these
weirdo plants harvested and on the dinner

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.520
table is gaining ground.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.180
More grocery stores, farmers markets, and
even restaurants are buying and serving "substandard"

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.180
food.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.870
Which is great, because c'mon, it's exactly
the same, it just looks weird.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.380
And hey, I look weird, but y'all still like
me, so why not a green pepper that's like…

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.550
85 percent green?

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.970
Or a potato with an extra bump?

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.240
Or a double carrot!

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.690
All the way across the sky.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.580
The ugly food movement is making it big lately,
and our friends at seeker stories followed

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.590
a chef who transformed “ugly food” and
turned it into an amazing six course meal

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.580
which was served out of a dumpster.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.620
Seriously, it's weird.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.620
But super interesting.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.870
Watch it here.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:16.859
Do you care what your

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.739
food looks like or are you just a human trash
compactor?

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.139
Tell me.
