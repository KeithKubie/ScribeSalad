00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.460
Let me draw a good
old PV diagram.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.510
That's my pressure axis,
this is my volume axis.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.360
Just like that, I have
pressure and volume.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.650
I showed several videos ago that
if we start at some state

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.560
here in the PV diagram, right
there, and that I change the

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.090
pressure and the volume to get
to another state, and I do it

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.770
in a quasistatic way, so
essentially I'm always close

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.170
to equilibrium, so my state
variables are always defined,

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.640
I could have some path that
takes me to some other state

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.950
right there.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.600
And this is my path.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.020
I'm going from this state
to that state.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.230
And we showed that if I just did
this, the work done by the

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.460
system is the area
under this curve.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.730
And then if I were to move back
to the previous state,

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.480
and then if I were, you know, by
some path, just some random

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.830
path that I happened to be
drawing, the work done to the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.600
system would be the area under
this light blue curve.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.860
So the net work done by the
system ended up being the area

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.090
inside of this path.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.850
So this is-- let me do it
in different color.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.700
The net work done would be the
area inside of this path when

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.390
I go in this clockwise
type of direction.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:26.770
So this is the net work
done by the system.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.360
And now, we also know that if
we're at some point on this PV

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.260
diagram, that our state is the
same as it was before.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.150
So if we go all the way here,
and then go all the way back,

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.300
all of our state variables
will not have changed.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.580
Our pressure is the same
as it was before.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.430
Our volume was the same as it
was before because we went all

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.880
the way back to that same
point on the PV diagram.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.660
And our internal energy is also
the same point as it was

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.130
before, so our change in
internal energy over this

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.290
path, you're going to have a
different internal energy here

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.350
than you had here, but when you
go around the circle and

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.840
you get back, your change
in internal

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.420
energy is equal to zero.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.865
And we know that our change in
internal energy is defined as,

00:02:07.865 --> 00:02:11.450
and this is from the first law
of thermodynamics, the heat

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:18.250
added to the system minus the
work done by the system.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.650
Now, if we go on a closed loop
on our PV diagram, then what's

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.810
our change in internal energy?

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:24.970
It's zero.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.150
So we get zero change in
internal energy, because we're

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.330
at the same state is equal to
the heat applied to the system

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.930
minus the work done or-- and
I've done this little exercise

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:38.810
multiple times.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.020
I think is probably the fourth
or fifth time I'm doing it.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.970
We get that the heat added to
the system, if we just add w

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.170
to both sides, is equal to the
work done by the system.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.430
So this area inside of this
path, I already said, it's the

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.360
work done by the system, and
if you don't remember even

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.310
where that came from, it was,
remember, pressure times

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.155
volume times change in volume is
a little incremental change

00:03:01.155 --> 00:03:02.800
in work, and that's why it
relates to the area.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.070
But we've done that
multiple times.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.180
I won't go there just yet.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.150
So if you have any area here,
some heat was added to the

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.360
system, some net heat, right?

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.380
Some heat was added here, and
some heat was probably taken

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.780
out here, but you have
some net heat that's

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.260
added to the system.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.330
And I use that argument
to say why heat isn't

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.410
a good state variable.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.410
Because-- and I had a whole
video on this-- that if I

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.350
define some state variable,
let's just say, heat content.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.200
Let's say I want to
define some state

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.900
variable heat content.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.990
And I would say that the change
in heat content would,

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.350
of course, be equal to
the change in heat.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.100
That's what I'm defining.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.970
If I'm adding heat to
the system, my heat

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.550
content should go up.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.230
But the problem with that heat
content state variable was

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.630
that, let's say over here, I say
that the heat content is

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.270
equal to 5.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.560
Now, I just showed you that if
we go on some path here and we

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.280
come back, and there's some area
in this little path that

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.700
I took, that some
heat was added.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.490
So let's say that this area
right here, so this is q is

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.439
equal to the work done by
the system, let's say

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:19.200
it's equal to 2.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.470
So every time, if I start at
heat content is equal to 5,

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.850
that's just an arbitrary number,
and I were to do this

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.720
entire path, when I go back,
the heat content

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.930
would have to be 7.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.030
And then when I go back and do
it again, my heat content

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.250
would have to be 9.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.150
And it would have to increment
by 2 every time I do this

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.860
exact path.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.590
It would have to increment by
the amount of area that this

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.390
path goes around.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.420
So heat content can't be a state
variable, because it's

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.180
dependent on how
you got there.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.170
A state variable-- and
remember this.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.750
In order to be a state variable,
if you're at this

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.340
point, you have to have
the same value.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.190
If your internal energy was 10
here, when you do the path and

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.630
you come back, your internal
energy will be 10 again.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.380
That's why internal energy is
a valid state variable.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.520
It's dependent only
on your state.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.010
If your entropy was 50 here,
when you soon. go back and you

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.890
do all sorts of crazy things,
and you come back to this

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.040
point, your entropy
is once again 50.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.030
If your pressure here is 5
atmospheres, when you come

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.170
back here, your pressure
will be 5 atmospheres.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.060
Your state variable cannot
change based on

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.050
what path you took.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.420
If you're at a certain state,
that's all that matters to the

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.030
state variable.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.090
Now this heat content didn't
work, and that's why we

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.590
actually led into some videos
where I divided by t and we

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.260
got entropy, which was an
interesting variation.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.790
But that's still
not satisfying.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.950
What if we really wanted to
develop something that could

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.670
in some way be a state variable,
but at the same time

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.020
measure heat?

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.090
So obviously, we're going to
have to make some compromises,

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.170
because if we just do a very
arbitrary kind of heat content

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.440
variable, then every time
you go around this,

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.440
it's going to change.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.370
That's not a valid
state variable.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.780
So let's see if we
can make up one.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.950
So let's just make
up a definition.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.930
Let's call my new thing that
I'm going to try to maybe

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.350
approximate heat, let's call it
h, and just as a little bit

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:03.870
of a preview, we're going
to call it enthalpy.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:08.980
And let's just define it.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.730
I'm just playing around.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.430
Let's just define it as the
internal energy plus my

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.883
pressure times my volume.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.620
So then what would my change
in enthalpy be?

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.660
So my change in enthalpy will
be, of course, the change of

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.340
these things.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.520
But I could just say, that's
my change in my internal

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:39.130
energy plus my change in
pressure times volume.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.300
Now, this is interesting.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.840
And I want to make
a point here.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.230
This, by definition, is a
valid state variable.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:45.220
Why is it?

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.320
Because it's the addition of
other state variables, right?

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.870
At any point in my PV diagram,
and it's also true if I did

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.030
diagrams that were entropy in
temperature or anything that

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.220
dealt with state variables, at
any point on my diagram, u is

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.800
going to be the same, no matter
how I got there. p is

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.200
by definition going
to be the same.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.540
That's why it's at that point.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.510
v is definitely going to
be the same point.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.940
So if I just add them up, this
is a valid state variable

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.480
because it's just the
sum of a bunch of

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.595
other valid state variables.

00:07:14.595 --> 00:07:17.780
So let's see if we can somehow
relate this thing that we've

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.930
already established as a
valid state variable.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.550
From the get-go, from our
definition, this works because

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.470
it's just the sum of

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.030
completely valid state variables.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.820
So let's see if we can relate
this somehow to heat.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.320
So we know what delta u is.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.790
If we're dealing with all of
the internal energy or the

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.810
change in internal energy, and
I'm not going to deal with all

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.590
the other chemical potentials
and all of that, it's equal to

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:48.770
the heat applied to the system
minus the work done by the

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:50.040
system, right?

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.380
Let me put everything
else there.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.480
The change in enthalpy is equal
to the heat applied

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.740
minus the work done-- that's
just the change in internal

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.520
energy-- plus delta PV.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.910
This is just from the definition
of my enthalpy.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.090
Now this is starting to
look interesting.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:11.570
What's the work done
by a system?

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:15.020
So I could write change in h,
or enthalpy, is equal to the

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:20.140
heat applied to the system
minus-- what's the work done

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:20.740
by a system?

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:25.280
If I have some system here, it's
got some piston on it,

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.450
you know, if we're doing it in
a quasistatic, I have those

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:29.310
classic pebbles that
I've talked

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.450
about in multiple videos.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:36.220
When I apply heat or let's say
I remove some of these

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.340
pebbles, so I'm at a different
equilibrium, but what's

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.150
actually happening?

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:41.200
When is the work being done?

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.030
You have some pressure being
applied up here, and this

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:48.370
piston is going to be moving up,
and your volume is going

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:48.880
to increase.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.710
And we showed multiple videos
ago that the work done by the

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.160
system can be, and you can
kind of view this as the

00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:01.560
volume expansion work, it's
equal to pressure

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.975
times change in volume.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.180
And let's add the other part.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.475
So this was our change
in internal energy.

00:09:09.475 --> 00:09:12.110
And I had several videos
where I show this.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:13.750
And now let me add the other
part of the equation.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.690
So our enthalpy, our change
in enthalpy, can

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:17.390
be defined by this.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:17.570
Now.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.780
Something interesting
is going on.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.780
I said that I wanted to define
something, because I wanted to

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.000
somehow measure heat content.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.270
My change in enthalpy will be
equal to the heat added to the

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:34.940
system, if these last two
terms cancel out.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:38.510
If I can somehow get these last
two terms to cancel out,

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.160
then my change in enthalpy
will be equal to this, if

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.360
somehow these are equal
to each other.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.800
So under what conditions are
these equal to each other?

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:52.060
Or another way, under what
conditions is delta pressure

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:57.010
times volume equal to pressure
times delta volume?

00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:58.360
When does this happen?

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.560
When can I make this
statement?

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.670
Because if I can make this
statement, then these two

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.285
terms are equivalent right here,
and then you my change

00:10:04.285 --> 00:10:07.580
in enthalpy will be equal
to the heat added.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.790
Well, the only way I can make
this statement is if pressure

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.040
is constant.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.100
Now why is that?

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.040
Let's just think about
it mathematically.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.740
If this is a constant, then if
I just change-- you know, if

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:30.130
this is just 5, 5 times a change
in something is the

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:33.930
same thing as the change in 5
times that thing, so it just

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.360
mathematically works out.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:40.830
Or if you view it another way,
if this is a constant, you can

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:44.660
just factor it out, right?

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:54.050
Well, if I said, the change in
5x, that would be equal to 5

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:58.900
times x final minus
5 times x initial.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.740
And you could say, well, that's
just equal to 5 times x

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.950
final minus x initial.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.710
Well, that's just equal to
5 times the change in x.

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:09.180
It's kind of almost too obvious
for me to explain.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.270
I think sometimes when you
overexplain things, it might

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:12.480
become more confusing.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.050
So this applies-- and the 5 I'm
just doing as the analogy

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:16.810
for a constant.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:20.830
So if pressure is constant, then
this equation is true.

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:26.690
So if pressure is constant-- so
this is a key assumption--

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:31.700
then if heat is being applied
in a constant pressure

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.410
system-- so we could
write it this way.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:36.780
I'll write it multiple times,
because this is key.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:45.450
If pressure is constant, then
our definition, our little

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:47.330
thing we made up, this enthalpy
thing, which we

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:52.900
defined as internal energy plus
pressure and volume, then

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.070
in a constant pressure system,
our change in enthalpy we just

00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:01.320
showed is equal to the heat
added to the system because

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.390
all of these two things become
equivalent under constant

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.360
pressure, so I should
write that.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.270
This is only true when
heat is added in a

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.220
constant pressure system.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.325
So how does this gel
with what we did up

00:12:11.325 --> 00:12:13.270
here on our PV diagram?

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.990
What's happening in a constant
pressure system?

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.780
Let me draw our PV diagram.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.920
That's P, that's V.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.210
So what's happening in
constant pressure?

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:30.440
We're at some pressure
right there.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.160
So if we're under constant
pressure, that means we can

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.900
only move along this line.

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:39.395
So we could go from here to
there and back to there, or we

00:12:39.395 --> 00:12:41.160
could go from there to
there, back to there.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.280
So we could go there, all the
way there, and then go back.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.040
But what do we see about this?

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.850
Is there any area
in this curve?

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:50.540
I mean, there is no curve to
speak of, because we're

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:51.680
staying in a constant
pressure.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.000
We've kind of squeezed
out this diagram.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.170
We've made the forward path and
the return path the same

00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:59.590
exact path.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:04.420
So because of this, you don't
have that state problem

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:08.490
because no net heat is being
added to the system when you

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.710
go from this point all the way
to this point and then back to

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:12.790
this point.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:14.840
So because of that, you can
kind of see visually that

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.090
enthalpy in a constant pressure,
when you're not

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:19.540
moving up and down in pressure,
is the same thing as

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.400
heat added.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.780
So you might say, hey Sal,
this was a bit of a

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.610
compromise, constant pressure,
you know, that's a big

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:25.490
assumption to make.

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:27.370
Why is this useful at all?

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.530
Well, it's useful, because
most chemical reactions,

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:33.530
especially ones that occur in an
open beaker, or that might

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:36.755
occur at sea level, and that
should be a big clue, they

00:13:36.755 --> 00:13:38.250
occur at constant pressure.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.070
You know, if I'm sitting at
the beach, and I have my

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:45.290
chemistry set, and I have some
beaker of something, and I'm

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:48.790
throwing other stuff into it,
and I'm looking for a reaction

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:50.450
or something, it's a constant
pressure system.

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:52.070
This is going to be atmospheric
pressure.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:52.830
1 atmosphere.

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.310
I'm sitting at sea level.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:14:00.110
So this is actually a very
useful concept for everyday

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.910
chemical expressions.

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:02.980
It might not be so useful for
engines, because engines

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.710
always have pressure changing,
but it's very useful for

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:10.130
actual chemistry, for actually
dealing with what's going to

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:13.910
happen to a reaction at
a constant pressure.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:16.520
So what we're going to see is
that this enthalpy, you can

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.960
kind of view it as
the heat content

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.450
when pressure is constant.

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:22.080
In fact, it is the heat content

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.200
when pressure is constant.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.960
So somehow-- well, not somehow,
I showed you how-- we

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.930
were able to make this
definition, which by

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.350
definition was a state variable,
because it was the

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.710
sum of other state variables,
and if we just make that one

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:39.270
assumption of constant pressure,
it all of a sudden

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:43.420
reduces to the heat content
of that system.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.290
So we'll talk more in the future
of measuring enthalpy,

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:49.310
but you just have to say, if
pressure is constant, enthalpy

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:52.280
is the same thing as-- and it's
really only useful when

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.380
we're dealing with a
constant pressure.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.340
But if we have a pressure
constant, enthalpy can be

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.655
imagined as heat content.

00:14:57.655 --> 00:15:00.900
And it's very useful for
understanding whether chemical

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.980
reactions need heat to occur or
whether they release heat,

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.200
so on and so forth.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.450
