00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.483
- [Instructor] Let's
say that we run a school

00:00:01.483 --> 00:00:04.305
and in that school there is a population

00:00:04.305 --> 00:00:06.975
of students right over here.

00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:08.972
And that is our population.

00:00:08.972 --> 00:00:11.305
And we want to get a sense of how

00:00:11.305 --> 00:00:14.939
these students feel about the
quality of math instruction

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:18.097
at the school, so we construct a survey,

00:00:18.097 --> 00:00:21.278
and we just need to decide
who are we going to get

00:00:21.278 --> 00:00:23.960
to actually answer this survey.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.304
One option is to just go to
every member of the population,

00:00:27.304 --> 00:00:29.069
but let's just say it's
a really large school.

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:30.868
Let's say we're a college

00:00:30.868 --> 00:00:32.505
and there's 10,000 people in the college.

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:34.572
We say, well, we can't
just talk to everyone.

00:00:34.572 --> 00:00:38.148
So instead, we say, let's
sample this population

00:00:38.148 --> 00:00:41.480
to get an indication of how
the entire school feels.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.336
So we are going to sample it.

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:47.204
We are going to sample that population.

00:00:47.204 --> 00:00:49.954
Now in order to avoid having bias

00:00:51.128 --> 00:00:53.229
in our response, in order for it to

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:55.853
have the best chance of
it being indicative of the

00:00:55.853 --> 00:01:00.578
entire population, we want
our sample to be random.

00:01:00.578 --> 00:01:04.061
So our sample could either be random,

00:01:04.061 --> 00:01:05.894
random, or not random.

00:01:08.192 --> 00:01:09.109
Not random.

00:01:10.246 --> 00:01:12.650
And it might seem, at first,
pretty straightforward

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.854
to do a random sample, but when
you actually get down to it,

00:01:15.854 --> 00:01:19.511
it's not always as straightforward
as you would think.

00:01:19.511 --> 00:01:24.329
So one type of random sample
is just a simple random sample.

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:25.912
So, simple, simple,

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:29.950
random, random, sample,

00:01:31.957 --> 00:01:34.874
and this is saying, alright, let me

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:39.709
maybe assign a number to
every person in the school,

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:42.008
maybe they already have
a student ID number,

00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:43.692
and I'm just going to get a computer,

00:01:43.692 --> 00:01:46.048
a random number generator, to generate the

00:01:46.048 --> 00:01:48.788
100 people, the 100 students,

00:01:48.788 --> 00:01:50.704
so let's say there's a
sample of 100 students,

00:01:50.704 --> 00:01:52.445
that I'm going to apply the survey to,

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:54.779
so that would be a simple random sample.

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:58.494
We are just going into this
whole population and randomly,

00:01:58.494 --> 00:01:59.795
let me just draw this.

00:01:59.795 --> 00:02:02.987
So this is the population,
we are just randomly

00:02:02.987 --> 00:02:05.344
picking people out, and we
know it's random because

00:02:05.344 --> 00:02:08.325
a random number generator, or
we have a string of numbers

00:02:08.325 --> 00:02:10.264
or something like that,
that is allowing us

00:02:10.264 --> 00:02:12.098
to pick the students.

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:14.084
Now that's pretty good, it's
unlikely that you're going

00:02:14.084 --> 00:02:17.613
to have bias from this
sample, but there is some

00:02:17.613 --> 00:02:20.363
probability that, just by chance,

00:02:22.632 --> 00:02:25.203
your random number generator
just happened to select

00:02:25.203 --> 00:02:28.163
maybe a disproportionate
number of boys over girls,

00:02:28.163 --> 00:02:30.752
or a disproportionate number of freshmen,

00:02:30.752 --> 00:02:33.040
or a disproportionate
number of engineering majors

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.197
versus English majors,
and that's a possibility.

00:02:36.197 --> 00:02:39.262
So even though you are
taking a simple random sample

00:02:39.262 --> 00:02:42.060
that is truly random, once
again, it's some probability

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.043
that it's not indicative
of the entire population.

00:02:46.043 --> 00:02:48.852
And so to mitigate that,
there are other techniques

00:02:48.852 --> 00:02:50.385
at our disposal.

00:02:50.385 --> 00:02:53.468
One technique is a stratified sample.

00:02:54.506 --> 00:02:55.423
Stratified.

00:02:56.735 --> 00:02:59.940
And so this is the idea of
taking our entire population

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.356
and essentially stratifying it.

00:03:01.356 --> 00:03:04.712
So let's say we want to, we
take that same population,

00:03:04.712 --> 00:03:06.952
we take that same
population, I'll draw it as a

00:03:06.952 --> 00:03:09.135
square here just for convenience,

00:03:09.135 --> 00:03:11.329
and we're gonna stratify it by,

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.735
let's say we're concerned that
we get a appropriate sample

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:16.760
of freshmen, sophomores,
juniors, and seniors.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.846
So we'll stratify it by
freshmen, sophomores,

00:03:20.846 --> 00:03:24.887
juniors, and seniors, and then we sample

00:03:24.887 --> 00:03:27.650
25 from each of these groups.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.089
So these are the stratifications.

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:33.256
This is freshmen, sophomore,
juniors, and seniors,

00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:37.515
and instead of just sampling
100 out of the entire pool,

00:03:37.515 --> 00:03:40.182
we sample 25 from each of these.

00:03:42.217 --> 00:03:44.110
So just like that.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.687
And so that makes sure that you are

00:03:46.687 --> 00:03:49.421
getting indicative responses from

00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:52.754
at least all of the different age groups

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.488
or levels within your university.

00:03:56.488 --> 00:03:57.789
Now there might be another
issue where you say,

00:03:57.789 --> 00:04:00.784
well, I'm actually more
concerned that we have

00:04:00.784 --> 00:04:04.894
accurate representation of
males and females in the school,

00:04:04.894 --> 00:04:06.525
and there is some probability,

00:04:06.525 --> 00:04:08.510
you know, if I do 100
random people, it's very

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.471
likely that it's close to
50/50, but there's some chance,

00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:14.373
just due to randomness,
there's disproportionately male

00:04:14.373 --> 00:04:16.022
or disproportionately female.

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:18.994
And that's even possible
in the stratified case.

00:04:18.994 --> 00:04:20.224
And so what you might say is,

00:04:20.224 --> 00:04:21.827
well, you know what I'm gonna do?

00:04:21.827 --> 00:04:25.678
I'm going to, there's a technique
called a clustered sample.

00:04:25.678 --> 00:04:29.184
Let me write this right
over here, clustered,

00:04:29.184 --> 00:04:33.526
a clustered sample, and what
we do is we sample groups.

00:04:33.526 --> 00:04:36.348
Each of those groups we feel confident has

00:04:36.348 --> 00:04:38.112
a good balance of male females.

00:04:38.112 --> 00:04:40.735
So, for example, we might,

00:04:40.735 --> 00:04:44.205
instead of sampling individuals
from the entire population,

00:04:44.205 --> 00:04:46.852
we might say, look, you know,

00:04:46.852 --> 00:04:49.754
on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and this, well,

00:04:49.754 --> 00:04:51.237
even there as you can tell this is not a

00:04:51.237 --> 00:04:55.569
trivial thing to do, let's
just say that we can split,

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:58.652
let's say we can split our population

00:04:59.582 --> 00:05:02.449
into groups, maybe these are classrooms,

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.851
and each of these classrooms
have an even distribution

00:05:05.851 --> 00:05:10.681
of males and females, or pretty
close to even distributions.

00:05:10.681 --> 00:05:13.815
And so what we do is we
sample the actual classrooms,

00:05:13.815 --> 00:05:16.428
so that's why it's called
cluster, or cluster technique,

00:05:16.428 --> 00:05:19.850
or clustered random
sample, because we're going

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.029
to randomly sample our
classrooms, each of which have a

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:27.338
close or maybe a exact
balance of males and females

00:05:27.338 --> 00:05:29.056
so we know that we're gonna
get good representation,

00:05:29.056 --> 00:05:31.843
but we are still sampling,
we are sampling from

00:05:31.843 --> 00:05:33.491
the clusters, but then we're gonna survey

00:05:33.491 --> 00:05:35.709
every single person in
each of these clusters,

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:38.890
every single person in
one of these classrooms.

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.882
So, once again, these are
all forms of random surveys,

00:05:43.882 --> 00:05:45.995
or random samples, you have
the simple random sample,

00:05:45.995 --> 00:05:48.840
you can stratify, or
you can cluster and then

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.452
randomly pick the clusters and then survey

00:05:51.452 --> 00:05:54.169
everyone in that cluster.

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.315
Now if these are all random samples,

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:59.881
what are the non-random things like?

00:05:59.881 --> 00:06:02.191
Well, one case of
non-random, you could have a

00:06:02.191 --> 00:06:03.608
voluntary survey,

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:08.632
or voluntary sample,
and this might just be

00:06:08.632 --> 00:06:10.176
you tell every student at the school,

00:06:10.176 --> 00:06:12.707
"Hey, here's a web address.

00:06:12.707 --> 00:06:15.400
"If you're interested, come
and fill out this survey."

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.163
And that's likely to
introduce bias because

00:06:18.163 --> 00:06:20.485
you might have maybe the
students who really like

00:06:20.485 --> 00:06:22.680
the math instruction at their school

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.995
more likely to fill it out,
maybe the students who really

00:06:24.995 --> 00:06:27.062
don't like it are more
likely to fill it out,

00:06:27.062 --> 00:06:29.036
maybe it's just the
kids who have more time

00:06:29.036 --> 00:06:30.266
more likely to fill it out.

00:06:30.266 --> 00:06:34.365
So this has a good chance
of introducing bias.

00:06:34.365 --> 00:06:36.853
The students who fill out the survey

00:06:36.853 --> 00:06:40.701
might be just more skewed
one way or the other because,

00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:43.534
you know, they volunteered for it.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.477
Another not random sample would be called

00:06:51.596 --> 00:06:54.394
you're introducing bias
because of convenience

00:06:54.394 --> 00:06:56.031
is the term that's often used,

00:06:56.031 --> 00:06:58.028
and this might say, well,
let's just sample the 100

00:06:58.028 --> 00:07:00.002
first students who show up in school.

00:07:00.002 --> 00:07:01.976
And that's just convenient for me because

00:07:01.976 --> 00:07:03.438
I didn't have to use random numbers,

00:07:03.438 --> 00:07:06.512
or do the stratification, or
doing any of this clustering,

00:07:06.512 --> 00:07:09.600
but you can understand how
this also would introduce bias,

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.853
because the first 100 students
who show up at school,

00:07:11.853 --> 00:07:14.105
maybe those are the
most diligent students,

00:07:14.105 --> 00:07:17.507
maybe they all take an
early math class that has

00:07:17.507 --> 00:07:20.011
a very good instructor where
they're all happy about it.

00:07:20.011 --> 00:07:21.067
Or it might go the other way,

00:07:21.067 --> 00:07:22.968
the instructor there
isn't the best one, and so

00:07:22.968 --> 00:07:25.499
it might introduce bias the other way.

00:07:25.499 --> 00:07:27.751
So if you let people
volunteer or you just say,

00:07:27.751 --> 00:07:29.597
"Oh, let me do the first N students."

00:07:29.597 --> 00:07:32.087
Or you say, "Hey, let me just
talk to all of the students

00:07:32.087 --> 00:07:35.477
"who happen to be in
front of me right now."

00:07:35.477 --> 00:07:37.068
They might be in front of
you out of convenience,

00:07:37.068 --> 00:07:40.651
but they might not be
a true random sample.

00:07:41.921 --> 00:07:44.661
Now there is other reasons
why you might introduce bias,

00:07:44.661 --> 00:07:47.413
and it might not be
because of the sampling.

00:07:47.413 --> 00:07:49.038
You might introduce bias because of the

00:07:49.038 --> 00:07:51.104
wording of your survey.

00:07:51.104 --> 00:07:53.438
You could imagine a survey that says,

00:07:53.438 --> 00:07:56.515
do you consider yourself
lucky to get a math education

00:07:56.515 --> 00:07:59.580
that very few other people
in the world have access to?

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.263
Well, that might bias you to say,

00:08:01.263 --> 00:08:03.249
"Well, yeah, I guess I feel lucky."

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:05.790
Well, if the wording was,

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.269
do you like the fact
that a disproportionate

00:08:08.269 --> 00:08:11.950
more students at your school tend to fail

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.713
algebra than our surrounding schools?

00:08:14.713 --> 00:08:16.617
Well, that might bias you negatively.

00:08:16.617 --> 00:08:19.578
So the wording really, really,
really matters in surveys,

00:08:19.578 --> 00:08:22.956
and there is a lot that
would go into this.

00:08:22.956 --> 00:08:25.545
And the other one is just people's,

00:08:25.545 --> 00:08:27.205
you know, it's called response bias.

00:08:27.205 --> 00:08:29.481
And, once again, this isn't about...

00:08:29.481 --> 00:08:30.648
Response bias.

00:08:32.455 --> 00:08:35.509
And this is just people not
wanting to tell the truth

00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:37.471
or maybe not wanting to respond at all.

00:08:37.471 --> 00:08:39.178
Maybe they're afraid that somehow

00:08:39.178 --> 00:08:40.839
their response is gonna show up

00:08:40.839 --> 00:08:42.704
in front of their math
teacher or the administrators,

00:08:42.704 --> 00:08:44.132
or if they're too negative,

00:08:44.132 --> 00:08:46.106
it might be taken out on them in some way.

00:08:46.106 --> 00:08:48.474
And because of that, they
might not be truthful,

00:08:48.474 --> 00:08:51.086
and so they might be overly positive

00:08:51.086 --> 00:08:53.153
or not fill it out at all.

00:08:53.153 --> 00:08:56.946
So anyway, this is a
very high level overview

00:08:56.946 --> 00:08:58.653
of how you could think about sampling.

00:08:58.653 --> 00:09:00.522
You want to go random
because it lowers the

00:09:00.522 --> 00:09:03.840
probability of their
introducing some bias into it.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.723
And then these are some techniques.

00:09:05.723 --> 00:09:07.104
And also think about
whether you're falling

00:09:07.104 --> 00:09:09.403
into some of these pitfalls
that have a good chance

00:09:09.403 --> 00:09:11.070
of introducing bias.
