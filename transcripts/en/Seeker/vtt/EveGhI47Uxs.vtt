You guys probably don't need ME to tell you
that sometimes, swearing just feels f*cking

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:04.499
awesome.

00:00:04.499 --> 00:00:06.120
I mean fricking.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.180
We can saying fricking, right?

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.530
Hey folks, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.859
I grew up in a household where swearing was
a biiiiiig nono.

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:22.679
I remember once my dad was driving me to school
and I accidentally said "what the fuck?" out

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:24.560
loud while reading a text.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.000
Bad times, my friends.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.029
Never forget.

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.859
I have often asked myself: what's so bad about
cursing anyway?

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:30.859
They're just....words.

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.890
What's interesting is that what counts as
a vulgarity varies by culture -- but every

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.320
language in the world has swear words.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.630
It also depends on the time period.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.170
For example, in the 1700s, "quim" had an effect
quite like today's "c-word".

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.800
And while some curse words live long lives,
they may lose or gain offensiveness over time.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.430
Like "bastard", which was considered MUCH
more offensive in the 1800s than it is today.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.400
Dr. Melissa Mohr, author of "Holy Shit: A
Brief History of Swearing", writes that throughout

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.420
history, the general trend is that what counts
as a vulgarity depends on what the society

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.280
believes is taboo, most scary, or most interesting.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.409
Under this banner comes more expansions like
bodily functions and sexual or racial epithets.

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.670
In this sense, curse words hold a unique cultural
power to mark what is "good" and "bad".

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.200
That in mind, scientists have found that the
act of cursing provides people with a number

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.200
of benefits.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.390
The main one being pain relief.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.340
Scientists at Keele University in the UK have
found that, particularly for those who don't

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.079
swear often, letting your mouth run wild can
help when you're in pain.

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:31.950
For the study, patients put their hands in
an ice cold bucket of water and were told

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.430
to hold it there as long as possible.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.859
For the group that was allowed to swear during
the experiment, they lasted, on average, about

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:40.780
31 seconds longer than the non-swearing group.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.340
They believe that swearing activates the brain's
endogenous opioid centers -- which results

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.409
in a sensation similar to morphine.

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.619
For those who curse a lot, they have built
up a tolerance, and need more extreme profanities

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.259
to elicit the same effect.

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.649
It's kind of like a drug in your brain.

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.299
Another widespread benefit of cursing is more
psychological, it provides us with a way to

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.389
let it all out and get back at people without
physically harming them.

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:05.810
Although, that doesn't necessarily mean that
we aren't harming someone at all by using

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.590
words instead of physical violence.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.290
After all, we know that words can drive someone
to the edge -- the most extreme effects of

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.489
verbal abuse being self-harm or even suicide.

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.849
Swearing can also help us feel like we have
more power and control over a situation than

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.269
we may actually have.

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.680
As for those non-angry swears, a recent paper
in the American Journal of Psychology notes

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.390
that swearing can encourage social bonding
through humor or a shared sense of belonging.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.840
So folks, tell me: do you swear?

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.129
Do you see any benefits or problems with it?

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.689
Tell me what you think down below and we'll
be back later with more f*cking updates.
