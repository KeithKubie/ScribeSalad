00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is this.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It is equal to the square root of the sum of the deviations in the y's

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
over the deviations of the x's.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Note that this is exactly the same as the standard deviation of y

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
divided by the standard deviation of x,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
because the number of observations divides out.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
To see that this is, in fact, true, when we divide b/r we can see the numerators cancel,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
so we have b/r equal to the square root of the squared differences in the y's

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
times the sums of the square differences in the x's

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
over the sums of the square differences in the x's.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The key thing to recognize is we can break this into two pieces.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The denominator can be written as the square of the square root.

00:00:49.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Now we can just cancel this and we have our answer.
