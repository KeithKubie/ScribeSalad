00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.460
What are the solutions to
the system of equations

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.160
y is equal to x plus
1, and x squared

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.680
plus y squared is equal to 25?

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.040
So let's first just visualize
what we're trying to do.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.430
So let me try to roughly
graph these two equations.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.293
So my y-axis, this is my x-axis.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.730
This right over here, x
squared plus y squared

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.650
is equal to 25, that's going
to be a circle centered

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.667
at 0 with radius 5.

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:33.750
You don't have to know
that to solve this problem,

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.080
but it helps to visualize it.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.130
So if this is 5,
this is 5, 5, 5.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.360
This right over
here is negative 5.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.720
This right over
here is negative 5.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.480
This equation would
be represented

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.900
by this set of
points, or this is

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.160
a set of points that
satisfy this equation.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.330
So let me-- there you go.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.810
Trying to draw it as close
to a perfect circle as I can.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.700
And then y equals
x plus 1 is a line

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.670
of slope 1 with a 1 y-intercept.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.240
So this is 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.850
y-intercept is there
and has a slope of 1

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.224
so it looks something like this.

00:01:13.224 --> 00:01:14.890
So when we're looking
for the solutions,

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.020
we're looking for the
points that satisfy both.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.630
The points that satisfy both
are the points that sit on both.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.870
So it's that point-- let me do
it in green-- It's this point

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.680
and it's this point
right over here.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.100
So how do we actually
figure that out?

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.320
Well, the easiest way
is to-- well, sometimes

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.960
the easiest way is to substitute
one of these constraints

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.710
into the other constraint.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.840
And since they've already
solved for y here,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.740
we can substitute y in the
blue equation with x plus 1

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.580
with this constraint
right over here.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.690
So instead of saying x squared
plus y squared equals 25,

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.880
we can say x squared plus,
and instead of writing a y,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.310
we're adding the constraint
that y must be x plus 1.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:02.960
So x squared plus x plus 1
squared must be equal to 25.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.010
And now, we can
attempt to solve for x.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.539
So we get x squared
plus-- now we square this.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.340
We'll get-- let me
write in magenta--

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.060
we'll get x squared
plus 2x plus 1,

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.380
and that must be equal to 25.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.890
We have 2x squared--
now, I'm just

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.340
combining these two
terms-- 2x squared

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.190
plus 2x plus 1 is equal to 25.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.250
Now, we could just use
the quadratic formula

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.760
to find the-- well,
we have to be careful.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.540
We have to set this
equal to 0, and then

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.180
use the quadratic formula.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.430
So let's subtract
25 from both sides,

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:46.406
and you could get 2x squared
plus 2x minus 24 is equal to 0.

00:02:46.406 --> 00:02:48.280
And actually, let's--
just to simplify this--

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.710
let's divide both sides by 2,
and you get x squared plus x

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.027
minus 12 is equal to 0.

00:02:56.027 --> 00:02:58.610
And actually, we don't even have
to use the quadratic formula,

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.474
we can factor this
right over here.

00:03:00.474 --> 00:03:02.640
What are two numbers that
when we take their product

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.880
we get negative 12, and when
we add them, we get positive 1?

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.820
Well, positive 4 and negative
3 would do the trick.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:16.950
So we have x plus 4 times
x minus 3 is equal to 0.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.220
So x could be equal
to-- well, if x plus 4

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.340
is 0 then that would make
this whole thing true.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.930
So x could be equal
to negative 4 or x

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.180
could be equal to positive 3.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.990
So this right over
here is a situation

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.740
where x is negative 4.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.690
This right over here is
a situation where x is 3.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.490
So we're almost done, we just
have to find the corresponding

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:40.340
y's.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.270
And for that, we can just
resort to the simplest equation

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.470
right over here, y is x plus 1.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.360
So in this situation
when x is negative 4,

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.770
y is going to be that plus 1.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.370
So y is going to be negative 3.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.660
This is the point negative
4 comma negative 3.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.970
Likewise, when x is 3, y
is going to be equal to 4.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.150
So this is the point 3 comma 4.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.440
These are the two solutions
to this non-linear system

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.991
of equations.
