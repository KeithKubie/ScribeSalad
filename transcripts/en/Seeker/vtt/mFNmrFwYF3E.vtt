00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.870
Get your NASA-issued
party helmets on,

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:02.975
because it is space week!

00:00:09.846 --> 00:00:11.270
Happy Space Week, viewers.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.550
I'm Trace, and you have found
the D News weekly space update.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.540
Space gets people excited.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.580
It's inspiring.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.070
How can you not love the
romantic and exciting ideas

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.470
of space travel?

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.800
Today begins World Space Week.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.000
The United Nations created
World Space Week in 1999

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.330
to commemorate two dates--
October 4 and October 10.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.380
And they use this
time to educate people

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.730
about the benefits of
space travel for economies,

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.200
for industries, and
get people excited

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.576
around the globe about science,
space exploration, and space

00:00:40.576 --> 00:00:41.075
education.

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:44.500
On October 4, 1957, the
very first satellite

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.370
was launched into
space, Sputnik One.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.680
Think about that.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.296
56 years ago yesterday, nothing
had ever been put into orbit.

00:00:53.296 --> 00:00:54.920
Sure, we'd launched
rockets into space.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.600
But that was it.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.330
We had never purposefully
placed anything up there ever.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.480
Sputnik burned up on
reentry a few months later,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.310
but it kicked off the space
race between the Soviet Union

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.480
and United States.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.840
October 10, 1967, 10 years after
Sputnik One's successful orbit,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.410
the Treaty on Principles
Governing the Activities

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.570
of States in the Exploration and
Peaceful Uses of Outer Space,

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.100
Including the Moon and
Other Celestial Bodies

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.131
was signed at the
United Nations.

00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:22.630
We have actually
referred to it here

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.599
at D News as the
Outer Space Treaty.

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:26.140
I think it took 10
years and six days

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.099
because they were still
agreeing on that name.

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:28.890
I love this treaty.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.940
It is super interesting.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.439
According to the
Outer Space Treaty,

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.376
no country can claim
the moon as its own.

00:01:33.376 --> 00:01:34.000
Sorry, America.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.660
And all celestial bodies have
to be used for peace only.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.520
It also mandated that astronauts
were envoys for all mankind,

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.320
not just their
country of origin.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.844
If an astronaut somehow
landed in an enemy country,

00:01:45.844 --> 00:01:48.260
that country was supposed to
send them home straight away,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.950
though I don't know if
that's ever happened.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.540
Just in case you're
unaware, dollars

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.110
spent in space exploration
provide huge benefits

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.379
to people on the ground
across the world,

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:58.170
even in nations that
have no space program.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.960
For example, better
digital cameras

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.670
were pushed by the Hubble
Space Telescope research.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.440
And that has since made
digital medical devices better.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.650
The jaws of life were
developed for the space program

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.650
and now help cut apart
vehicles mangled in car wrecks.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.260
Not to mention satellites for
natural disaster, early warning

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.800
systems, community, and
countless other uses.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.690
Space is awesome.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.840
To get into the spirit,
Discovery's online network,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.790
TestTube, is throwing
space celebrations

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.087
all across our shows.

00:02:24.087 --> 00:02:25.920
Here on D News, we're
going to have a Google

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.050
Hangout with some
awesome space nerds.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.220
Nature hates you is going to
tell you why space hates you.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.220
And brain stuff is
getting into the fun too.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.890
So for all the
awesome space video,

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.420
check out TestTube.com/space.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.350
So what do you love
about space exploration?

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.624
What is your favorite
thing about space programs?

00:02:42.624 --> 00:02:44.540
Share your thoughts with
us, and get out there

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.916
and enjoy Space Week, everybody.
