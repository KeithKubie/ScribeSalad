00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:03.510
Vsauce. Michael here today with a
special video.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.180
It's a Skype conversation I had with Newt
from Underbelly where he teaches me

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.530
about six actual villains from real
comic books

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.420
that are really, really lame. He's joined
by a bunch of ladies from Underbelly,

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.900
and as you will see immediately from
Storytime, he's quite

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.689
the ladies man.
First things first, you should know that

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.000
I'm kinda busy right now playing the
May update for Angry Birds Rio

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.920
and I'm not wearing pants.
So,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.030
we're already up to a really good start.
"Hey, over here.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.940
It can't be," Prince Hobopopo says.
"In the flesh."

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.010
If you're gonna read me the bad guys, you
gotta read in the scary voice. You know I

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.590
only want you on the show if you do what
I tell you. "In the flesh."

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.920
Just be quiet, I wanna do this.
At number 6

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.510
we were gonna have Kite-Man, who's a Batman
villain, who's just some

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.360
dork with a kite strapped to his back,
but I decided instead

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.230
to go with a color-blind villain, because
color blindness is nothing to joke about

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.090
in America.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.650
So, I thought I would go with Rainbow
Rider, who is a flash

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.729
villain and this guy just sucks, alright?
He basically

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.229
has glasses that project colours and
then he create structures for him to

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.030
emote from that are colourful, but I mean,
really, this guy's just fabulous. 'Cause

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.460
everything

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.759
is rainbow colored. Anyway, it's just one of those
characters where it's like four o'clock in

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.530
the morning and they're like "oh, we got to
have the Flash fight, somebody."

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.590
"I know, we'll have a guy who rides rainbows."
The

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.189
next one on the list, number 5,
we have armless

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.530
Tiger Man. Basically this guy's story was
he was a small German boy who had his

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.579
arms ripped off

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.259
in an industrial accident. He went around
during Golden Age Marvel books

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.750
using his sharp teeth and his prowess with his toes

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.680
to destroy all machines.
Next up on the list we have Crazy

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.520
Quilt, who is a Batman villain and this
guy has the most

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.869
eye-be-jarringly bad costume in comic book history.

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.320
And I think I just made up the word "eye-be-jarring." Crazy Quilt was a low-level

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.670
robber who was blinded by a bullet,

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.660
but in prison had an experimental
surgery to restore his vision,

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.060
but unfortunately the vision that he was
left with was so disorienting

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.290
that it drove him crazy. Wow, Vsauce doesn't even have t-shirts and you guys already have

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.330
dresses and girls.
We have several... we have home and away uniforms.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.720
Next up on the list we have Egg Fu.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.220
An Egg Fu was a Wonder Woman villain,
who, at the peak of the Red Scare,

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.650
would try to have people denounce their
love for the red white and blue

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.580
and this worked with him using fear,
because he is essentially a giant

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.530
egg with a mustache.
Katie, what do you think about Egg Fu?

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.580
It doesn't matter, she's a woman.
Next up from the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.750
freaky deaky seventies,
we have the Hypno-Hustler.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.980
And this guy's clearly... he's got the most glorious

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.870
glittering crusted Afro I've seen
on the printed page, it's amazing.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.319
Armed with hypno goggles and...
Oh, one second. Thank you.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.060
Any port in a storm, right?

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.630
The ladies keep coming. I have them bring
me drinks every now and again when

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.270
I get parched.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.570
Armed with his hypno goggles

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.590
and power boots, he put the audience in a trance

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.380
and was able to rob them.
His name is

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.420
Turner D. Century and he was a Spider Woman

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.400
villain and essentially he, he hates
young people

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.060
and he wants to restore, restore
San Francisco to the glory days

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.060
of like the 1900's.
So he flies around

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.450
on a bicycle, okay?
And he goes

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.970
toe-to-dandy-toe with any superhero
who tries to stop him.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.780
And he has a horn that's honking fury
will kill anyone under the age of 65

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.370
years old.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.860
And that's how he can restore San
Francisco to the glory days.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.210
So that was our top six worst,
my top six super villains

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.440
in comic book history. And this is
kicking off, this month is Superhero Month.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.000
We're gonna give you a top 10 worst
superhero list,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.870
so turn up a little bit. Kevin

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:12.210

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.220
piece called "Saving Superman."
And then we're gonna introduce a new

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.130
Underbelly character and we hope that you

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.980
