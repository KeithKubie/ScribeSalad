&gt;&gt;Jenny: So I'm really excited to introduce
our author today, Pamela Slim. Pam was born

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:17.210
and raised in the Bay area and now lives in
Mesa, Arizona, with her family. She is a former

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.240
corporate manager and entrepreneur for over
a decade and spent a lot of time consulting

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:29.349
with companies like Cisco, HP, and Charles
Schwab. Pam's coached thousands of employees,

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:35.460
both in corporations and later, helping them
get out of those corporations and start their

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.110
own small businesses. She has one of the top
business and marketing blogs on the Internet,

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:49.830
Escape from Cubicle Nation. And her book of
the same name came out last spring in 2009

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.760
and was voted The Small Business Book of the
Year. Fun fact about Pam is that she also

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.240
spent 15 years training, teaching and coaching
martial arts and spent ten of those years

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.640
working with gang members in the Mission District
of San Francisco. So please give a warm welcome

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.490
to Pamela Slim.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.670
[applause]

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.740
&gt;&gt;Pam: Well, thank you. These days I couldn't
do much, but it's a good thing for an intro

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.840
to a presentation in case anybody challenges
me. I can always play that card.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.840
[Pam laughs]

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.840
[Pam clears throat]

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.030
So, thanks so much for having me. I'm really
excited to be here back at home, as Jenny

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.350
is saying. I was born and raised here in the
Bay area. And one of the interesting things,

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.040
I think, for context for this talk, I'm, I
love Twitter. How many of you are on Twitter?

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.740
Any social media users? Ok. So, when I was
mentioning to people that I was coming out

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.380
to Google, it was very interesting to hear
the kind of comments that I got back. Most

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:55.060
of them were, "Why in the world would Google
bring you, Escape from Cubicle Nation lady,

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.250
inside their company to talk to their employees?"
Right? It sounds like kind of a crazy idea.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.100
And the, the analogy that I thought of is
if I sent my husband away with Salma Hayek

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.131
for the weekend. It's just, I mean, why, why
would I ever do that?

00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:09.590
[audience laughter]

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.230
The idea, knowing my husband the way that
I know him and knowing Google the way that

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.190
I know of you, is it actually is the most
sane thing in world, I think nowadays, that

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:28.370
we start to talk very openly about the new
world of work. We are no longer in a work

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.200
environment where you're only going to be
an employee in your career or you're only

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.990
gonna be an entrepreneur.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.040
For some of you, you might already be working
on plans on side hustles already; things that

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.140
you're getting going on the side. Some of
you might have come from smaller businesses

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.099
and you're, you're staying some time here.
Some of you may want to be staying here a

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.980
long time, which is great, in building a whole
career, but maybe moving around a lot as you

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.930
actually go through that process of transition.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.900
So one of the things that I love the most
now about writing openly at Escape from Cubicle

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.640
Nation, is I can really talk about the things
that I found were going on in people's minds

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:14.230
when I was consulting here for so many years.
And I think that a lot of it is related to,

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.060
kind of comes back to dating, right? Everything
can come back to dating analogies. So, if

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.319
any of you are on the market or you ever have
been--I'm happily married now--but you know

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.230
that desperation is usually not a very good
way to be attracting somebody. The more secure

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.099
you are, the more you know yourself, the more
you're truly just interested in meeting somebody

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:40.209
else, the more you're going to really be attracting
quality people. And that, I think, is what's

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.810
really true for companies. So, a secure company
that has an amazing history, that's doing

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.900
really amazing work, that has really smart
people working for it, has nothing to worry

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.900
about.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.599
If, if people were worried that those of you
sitting right here in the middle of Silicon

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:01.730
Valley didn't know how to start a company,
that's, there's no way that I can teach you

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.860
that in an hour. You probably already know
you're connected through your networks with

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.879
people who are. So the key is, is to really
look at what is a common framework that you

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:15.349
can use that's going to apply, whether or
not you're in a company or you're, you decide

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:19.829
to go it on your own. And a lot of it is really
related to your quality of life.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.770
So, when I really saw a lot of this happening
 -- a lot more open dialogue about the new

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.880
world of work was in 2009. And I know, for
me, it was during a time when I saw the picture

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.070
of the Lehman Brothers employee coming out.
Do you remember that? When he had his stuff

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.639
in a cardboard box. I think it was on the
cover of the Wall Street Journal and that

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.550
was a moment, personally, where I went, "Ooh,
things are really different now." Do you guys

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.490
have a similar memory? Was there any moment
you had during the whole economic crash where

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.810
you remembered when things are not the same?
I don't know if you have a memory from that

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.580
time. For me, it really was the Lehman Brothers.
I don't know the kind of waves that were going

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:04.050
through here, but what I knew at that time
was that we were never going to be making

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.820
the same assumptions again because of the
creative destruction that we've had in the

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:09.820
economy.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.830
I actually think of it as a really, really,
good, healthy thing. I have personally lived

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.220
through some really difficult challenges.
My husband has a construction business in

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.020
Phoenix, Arizona, but if you what's going
on in the last couple of years in Phoenix,

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:28.380
Arizona, we've had tremendous strain. The
whole market crashed and, at the same time,

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.610
it's, it was really unsustainable. There were
things about the way in which we were working

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.250
that was really not sustainable.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.270
So what happened when our economy crashed--

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.340
[clears throat]

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:44.180
is that all of a sudden we realized that we're
all self-employed; every single one of us.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.150
No matter how you work, if you're an employee,
if you're a contractor, if you have your own

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.229
business, we're all self-employed. Nothing
is guaranteed. So this actually provides,

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:59.449
I think, a lot of liberation, a lot of opportunity,
a lot of ways to really think strategically

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:05.061
about your career, a lot of ways you can think
about managing others where you don't have

00:06:05.061 --> 00:06:11.370
to worry about trying to keep somebody anywhere
by force; knowing that everybody has free

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.919
will and there' a lot of different options
for how people move.

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:19.400
So knowing that, there are some frameworks
and ways I think you can manage your career

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.229
that are gonna be really helpful for you.
So the first is the context of this talk.

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:30.320
And it actually came when I was having a conversation
with my best friend and her daughter is in

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.300
high school. She's a junior in high school
and she's getting ready to go away to college.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:40.030
And she enrolled in a nail technician class
and my best friend was a little bit dismayed

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.360
by this because she's like, she's professional,
she's worked for her whole career and she

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.480
thought, "I've really raised you to go to
college and I'm not quite sure what this new

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:54.100
career you're talking about." And her daughter
goes, "Mom, that's my side hustle. That's

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:59.039
what I'm gonna use when I'm in college when
I need to make some money." And her mom went

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:04.940
from feeling a little dismayed and concerned
to feeling overwhelmingly proud of her daughter

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:10.180
for really thinking in a smart way about how
to, how to generate money and have a side

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.180
hustle.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:17.490
And this is a term that I'm using a lot now
in, in the place where I operate, talking

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:22.539
with tens of thousands of employees from all
over the world each year through my blog.

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:26.660
Many, many, many, many people have a side
hustle. Now we're recording this, so I won't

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.940
ask you all to raise your hand to see how
many of you have a side hustle. I would imagine

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:37.670
in a group of smart people, that I hope you
do. It's really the wave of the future is

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:41.390
a lot of people are working on a side project,
or maybe you have a thought for something

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:45.470
you really love to do that you generate a
little bit of income on the side. Or maybe

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.080
you're have a vision for a start-up that's
a couple years down the road and you're working

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.080
on that.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.980
So, the side hustle, I think, is something
that everybody everywhere should always be

00:07:54.980 --> 00:08:00.160
thinking about. It's really what is something
that's the root of my passion that I'm highly

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.940
interested in, that I can begin to test and
try in little ways on the side to see if it

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:10.110
has viability. It's, it's something where
you, you can tell me if I'm accurate in making

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:14.410
the correlation here, but some of the projects
that might be worked on with the 20 percent

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:19.110
time that you have here, to me are akin to
a side hustle. Its like, "This, this is a

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:23.590
really cool idea. I wanna try it. I wanna
see if it works. I'm not sure, but I wanna

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:28.670
put a little bit of resource to it." And so
having that perspective, it keeps you stretching,

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:35.639
it keeps you growing. For many of the people
I run into all the time on my blog or as a

00:08:35.639 --> 00:08:39.959
coach, they're people who lose their jobs
and really need to rely on their side hustle

00:08:39.959 --> 00:08:43.529
as a way to provide for themselves and their
family.

00:08:43.529 --> 00:08:48.769
So, it's a thought of instead of thinking
in terms of one career path, where you go

00:08:48.769 --> 00:08:53.540
to school and you become an engineer and you
work only in that career path for a corporation,

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:59.040
you can also have other interesting side hustles.
Some of my clients raise alpacas at the same

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:06.759
time as being financialanalysts. People have,
they make spicy almond toffee at the same

00:09:06.759 --> 00:09:11.649
time of being an HR professional. So a lot
of people have very interesting, different

00:09:11.649 --> 00:09:16.420
kinds of side hustles. And definitely, a lot
of engineers that I know have side hustles

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:20.279
with projects that they're working on to see
if they have some traction--it's what keeps

00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:23.499
you fresh and really engaged.

00:09:23.499 --> 00:09:31.610
So in order to understand what might be good
avenues to explore--good side hustles to explore--there's

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.509
a concept that I learned from Martha Beck.
If anybody knows Martha Beck, she wrote a

00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:41.009
book called Finding Your Own North Star, and
she's actually who I train with as a coach.

00:09:41.009 --> 00:09:45.420
And she talks about our two selves: our essential
and our social selves.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:51.850
So, our essential self is essential in that
it's our essence. It is the core of who we

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:55.889
are. How many of you are parents here? Are
there any parents in the room? Ok. If you

00:09:55.889 --> 00:09:58.889
remember, I have a two year old actually here
on the campus. You might see them running

00:09:58.889 --> 00:10:02.579
around, but if you remember, is your child
older than two now?

00:10:02.579 --> 00:10:04.230
&gt;&gt;female member #1: Six, four and two.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:08.709
&gt;&gt;Pam: Ok. Six, four and two. So you're really
into the essential self. Two year olds have

00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:14.160
no filter, right? Whatever it is that they're
feeling they express it right away. And actually,

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:20.839
all of still have that essential self inside.
What happens over time is you, we learn, we're

00:10:20.839 --> 00:10:25.540
shaped by school, we're shaped by our parents,
we're shaped by the places where we work,

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:33.670
the media, in order to play a certain role
to be effective. And I know that in many corporations,

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:37.699
it's really not safe at all to speak up with
your essential self voice.

00:10:37.699 --> 00:10:38.879
Not here, of course.

00:10:38.879 --> 00:10:39.879
[Pam laughs]

00:10:39.879 --> 00:10:44.139
But I would imagine, I know many places I've
been, people inside are screaming, "I have

00:10:44.139 --> 00:10:48.699
to get out of this meeting and there's 345
PowerPoint slides for a one hour presentation."

00:10:48.699 --> 00:10:53.139
And, "I can't believe we're going through
another reorganization," says the essential

00:10:53.139 --> 00:10:59.459
self. The social self says, "Be quiet, smile,
pretend like everything's ok." Now, we need

00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:04.619
both. We need the essential and the social
selves in order to walk through life, right?

00:11:04.619 --> 00:11:11.079
So one analogy is, your essential self might
really be drawn to medicine and your social

00:11:11.079 --> 00:11:13.999
self will actually get you through medical
school and everything that's required for

00:11:13.999 --> 00:11:19.709
that, right? What happens though is you begin
to plan your life and your career, is it's

00:11:19.709 --> 00:11:24.329
really easy to get sidetracked by the social
self. And this is where you have thoughts

00:11:24.329 --> 00:11:29.069
that, "What's wrong with me? I'm working in
a great place," or, "I have what I thought

00:11:29.069 --> 00:11:33.600
was the perfect job and I'm making a great
salary and I like the people around me, but

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:38.499
I'm just not happy. There's something here
that's missing." And that's really the essential

00:11:38.499 --> 00:11:42.730
self voice. The social self might say, "There's
really something wrong with you because you're

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:46.470
not happy." And sometimes parents say that.
Being a parent--

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:47.480
[clears throat]

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:52.679
sometimes that's how parents can shape you,
with good reason, wanting to be supportive,

00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:58.639
wanting to really help you make good choices.
The problem is, is that when you're only driving

00:11:58.639 --> 00:12:04.170
your career decisions by your social self,
by what you think is the right thing to do

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:10.100
or the socially acceptable thing to do, it
can really lead to a lot of personal misery.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:14.139
And so, the key is really tapping in and listening
to your essential self. Your essential self

00:12:14.139 --> 00:12:18.399
speaks usually through your body. If, if you've
ever been in a time, maybe in school where

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:22.939
you're really stressed out and your body starts
to give out on you or you're really in a bad

00:12:22.939 --> 00:12:27.920
situation, a bad relationship, a bad job,
you notice that your body really reacts in

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.819
a negative way. And the same thing is true
in a positive way.

00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:37.350
So, using the essential and social selves
are really critical to begin to shape a picture

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:43.629
of what it is that you really want. And the
best way that I think of to do that is by

00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:47.679
creating a life plan. And a life plan, I just
have a number of different categories here

00:12:47.679 --> 00:12:52.470
of different topics you can look at, but your
life plan really, you can first look at it

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:58.549
that's really aside from anything to do with
your current work. So you could say, if you

00:12:58.549 --> 00:13:04.249
look into the future sometime, maybe five
years from now, what would your life look

00:13:04.249 --> 00:13:08.600
like? So, where would you live? What would
your home be like? What would your physical

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:12.910
home be like? Where do you actually wanna
live? What would your neighborhood be like?

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:16.619
What kind, what's the quality of relationships
that you have? What are your friendships like?

00:13:16.619 --> 00:13:20.449
Are you in a relationship? Are you not? Do
you have kids? Do you not?

00:13:20.449 --> 00:13:25.139
Begin to really flesh out and define the specific
characteristics of really what would make

00:13:25.139 --> 00:13:29.999
your essential self feel happy. And this is
why, when you're doing this exercise, it's

00:13:29.999 --> 00:13:35.269
really important to not worry about what you
think you should want, but rather to really

00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:40.709
tune in, to what actually does make you happy.
So, things like work content, when you're

00:13:40.709 --> 00:13:45.859
in the flow, when you're truly energized and
you're doing exciting work, what are you doing?

00:13:45.859 --> 00:13:51.459
What's the nature of the work? Who are people
who are exceptionally energizing to be around,

00:13:51.459 --> 00:13:57.999
and why is it? I, I love, for some reason,
I, have nothing to do with software, I'm not

00:13:57.999 --> 00:14:02.919
an engineer at all, but I love to work around
high-tech companies. There's something about

00:14:02.919 --> 00:14:07.290
that that I know, when I'm in that kind of
environment, I'm going to be happy. And so

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:11.759
as you begin to go through your career, you
pay attention to that and you notice: What

00:14:11.759 --> 00:14:16.619
are these specific characteristics? What is
it about a certain person that actually gets

00:14:16.619 --> 00:14:21.850
you excited? What is it about a certain kind
of work content that gets you excited?

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:27.100
And also looking at things like your financial
life. What would be the picture of your finances

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:32.809
if you could really set it up the way that
you wanted to? And so when you create this

00:14:32.809 --> 00:14:38.559
picture--this vision-- of how you want your
life to look, that then becomes the framework

00:14:38.559 --> 00:14:44.160
and the blueprint for how you make choices
about your career. So, at different times

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.589
of your life, it might look a little bit differently,
right?

00:14:47.589 --> 00:14:51.929
When I was younger, when I was in my twenties
and early thirties and I wasn't married, didn't

00:14:51.929 --> 00:14:56.240
have any kids, it, I loved to travel all the
time. I was always for work. I was working

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.519
all the time, as Jenny said, I had my day
job when I would work inside corporations.

00:15:00.519 --> 00:15:05.980
I'd run off to the martial arts studio, change
into my clothes, work out all night. I was

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:10.389
a maniac in my twenties and thirties and I
loved it that way. It totally fit with my

00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:15.679
life plan at that time. Now, when I have little
ones at home, that doesn't fit. And so I've

00:15:15.679 --> 00:15:20.939
really designed my business and my work to
be more work that I could do mainly from home

00:15:20.939 --> 00:15:25.540
and my own small office, where I can spend
a lot more time with my kids. So it's not

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:30.339
like you have one life plan that you set and
then that becomes the plan that you're always

00:15:30.339 --> 00:15:34.359
working towards; it will change and evolve
as you go through time.

00:15:34.359 --> 00:15:41.309
I don't, how many of you have read Good to
Great by Jim Collins? You read Good to Great?

00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:44.949
Jim is a totally riveting speaker. I love
to hear him speak. I heard him in Phoenix

00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:52.310
in the year 2000 and he talks about the sweet
spot in his book, which is the intersection

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:58.290
of three circles. So it's, that which you
love--for me it's like, John Legend and Martial

00:15:58.290 --> 00:15:59.290
Arts--

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:00.290
[Pam laughs]

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:03.790
I just, passions that are just things you
like; you're interested in, that which people

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:09.059
will pay you to do--so marketable skills that
you have-- and then a term which he uses which

00:16:09.059 --> 00:16:13.949
is called, "What are you genetically encoded
to do?" Which could also be, maybe, what's

00:16:13.949 --> 00:16:19.119
your mission in life, or what's your purpose?
The "genetically encoded to do" part is one

00:16:19.119 --> 00:16:24.199
that actually takes a lot of insight and thought.
He, in his own process, he described that

00:16:24.199 --> 00:16:29.199
it took him about 15 years of carrying around
a notebook and making notes about what actually

00:16:29.199 --> 00:16:34.490
interested him. He called it a "bug called
gym." And he observed himself, much as if

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:39.309
you were a scientist observing a bug, and
would notice what where those moments when

00:16:39.309 --> 00:16:45.569
he was really on fire. What were those conditions
in his life that made things really exciting?

00:16:45.569 --> 00:16:49.179
And so when you do that, when you start to
get that picture, the intersection of those

00:16:49.179 --> 00:16:53.649
three circles is your sweet spot. That, that
really becomes your work; the work that you're

00:16:53.649 --> 00:16:54.869
really meant to do.

00:16:54.869 --> 00:16:59.629
And then, when you get that work, and you
combine it with the kind of lifestyle that

00:16:59.629 --> 00:17:02.459
you want, you're living where you want to
live, you're around the kind of people that

00:17:02.459 --> 00:17:09.350
you want to, that's where things become highly
enjoyable. My, my philosophy about work is

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:16.189
it should be enjoyable while you are doing
it, not just reaping the benefits from doing

00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:20.789
your work or from getting a paycheck. I love
to work hard. I've worked since I was 12.

00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:26.829
There's, I love to work and I love to enjoy
what I'm doing while I'm working. That's where

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:31.210
things flow. That's where your health is better.
That's where you can wake up and be excited

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:35.220
just to look outside and see the sun rise.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:40.169
So, the context is really thinking about the
big picture of your life as the blueprint

00:17:40.169 --> 00:17:46.279
for design. Otherwise, it becomes more, the
metaphor that I used in my book was like an

00:17:46.279 --> 00:17:50.350
ill-fitting shoe. Have you guys ever seen
Shoewawa, which is a blog about shoes? They

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:52.519
have an ugly shoe of the week feature--

00:17:52.519 --> 00:17:53.519
[Pam laughs]

00:17:53.519 --> 00:17:57.970
and this was an ugly shoe; one of the worst
shoes of 2009, which is my personal favorite.

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:04.769
It actually has a fish tank in the heel with
a leopard skin shoe. It's just really awful.

00:18:04.769 --> 00:18:10.610
And this, in some cases, is what people can
feel like--I'm sure there's one person where

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:16.039
this would be the perfect pair of shoes, right?
The perfect setup for them, but it's an example

00:18:16.039 --> 00:18:21.250
where if you happen to be in a situation where
your social self, your friends, your family

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:25.460
say, "But that's the perfect situation. Why
don't you like that job? You just said you

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:29.679
wanted it, you went there, why don't you like
it?" It may be because it's just an ill-fitting

00:18:29.679 --> 00:18:34.210
shoe. It would be a perfect shoe for somebody
else; it's not the shoe for you. It doesn't

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:39.539
fit with the particular conditions that really
make you happy and make you flourish.

00:18:39.539 --> 00:18:44.000
So, you're the one that really needs to be
thinking about that. What are those conditions?

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.610
And to be able to name it and say, "This is
what I want. These are the kinds of people

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:54.000
that I really want to have around me." Which
is, to me, a really key part of the whole

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
process.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:01.929
So, one way to think about it if you are in
a situation where you are, looking at today,

00:19:01.929 --> 00:19:06.760
you may have a couple elements of what your
ideal life is. If this were to be your ideal

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.990
life where everything and all the boxes were
checked off, you're living where you wanna

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:13.799
live, you're making the kind of money, you're
doing the kind of work that you wanna do,

00:19:13.799 --> 00:19:18.990
maybe you have just a couple of those elements
right now that's going on in your life. So

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:23.409
as you think about what the next step may
be as you get yourself prepared for the next

00:19:23.409 --> 00:19:28.639
job, as you think about. Does anybody have
an example that I could work with? Like, anybody

00:19:28.639 --> 00:19:33.440
have a little bit of a longer term goal of
some kind of work that you wanna do, or maybe

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:37.610
being in a different location? Would anybody
be brave enough to give me a live example

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:41.350
of something that would be cool to work into
your life plan? Let's work a real example

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:43.100
here.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:50.620
You guys could be brave, right? No? He's shaking
his head. Just for career, you guys do career

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:56.700
planning, right? Have you thought about some
cool things to do? Can I pick on you since

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:57.929
you're in the front row? Up.

00:19:57.929 --> 00:20:00.530
&gt;&gt;audience member #2: Sure.

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:01.530
&gt;&gt;Pam: Ok.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.370
&gt;&gt;audience member #2: Career plan?

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:08.631
&gt;&gt;Pam: Yeah, like, let's say five years down
the road. Is there anything, something that

00:20:08.631 --> 00:20:10.560
would just be really fun and interesting to
do?

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:15.159
&gt;&gt;audience member #2: It would be fun to work
in an international office.

00:20:15.159 --> 00:20:17.360
&gt;&gt;Pam: Excellent. Work in an internat-, anywhere
in particular?

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.921
&gt;&gt;audience member #2: How about Zurich?

00:20:18.921 --> 00:20:22.490
&gt;&gt;Pam: Zurich. Ok. I lived in Neuchatel; I
was in Switzerland for a year, so it's a great

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:28.529
place to be. So, you have an office in Zurich,
is that right? Ok. So, if I were you, right?

00:20:28.529 --> 00:20:32.470
As you're thinking about right now, you're
here, you're based in the US, you have a plan

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:36.261
down the road maybe to go to Zurich. Part
of the way you're gonna be thinking about

00:20:36.261 --> 00:20:40.659
navigating through your experience, through
your work, is first knowing, what's the work

00:20:40.659 --> 00:20:45.669
going on in Zurich, right? Who are the people
there? How could you begin to build relationships?

00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:50.909
You might find for the next step in your career
path that you could learn a critical skill

00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:54.730
that's gonna position you really well for
the work that's being done in Zurich, right?

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:59.990
Or, you have the opportunity to volunteer
to head up a project that's made up of people

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:05.159
who work with the staff in the Zurich office;
something like that. So, you're always thinking

00:21:05.159 --> 00:21:09.160
about what are ways that you can be really
working on developing particular skills, or

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:14.250
resources, in order to get closer to your
picture of the ideal life.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:17.710
And then, then next step that you might take
in your career, you might hit a couple other

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:21.850
of those elements, which end up in the big
picture, really giving you what it is that

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:27.669
you want. The key is where you have an idea
about what are you really working towards?

00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:34.899
What are these particular skills, resources,
people, connections that you wanna make in

00:21:34.899 --> 00:21:36.750
order to get where you wanna go?

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:41.390
And what I find a lot in my work as a career
coach and now a start-up coach is a lot of

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:46.169
people just kind of look to the future and
just look for opportunities out of the air,

00:21:46.169 --> 00:21:50.129
which is very cool. I like to do that myself--
to look for serendipity, for synchronicity,

00:21:50.129 --> 00:21:56.330
and a lot of cool people can cross your path.
When you put things out very clearly and you

00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:01.840
say, "I want to meet Seth Godin and I wanna
talk to him about marketing." I'm a big Seth

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:08.240
Godin fan, personally. So, when you say that,
you are much more likely to have that happen,

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:12.210
when you begin to notice, where does Seth
hang out in person? Where does he hang out

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:15.640
online? Oh, he's speaking at this event. Why
don't I do there? Why don't I meet him and

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:19.440
shake his hand? And all of a sudden, a lot
of things can really start to happen in that

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.580
direction.

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:25.309
So the key is to be really conscious about
what are your goals and how can you meet them.

00:22:25.309 --> 00:22:30.720
And as you, in particular, looking at some
financial goals, that's where you can be working

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:35.899
on, particular nuggets at a time, being very
thrifty. I'm looking at Jenny, who's written

00:22:35.899 --> 00:22:41.080
a lot about that topic of really being effective
with your money, really utilizing it well,

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:46.379
investing well, saving well, so that you know
you need to have that nugget in order to reach

00:22:46.379 --> 00:22:50.540
your overall plans. So that's really the key,
I think, in terms of looking at your life

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.360
plan.

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:56.531
The, the key philosophy for a lot of the things
that you're gonna try, is to test often and

00:22:56.531 --> 00:23:02.040
fail fast. The first time that you try a new
thing, maybe, maybe you wanna go and spend

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:06.690
one week in the Zurich office, which I think
would be much better than trying to lobby

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:10.860
to actually get a job there and end up arriving
and finding out that it's really not the best

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:16.620
fit for you. So, you wanna look for little,
tiny ways that you can be chipping away. There's,

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:19.909
I don't know how many of you know of PBwiki?
Do you guys know that company here? It was

00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:25.570
founded by Ramit Sethi, whose blog is I Will
Teach you to be Rich. And what he talked about

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:31.740
when he first started PBwiki with David Weeks,
his friend, they had a Gmail account, which

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:37.259
was like "supportpbwiki.com," and they put
out a prototype. They had a Super Happy Dev

00:23:37.259 --> 00:23:42.059
party, where they got, in 24 hours, a bunch
of engineers together, a couple cases of Red

00:23:42.059 --> 00:23:48.100
Bull and some pizza and they came up with
a prototype in 24 hours of the first PBwiki.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:52.360
They released it within 48 hours. They had
a thousand users signed up and him and David

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:56.240
were just sitting there monitoring the Gmail
account for any kind of changes that would

00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:01.179
come in, and real time they were making changes
to the code and fixing it as they went along.

00:24:01.179 --> 00:24:06.669
It's now grown to being much more of a mid-size
company, but that's a perfect example to me

00:24:06.669 --> 00:24:11.509
of testing often and failing fast. Ramit says
that in the time that they started that, they

00:24:11.509 --> 00:24:16.100
had a whiteboard of about nine different ideas
of what they wanted to work on and they systematically

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:20.850
went down and did some of these tests. What
they found with that particular product is

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:25.370
that it actually had a lot of interest and
they went with it. They followed it and then,

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:29.029
in many ways, they really built the market,
they built the infrastructure, after they

00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:30.980
had already done the test.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:35.370
So for some people that have come within a
corporate environment where there's not so

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:40.029
much flexibility, that can feel a little bit
uncomfortable. If you're testing often, and

00:24:40.029 --> 00:24:44.279
especially the failing fast, which is why
I like to take things in little, tiny bit,

00:24:44.279 --> 00:24:49.610
right? Little, little, tiny pieces. What's
something you can do in order to learn something

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:55.529
really quickly, or test a particular part
of a product, or if you wanna be a speaker,

00:24:55.529 --> 00:25:00.000
if you wanna be a writer, write one blog post
as opposed to going to shop to New York and

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.429
try to get a deal with a big publisher. So
the key is really being fast and flexible

00:25:04.429 --> 00:25:05.970
in testing.

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:10.370
The other key which I found, is really, really
critical. It's been very important for me,

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:16.090
is who it is that you have around you. And
I think about a number of different kinds

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:21.950
of people that I classify first as your posse,
your, your kind of creative posse that are

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:28.340
people around you that are highly intelligent,
who are highly supportive, who are highly

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:35.320
driven. Sometimes, your posse, you can find
around you at work and sometimes not. I find

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:39.129
it's really healthy often to be connected
with other people that are outside of your

00:25:39.129 --> 00:25:44.679
work environment just so that you get other
perspectives and your posse is really critical

00:25:44.679 --> 00:25:48.690
to give that personal support when you're
testing often and failing fast, when you're

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:52.990
trying things and it might not always work.
You want to have people you can call on that

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:58.169
are gonna give you really objective feedback
about what you're doing and then they're also

00:25:58.169 --> 00:26:02.450
gonna expect the same thing from you. And
it's a really, really critical thing. I have

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:06.880
my own posse now in the work that I do of
people that are in my same field, and in some

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:11.760
ways we could be classified as direct competitors,
but we see it as we're all working toward

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:15.980
trying to do good things in the market. And
it can be good for business and it can also

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:18.320
be good personally.

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:22.769
Mentors can be very specific people that are
maybe technical mentors that have particular

00:26:22.769 --> 00:26:27.779
expertise. Some people may be leadership mentors;
somebody you can go to for advice about your

00:26:27.779 --> 00:26:32.000
life or about your career path. And often,
you want to have a variety of different kinds

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.700
of mentors to, to supplement and support what
you're doing. Your High Council of Jedi Knights

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:42.870
are which I, I really wish that I, I would
have access to sometimes, who are people who

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:48.860
you really, really identify with and you imagine
that you could be in that moment where, in

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:55.260
the dark side of the force is coming in to
get you and you can have a place to go where

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:59.610
people whom you really admire are there to
give you advice. And my own High Council of

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:07.289
Jedi Knights I have some people who I, I know
and some people who I don't know. The, an

00:27:07.289 --> 00:27:11.509
example I was just saying, in looking at the
way that people can have different roles within

00:27:11.509 --> 00:27:15.080
your life, or your different circles, your
mom's the one who will throw herself in front

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:19.750
of a train to save you, right? Your trolls
will throw you under the train at the first

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:24.740
sign of weakness. Your mentor's gonna warn
you to stay off the tracks and your posse's

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.110
gonna drag the troll back under the bridge,
right?

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:31.559
You need to have all of these people around
you in order to be really supporting your

00:27:31.559 --> 00:27:39.499
efforts and to have some circles of support.
The High Council concept is one, for me, where

00:27:39.499 --> 00:27:42.570
I often look at it--I don't know if any of
you recognize some of these folks here. You

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:47.799
saw Seth, who I talked about. Cathy Sierra,
who I adore, does a lot of writing about technology

00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:53.894
who doesn't write anymore on her blog, but
the way I look at my High Council are people

00:27:53.894 --> 00:27:57.210
who, my criteria for High Council are not
just people who are really smart and very

00:27:57.210 --> 00:28:04.009
accomplished, but who also live according
to the kinds of values that I also share personally.

00:28:04.009 --> 00:28:09.389
So, it would be the kind of person that I
would be comfortable having watch my kids,

00:28:09.389 --> 00:28:12.539
in addition to getting business advice from.

00:28:12.539 --> 00:28:17.289
Now, the thing about the High Council, which
I really encourage you to do, is sometimes

00:28:17.289 --> 00:28:22.070
you can have people on your High Council who
might not seem like they're attainable, or

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:26.539
they're too far out of reach or they wouldn't
want anything to do with you. In my own experience,

00:28:26.539 --> 00:28:32.730
in my experience working with a lot of clients,
it is amazing what happens when you actually

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:37.950
identify people who may seem to be too famous
and out of your reach to be on your High Council.

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:41.909
It's amazing how often you can begin to build
personal relationships with them. That, to

00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:47.129
me, is one of the examples of the power of
social media where we're really just one quick

00:28:47.129 --> 00:28:52.049
link or one quick tweet often from people
who we really admire. And that's been my own,

00:28:52.049 --> 00:28:55.710
my own path in the way that I really started
my own business.

00:28:55.710 --> 00:29:02.059
When I moved from just doing work as a consultant
and wanted to work as helping employees leave

00:29:02.059 --> 00:29:07.419
and start a business, I didn't obviously want
to tap into my old network, right? Because

00:29:07.419 --> 00:29:11.029
it wouldn't be very ethical to go back to
companies who paid me to retain employees

00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:16.559
and try to get those same employees to leave.
So, I started writing my blog and I was writing

00:29:16.559 --> 00:29:20.769
a post one night. I called it "An Open Letter
to CEOs Across the World." It was a bit of

00:29:20.769 --> 00:29:26.429
a rant the way companies are led and I, at
that point, had maybe a hundred visitors to

00:29:26.429 --> 00:29:31.909
my blog; my dad, my sister, my best friend
and a few people who found me over Google.

00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:37.869
And I sent a message to Guy Kawasaki. Some
of you might know Garage Technology Ventures,

00:29:37.869 --> 00:29:42.419
and I just thought me might be interested
in the post. So I sent him an email and ten

00:29:42.419 --> 00:29:46.769
minutes later he responded back, which just
completely shocked me and amazed me. The next

00:29:46.769 --> 00:29:52.240
day, he blogged about it. This was in 2006,
and all of a sudden I had this gigantic wave

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:57.710
of visitors--about 20 thousand people who
were hitting my blog-- and within a week,

00:29:57.710 --> 00:30:03.629
it was a really powerful message to me about
not waiting to build up enough traffic to

00:30:03.629 --> 00:30:09.110
then begin to approach somebody I saw. That
when you just begin to do your good work,

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:12.899
you do work within your sweet spot and you
connect with people on your High Council of

00:30:12.899 --> 00:30:16.950
Jedi Knights, you might as well go direct.
You never know what's gonna happen.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:21.330
I've seen it over and over and over again,
where people end up building relationships

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:25.419
with venture capitalists or they end up getting
fantastic jobs because they're not afraid,

00:30:25.419 --> 00:30:29.649
within a corporation, to talk to the people
with whom they want to talk to. That's about

00:30:29.649 --> 00:30:36.019
really you standing in your own power with
your own backbone and really just building

00:30:36.019 --> 00:30:40.240
relationships with people that you want to
build relationships with. So, if you haven't

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:45.960
already, think about who your High Council
is. Look for people. If you don't have a High

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:50.899
Council, then start to look. What are the
qualities and characteristics of people who

00:30:50.899 --> 00:30:54.960
you really want to aspire to be like? Where
are they? Where are they hanging out? What's

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:59.369
their own path in life, which then you can
also learn from in order to move your own

00:30:59.369 --> 00:31:00.379
career forward.

00:31:00.379 --> 00:31:07.480
&gt;&gt;audience member #3: What's the difference
between mentors and High Council? Is it just

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.220
that mentors are people you already know?&gt;Pam:
The question was, "What's the difference between

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:14.110
mentors and High Council members? And is it
just that mentors are people that you know?"

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:19.450
I, sometimes mentors can definitely be High
Council members. The way I personally think

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:23.759
about it is a mentor is usually more accessible;
it might be somebody at work, it might be

00:31:23.759 --> 00:31:28.610
somebody that's well known in their technical
field. But High Council members often are

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:34.029
really, really have made tremendous progress
within their own field. Again, in all areas

00:31:34.029 --> 00:31:38.519
of life. So, I don't wanna, can I pick on
Larry Ellison? I don't really wanna pick on

00:31:38.519 --> 00:31:43.419
Larry Ellison, but for example, he might be
a great mentor to learn certain things from

00:31:43.419 --> 00:31:48.210
about business, right? Based on what he knows.
Personally, he would not be somebody that

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:53.720
I would choose as a mentor for how to really
set up an effective life, right? Because I

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:59.000
don't necessarily share, share values or agree
on the way in which he runs his life and,

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.210
at the same time, I think he's done some really
cool things on the business side and can probably

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:08.119
be an interesting person to learn from. So,
some people mix that. For me, personally,

00:32:08.119 --> 00:32:15.320
it's people who have more Yoda-like characteristics
that you really feel like you're getting maybe

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:20.710
a little bit almost more spiritual guidance,
depending upon whatever framework you have.

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:24.509
It's more that people who you know you can
really count on, who really have your back

00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:28.600
and have actually gone through the fire themselves.
They've really pushed themselves personally

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:32.929
and professionally.

00:32:32.929 --> 00:32:39.049
The, I think a lot of, a lot of what we're
seeing, which again, brings me great joy is

00:32:39.049 --> 00:32:45.429
that weirdos like all of us, if I may include
you in that group, companies that are really

00:32:45.429 --> 00:32:49.239
doing things differently, that are not afraid
to talk about the truth about what's really

00:32:49.239 --> 00:32:54.570
going on in people's minds. People that are
working on side hustles, people that are not

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:58.830
afraid to really be talking openly about what's
going on in their life, like we've seen a

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:03.210
lot within blogging that's really changed
dynamics of conversations, the way that companies

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:09.820
are talking to each other, the way that they're
talking to their customers and clients. I

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:13.440
think that weirdos -- this is a term that
my friend Charlie Gilkey uses often -- he

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:17.710
calls it the weirdo syndrome, where, if you're
the kind of person that wants to make meaning

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:22.190
and you wanna have a good life and you're
bucking a little bit against convention for

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:26.379
people that say, "Just choose a career and
stay in the company and stay there for a long

00:33:26.379 --> 00:33:30.360
time," you can really feel like a weirdo.
You can feel a little bit out of sorts, like

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:34.549
there's something wrong with you. What I wanna
really reinforce is that there's nothing wrong

00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:39.280
with you. It's actually the wave of the future,
of people who are highly creative, who are

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:45.230
working in, in unique and different ways,
are really what's going to create a really

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:48.260
positive, strong force; not just in business,
but I think also in society.

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:52.340
This is from Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer,
for those of you didn't, who haven't watched

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.960
that before. The Island of Misfit Toys who
are just my people.

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.379
[Pam laughs]

00:33:57.379 --> 00:34:02.821
One of the other key things I wanted to leave
you with is, is really to stay fresh. I think

00:34:02.821 --> 00:34:08.491
the core of innovation, we were actually just
talking about this earlier, the core of innovation

00:34:08.491 --> 00:34:14.480
is something I just learned about. This is
Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin and he just came

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:18.399
into Phoenix recently and I was reading an
article in the paper about the work that he's

00:34:18.399 --> 00:34:23.770
doing. And he is actively searching out all
the young, emerging artists; he has Emmylou

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:28.270
Harris. Who's the most interesting artist
to work with? Who should I be learning from

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:32.780
musically? He's reaching out to those artists
and doing shows with them, and he actually

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:38.109
is touring with the band named, "Band of Joy,"
which was the name of the band he was in when

00:34:38.109 --> 00:34:40.760
he was 17 or 18 years old.

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.549
And the way he described it in the interview
is he wanted to be really connected with the

00:34:45.549 --> 00:34:51.330
root of his passion by touring with that band
name, which I thought was so miraculous because

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:55.700
he probably would sell a few more tickets
if people know he was from Led Zeppelin, right?

00:34:55.700 --> 00:35:01.650
He has a lot more personal brand around that
name, but what he's really tapping into is

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:07.240
keeping fresh, tapping into the source of
his passion, staying with the younger generation

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:12.290
and not just trying to hold on to success
that he's had. And I think that's also a characteristic

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:17.030
for companies of not settling and really not
getting kind of stuck in a rut where you've

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:22.309
been really good and being afraid to engage
with the younger, hungrier companies or, or

00:35:22.309 --> 00:35:27.640
employees. So you really wanna stay fresh,
stay open and keep really pushing your, your

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:28.640
learning.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:32.549
The other thing is really about, about leading.
And this is something I remember I, when I

00:35:32.549 --> 00:35:39.859
used to do career development work here in,
it was like 1999, 2000. At that point, we

00:35:39.859 --> 00:35:43.329
were talking about career self-reliance and
how you can never count on one company in

00:35:43.329 --> 00:35:50.160
order to be leading your career. It is more
true now than ever. And when you're in a situation

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:54.819
where you're in that ill-fitting shoe -- where
things are not quite working right -- don't

00:35:54.819 --> 00:36:02.329
wait for somebody else to make the change.
Diagnose it, pay attention to where are things

00:36:02.329 --> 00:36:07.220
out of alignment? Where is your life plan
off whack? Maybe you're doing the right kind

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:11.020
of work, but you're not working with the right
kind of people. Maybe you're doing great work,

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:15.420
but you're not getting the right kind of compensation.
So when you know that, you're the one that

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:21.770
really can be working on those particular
tweaks and you're gonna be a lot more in power

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:25.370
and in control of your own career. Whenever
you're looking to somebody else to make a

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:30.740
decision about your career is where you really
start to lose power. And remember that you

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:35.540
have a lot of different options now. Knowing
we're all self-employed, you can look at different

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:39.910
ways in which you can be bringing certain
parts of this life plan into your, into your

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:42.430
work, work life.

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:47.290
It's probably the greatest change I see in
people, when they're in a situation--I get

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:53.610
a lot of messages from people who are disgruntled
in their cubicles, given the name of my blog--but

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:57.900
often, it's not the fault of the corporation,
it's the fact that they've totally given up

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:02.110
ownership for their own career. And once they
start to shift that, some people find that

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:06.210
they're actually happy once they evaluate
the situation and see the certain things are,

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:09.280
are actually working well.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:13.599
So, I'd love to open it up and, and see what,
what kind of questions that you might have

00:37:13.599 --> 00:37:20.700
about entrepreneurship or life plan; any,
any kind of questions. Bring 'em on. You've

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:31.310
been a quiet group so far. You can come up
to the microphone right here on the side.

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:32.310
All right, excellent.

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:38.839
&gt;&gt;audience member #4: Hi. Thank you so much
for coming today. It was an amazing talk.

00:37:38.839 --> 00:37:44.319
I'm curious to hear more about what set you
on the path of writing your book and sharing

00:37:44.319 --> 00:37:45.800
your message in your blog.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:51.119
&gt;&gt;Pam: Yes. What, what set me on my path was
actually all the work that I did within corporations

00:37:51.119 --> 00:37:57.049
for so long. I often was in this very capacity
of in companies here talking to employees

00:37:57.049 --> 00:38:01.130
about some kind of corporate initiative and
what I would find is--

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:02.130
[Pam clears throat]

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:06.369
I'm not sure if the same is true now, but
what I would often find is that there was

00:38:06.369 --> 00:38:10.770
this whole other dialogue that was going on
in the minds of employees as they were, as

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:15.700
I was addressing them on behalf of the corporation.
And the only way I would ever know is when

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:20.700
people would pull me aside after a talk and
they'd say, "I know I said that everything's

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:25.839
fine here; it's really not fine." "I really
can't stand my manager," or "I really don't

00:38:25.839 --> 00:38:31.460
like my job," or, "I really wanna start a
business and I have no idea how to do it."

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:35.250
And so that's really, it was like market research
for ten years going into lots of different

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:39.010
companies, which on the outside were very
successful, but I noticed that there were

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:43.440
a lot of people who, who really just didn't
feel happy and wanted to leave and start a

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:47.650
business. And the puzzling thing to me was
that there's tons of great books about starting

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:51.690
a business. Most of them have already been
written well before I even started my blog.

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:56.520
The difference is, what people didn't talk
about often, is the fear that accompanies

00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:01.460
making a big change. And so a lot of what
I started to write about was what happens

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:07.270
when you begin to go down the path of creating
a company when all the doubts and the fear

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:11.960
of, "Am I good enough? Am I smart enough?
Will people like me? Is my product good? Who

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:16.520
are my mentors? I've been here my whole career,
how can I start to build my network?" Those

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:20.940
were more things about fear that came up,
so that was really the gist of it. And I started

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:24.780
writing my blog, couple years after I started
writing it is when my publisher approached

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:28.359
me about doing a book. And I also had been
working with a lot of individuals who are

00:39:28.359 --> 00:39:32.650
actually making that transition and that's
how, and that's how it came about. Yes.

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:37.800
&gt;&gt;audience member #5: You say you were a personal
coach, right? [inaudible]

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:38.800
&gt;&gt;Pam: Yes.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:43.250
&gt;&gt;audience member #5: Do you have any success
stories about people [inaudible]

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:47.130
&gt;&gt;Pam: Yes. So, the question is, "I'm a coach
so do I have success stories about people

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:52.069
who have started a business?" I have a lot
of success stories. I am massively, massively

00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:57.380
proud of, of my clients. They've, they've
done their own work. I have people who have

00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:02.190
done everything from left high-level jobs,
one of my current clients is actually, was

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:07.400
a VP at a large corporation, had many dreams
for a start-up, she worked in technology and

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:14.060
entertainment and she is doing it. She got
her developer team going and Buenos Aires

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:17.900
and is getting the product done. She's lined
up a whole bunch of, actually, investors and

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:23.200
also companies who are ready to buy into the
company. So, she's been doing the whole from

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:28.299
start to finish, from conception of the product
all the way through. I have, one of my other

00:40:28.299 --> 00:40:33.650
clients right now, too, who just raised ten
thousand dollars toward a documentary that

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:39.020
she's doing. She has borderline personality
disorder, BPD, if you've ever heard of that,

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:44.270
which is a mental illness and she is a graphic
designer in New York and she's training for

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:49.540
the Golden Gloves, also. Training for boxing,
Golden Gloves boxing championship, and so

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:56.069
she's creating a documentary called The Fight
Within Us, which is following her along, kind

00:40:56.069 --> 00:41:01.089
of documenting her experience with BPD, but
also using the metaphor of boxing, of really

00:41:01.089 --> 00:41:05.780
training for the fight within the ring. So,
she just worked on a project where she just

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:09.119
raised ten thousand dollars for one stage
of the project. That's kind of a different

00:41:09.119 --> 00:41:15.980
kind of, kind of story, but for her it's more
about a social cause. And then I have lots

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:21.150
and lots of people who have just done the,
gone from corporate employee to become a consultant,

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:27.869
or started smaller, smaller jobs. So it's,
I'm tremendously proud of my clients. Yeah.

00:41:27.869 --> 00:41:29.680
&gt;&gt;audience member #6: I have a question--

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.680
&gt;&gt;Pam: Yes.

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:33.609
&gt;&gt;audience member #6: something about the
slide that you had where the building blocks,

00:41:33.609 --> 00:41:39.400
you had like, the two building blocks and
then it builds up to your full picture, and

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:43.550
I think it's nice to think of it kind of you
add you add, but I'm wondering if you can

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:48.089
speak to sometimes you have to subtract first?
Like, if you have financial goals and you

00:41:48.089 --> 00:41:51.750
wanna start your own business, it might be
that in starting your own business you have

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:53.220
to subtract financial goals to get, and then
eventually get there.

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:54.220
&gt;&gt;Pam: Yes.

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:56.549
&gt;&gt;audience member #6: So, it's not that nice,
neat path sometimes.

00:41:56.549 --> 00:42:00.910
&gt;&gt;Pam: Exactly, exactly. And it, and so much
of it is about choice, especially, as you

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:05.640
said, you have three little ones. I know time
is often a factor, money is often a factor,

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:10.250
learning how to say no is one of the best
skills. If you really wanna be an entrepreneur,

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:14.750
learn how to say no. Cause a lot of it is
about really being focused on what you're

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:18.970
doing, clarifying your priorities. Jenny and
I were just talking about the time she spent

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:22.500
writing her book where she had to say no to
a whole bunch of social engagements and other

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:28.010
things she was doing and so, you're absolutely
right. What I'm thinking about in that context

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:33.760
is actively going after skills, resources,
experiences that you can get in order to make

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:38.059
the time to do that is often where you need
to subtract things. And that's where anytime

00:42:38.059 --> 00:42:42.010
people say, "Well, I have a full-time job.
There's no way I could do it," there is a

00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:46.220
way to do it. I guarantee if you start to
look into the way that you're working and

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:50.099
the way that your outside life is, there are
ways to work in little, tiny turtle steps

00:42:50.099 --> 00:42:54.490
to make it happen, so, so I'm totally with
you. And I don't believe in work/life balance

00:42:54.490 --> 00:42:59.349
at all. I've learned a long time ago that
often there are choices and they're not always

00:42:59.349 --> 00:43:05.430
easy choices, right? Sometimes you make a
choice to not do one thing in order to make

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:09.640
something else happen and it's not always
perfect. And that's ok. It's kind of beautiful

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:10.640
imperfection.

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:11.640
&gt;&gt;audience member #7: Hi, thanks so much for
coming.

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:12.640
&gt;&gt;Pam: Yeah.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.790
&gt;&gt;audience member #7: So I was spending some
time in the, in the start your own business

00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:15.799
section in amazon, or--

00:43:15.799 --> 00:43:16.799
&gt;&gt;Pam: Yes.

00:43:16.799 --> 00:43:22.130
&gt;&gt;audience member #7: amazon online and also
in the bookstore. It's just really easy to

00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:24.550
get overwhelmed with all the books that are
on--

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:25.550
&gt;&gt;Pam: Yeah.

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:29.161
&gt;&gt;audience member #7: on the shelf, claiming
they would help you. Are there anything in

00:43:29.161 --> 00:43:37.500
books or reference guides you would recommend
that would sort of give you the foundation

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:38.500
of kind of checklist things you should consider?
Everything from like, legally and what kind

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:41.089
of things you need to consider in insurance,
so just something like that?

00:43:41.089 --> 00:43:48.160
&gt;&gt;Pam: So, yes, kind of the nuts and bolts?
Yes. I think for the, I'm not sure of the

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:52.460
nature of the company, but I have, a checklist
for some of the nuts and bolts of the structure

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:56.020
of the company, the meaning, the purpose,
the essence, I really like The Art of the

00:43:56.020 --> 00:44:00.470
Start, which Guy Kawasaki wrote, which goes
through some good elements to look at. What

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:05.789
is your message? What's your market? How do
you organize the business plan side? There

00:44:05.789 --> 00:44:11.109
is a book, I think it's Rhonda Abrahamson,
I hope I get her name right, which is Six

00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:16.440
Weeks to Start-Up, and that tends to be a
lot more the checklist kind of elements. There's

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:21.940
also startupnation.com, which is a site that
has ten steps to open for business and they

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:26.020
have a lot of checklists in terms of legal
agreements and health insurance. I don't,

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:29.880
health insurance was one of the biggest issues
that people often come to me about because

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:33.920
it's often a concern. I actually wrote a whole
chapter about it in my book because it was

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:38.610
such a big issue for people, so there is some
information there. Some of it, I think, depends

00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:42.829
on the nature of the kind of company that
you're starting and I'm a huge believer in

00:44:42.829 --> 00:44:48.510
getting as much as you can free. Absolutely.
Get as much free advice as you can and then

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:53.520
certain things, you don't want to scrimp on
like really talk to a good accountant, a CPA,

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:58.140
a lawyer about what kind of business structure,
for example, you want to set up, and talk

00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:02.849
to a really reputable insurance broker. And
if you have, depending on your own financial

00:45:02.849 --> 00:45:07.750
situation, talk to a good financial planner,
also. Just to make sure that you're mitigating

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:12.330
risk. It's in the spirit of test often fail
fast. Nothing scares me more as a coach than

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:17.190
somebody who says, "Hey, I'm quitting my job
tomorrow," when they haven't thought about

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:21.750
how are you really mitigating your risk? So,
there's a lot you can learn for free, but

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:26.619
then certain things, make sure you get really
good advice. And I usually go with a mentor

00:45:26.619 --> 00:45:37.130
or a High Council recommendation for the kind
of people who are good to work with. Yeah.

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:42.520
Any other questions? All right, awesome. Well,
thanks so much for having me here. I've had

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:48.260
a great time and enjoy the rest of your day.
You can find me at escapefromcubiclenation.com
