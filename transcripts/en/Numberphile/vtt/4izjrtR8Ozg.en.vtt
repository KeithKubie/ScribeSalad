00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
What I thought I'd show you a card trick that I like
to call the Little Fibs trick.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.900
So what we do is we take a deck of cards and we shuffle
few times to make sure they're good and mixed up.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.300
I usually do this with two people but we can just
do it with one person.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.400
You can actually do it with three or four people
if you like.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.980
And then what I do is, I have... I have a couple of people
pick a couple of cards,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.820
maybe I'll take off the top I don't know four or five
that looks like five,

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.660
I mix them up thoroughly, and you tell me when to
stop mixing.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.600
- Brady: Okay, stop.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.780
Okay, and then I have two people pick cards.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.940
- Brady: Okay, so I'll represent both people here.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.260
Okay, so pick... pick any cards you wish.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.860
Okay. Now what you have to do is look at the cards
and remember them.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.260
Very important; suit and value. And then,
the cards have values an Ace counts as 1,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.780
2, 3 up to 10 is obvious, Jack, Queen and King is the
usual convention of 11, 12, and 13.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.520
So I want you to add the two values of the numbers, the
cards that you have, but don't tell me that yet.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.640
So if you got 3 and a King that would be 16, and if you
got a Queen... two Queens that would be 24, and so on.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.620
- Brady: So that one (King of hearts)

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.920
So remember the suit and the value.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.920
- Brady: Suit and the value okay. (8 of clubs)

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.360
Okay. So now I have you put them back in the packet.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.780
So put one back, maybe there and I'll cover them up...
Cover it up. And put the other one back there.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.500
And I'll cover it up.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.380
Now a Magician would be able to find
those cards and put them up very quickly,

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.260
It would probably already have it in his or her pocket,
or perhaps in your pocket.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.200
But I Mathemagician so I'm gonna do it little honestly.
I'm gonna shuffle the cards again,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.420
and make sure they're good and mixed up.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.580
And ask you now what the two numbers added up to,
the value total of the two cards you selected.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.580
What was that please?

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.700
- Brady: They added up to... 21.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.620
21, okay so it could be a Jack and a 10, it could be a
Queen and a 9, that could have been two ten-and-a-halfs

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.660
there are many other possibilities ,and then there's the
irrational numbers, we didn't even get to those...

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.400
I couldn't help noticing that you weren't wearing gloves

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.220
so in fact you left your fingerprints on the cards,

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.200
So I... I think from that point of view I might be
able to find them.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.020
let's see if I can do this now...

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.380
I'm looking for the fingerprints... I think I have it.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.720
So let's shuffle them one more time to make sure
that they're really lost.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.180
And... And then I'm just gonna produce two cards,

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.180
and ask you what your cards were?

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.440
- Brady: They were the King of hearts and the 8 of clubs.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.800
What, is it that king of hearts and that 8 of clubs?

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.720
- Brady: That was... That was those... it was them, 
you got it... you got it!

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.920
Good.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.200
I'll shuffle those cards again, and we could do this again,
but it's like telling a good joke.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.980
The punchline isn't so funny the second time around.
So you really don't want to perform this exact trick,

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.020
for the same audience, the second time.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.480
But let me demonstrate what's actually going on here,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.340
but this time I'm going to shuffle them in such a way that
you can see a little more carefully what I'm really up to...

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.300
I'm indeed shuffling a lot of the cards, but if you
look closely you'll see that I'm not shuffling,

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.560
quite a large chunk at the top.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.760
so actually maybe eight or nine cards at the top, 
were not shuffled.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.420
And I can do this several times and if I do it fast it looks like an honest shuffle,

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.220
especially if I don't give you the benefit of the angle.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.860
That's the way I showed earlier. But if you see the angle,

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.600
and I do it slower you can see that in fact I have control 
over some of the cards, the top...

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.460
Five or six cards. Actually the top six cards it's what's
particularly important.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.860
So let me take them off, so I've done a
false-shuffle here.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.260
And giving the illusion of free choice. But actually, you're
doomed to pick two cards from particular cards,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.380
and I'm gonna show you what they are and see if you
recognize them they're kind of famous numbers.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.080
So 1, what might come after 1, well probably 2, what'd 
you think comes after 2 ?

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.180
- Brady: 3.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.500
Most people would go for 3, what comes after 3 ? - Well,
obviously 4. But wait a minute,

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.740
if I was to use these cards and you selected
 those two (2&amp;3), you would tell me the total was 5.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.580
But if somebody else selected these other two (1&amp;4),
they would also get a total of 5.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.480
And that would be ambiguous. The whole 
point of this trick, is that from the total,

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.340
I do know what the cards are, even though
I pretend I don't.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.700
because you're picking from a controlled
sub-set of the deck.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.780
so we probably shouldn't use the 4, so in fact we might want to jump to 5.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.860
Now we don't have the problem we had before.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.400
Now what comes after 5 ? - Most people would say 6,
but 6 isn't such a good idea,

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.460
because 6+1 is 7 and so is 5+2,
so maybe we should jump to 7?

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:17.720
But 7+1 is 8 and so is 5+3. so we can't use 7, but it turns
out that 8 works.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.220
Now actually, we can push this a little further, we can go:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and another card.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.540
If we do a 9; 9&amp;1 is 10, so is 2&amp;8.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.020
Turns out we can't use 10, we can't use a Jack (11) or a
Queen (11) either for similar reasons.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.400
Guess what? - You have to go up to 13 which is a King.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.000
At this point, you should be recognizing these numbers.
They're very famous mathematics numbers,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.440
for at least... 800 years;
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.080
Well the next one of course would be 21.
These are the Fibonacci numbers.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:57.340
And if you add 1&amp;2 you get 3, if you add 2&amp;3 you get 5,
you add 5&amp;3 you get 8, you add 5&amp;8 you get 13,

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.960
you add 13&amp;8 you get 21, it keeps going. But at that
point, you're beyond the range of a deck of cards.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.220
So for the cards, 'shark' - you only go
with Ace (1) to 13 (King).

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.360
So I've chosen these particular Ace (1), 2, 3, 5, 8,
and 13 (King), and I've memorized the suits.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.020
I've been doing this trick for a while, so I put those
at the top and I shuffle,

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.540
and you're gonna be picking cards from those too.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.540
And it turns out that Fibonacci numbers have this
magic property, that you will always

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.120
be able to decompose their sum.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.060
So I pretend to shuffle, and I do in fact mix these cards
up and I don't know which ones you're going to pick.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.900
so again let me just show you two and you tell me what the total is,

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.900
and i'll tell you immediately what the cards are.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.880
- Brady: 14.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.360
14, so It's a King (13) and an Ace (1).
Now, how did I know that?

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.480
I would say of course in performance well, it could have
been a 7 and a 7, it could have been a 10 and a 4,

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.540
But I don't have 7's among the cards you're
gonna pick from...

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.860
There's no other possibilities, when you have six numbers, there are - 6 times 5 over 2,

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.760
which I think is 15 different ways you can add them
up in pairs.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.980
Usually you'll get some collisions like 1+4 is the same
as 2+3, but with these Fibonacci numbers,

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.080
you never get collisions - You'll get 15 distinct numbers.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.240
and secondly, it's easy to actually break up the numbers.
Here's the trick:

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.960
we'll try in again I'll just mix them up here and ask you to tell me what these two add up to?

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.780
what do those two add up to add up to?

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.120
- Brady: They add up to 15.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.220
15, so here's what I'm doing in my head:

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:23.860
15 is the sum of two Fibonacci numbers. What's the
biggest Fibonacci number - less than 15, I think it's 13.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.700
So it's 13+... Well the subtraction's easy it's 13+2, so it's
the King and the two.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.720
And the suits, there's no mathematics involved there, I
have to memorize the suits, but I do memorize the suits.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:39.720
If you want to do this the first time, an easy version,
just use the six values in question use all diamonds.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.140
It's always going to be two diamonds, if you do the trick 
once for somebody, you'll probably get away with it.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.520
It's a good way for students to learn to do the trick,

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.180
but for a more sophisticated version that's a bit more convincing use different suits and memorize them.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:58.280
So I just again, happen to use the Ace of clubs, the
2 of hearts, the 3 of spades, the 5 of diamond.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:04.840
Notice that suit order is C-H-S-D, called the "chaste order"
and then you repeat the cycle of the suits.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.240
So of course it's possible to get two of the same suit
with six cards that's unavoidable.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.220
I usually actually, leave the Ace out of the mix, simply
because if the total's 3 it's too obvious.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.600
A 3, could only be an Ace and a 2, and then the question
of the suits isn't as impressive.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.940
But if you leave the Ace out, it's quite impressive.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.680
If you've been paying attention the beginning you might
have noticed that I did in fact use the smallest

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.900
Fibonacci numbers 1 2 3 5 8 and 13 so that's the Little Fibs trick.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.580
And to be honest I did tell a few little 'fibs' 
(Fabrications)

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.120
or if not, big whoppers because I said I was 
shuffling the cards.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.740
"So what we do is we take a deck of cards and we
shuffle... here we are shuffling the cards."

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:45.660
I couldn't possibly know what any of the cards are - 
those were little 'fibs', it was a fake shuffle.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.420
I knew what cards you are selecting your two cards
from, I didn't know what they were.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.040
It wouldn't work with any five or six cards, you have
to pick your numbers carefully.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.900
And the Fibonacci numbers - work beautifully for
this trick.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.980
- Brady: so the little 'fib' was that you are serving me that little 'fibs'?

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.940
I was dishing up some little fibs.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.780
What interested me, you can do other numbers,

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:09.280
for instance you can start with
a 2 first and then a 1.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.700
And then add those to get 3,

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.520
And add 1&amp;3 to get 4, and add 3&amp;4 to get 7,
