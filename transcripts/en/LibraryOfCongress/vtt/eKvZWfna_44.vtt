&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.040
Thanks a lot for joining us.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.490
My name is Eric Deggans
and I'm TV critic

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.210
for national public radio.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.220
Thank you so much for joining us

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.720
for this wonderful
panel discussion.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.060
I'm going to introduce
our two panelists

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.450
and their wonderful work
and then we're going

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.990
to talk about their books.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.570
But first a couple
of ground rules.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.670
Number one, look at those
pesky cellphones that you have

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.220
and make sure that they're
silenced because I know

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.870
that you think your ringtone
is really cool but when we're

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.940
in the middle talking about
stuff, we don't want to hear,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.470
you know, Drake or
something, all right?

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.770
Secondly--

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.070
&gt;&gt; Erica Armstrong
Dunbar: Maybe.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.440
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans:
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.580
Secondly, we're going have--
we're going to take questions

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.910
from the audience
probably in the last 20--

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.990
15 or 20 minutes of
our time together.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.960
And as you'll see,
there are microphones.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.840
And so I will let you know
when we get to the point

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.130
and you can kind of line
up and we'll just take

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.590
as many questions as we can
before the evening is over

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.050
or before the afternoon is over.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.310
So, be thinking while
we're talking

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.360
about what you want to ask.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.550
And remember, it's a question,
not a speech, all right?

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.710
I'm just going to say
that one time [applause].

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.490
So, let's start with the
lovely lady to my left,

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.310
Erica Armstrong Dunbar, the
Charles and Mary Beard Professor

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.020
of History at Rutgers
University,

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.230
and the former director
of the program

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.530
in African American history

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.560
at the Library Company
of Philadelphia.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.810
And she has written
"Never Caught:

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.630
the Washingtons'
Relentless Pursuit

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.370
of Their Runaway
Slave Ona Judge",

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.280
2017 national book
award finalist.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.580
Erica, thank you for joining us.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.550
&gt;&gt; Erica Armstrong
Dunbar: Yes [applause].

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.300
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: And to my
right, Catherine Kerrison,

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.840
who is a scholar of Early
American and Gender History

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.810
who was recently became a
full professor of history

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.810
at Villanova University,
and she's written

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.120
"Jefferson's Daughters: Three
Sisters, White and Black,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.420
in a Young America", the
story of Jefferson's one black

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.220
and two white daughters.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.900
Thank you very much for
joining us [applause].

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.200
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerrison:
Thank you.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.500
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: So,
let's get right into it.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.800
I read both of these books.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.400
And as a black person, I
did not know how to feel

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.440
about our founders after I
read about them owning slaves

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.330
and their relationships
with their slaves.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.290
So, how am I supposed
to feel about this?

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.920
How am I supposed to negotiate
how I feel about Jefferson

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.870
and Washington after reading
about how they were slave owners

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.190
and how hypocritical they
were in some ways about this?

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.870
What do you think?

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.170
&gt;&gt; Erica Armstrong Dunbar: Yeah.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.720
I think that the discomfort that
we feel reading about the sort

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.060
of flawed nature of our
founders is natural.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.360
It's normal.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.660
We've grown up with
these narratives

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.550
that paint our founders
in a specific way

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.370
with specific light
for multiple reasons.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.800
So, when text like
"Never Caught"

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.390
or "Jefferson's Daughters"
come out, it really sort of--

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.480
these texts challenge us to
rethink not simply our founders

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.750
but this moment in which
the nation was created.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.410
And so I would say--
you know, I wrote a book

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.170
that wasn't necessarily
about George Washington.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.830
The book was about an
enslaved woman named Ona Judge

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.920
who happened to be owned by
Martha and George Washington.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.330
And so, it was really-- I
think we just think about it

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.820
as an attempt to reshape
how we see the founding

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.420
of the nation, founders
included.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.760
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Now, your
book, there are some people

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.820
who have even disputed
this connection

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.850
between Sally Hemings
and Thomas Jefferson.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.980
So, as you work on the book,
did it change how you felt

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.750
about Jefferson or change how
you felt about the founders?

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.450
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerrison: There
are still naysayers to the idea

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:26.430
that Jefferson had this
relationship quite long-standing

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.770
with Sally Hemings that produced
four children who survived

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.230
into adulthood, but
the preponderance

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.010
of the evidence really makes

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.220
that position sort
of untenable, right?

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.310
That, in fact, that he did have
this long-standing relationship.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.600
And like Erica with her
project on Ona judge,

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.430
I was much more interested in
Harriet Hemings but, of course,

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.120
I think in my work on all
three daughters, there's a way

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:06.050
which looking at Jefferson as
a father, we actually see him

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.090
in a very different way and
in a way that he is an edited.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.580
He was usually very conscious
of his self-presentation

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.640
for both his peers
and for posterity,

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.520
but as a father we see
him rather differently,

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:33.470
and so I didn't see
Jefferson differently so much

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.170
than I had before I
started this project.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:43.550
I knew he was a slave owner,
but to actually kind of see him

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:50.540
in this relationship and how
he dealt with the children

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.490
of his slave Sally Hemings
was really quite revealing,

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:03.260
and that what I see ultimately
is Jefferson is very human,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.810
Jefferson as in some ways
very, very conventional.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:14.370
And that ultimately in seeing
the humanity of our founders,

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.050
I think that's actually kind of
freeing and liberating, right?

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.100
So, we don't sort of feel
as though we have to live

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:30.750
up to these towering idols but,
in fact, we can take the best

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.830
of what they have to offer,
except that this is indeed part

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.160
of the American story.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.180
And ask, OK, so what does
that mean for us today

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.420
and that's what I tried to do.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.050
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: So your book
talks about how this woman

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:54.270
that the Washingtons owned
escaped from them went

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.490
to Portsmouth and eventually
resisted their attempts to sort

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.420
of bring her back into the fold.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.720
How did you hear
about this story?

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.160
What made you decide you
wanted to write this book

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.630
and how did you stumble on this?

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:08.930
&gt;&gt; Erica Armstrong Dunbar: Yeah,

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.280
I was actually working
on another book.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.590
This is what historians
always do.

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.630
We're in the archives and we're
reading through old newspapers

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:22.420
and manuscripts, and we find
something that intrigues us.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.820
And so, I was finishing
another book

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.670
about how black women
became free in the north.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.330
And I was working, I was in
the archives, I was reading

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.610
through 18th century newspapers
trying to get a feel for sort

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.460
of everyday life
in Philadelphia.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:43.110
And so I'm in the
microfilm room, 13th in locus

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:47.340
in Philadelphia, the historical
society, and I'm reading,

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.270
you know, through the newspapers

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:54.290
and up pops a runaway
slave advertisement.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.050
And I pause, I thought, OK,
this is sort of interesting,

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:59.340
it's the end of the
18th century,

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:03.370
it was 1796 slavery
is almost sort

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.310
of dead, gone in Philadelphia.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.430
So it's interesting that
someone's advertising.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.800
And then it became clear to
me that this was not just sort

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.250
of any advertisement, that
this was an advertisement

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.690
from the house of the president.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:21.890
And so I did the pause
moment, wait, wait, wait, 1796,

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:25.470
that's George Washington, OK.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.850
Who is being advertised here?

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:29.200
What is this about?

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.000
And what was so-- you
know, one of the things

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.680
that historians have relied upon

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.990
with runaway slave
advertisements is

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.660
that it gives us
some information,

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:43.130
typically about people of
whom we know very little.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.210
And so it said, you know,
absconded from the household

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:50.200
of the president of the United
States, Ona Maria Judge.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:56.050
And I thought, OK,
wait, who is Ona?

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:57.390
Why did she run away?

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.860
We kind of know the
answer to that, right?

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:03.430
What happened to her?

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:06.670
And I think it was that last
question, the what happened

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:11.790
to her that sort of just took
hold of me and never really kind

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.290
of let go and I thought,
OK, well, I've got to figure

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:18.140
out who this is and more
specifically as an expert

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.470
in African-American history,

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.520
specifically African
American women's history,

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:28.180
I found myself excited but also
really angry and frustrated

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.010
at that moment because I had
never heard her name before.

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:35.120
And I thought why don't
I know this story?

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:42.750
Why have I not encountered her
or her story in source material?

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.690
So, I thought maybe I can
find a way to weave this

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:47.800
into the first book
and I said no,

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.740
I'm going to come back to this.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:54.890
So, I finished the first book
and moved on to really sort

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:57.300
of figure out all that
I could about Ona.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.190
And that was really
a nine-year search.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:04.490
It took me nine years to
research and write this book,

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:08.710
in part because Ona was a
fugitive and one the one thing

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:12.810
that fugitives rely upon
is anonymity, right?

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:15.700
So, she didn't want to
be found for the majority

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.830
of her life, until the end.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:22.480
And it's the end of her life
where she does leave behind

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.170
to newspaper interviews.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:31.340
So we do actually have Ona's
voice through her interviews.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.900
But really it was,
you know, finding Ona

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:39.180
and then being committed
to telling her story,

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:44.590
but also understanding
that Ona's life, her story,

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:47.110
gives us a sort of portal

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.430
into the founding of
the nation, right?

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:53.460
We have lots of books, great
books about Washington,

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:58.360
Jefferson, but I was more
interested in telling a story

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.810
about those who worked,
who toiled,

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:05.570
who labored under the founding
fathers, who built this nation.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:09.840
And so Ona gives us that perfect
portal to think about race,

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.010
to think about gender,
to think about labor,

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.290
to think about the
south and the north.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:20.240
She-- Her life allowed really
all of us to understand the sort

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.950
of complex nature of
the early republic.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:25.050
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: That's
what's interesting to me

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:27.890
about both your books,
because you guys are talking

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:30.890
about slaves and you
are talking about women.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:32.530
You're talking about
the two groups

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:37.190
that historians probably
ignored during that time

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.130
and how do you put together a
book where you're trying to find

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:44.860
out about these people who is
sort of the official chroniclers

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:50.930
of history didn't pay attention
to or kind of marginalized?

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:54.260
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerrison: So,
as you had alluded earlier,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:12:00.700
for decades, the story of Thomas
Jefferson and Sally Hemings

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.620
and their children had
been suppressed, right?

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:07.550
And historians, to
be perfectly honest,

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:10.930
were very much part
of that project.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.230
And so, they--

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:13.530
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Proud
of suppressing the story.

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:14.830
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerrison:

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:16.130
Of suppressing the
story, indeed, yes.

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:24.030
And so, it-- they
ignored the story told

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:29.300
by Sally Hemings' son Madison
who gave a newspaper account

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:35.930
in 1873, so almost 50 years
after Jefferson's death.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.810
They suppressed that story.

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:41.130
They even attack
Madison's character

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.850
as incapable of telling
the truth.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:48.380
So-- And this is--
these are historians

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.510
in the 20th century
who did this.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:58.850
So, it has been a project of the
latter half of the 20th century

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:03.010
and into our own to
even get historians

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:09.120
to really take seriously
the question of slavery

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.130
and enslavement to even
think about that experience

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.740
from the slaves'
point of view, right?

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:21.490
And then as many of
you may know, in 1998,

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:24.020
there was a DNA test

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:30.580
that definitively linked the
youngest son of Sally Hemings,

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:36.520
whose name was Eston, to the
Jefferson male line, right?

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.420
So that's not to say
Thomas, but it was--

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:47.800
but all the other evidence
around this relationship,

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.700
taken together with
the DNA as they say,

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:55.440
it's really no longer tenable
to deny that relationship.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.930
So there was all of
that work that had

00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:00.850
to be done before we even get

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:06.410
to the question of
women in slavery.

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:12.180
And that field is
now quite rich,

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:16.390
and again particularly
in the last 20 years.

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:20.130
What I was-- What I wanted to
do when I first started my book,

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:24.690
I was initially drawn
to it because Martha,

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:28.670
the eldest of Jefferson's
three surviving daughters,

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:33.710
lived into her 60s, had
11 surviving children,

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:39.770
all of whom developed a rather
sizable archive of letters.

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:43.880
And I remember the first
time I saw this, particularly

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.600
at the University of
Virginia, I thought, gee,

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.650
there's got to be a book
in there somewhere, right?

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:53.840
And then I thought, well, if I'm
going to do a book on Martha,

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.900
I'm not going to ignore
Maria, his second daughter

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:04.090
with his wife, and then it
would be utterly dishonest of me

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.020
to do a book called
"Jefferson's Daughters"

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:09.600
without talking about Harriet.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:16.500
And in a slightly different
way than Erica did for her work

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:23.150
on Ona, Harriet was a bit of
a challenge to try to find,

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.930
because very briefly, what we
know about her, what happened

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:30.930
to her also came from
Madison's account.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:35.290
And what he said was
that Harriet thought it

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:38.400
to her interest to
go to Washington,

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:43.130
DC to take on the
role of a white woman,

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:47.170
and by her dressing
conduct as such.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:51.670
He believed that she never
revealed her identity

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:54.490
as Harriet Hemings
of Monticello.

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:59.200
In fact, she married a
white man of good standing

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.250
in Washington City,
Madison said,

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:04.750
and raised a family of children.

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:11.900
So, a fugitive sort of in--

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.490
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: A fugitive
history in a [inaudible].

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:14.790
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerrison:
A fugitive--

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:16.090
That's a lovely way to put it.

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:20.160
Because she never--
Jefferson never gave her--

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.710
Jefferson never actually
gave her freedom papers

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:25.420
but he did pay for her
stagecoach fair to Philadelphia

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:29.960
and he did give her
$50 for her expenses.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:37.710
So clearly he facilitated
her departure, but at law,

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:41.740
she was still a slave at law

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:45.820
until the Thirteenth
Amendment was passed in 1865.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.960
She was-- That was what it
took to formally free her.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:56.820
And so, protecting her identity
was what she needed to do

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:04.040
to pass as a freeborn white
person, which again is somewhat

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:10.360
of a different strategy than Ona
Judge did and enabled me then

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:15.030
to really kind of discuss this
whole phenomenon of passing both

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:18.810
in the 19th century during
the course of slavery.

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:22.670
And even today, one
researcher estimated as many

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:27.640
as 30,000 people a year
crossed the colorblind

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.210
from black to white.

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:32.510
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Wow.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:37.280
You know, I'm interested in
this idea of the modern things

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:41.410
that we struggle with that
are legacies from slavery.

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:44.040
And I've always felt
sort of this idea

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.980
of inherent black
criminality, for example,

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:51.790
came out of the need to find a
reason to oppress black people

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:54.860
and force them into free labor.

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.260
When you look at the work that
you've done about that time,

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:02.850
about what Ona went through,
what are the modern legacies

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:06.190
of what she went through in the
system of slavery that she had

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:08.300
to find a way to survive?

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:12.300
&gt;&gt; Erica Armstrong Dunbar: Yeah,
that's a beautiful question,

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:17.020
because I think, you know,
someone who teaches US history,

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:22.510
we-- and I sort of focus on
the 18th and 19th century,

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:26.280
we don't-- historians are really
uncomfortable when people ask us

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.230
to think about connecting the
past with the present, right,

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.060
or the future but
I'll do it anyway.

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.620
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: It's my job--

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:34.920
&gt;&gt; Erica Armstrong Dunbar:
That's your question.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.710
So, I'll do it, thank
you for letting me.

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:40.690
You know, I do think we can
see these direct connections

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:46.320
between the history of
enslavement, the creation

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:50.640
of race with modern-day
social justice issues, right,

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:55.060
when we look at the
industrial complex clearly.

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:59.940
I do think also Ona's
story helps as to think

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:08.930
about not simply the connections
between slavery and the lack

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:10.630
of any inequality thereafter,

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:14.080
but I think Ona's story
is really also a coming

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:19.820
of age story that helps us think
about the importance of family,

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:23.810
that helps us think
about what one must do

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:29.750
in very dire situations, the
choices that they have to make.

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:35.260
We also know that Ona as an
enslaved person was forbidden

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.650
from learning to read or write.

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:40.690
We know that at the end of
her life she learns to read.

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:43.930
I'm not certain that she
ever learned to write,

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:45.360
but clearly there
are these issues

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.380
about literacy, about education.

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:50.410
And I think education
in particular is one

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:55.810
of these themes that we can
connect between the 18th and--

00:19:55.810 --> 00:20:00.040
17th through 19th century,
and the 20th and 21st century.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.150
When we think about how
the decks were stacked

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:07.670
or the ground was
uneven, foreign slaved--

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:10.330
people who were legally
forbidden from learning to read

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:13.550
and write and that we think
about education at this moment

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:17.000
and the students, the
children in particular

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.570
who have the least opportunity.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:24.800
We see some connections,
racially at least, right?

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.470
And I do think that for the
21st century that the issue

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.240
of education is going to be one

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:34.080
of the most important
civil rights issues,

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.880
right, of the century.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:41.090
And I do think that it's
important for historians like us

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:45.680
to write about these
women, these men,

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:50.060
but also to make certain
that readers like yourselves,

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.710
adult readers, engaged
readers are invested

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:55.540
but also children, you know?

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.610
And it's our job really
I think to make certain

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:01.770
that those ideas are translated,

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:05.850
are legible for young
children, not just adults.

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:09.520
It's too late to wait
until college, right?

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:13.820
Or to wait into you're 18,
19, 20 years old to learn

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:16.180
about these very sort
of fundamental issues

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.710
that we can connect
to the founding

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:21.650
of the nation, to the president.

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:24.340
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: So, the
question I had when I came

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.640
to your book, the
main question I had

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.170
and the question I've
always have when I heard

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:30.480
about Sally Hemings
was, what was that like?

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:34.430
Like, what was that relationship
like between these two people?

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:37.540
And like you said, there's not
a lot of information out there.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:39.150
It's hard to figure
out what's going on.

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:43.380
What were you able to find
out about what it was like?

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:50.510
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerrison: I think
actually I have to hear--

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:55.340
talk very briefly about a
wonderful scholar's work,

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:59.280
Annette Gordon-Reed, who wrote
a Pulitzer Prize-winning book

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.510
called "The Hemingses
of Monticello".

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:05.820
[ Applause ]

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:11.870
And there Gordon-Reed
takes on this question sort

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:15.540
of probing very much
what historians

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:18.030
of enslaved women need to do,

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:22.080
which is to probe
the silences, right?

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.770
Because we don't know.

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.500
What we do know,
what we can be sure

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:32.640
of was this incredible
power dynamic and in balance

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:37.920
between the two people, Thomas
Jefferson the slaveholder

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:45.500
and Sally Hemings who
at age 16 in Paris

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:51.060
where she knows all she has
to do is go to a French court

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:55.590
and she will be freed,
has a decision to make

00:22:55.590 --> 00:23:01.090
about whether she's going to
re-cross the Atlantic to go back

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:04.790
to a life of slavery
in Virginia or not.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:06.090
And she's--

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:07.390
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: At a time

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:09.480
when crossing the Atlantic was
not the safest thing to do.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:10.780
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerrison: No.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.410
No. So, there were all
sorts of risks, right?

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:14.710
All kinds of risks.

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:18.350
She's taken her life in
her hands at that moment.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:20.490
Does she company
Jefferson back or not?

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:23.740
In so many different
ways, right?

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:28.640
However, having stated
that, which is the obvious,

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.680
it's also important I think

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:37.010
to consider Sally
Hemings the person.

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:41.440
And a very important point I
think that Gordon-Reed makes is

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:50.630
that this 16-year-old in
Paris did judge correctly

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:58.390
that Thomas Jefferson, a man 30
years her senior, at least, yes,

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:02.530
that he would keep his
promise that if she came back

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:07.310
to Virginia with him, he
would free any children

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:08.990
that they had together.

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:12.550
And for everything we can say
about Jefferson and slavery,

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:15.960
and I am one of many
voices who have said a lot,

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:21.740
we do have to say that he kept
that promise that he made.

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:25.050
And there isn't a court
in the United States

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:27.450
that would have forced
him to do so.

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:32.080
So, she was correct
in that judgment.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.950
She was the person who also
had a home in Virginia,

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:42.200
who had a family in
Virginia, who loved that view

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:47.980
from Monticello of the Blue
Ridge Mountains, as much as any.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:51.090
The other thing that I do in my
book particularly is I'm trying

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:53.210
to think about Harriet's
childhood is

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:56.910
to take Sally Hemings,
to think about her

00:24:56.910 --> 00:25:00.470
as a person, as a mother, right?

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:07.420
How did she raise these
children, trusting them--

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:11.230
trusting in Jefferson's
promise and educating them

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:15.210
so that they knew that unlike
every other enslaved person

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:18.440
on this plantation,
when they turn 21,

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.510
they were going to be free.

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:23.410
And how did she do that?

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:27.630
And let's think that Jefferson
is not the only educator

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:29.030
on that mountain.

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:30.330
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Right.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:33.210
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerrison:
Sally Hemings was as well

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:38.640
and she clearly prepared
her daughter beautifully

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:43.140
for the life she was going to
live as a freeborn white woman,

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:47.710
the wife of a white man
of middling standing

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:50.960
who raised her own
children in her stead.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.260
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Wow.

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:53.560
&gt;&gt; Erica Armstrong
Dunbar: Can I just add?

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:54.860
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Please.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.160
&gt;&gt; Erica Armstrong Dunbar:
There's something that you said

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.460
that I think is really
important,

00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:59.650
and it's about the archives.

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:04.850
And for historians who write
based upon what we find

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:09.210
in the archives, it's very
frustrating if you are someone

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:12.420
who focuses on women
or who focus on people

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:17.180
of African descent, you know,
prior to the 20th century.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:21.800
The archives are kind of
violent spaces for black women

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:25.040
in particular because
we're not there, right?

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.340
We're ignored.

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:29.380
Our names are often
not mentioned.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:33.320
And so it becomes a
different kind of project

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:37.640
when you're attempting to
recreate and share the lives

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.120
of enslaved women in
particular, why it takes so long

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.680
to write a book, too,
if you're doing that.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:48.230
But I do think it's one
of the things that led me

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:52.480
in writing this book
about Ona to make certain

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:57.200
that this was a readable book,
a book for a general audience

00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:01.190
but also one that
allowed me as an expert

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:05.120
in African American women's
history to speculate, right?

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.080
To speculate-- Informed
speculation, right?

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.390
And to make certain that
the reader always knows

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:14.450
when I do not necessarily
have a document

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:18.390
that says Ona made
round bread this morning

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:19.690
for breakfast, right?

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:20.990
I don't have that document.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:25.710
But what I do have are
recipes from the 19th century

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:27.040
of brown bread, right?

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:31.270
And that we know the majority
of other enslaved women made

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:34.430
that bread so it didn't
make me feel uncomfortable

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:38.390
to say Ona probably made
brown bread for breakfast,

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:40.740
in the narrative, in the book.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:44.430
But I do think that when
we're writing history,

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:47.990
at least for me, it
was a risk, right?

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:53.220
We're trained methodologically
to only stick to the sources,

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:55.720
paper sources typically.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:59.280
That's almost impossible to do
if you're writing the stories,

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:03.370
the histories of people who were
enslaved, who were murdered,

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:07.060
who were traumatized and whose
names were not counted, right?

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.360
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans:
That's the thing

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.660
that struck me about your book.

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:12.680
I remember reading passages
where you Ona must've done this,

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.350
or she might have felt that.

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:16.560
And I could tell you we're
signaling-- I don't--

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:17.970
that's so you know for sure.

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:20.410
But the thing that was
interesting to me is, you know,

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:24.650
slaves were not allowed to learn
how to read, right, or write.

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:27.770
And, you know, there's a real
practical reason for that,

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:29.750
right, to keep them from
being able to make maps

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:31.270
or communicate with each other.

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:35.040
But what it also did was it
robed us of their history.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.820
Because a lot of your
book is letters, right,

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:41.420
that all these people wrote
to each other and you're able

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:43.850
to read these letters and
find out how they felt

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:47.280
about the circumstances, what it
was like to live in that time,

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.800
who died and when and of what.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.430
And we don't have any
of that stuff for slaves

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:54.830
because they weren't able
to write any of that stuff

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:56.830
down and leave it for us.

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:59.690
And that's a cost of slavery

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:02.040
that I think we can't
really appreciate

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.070
until we read the books
that you guys wrote.

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:05.370
&gt;&gt; Erica Armstrong Dunbar:

00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:07.250
I do think that the oral
tradition that's been passed

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:08.940
down is amazing, right?

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:15.040
And that for that reason we
can never dismiss the records

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:19.110
that we do have, the oral
transcriptions of interviews

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:22.030
and what have you from those
who are members of slavery

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:26.830
or perhaps had a parent or
grandparent who was enslaved.

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:28.130
And I think we have to look

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:32.330
at that source material
in similar ways.

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:36.110
And so, maybe I'm more of
an optimist and that I'm--

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:42.420
as opposed to being sort of
angry about what's not there.

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:50.890
I'm excited and delighted to
read or to hear the stories

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:52.590
of what actually
does still exist.

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:55.700
It gives us enough
to tell the story.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.950
It tells us-- It gives
us the opportunity to get

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:00.740
into the lives of these people

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:02.740
who otherwise would
have been forgotten.

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.080
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: I'm a
critic so it's my job to look

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.960
at all the stuff
that is not there.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.070
We only have 15 minutes
left already?

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:11.370
Wow. OK.

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:12.670
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerrison:
May I just--

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:13.970
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans:
Before you do that,

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:15.270
I just want to say we're going

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:17.250
to start taking questions
from you guys next.

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:21.030
So if you would line up at these
mics, if you have a question.

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:22.440
And remember, no speeches.

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:26.000
I will you off [laughter].

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.300
Go ahead.

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:28.600
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerrison:
Well, I'll say very quickly,

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.250
just building on what Erica
was just talking about,

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:35.100
it's this question of sources
and the ways in which documents

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:39.240
which is to say the written
record has always sort

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:43.920
of taken priority
among historians

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:47.940
but over the oral record,
the oral tradition.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:52.350
But that-- So two things I would
say about that, first of all,

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:57.410
let's remember that is
essentially the white archive,

00:30:57.410 --> 00:30:58.710
right?

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:00.560
And so we need to be
really careful about that.

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.970
So for example when
Jefferson's granddaughter

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:08.490
and grandson finger their
cousins for the paternity

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:11.000
of Jefferson's children, we need

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.320
to be very careful
about using that.

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:19.590
And then the other thing is
that some readers have said

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:24.290
to me sometimes I get a little
frustrated with all those maybes

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:30.560
and probablys and would have,
might have, but what I say

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:33.910
to that is that, again,
in this effort to speak

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:38.210
into the silences,
what is so important is

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:41.790
to ask the questions,
right, to--

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:45.590
as you did, what would
it have been like?

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:46.890
I don't know, I don't know.

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:48.400
I don't have Sally
Hemings' words

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:54.210
but I have all this other
information, all this context

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:57.840
that then allows me
to think about that.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:01.210
And it's the thinking
about that that is

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:04.300
so important to go forward.

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:05.600
Thanks.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:06.900
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Before
we take questions,

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.200
I just want to point
out one more thing.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.500
There's lots of points
when I got upset,

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:10.800
when I was reading
your books, you know?

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.930
I mean your books are wonderful
but the things these people did.

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:17.480
The Washingtons realized
when they're in Philly

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:22.190
that they're there for six
months, can claim their freedom.

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:24.640
So then they decide very
surreptitiously to come

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:27.530
up with this plan to rotate
the slaves in and out of, what,

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:32.180
Virginia so that they never run
out the clock on their freedom.

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:34.360
I was like, Washington, I
hate that guy [laughter].

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:35.820
&gt;&gt; Erica Armstrong Dunbar: Yeah.

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:38.230
Yeah. That is a moment where
you're in the archives like,

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:39.540
George, man [laughter].

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:41.320
What you doing?

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.680
Like, what is this about?

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:43.980
And it was.

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:47.500
I'm reading George Washington's
letters and he's saying, yes,

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.380
you know, there's a law in
Pennsylvania that says--

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:53.990
that was written in 1780 that
said if you were a nonresident

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:56.320
and you brought enslaved
people with you to the state

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:59.450
of Pennsylvania, they can only
remain there for six months

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:02.000
and then if they've
overstayed that time,

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.610
they can be set free, right?

00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:06.670
So we send this letter home
to a secretary saying, well,

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:09.150
we're going to rotate
the slaves.

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:10.450
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans:
And not tell them.

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:11.750
&gt;&gt; Erica Armstrong Dunbar:
And not tell anyone.

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:13.050
For good reason, right?

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:14.350
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: For
good reason, yeah.

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:15.650
&gt;&gt; Erica Armstrong Dunbar:

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:16.950
And every six months they would
be rotated back to Virginia

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:20.470
or if that was too inconvenient,
a quick trip to New Jersey,

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:24.820
to Trenton, would
restart the clock.

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:27.820
And that is a moment where
as a scholar, you know,

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:29.990
you're reading the document,
you're using the documents

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:31.810
but you're like, man--

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:33.110
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Come on.

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:34.410
&gt;&gt; Erica Armstrong Dunbar: What?

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:37.170
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: And in your
case, the idea that Jefferson

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:39.550
on the one hand talk about
refraining from using the whip,

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:41.730
right, to control slaves.

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:44.320
But on the other hand, he was
giving away slaves as like gifts

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.620
and breaking up families to,
you know, hey, you got married,

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:48.960
here, have these three people.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.260
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerrison:
Absolutely.

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:52.920
Yeah, Jefferson is, you
know, on the one hand,

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:58.090
he will offer inducements
to his enslaved population.

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:02.610
He'll provide a bed and
a pot as a wedding gift,

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:08.020
if his slaves would find
spouses, and remember

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:09.540
of course this isn't--

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:11.800
these aren't marriages
recognized by law.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:16.720
These exist strictly at the
sufferings of the master.

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:19.040
So on the one hand,

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:22.810
he'll encourage his
enslaved population

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:30.130
to find a marriage partner
within his own population

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:34.170
of enslaved people,
but then think nothing

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:38.710
of separating children
out as wedding gifts.

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:46.760
So yeah, it's-- that's when you
really realize the enormous gulf

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:50.120
between the past and present.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.420
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: The present.

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:53.240
Sir, if you could give us
your name and your questions.

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:54.540
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Rod
Riggers [assumed spelling]

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:55.840
from Rockville, Maryland.

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.730
My question really goes to how
we identify people in the past

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:01.570
and I noticed at the front
of this conversation,

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:04.100
some people use the term
enslaved [inaudible] enslaved.

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:09.880
So I just want to-- a discussion
on how we use identifiers

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:12.790
and how we convert
humanity or take away

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:15.090
that humanity and then in your--

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:16.390
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans:
Very perceptive.

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:19.420
She actually has a part in
the beginning of the book

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:22.260
where you talk about using
enslaved as an adjective rather

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:25.420
than enslaved as a noun,
which I think is important.

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:26.720
Yeah.

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.020
&gt;&gt; Erica Armstrong
Dunbar: You know,

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:30.180
I think in the book I explained
that when I'm teaching,

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:34.320
when I'm talking, I typically
use the phrase enslaved

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:38.450
because it reminds us that this
is an action that was taken

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:42.380
and placed on the shoulders
of enslaved Africans, right?

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:45.670
This was not something that
we should think about in terms

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:48.170
of just identity,
right, and it's forced.

00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:52.360
And that by using that
term, enslaved versus slave,

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:55.980
it reminds the reader
of exactly this.

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:59.000
However, I explained
also that I do--

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.550
I sort of move back and forth
between the term enslaved

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:05.200
and slave just for sort
of narrative reasons.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.560
When you say enslaved, enslaved,
enslaved over and over again

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.270
and when you're reading,

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:11.780
sometimes that becomes
sort of a little heavy.

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:15.570
But you're right, I'm glad yo
asked this question and I think

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:19.080
if you walked into any sort of
history class at this moment

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:21.180
in time that, you
know, we get it.

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:26.000
The term enslaved is the term
that we use to describe folks.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.300
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: I
want to move quickly.

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:28.600
So, yes, you.

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.300
&gt;&gt; I'd like to address
this to Professor Dunbar.

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:34.720
I read your book on Ona
Judge and really enjoyed it.

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.020
&gt;&gt; Erica Armstrong
Dunbar: Thank you.

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:38.840
&gt;&gt; You really have
aluminated a hidden chapter

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.980
in our early history.

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.820
And I'd like to make an
observation about the book

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:44.470
and get your response to it.

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:50.200
Much of the book deals with
the saga of an Ona living

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:53.260
in New Hampshire and
George Washington trying

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:55.500
to recapture her.

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:58.420
And on the one hand,
you have a person

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:03.900
who is triply disenfranchised
as an enslaved black woman.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.590
On the other hand, you have
by far the most powerful

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:11.270
and prestigious person in the
country and yet in the end,

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:13.320
Ona wins because she's
never brought back

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.620
from New Hampshire to slavery.

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:15.920
&gt;&gt; Erica Armstrong
Dunbar: Never caught.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.220
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans:
Spoiler alert [laughter].

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.520
[Inaudible].

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:24.890
&gt;&gt; So, I found that
rather remarkable

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:28.600
and somewhat inspiring
in a sense, actually.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.650
And I'd like your
response to that.

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:31.950
&gt;&gt; Erica Armstrong Dunbar: Sure.

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:33.250
Yeah, that's-- thank
you for that.

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:37.750
And I do think that aside from--
yes, it's called "Never Caught"

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:39.320
so you do know what
happens at the end

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.540
but still go buy the book,
thought, right, because you want

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:42.840
to find out what happens.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.850
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Yeah, you gave
away the ending in the title.

00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:46.150
How do you do that?

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:47.450
&gt;&gt; Erica Armstrong
Dunbar: It's worth it.

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:49.320
So, you know, I do
think that the struggle

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:54.060
between like the most powerful,
well-known founding father

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:59.920
and this enslaved woman who
he could never see to capture

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:03.280
and bring back into his
possession, although legally,

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.780
he had every right to do so.

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:08.170
He signed first fugitive
slave act of 1793

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:11.060
to make certain he could
cross state lines, right?

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:14.700
And because of the help from
the free black community

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:18.150
in Portsmouth, of white
sympathetic men and women

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:21.660
who were uncomfortable
with human bondage.

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:25.610
Ona is able to remain
detached, right,

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:27.330
from this sort of powerful man.

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:30.320
And I do think that it's a
story about perseverance, right?

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.490
And that's not just for her.

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:36.420
But when we think about the
experiences of the enslaved,

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:38.800
the mere fact that
we still exist

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.610
as black people is
amazing, right?

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:43.330
It is-- It was survival.

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:45.520
It was a story of survival.

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:49.320
And I think Ona kind of
helped us to remember that.

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.210
And I think sort of
at a moment in time

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:56.030
where we're thinking quite a
bit about presidential power,

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:59.280
about race that I think
Ona's story helped us sort

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:03.680
of unpack all of that
and remain optimistic.

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.400
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Yes, you.

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.700
&gt;&gt; You mentioned earlier

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:10.830
about how we're considering our
founding fathers differently

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:12.130
and in relation

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:15.200
to the confederate
memorials coming down,

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.690
some people have taken the
extreme stand that we ought

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:19.940
to be removing memorials
to the founding fathers

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:22.700
because they were slaveholders
and that sort of thing.

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:27.900
Do either of you have a
strong feelings on that topic?

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:30.600
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerrison: I think--

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:33.700
the difference I think
for the moment anyway is

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:38.760
in the conversation
around the statues.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:42.990
So, for example, they
are-- as this panel shows,

00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:46.260
there are a lot of
conversations going

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:50.940
on about the founders
and slavery.

00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:55.360
There is very little
that I'm seeing

00:39:55.360 --> 00:40:02.160
in the public discourse anyway
about the Jim Crow context

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:06.370
of the erection of the
confederate statues.

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:11.560
And to me, that is a significant
difference, which is to say,

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:17.560
we're not getting really the
history of why those monuments

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:21.890
to confederate generals and et
cetera were put up when they

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:24.620
when they were erected and why.

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:25.920
And I think--

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:27.220
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: And where.

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:28.520
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerrison:
And where, yeah.

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:32.780
So, I really do think if
we had a bit more context

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:37.870
that was visible and a plaque
in front of those monuments

00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:42.320
that thought about the
daughters of the confederacy

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:44.150
who erected these things,

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:53.190
as we're also erecting this Jim
Crow legal system, that maybe--

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:56.060
that would be a little
bit different.

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.910
But that isn't the
conversation going on.

00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:00.210
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Yeah.

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:01.510
It strikes me that a monument

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:02.810
to George Washington is
not necessarily a monument

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:05.020
to somebody who fought
for slavery but a monument

00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:07.100
to a confederate general,
it's a monument to somebody

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:08.400
who fought for slavery.

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.700
And they were erected--

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:11.570
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerrison: And
for treason [applause].

00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:12.870
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Yeah.

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:16.740
And they were erected at a time
when Jim Crow laws were trying

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:19.350
to hold back people of color
and they were erected in places

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:20.970
where people of color
would have to face them

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:22.920
and be reminded of their status.

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.760
So it's a totally
different conversation.

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.060
&gt;&gt; Erica Armstrong Dunbar: And
I do think it's important for us

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:31.330
to also recognize that there's
space for more monuments, right?

00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:36.900
That it's not simply about
tearing down monuments

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:38.200
but it's about building them.

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.670
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Are you
advocating an Ona monument?

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:42.480
Is that what you're doing?

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:43.780
Somebody from--

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:45.080
&gt;&gt; Erica Armstrong Dunbar: I'll
be collecting money at the door.

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:46.560
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans:
Can we some funding?

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:47.860
OK, yes.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:49.160
&gt;&gt; I'm [inaudible].

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:52.830
I want to thank the
panel and the discussion

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:54.160
on the enslaved women.

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:57.030
I'd like to know,
is there a story

00:41:57.030 --> 00:42:00.600
about the white women,
the white wives?

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.980
Has that story been told or is

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:06.610
that the subject of
a couple of books?

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:07.910
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerrison:
Sorry, the white--

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:09.210
&gt;&gt; Erica Armstrong
Dunbar: Wives.

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:14.550
&gt;&gt; Wives. Wife-- The wife of
Jefferson and how did they feel

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:16.170
about the relationships

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:19.670
that their husbands
had with the women?

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:20.970
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerrison: OK.

00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:22.470
&gt;&gt; And what was going
on in their minds,

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:24.580
what could you enlighten
us with.

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:26.180
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerrison:
Well, there's--

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:33.340
there has been some work
written about Jefferson's wife.

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:37.660
What-- In terms of your question
about sort of the relationship

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:43.730
or what white women kind of
thought about the relationships

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:47.380
that their men, husbands,
fathers, brothers,

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:53.370
there is in southern
society a huge cone

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:57.610
of silence about that, right?

00:42:57.610 --> 00:43:03.020
And so, what I've--
So specifically,

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:07.560
one thing for example that
I found is there are sort

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:11.580
of these tiny little mentions
long after Martha Jefferson--

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:14.370
Martha the daughter dies

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:17.580
where her son tells someone
who's doing a Jefferson

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:20.820
biography that really--
I'm paraphrasing.

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:24.300
If he'd-- If she
had her druthers,

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:26.430
this is Jefferson's daughter,

00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:30.570
Sally Hemings would have been
moved off the mountain long

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:36.530
before, in fact she never--
Jefferson refused to remove her.

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:41.390
And Martha's daughter Ellen
talks with real disdain

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:44.840
and condescension
that reverberates

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:48.500
across the centuries
about the yellow children

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:50.720
at Monticello, right?

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:54.740
So, in all of those-- and
even in sort of the stories

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:58.450
that they tell, he
white women tell,

00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:03.690
about where all these
light-skinned children came

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:05.730
from or-- and there's--

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:11.730
they never even mentioned Sally
Hemings' children by name.

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:16.300
Not once. They don't even honor
their humanity with their name.

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:17.640
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: One
thing you'll learn

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:20.210
from reading both
books but particularly

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:23.330
from reading Catherine's book
is there's a lot about the lives

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:26.290
of the women because,
you know, there's a lot

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:28.960
about how they wrote to each
other and how they talked

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.360
about how they were feeling.

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:33.480
And so you do get a real sense
of what it's like to be a wife,

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:35.980
not necessarily Jefferson's
wife because she died

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:37.280
so quickly in the story.

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:41.040
But, you know, there is that
area but we're making the point

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.610
that the slaves, you
don't get any of that,

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:46.510
because they weren't allowed to
memorialize their experiences.

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:47.810
Yes.

00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:50.430
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Mimi
and I'm a recent graduate

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:51.730
of the University of Virginia.

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:55.010
And so I've lived
in Charlottesville

00:44:55.010 --> 00:45:00.450
for the past four years and
seen a lot of things changing

00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:05.530
and moving through the city and
I've been really [inaudible]

00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:10.890
by the work of my friends
and students that I've tried

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:14.290
to hold the administration
accountable.

00:45:14.290 --> 00:45:15.590
I'm sorry.

00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:19.720
And I was just wondering what
you as professors would say

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:23.790
that students and alumni could
do to keep that conversation

00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:27.120
and accountability moving
forward because we don't want

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:29.210
that to go away at
all and there's still

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:31.460
so much to be reckoned with.

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:33.080
So I wanted your advice on that.

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.380
&gt;&gt; Erica Armstrong Dunbar:
Oh, that's a great question.

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:39.660
Thank you for that [applause].

00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:42.520
I mean I-- if I may, I'll jump
in and I'll say, you know,

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:46.400
I think students should
do what they are doing,

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:49.120
keep doing what they are
doing which is don't be quiet.

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:52.750
That's the great thing about
being a college student, right?

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.460
Speak your mind and stand
behind those words too.

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:01.000
And I do think we're
seeing student groups

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.950
across the country doing
exactly that whether it's

00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:08.170
at Chapel Hill, at University
of North Carolina, whether it's

00:46:08.170 --> 00:46:12.560
at antiracist protests
in Charlottesville,

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:16.410
that in the past
we've seen movements,

00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:21.550
really being supported and moved
forward by students, right?

00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:26.170
And so if students continue to
hold administrations accountable

00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:30.540
for what the student body
has to endure every day,

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:32.910
whether it's walking
into a building named

00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:36.100
after a slaveholder,
right, or laying your head

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:40.630
in a dorm every night in a
building named after those

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:45.350
who traded and sold enslaved
people, we have to continue

00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:49.310
as professors and students
to remind folks that we have

00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:54.010
to rethink this and it's
up to us to rename it.

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:57.030
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerrison: And what
I would say quickly is continue

00:46:57.030 --> 00:47:01.960
to press for courses that
deal with this history, right,

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:04.470
because as you can see,
there's still a lot

00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:07.320
of the history to be written.

00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:14.460
And urge college
students particularly

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:18.680
to vote, right, to regret--

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:25.770
[ Applause ]

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:31.910
To reject the displays
that we saw last year

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:35.930
as unacceptable in
a civil society.

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:39.290
So thank you for your
question [applause].

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:40.590
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans:
Well, I can't think

00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:42.880
of a better note
to end our time.

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.920
I've been told we're
out of time.

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:48.550
So, apologies to those of you
who wanted to ask question

00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:50.750
but didn't get to ask one.

00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:56.200
Once more, a round of
applause for Erica Dunbar,

00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:57.500
Catherine Kerrison [applause].
