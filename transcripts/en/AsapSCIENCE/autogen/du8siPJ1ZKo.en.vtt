00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.880
 Being a teenager means a wonderful time of exploring, learning, and building friendships, but also 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.220
 Is the time of rapid changes, ups and downs when things are difficult 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.190
 So, what gets into our minds and bodies that makes us feel this way? 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.740
 Why is it difficult to be a teenager? 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.160
 They have always told us that the most important years of mind development are between 0-5 years 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.820
 Although recent studies have shown that adolescence is just as important. 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.640
 During childhood, our minds continue to grow, and continue to produce gray matter until it reaches maximum 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.780
 Measurement, as girls reach 12 years of age and males at the age of 14 years 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.070
 The brain works more efficiently by eliminating the gray matter that has not been used 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.559
 And at the same time produce myelin-fatty tissue that isolates brain pathways 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.000
 The stage of puberty begins from the hypothalamus (one of the parts of the brain's core), where the globular hormone is produced, stimulating 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.180
 The pituitary gland releases the hormones testosterone, estrogen and progesterone. These hormones 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.450
 Activates ovaries and testicles, but also causes emotionally rich experiences 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.939
 Whether it made you yawn or drive 180 km / h on the highway 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.409
 Your response to emotionally charged images or sounds will make you tougher 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.359
 Listening to the One Direction band may give rise to emotional shifts. 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:23.229
 The area responsible for advance planning and risk assessment is still immature in adolescents 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.240
 This is why adolescents are involved in risky behaviors 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.069
 Such as illegal relationships, drinking, and driving. Surprising that in the simulation driving experience, 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:38.340
 The adults and teenagers took the same recklessness when they were alone; but when they were surrounded 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.539
 With fans or friends, adolescents took higher risks while adults were not affected. 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.999
 What is the purpose of this action? Accept its peers. 

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:51.119
 In a study where adolescents were asked to classify music, their choice was influenced by their knowledge or ignorance of what their peers chose. 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.819
 Unlike children and adults, you feel like a teenager 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:01.509
 Socially isolated creates a strong sense of this vanity with our vitality 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:07.340
 Adolescents may make their friends a priority on their families. 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.930
 As social reasons, getting out of the family safety creates a society that is genetically disorganized, downplayed 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.319
 Proportion of marriage. In fact, adolescents have social capabilities 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.459
 And a better separation of facial expressions compared to all other ages, making adolescents 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.689
 Greater awareness of the joy of friends, grief, pressure. 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:30.060
 In talking about pressure, the hormone is produced at the time of pressure to help relieve 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.650
 Stress on brain cells in children and adults has an adverse effect on adolescents 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.750
 Causing an increase in tension. Coupled with a change in the rhythmic rhythms of the clock that make their bodice stay flat 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.569
 For another 3-4 hours, I was surprised that some people describe teenagers 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:46.599
 With moody people 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.769
 On the other hand, teenagers are considered to be very healthy physically. The immune system is very effective 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.700
 Adolescents have high adaptation to temperature changes and greater cancer immunity. But 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:03.670
 Regardless of physical fitness, records show a 200 to 300% increase in mortality rates after childhood 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.579
 Due to car accidents, homicides, and suicide. 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.379
 Scientists believe that 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.420
 The many changes in white matter, gray, and brain connections are blamed 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.920
 Which may raise the risk of mistakes during adolescence. 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.019
 But with large numbers of network connections, high flexibility, the brain of the teenager 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.180
 Come to learn faster and remember content quickly. In contrast to the old-fashioned brains of his school 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.420
 Adolescents can respond faster to their environment and leapfrog steps 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.749
 In communication and social integration. Not to mention being passionate, it gives valuable value. 

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:39.750
 Sometimes risking is needed to make a difference in your life and the lives of others. 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.569
 Being a teenager may be difficult, but it can be amazing. 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.930
 If you want to know what teenagers are the supernatural fans and become obsessed
