00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.310
The process of making a movie is one long
series of decisions. The filmmakers have to

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.290
make sure everything (from casting choices
to shot selection) are up to par so they can

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.990
make the best film possible. However, sometimes
they can over-think themselves and end up

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.830
being a bad call and derailing the project
before it even hits theaters.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.910
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Decisions That Ruined
Movies.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.580
A Venomous Force

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.940
After the success of Spider-Man 2, moviegoers
couldn�t wait for the follow-up, especially

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.430
when it was announced that fan-favorite villain
Venom would be a part of the film. However,

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.620
Eddie Brock is seen by many as a missed opportunity.
Part of that is perhaps due to director Sam

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.250
Raimi not wanting to use the character, wishing
to focus instead on Sandman and Harry Osborne

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.431
as the New Goblin. But Sony, aware of Venom�s
large marketing pull, forced the director

00:00:52.431 --> 00:00:54.812
to put him in the film, and the end result
was something that felt tacked on in a movie

00:00:54.812 --> 00:01:01.879
that already had a lot to unpack. Sony just
should have let Raimi do his thing.

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.750
The Force is Strong With This Kid

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.460
The Star Wars prequels had a ton of potential,
but largely failed to live up to the visions

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.500
we all had. Though they had many downsides,
one of the most unforgivable was George Lucas�

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.759
decision to make Anakin Skywalker a 9-year
old kid in The Phantom Menace. Due to his

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.429
age and where he�s introduced in the film,
Anakin felt like a side player in the story

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:25.950
� when the trilogy was supposed to be about
him � and by the time we got to Episode

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.860
II, he was so much older that it was like
meeting a new character instead of seeing

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.509
a natural progression like Luke.

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:33.990
The Ending Is Not Legend

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.900
Fans of the source material novel took issue
with the film�s ending, which deviated from

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.270
the book and showed Dr. Robert Neville sacrifice
himself so Anna could get away with a cure.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.170
Many viewers prefer the �alternate� original
conclusion, which featured Neville discovering

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.630
the Darkseekers he�s been hunting are real
individuals with feelings and emotions. This

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.479
was very thought provoking and stayed true
to the story�s intended themes. So why did

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.679
WB change it? Test screening reactions to
the heady ending were negative, so it was

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.930
scrapped for what we saw in the theatrical
cut. At least the home media version preserves

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:03.990
the �better� iteration of the movie.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.990
Singer Doesn�t Return

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.259
After X2 ended with a tease for the iconic
Dark Phoenix saga, fans eagerly anticipated

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.280
the follow-up, but things took a dark turn
when Bryan Singer left the project and gave

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.909
way to Bret Ratner. Instead of sticking with
the original treatment that was more loyal

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:21.890
to the comics, X-Men 3 tried to balance two
famous storylines � Dark Phoenix and mutant

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.819
cure � without developing either of them
fully. With no real emotional payoff and too

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.120
many mutant characters and subplots, the film
derailed the franchise for an extended period

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.760
of time. If only Singer had stayed on, things
might have turned out in a better and more

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.140
entertaining way.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.470
Batman for the Family

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.790
After�Batman Returns�received complaints
for its dark tone and grossed less than its

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.900
predecessor, WB decided to take the franchise
in a more kid-friendly direction. This caused

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.980
star�Michael Keaton and director Tim Burton
to not return for Batman Forever, sending

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.470
the series down a dark road. Joel Schumacher
embraced the camp and seemingly missed what

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.459
made Bruce Wayne such a compelling character.
The film was also accused of being excessively

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.769
commercial to market toys and merchandise
to children. WB would have been smarter to

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.299
keep Keaton and Burton in-house and rely on
Superman for more easy-going fare. This is

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.530
one instance where brooding is OK.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.219
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Trilogy

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:18.090
The Middle-earth faithful couldn�t wait
to see Peter Jackson�s Hobbit adaptation

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.079
after the success of Lord of the Rings, but
that enthusiasm turned to cautious optimism

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:28.989
when it was announced the small book would
be split into three films. Instead of a rousing

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.180
fantasy adventure, viewers were �treated�
to a narrative spread thin over multiple features

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.359
that dragged on for interminable lengths.
Jackson over-indulged, injecting the new trilogy

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.889
with too much CGI action and not enough substance
to make us care. It�s a shame, because he

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:46.410
was able to direct some standout sequences,
so if he produced a single, more focused movie

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.020
it may have turned out fine.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.180
Iron Man 2? Not Too Fast�

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.749
Once Iron Man made Marvel Studios a force
to be reckoned with, fans couldn�t wait

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:58.870
for the sequel � and neither could the studio.
As they planned ahead to forge the road to

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.629
The Avengers, their production schedules put
a great deal of stress on their filmmakers,

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.889
including Jon Favreau. Iron Man 2 was rushed
through pre-production, giving Favreau not

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.159
enough time to balance Tony Stark�s story
with the larger shared universe connections

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:14.240
Marvel wanted. The end result was a messy
film that fumbled a compelling character narrative

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.670
and complex villain as the studio seemed more
occupied on the future instead of the present

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.920
with a larger role for SHIELD and hints at
what�s to come.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.250
In Brightest Day and CGI

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.720
Warner Bros. finally looked to expand their
DC library when they made a Green Lantern

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.560
film in 2011, but it ended up doing more damage
than good. The movie was sullied by poor execution

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.840
and an undercooked script, which relied more
on CGI wizardry than anything else. Martin

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.990
Campbell seemed out of his element, as the
action sequences he crafted were seen as silly

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.080
and not that exciting. He even admitted that
the team wasn�t exactly sure what to do

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.650
with the power ring constructs, saying that
it was �as much as your imagination can

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.020
go.� Normally that creativity is inspiring,
but a tighter focus on the direction would

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.630
have helped immensely.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.759
Fincher�s Fox�s Alien 3

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:02.580
David Fincher is regarded as one of this generation�s
finest directors, so it seems odd Fox would

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.580
undercut him so much during the process of
Alien 3. Afterwards, Fincher went so far as

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.690
to disown the film, since the studio overrode
many of his decisions and interfered with

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.520
production throughout principal photography.
It also didn�t help that before Fincher

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.530
came on, Fox scrapped a script by Vincent
Ward, which is considered to be one of the

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.130
greatest sci-fi movies NEVER made. So in addition
to not letting a soon-to-be respected auteur

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.990
do his magic, the studio even chose the wrong
concept, which angered many longtime fans

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.990
of the franchise. Is there ever a scenario
where studio meddling is the best option?

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.560
2 Fast, 0 Diesel

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.889
Vin Diesel is the face of the Fast and Furious
franchise now, but he sat the second installment

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:42.190
out after saying the script wasn�t up to
par. Because of this, Universal dismantled

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.729
the project and wrote a new screenplay, leaving
Paul Walker�s Brian O�Connor as the only

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:50.789
remaining original character. Originally set
to be a story of Dom and Brian teaming up

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:55.480
to take down a drug kingpin, the film �evolved�
into something that felt more episodic than

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.270
continuation and was criticized for being
loosely connected to the franchise. Maybe

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.889
Universal should have worked things out with
Diesel and brought the fan-favorite back in

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.330
the fold.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.319
