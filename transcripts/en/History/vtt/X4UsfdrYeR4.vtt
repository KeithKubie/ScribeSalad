00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.220
- Hey [inaudible].

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:01.800
This is Delta-1.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.900
A wounded eagle needs
immediate cash and back.

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:05.038
Over.

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:06.506
(OVER RADIO) Roger that.

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:07.440
Inbound.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.308
[spanish]

00:00:11.043 --> 00:00:12.912
[automatic gunfire]

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:15.815
(OVER RADIO)
Delta-1, Raptor 6-6.

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:17.150
We are taking heavy fire.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.551
We have to abort.

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:21.054
She promised you my
network, didn't she?

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:23.022
You know how the CIA works.

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:25.058
She promised me everything.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:26.892
They lie all the time.

00:00:26.992 --> 00:00:28.327
You know that.

00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:31.564
But we can use it against her.

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:33.599
She is our asset.

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.135
We can feed her whatever
information we want.

00:00:36.235 --> 00:00:38.371
I think I might have the
location of the [inaudible]..

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:40.139
We'll need to
get a visual first.

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.941
And one of our guys on the
ground to mark the target.

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:44.076
Raptor 6-6.

00:00:44.176 --> 00:00:45.411
This is Delta-2.

00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:48.081
My position is marked
by a VS-17 panel.

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:50.850
Target, seven meters.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.285
(OVER RADIO) I have a visual.

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:54.253
You're inside our
margin of error.

00:00:54.353 --> 00:00:56.755
I need approval, over.
[gunfire]

00:00:56.855 --> 00:00:57.756
No!

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:59.258
Do it now!

00:00:59.358 --> 00:01:03.363
(OVER RADIO) Raptor
2-2, going hot.

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:05.265
[explosions]

00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:10.703
(OVER RADIO)
Target neutralized.

00:01:10.803 --> 00:01:13.139
Delta-2, Delta-1, radio check.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:16.275
The Prince is still
in that building.

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:17.643
We need a reaper
standing by ASAP.

00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:18.744
Negative.

00:01:18.844 --> 00:01:20.145
This is now a rescue mission.

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:21.981
You want a drone asset
to do your dirty work,

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:23.716
you call in your own.

00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:25.718
Give me the phone.

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:31.523
[phone voice] 100 meters.

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:34.293
On target.

00:01:34.393 --> 00:01:37.730
[screaming, gunfire]

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.134
Hey!

00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:44.637
They're on my decks.

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:45.638
[gunfire]

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:47.573
Who's done now?

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:48.408
Let's move.

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:50.476
We're running out a tunnel.

00:01:50.576 --> 00:01:51.477
[gunfire, grunt]

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:53.145
It's been a hell
of a ride, boys.

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:55.114
One mag left.

00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:57.816
Make 'em count.

00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:00.019
[shouting]

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.155
Target secure.

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:05.357
I'm sorry about Fish.

00:02:05.457 --> 00:02:06.959
I think we got the Prince.

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:09.028
But I need to know for sure.

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:12.031
You or me, Gina.

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:14.834
Just like before, huh?

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:15.869
Gun to my head.

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:23.509
[gunfire]

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.445
[explosion]

00:02:31.617 --> 00:02:32.819
Mother of god.

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:38.724
Fish is out of surgery.

00:02:38.824 --> 00:02:42.461
He's alive, and he's tough,
and they got the best doctors

00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:44.264
in land still working on him.

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:47.534
You guys did everything
you could, you understand?

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:49.301
What about Nasry?

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:52.805
(VOICEOVER) This is a
message to you, America.

00:02:52.905 --> 00:02:55.008
You thought you could kill me.

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:56.208
Your Seals tried.

00:02:56.308 --> 00:02:57.577
Your drones tried.

00:02:57.677 --> 00:02:58.945
Your CIA tried.

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:04.783
But I am still here, because
you cannot kill an idea.

00:03:04.883 --> 00:03:11.224
To Joe Graves, to Buddha Ortiz,
to the apostate Armin Khan,

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:13.359
I remember your faces.

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.728
I know your names.

00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:18.931
You will pay for the death
of our martyred prince,

00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:20.166
Tamerlin Shishoni.

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:21.800
I'm taking my own team, Bear.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.269
OK.

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.071
If that's what you want.
[knocking]

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:26.139
I'll get it.

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.406
Lily.

00:03:27.506 --> 00:03:28.674
(VOICEOVER) You
will never be safe.

00:03:28.774 --> 00:03:31.043
[gunfire]

00:03:31.143 --> 00:03:33.947
Where is he?

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:37.216
[gunfire, crying]

00:03:37.316 --> 00:03:38.384
Get help.

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:39.185
Now.

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:40.787
[phone ringing]

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:41.954
[recording] Hey, it's Lena.

00:03:42.054 --> 00:03:43.256
Leave a message.

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:45.391
You asked if we're
going to make it.

00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:48.026
So I'm saying it now.

00:03:48.126 --> 00:03:48.961
Yes.

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:51.363
Stay there.

00:03:51.463 --> 00:03:53.833
We're gonna make it.

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:55.335
[inaudible]

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:59.572
I'm coming home.

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:00.306
I love you.

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:03.443
