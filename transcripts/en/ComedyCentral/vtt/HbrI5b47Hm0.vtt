00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:07.407
- Oh hello.

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:09.742
I was just warming
myself by the fire.

00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:12.712 align:start size:84% position:16%
(log crashing
loudly and hissing)

00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.780
Welcome to Badass
Bitches of History.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.048
I'm Jenny Zigrino.

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:17.349
My guest today is Anne Hutchin--

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:18.184
(glass crashing and breaking)

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:19.252 line:0%
- Whooo!

00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:20.353 line:0%
Patriots won!

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.388 line:0%
Wicked!

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:24.089 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I didn't know
you liked football.

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:25.291
- What's football?

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:26.526 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Anne, are you sure
you should be doing that

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.027
when you're pregnant?

00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:30.296
- I stood up against the
Church, the government,

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:32.865
and I was on trial whilst
bakin' this friggin' bun.

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:34.267
I think I can handle my shit.

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:36.102
- Gross.

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:37.403
- So we doin' this?

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:39.572
Mama's gotta piss
like a racehorse.

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:42.375 align:start size:84% position:16%
- We're here in
17th century Boston,

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.711
and Anne Hutchinson is a
mother, she's a midwife--

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:45.945
- And I was wicked smart.

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:48.147
I'm chillin' in the
new colony of Boston,

00:00:48.147 --> 00:00:50.583 align:start size:97% position:3%
way before New York was
around 'cause Yankees suck,

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:52.485 line:0%
and John Winthrop
was the governor.

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:54.454
Also a massive asshole.

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:56.488 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And while she's chillin',
she starts preaching

00:00:56.488 --> 00:00:58.657
her own version of the
Bible from her home.

00:00:58.657 --> 00:00:59.892
(water splashing)

00:00:59.892 --> 00:01:01.460 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh shit, my
water's just broke.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.064
(shouting and groaning)

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:05.665 align:start size:94% position:6%
- She actually splits
the colony between people

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:07.500 align:start size:94% position:6%
who believe in a covenant
of grace versus--

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.968 align:start size:88% position:13%
(groaning and screaming)
Are you okay?

00:01:09.968 --> 00:01:11.404
- Oh, yeah.
(baby crying)

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.006
I have 15 of these things.

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:14.173
- That was fast.

00:01:14.173 --> 00:01:15.841 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So anyway, my
sermons were the shit.

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:17.343
They were the talk of the town,

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:20.279 align:start size:97% position:3%
but the dudes of Boston have
huge egos and tiny dicks,

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:22.982
so, they got jealous. (sighs)

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:24.517
(gavel hammering loudly)

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:27.786
- We the people of Boston,
meaning the men of Boston,

00:01:27.786 --> 00:01:31.524 align:start position:0%
formally declare Anne Hutchinson
to be guilty of heresy,

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:33.760
and also of kind
of being a bitch.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.127
- Go fuck yourself, Smith!

00:01:35.127 --> 00:01:37.430
- Smile wouldn't kill ya, hon.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.131
- I was killin' it
during my trial.

00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:40.700 align:start size:84% position:16%
I stood up for
what I believed in,

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.002
religious friggin' freedom.

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:45.638
I told those dickheads
off and I almost won too.

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:47.439
- Almost!

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.675
Until she said God spoke to her.

00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:50.843
(gavel hammering)

00:01:50.843 --> 00:01:51.878
- Ha ha!

00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:53.145
I gotcha!

00:01:53.145 --> 00:01:56.782
God doesn't talk to
women, she is guilty!

00:01:56.782 --> 00:01:59.285
- Then they banished her to--

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:02.187 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Rhode Fucking Island.
(door slamming)

00:02:02.187 --> 00:02:04.790
- Okay, sure, you got banished,

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.660
but we did name a highway
after you in the Bronx.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.161 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh yeah yeah,
real friggin' honor,

00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:11.664
having my road in the same
borough as Yankee Stadium?

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:13.533 align:start size:84% position:16%
That was the real
friggin' punishment.

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:15.635 align:start size:94% position:6%
- But Anne, you inspire
people who fight for truth

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:17.470 align:start size:81% position:19%
and justice--
- Yeah yeah yeah,

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.671
you seen my kid?

00:02:21.073 --> 00:02:22.208
I was just--

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:25.678 align:start size:94% position:6%
Oh never mind, it's cool,
I'll make a new one.

00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:32.752
- It's not too bad,
look, lobster rolls,

00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:35.388 line:0%
and there's one big city.

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:37.090 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
Look at that, there's
a guy in a boat!
