[yelling in mix of english and japanese] What do you mean you can't spend Christmas with me

At the last second,

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.660
I changed my mind.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.680
You know, Anna Kay

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.720
When it comes to death,

00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.560
Why rush?

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.580
We all get there sooner or later.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:10.480
The only thing guaranteed when we're born are death and change.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.220
As I was trying to drown the thought came to me.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.920
Why not wait for the next wave of change?

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:21.100
Things were hard, then.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.120
I was depressed.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.240
And I felt...

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.240
Hopeless

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.080
But what if I stayed?

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.320
What beautiful things could be waiting for me?

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.560
-Christina's room, as you can see

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.620
Everything is back in here together

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.840
You know, baby

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.180
You can die anytime.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.160
What's the rush?
