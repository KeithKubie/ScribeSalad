00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.820
- [Instructor] Let's see if we can name

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:03.270
this guy right over here.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.600
And so like always,

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.930
we always wanna look for
the longest carbon chain

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.560
or the longest carbon cycle,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.940
and I think it's pretty
obvious from this picture

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.210
that we have a very long carbon cycle here

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.490
that we can start,

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.530
or we can just look at this.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.250
We have one, two, three, four,

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.960
five, six, seven, eight carbons

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.690
in a cycle right over here,

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.930
and so we can call this backbone,

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.320
which is the backbone of our
molecule right over here,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.210
this is cyclooctane.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.200
Cyclooctane.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.410
It's an octane in a cycle.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.040
It's an alkane because
it's all single bonds

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.873
right over here,

00:00:44.873 --> 00:00:46.450
so that is cyclooctane.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.940
Now let's think about the different groups

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.710
that are attached to this
backbone right over here.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.420
So first we can look at
this one right over here,

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.640
and we can ask ourselves,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.330
well, how many carbons are there?

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.390
How many carbons?

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.250
Well, there's one, two, three,

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.480
four carbons that are
attached to the backbone.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.850
So our prefix for when we're dealing

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.440
with four carbons is but-,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.610
and it is in a cycle,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.819
so this is a cyclobutyl group.

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:14.736
Cyclobutyl.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.700
And we also have another
cyclobutyl right over here.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.523
So this is another cyclobutyl.

00:01:24.895 --> 00:01:27.960
Cyclobutyl.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.590
Bu-, I'm misspelling it,

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.640
cyclobutyl group.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.510
Now let's think about

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.700
this one right over here.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.240
How many carbons are there?

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.030
We have one, two, three carbons.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.420
So our prefix when we're dealing

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.850
with three carbons is prop-,

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.720
and they're in a cycle, as well,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.853
so this is a cyclopropyl group.

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:53.590
Cyclopropyl.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.880
This is a cyclopropyl group.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.360
And now we can jump
over to these two groups

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.193
right over here.

00:01:59.193 --> 00:02:00.940
We see that these are
clearly the same groups.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.470
Let's count the number
of carbons they have.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.880
We have one, two, three, four carbons.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.210
So if we're dealing with four carbons,

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.700
we would think about the prefix but-,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.820
but this isn't in a cycle

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.880
and it's not in just a straight chain.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.340
It has this Y shape.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.110
And so the common name when
we end up with this Y shape,

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.170
when we're attached
down here and then that,

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.003
we're attached to one carbon here

00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:26.660
and that's attached to kind of this

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.493
carbon right over here

00:02:27.493 --> 00:02:29.350
that's then attached to these other two,

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.790
this is a isobutyl group,

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.555
which we've seen multiple times before.

00:02:34.555 --> 00:02:38.430
Isobutyl group.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.560
And of course this one is
an isobutyl group, as well.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.500
So these are both isobutyl groups.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.290
Now the next thing we need to think about

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.030
is how we can number it.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.320
We wanna go back to our main carbon chain,

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.720
which in this case is a cycle,

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.880
and think about how we wanna number.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.448
And the convention is to start numbering

00:02:58.448 --> 00:03:02.820
at the thing that is first
in alphabetical order.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.350
And when we're considering
alphabetical order,

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.380
we think even the C in cyclo

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.080
and we think of the I in isobutyl.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.730
If this was tert- or sec-,

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.470
you wouldn't think about the T or the S

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.580
in secbutyl or tertbutyl,

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.550
but for isobutyl,

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.610
you do consider the I.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.898
For the cyclos, you consider the C.

00:03:17.898 --> 00:03:19.224
And so when you look at it that way,

00:03:19.224 --> 00:03:22.560
all of the Cs come before the Is,

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.910
and then amongst the Cs,

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.410
these all have cyclos,

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.020
but the cyclobutyl comes before
cyclopropyl or cyclooctane.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.440
B comes before P or O.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.170
So the thing that is first
alphabetically are both of these,

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.250
both of these cyclobutyls.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.780
So we can start numbering

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.780
at where either of them attach
to the main carbon backbone.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.080
But we have to,

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.560
or those are,

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.880
I guess we should say
those are both options,

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.580
but we wanna number from the one

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.600
that is gonna give us the
total lowest numbering.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.570
So let's think about that a little bit.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.500
So we could say, let's number from here.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.130
Let's make this the one carbon.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.660
And so that we hit something
else as soon as possible,

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.800
'cause remember we're trying
to minimize the numbers here,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.610
we might wanna go clockwise,

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.783
so we hit a two right over here,

00:04:10.783 --> 00:04:15.783
three, four, five, six, seven.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.560
So in this situation,

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.120
where do we hit interesting things?

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.300
We hit interesting things
at the one, at the two,

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.740
or where do we have groups
attached to the chain?

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.050
One, two, four,

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.120
six and seven.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.160
So that's one option.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.100
We'll have things at groups

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.390
attached at one, two, four, six,

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.840
and seven if we start right over there

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.150
and if we were to go clockwise.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.820
Our other option,

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.800
one, two, four, six, seven.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.380
Our other option is to start,

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.980
and let me erase those.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.760
Our other option is to start
at this other cyclobutyl,

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.470
this other cyclobutyl
group here on the left.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.570
Let me erase these so I don't
mess up the diagram too much.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.720
The other option is to start here,

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.083
make this the one,

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.590
number this as one,

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.930
and then we would also go clockwise

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.240
to hit the cyclopropyl as soon as quick,

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.380
to hit something else as soon as possible.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.380
So two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.530
So now where are we
hitting interesting things?

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.190
We have groups at the one
carbon, the two carbon,

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.080
the four carbon, the five carbon,

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.683
and the seven carbon.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.920
So actually, this second
numbering is preferable.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.860
Both of them have something
at the one, the two,

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.990
the four, and the seven,

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.030
but the second one has something at a five

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.950
while the first one
had something at a six.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.870
So we would actually want to do

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.420
this numbering right over here,

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.600
and this is the numbering
that we now have on our,

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.660
that we have now listed right over here.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.660
Let's now write what the name
of this molecule actually is.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:53.840
So once again,

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.150
we start first in alphabetical order.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.880
So we're gonna start with
the cyclobutyl groups,

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.550
and we have two of them,

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.920
one at the one carbon

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.570
and one at the four carbon.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.340
So we could say one comma four,

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.350
and since there are two cyclobutyl groups,

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.047
we would say dicyclobutyl.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.490
1,4-Dicyclobutyl.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.180
And then what comes next
in alphabetical order

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.950
is the cyclopropyl.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.660
That comes before isobutyl.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.310
C comes before I.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.300
That's at the two carbon.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.663
So then we can say 2-cyclopropyl.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.740
And now we can get to the two isobutyls,

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.380
so there's an isobutyl at the five carbon

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.510
and at the seven carbon.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.270
So we can say five, seven,

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.103
and since there's two of them,

00:06:56.103 --> 00:06:57.540
we'd say diisobutyl.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.280
5,7-diisobutyl.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:09.030
So diisobutyl.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.990
And then we just give
the name of the backbone.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.510
We've tackled, we've done the butyls,

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.500
the dicyclobutyls right there,

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.260
the cyclopropyl,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.520
the two isobutyls,

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.633
and now we just write cyclooctane.

00:07:22.316 --> 00:07:27.316
Cyclooctane.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:29.120
And we are done.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.750
We have successfully named the molecule.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.096
And this was kind of fun.

00:07:33.096 --> 00:07:35.250
It's like a secret code or something.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.900
Now you wouldn't expect naming
organic molecules to be,

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.163
I think, quite so satisfying, but it is.
