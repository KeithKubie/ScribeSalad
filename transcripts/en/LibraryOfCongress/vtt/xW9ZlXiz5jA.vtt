&gt;&gt; George Barnum:
Today's lecture,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.840
today's presentations are part
of our Mike Denker Fellowship.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.550
Mike Denker was a beloved

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.460
and cherished early
member of this chapter.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.470
He-- it was really--

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.520
he was really the gas on
which this chapter ran

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.820
for a number of years.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.970
He and Chris Manson
and a few other people.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.740
We lost Mike a few years ago
to cancer, and the way that we

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.460
in the chapter decided that we
could honor him, was to think

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.210
about what a terrific natural,
instinctive teacher he was,

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.920
and how many people he brought
into the chapter for us.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.830
Just by his very nature, just
by the way that he would get

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.490
into conversations with people

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.740
and start teaching
them about printing.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.760
And so, we have been
sponsoring young people,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.720
students as members of
AFA, and of the chapter,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.080
and encouraging them to
participate in stuff with us.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.600
And then we ask this
tiny, little payback

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.190
that they give us a presentation
at the end of the year.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.920
I'm going to be talking
with our three this year;

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.980
two of whom are here
to talk to us today,

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.060
about ways that we
can sort of strengthen

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.960
that bond, in going forward.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.630
Ways that we can reach
out a little bit better

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.640
and make it a little
bit easier for them

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.120
to actually do stuff with us.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.340
So without too much further ado,

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.420
I do want to thank Mr. Jimmy
Nation who walks in on cue,

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.720
[laughter]; well done.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.280
And Stephanie Stillo and
the rest of the staff

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.530
of the Rare Books and
Special Collections Division

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.890
of the Library of
Congress, for hosting us.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.930
We always appreciate the fact

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.690
that we can treat this
room as our living room.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.370
And thank you very, very much.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.440
And I will, without any
further ado, introduce our two--

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.070
two of our three
Denker Fellows for 2018,

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.890
Casey Vanatta and Layla Saad.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.190
And Casey's leading off.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.990
So have at it.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.820
[ Applause ]

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.120
&gt;&gt; Cassandra (Casey)
Vanatta: Thank you.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.420
So yeah, I'm Casey Vanatta.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.890
I'm coming from Kutztown
University.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.130
I am in the CD department,
graphic design,

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.260
senior year, so it's
wrapping up.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.790
I'm kind of going
to start the talk

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.990
about like how I
got into this world.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.630
It's literally just a world
that wraps me up in it.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.660
I started my first
print, 10th grade.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.240
So I don't know if I
was late to the party,

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.700
early to the party,
but it was exciting.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.860
This print, the red and black
white was the first print I

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.160
ever did.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.520
I did a series of the
colors and I got into--

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.710
displayed at the Harrisburg
state capitol building,

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.360
which is like, "Wow, that's
really cool that I had

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.740
that great success with the
first print I ever did."

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.170
So I kind of got hooked,

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.000
and it's a later
edition with the colors.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.220
And then I also got
introduced to wood cut printing,

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.960
which was an experience
in itself.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.870
I don't know how
I felt about that;

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.170
I've done it a few times since.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.350
It was a lot of patience;
you learn a lot of patience

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.180
in this whole art form.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.480
And then, so yeah.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.920
I come to college, I'm hooked
on letter press printmaking

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.290
and I have a class
with Ann Levin;

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.670
have to give a little shout out
and I did a lot of products--

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.240
or projects that I can grab

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.420
into graphic design
and use my projects.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.460
So you see I have a little
ampersand letter press I used

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.780
for packaging.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.360
I was really just trying to
always touch art for like,

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.140
fine art art forms in my
projects as much as possible.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.960
So there's the one design I did.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.570
And then I also did an
entire children's book,

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.890
all of lino cuts.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.150
I thought I was crazy; I think
Ann thought I was a little crazy

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.450
for doing it.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.660
But it led to me getting this
text over the summer saying,

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.990
"Would you like to be the
letter press monitor?"

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.290
And I'm like, "Sure."

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.350
She said next year; that gives
me a great time to learn it,

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.780
because I've only done
it once since that.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.150
[laughter] I didn't-- it
almost didn't even happen;

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.190
because of a family emergency
I missed my training day.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.720
It was like so popular,
I was like, "Oh my gosh.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.020
I'm never going to
get a chance to do

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.920
like letter press printmaking"
because this filled up.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.420
But I got another
slot; I was so excited.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.220
I did "Happy birthday
day, Dad" on a card.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.510
I wish I had a photo; I
forgot to take a photo,

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.810
but it's very treasured.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.290
It sits by my parents' TV

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.750
and I always see it
every time I go home,

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.000
my first ever "Happy
birthday day, Dad" print.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.420
So I got that text from
her, and I'm like, "Yeah,

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.720
sure; it'll be great."

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.960
Little did I know she meant
my junior year, last year.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.620
First week back to school I had
to help teach graduate students.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.920
I had no clue what I was doing.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.220
I'm like, "Oh my god."

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.060
And then I get thrown
into teaching.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.320
So the first project I did
by myself, with no help,

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.900
was this five lines of text;
and I was so proud of myself.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.040
It only took me like two
and a half hours, maybe.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.080
Only to print it and realize
I did it all backwards.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.330
[laughter] Oh man!

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.530
It was a great learning
experience.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.530
But which is also from
"Hedwig and the Angry Inch."

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.510
I don't if I have any
fans of that musical here.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.370
Yeah? So it's from the song.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.540
But I gave it to my tattoo
artist and he was very excited

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.840
because he got me into it.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.510
So I just have some
other small projects

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.310
that I tackled throughout
the time,

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.090
during the same time I'm
teaching other students how

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.900
to do the printmaking process.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.300
I'm getting involved training
them so they can then do it.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.590
Which, I have two trainees
here that we've got hooked.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.970
Makes me so excited,
which is the type

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.370
that it was locked up,
is the printing here.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.430
I did some thank you cards.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.230
Christmas tags were one of
my favorite things I printed.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.530
I actually want to
get some soon.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.500
They were so fun; such
a nice little addition

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.740
to add to Christmas gifts.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.780
During this oppor-- I've loved
how many doors have been opened

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.270
to me through the like
printmaking world.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.790
I get to meet so many people.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.710
We did this event last year
through our AIGA chapter

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.380
and we did Christmas cards
for a local nursing home.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.540
I did two sets of
type that I locked up,

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.230
which I think I have a photo.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.560
I do not have a photo,
that we did.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.410
I let the students come in
and print them and it was open

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:03.710
to anybody; the [inaudible]

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.490
in the beginning was
a community member

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.070
of Kutztown I've
met several times.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.370
He came in, made
a couple prints.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.260
His wife was like very heavily
involved in the art department.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.560
So it was great to talk to him

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.350
and I had students
decorate with stamps.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.830
That was a freshman last year
and this is more decorated ones.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.000
And it was great; we
donated over 50 cards.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.300
So just be able-- great to
like express the art form

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.780
and then also donate and to
like help out local communities

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.110
and just make someone's
day brighter.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.790
So this first big project I
ever did was the Led Zepplin

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:35.460
"Stairway to Heaven" lyrics.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.220
It was a gift to my dad, to make

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.180
up for the last gift
that I did to him.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.480
There's still a typo in it,

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.670
but I don't think
he ever realized it.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.640
I also got to use the
process of my lino cut skills

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.980
and letter press
printmaking skills,

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.990
combining them to
make this piece.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.880
I did 52 prints overall.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.180
This is with the proofing press,

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.340
the lino cut process
of how I did that.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.100
All the prints.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.100
The type lock up.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.550
And the end result.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:04.940
I did two on blue paper.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.840
But because I have
the typo on it,

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.820
I'm like, "I can't sell these."

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.650
That was my goal, so I just
have a stack of 50, 49 prints;

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.420
I gave a couple out; of
prints to give to people.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.750
But my dad was just as loving
and appreciative of this piece

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.660
as he was the first little
"Happy birthday day, Dad".

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.280
I've done a lot of exploration.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.300
My-- I tell students
when I teach them,

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.740
"Once you know the rules,
please break the rules.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.960
I want you to explore
with how you print make.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.260
I want you to like
just try something.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.030
I don't want you to
just do lines of text.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.430
That's been done; do
something different."

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.180
So I was working-- this was
a piece I'd done myself,

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.330
but I've worked with students to
do more printmaking like this.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.630
Combining woodblock, lead type.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.250
Seeing what you can make.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.230
I mean, that's not that out
there, but I love to explore.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:54.170
That was a lock up for
part of how that was done.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:57.940
And then this was-- you can make
out what it's supposed to say,

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.060
but this was an experimentation

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.450
of using a proofing press
for a big woodblock.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.960
I should have grabbed a couple
of these; I have so many

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.230
of these, for the "F" but
then also lining up the text

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.070
to make it print correctly.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:12.450
But also ombre printing
which is a process in itself.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.750
Not the correct way to
print, but I do it anyway.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.510
This is a good show
of how I did the--

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.080
like you can really
see the ombre

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.410
on letter-- on the type here.

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:22.020
Still, such a fun process.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.030
I encourage everyone to
try, because it was so fun.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:26.290
And you only get limited
prints before all the colors

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.590
like mash together.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:32.560
And you can kind of see how
it print-- it's so pretty.

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.720
It makes for great
Instagram photos.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.200
[laughter] But like I think
when I did it this way,

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.500
because you don't want
to waste a lot of ink,

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:42.210
I only got maybe 25 prints
before all the colors started

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:43.510
to blend together.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.500
So, it makes it really
limited, but it's so fun.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.800
And then you can see just
all the prints in itself.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.760
I have so many of these,
but everyone loves them

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.450
and gets a laugh out of them.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.500
I did another type
of ombre printing,

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.210
not to think I was
printing on white coasters.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:58.510
So I had to redo it.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:02.600
And you can see the blue with
our Landis press ornament.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.690
And I have a bunch
of those coasters.

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:08.850
And then my boyfriend
decided to help me one day,

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.950
didn't reach the press out
of the clam shell press,

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.120
but we got this really
beautiful back coaster

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.050
of the ombre coloring.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.350
I've also explored a lot with
printmaking and the cards.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.750
And I did these in both
cards and coasters.

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:26.900
So you can see the
pink ink, black ink,

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.940
and then I was asked this
year, and I also volunteered

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.970
to do the APHA calendar piece.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.750
I did April, I mean
Venus; it's Venus

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.960
but Aphrodite works together,
but the rain coming down;

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.090
she was the goddess of water.

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:43.730
And she-- there was a
relation to her in April too.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.900
So it was a really
fun piece to make.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.150
I did it over the summer; I
don't have a printing studio;

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.620
I was not close to Kutztown.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.980
So 150, 130 prints
takes up a lot of space.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.500
You can see the first process.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.520
This was, in again, lino
cut, for the first step.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.100
I don't know if the
video's going to play.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.560
No, but I had all over
my parents' house.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.860
They woke up the next morning

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.440
and they're like,
"What is going on?"

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.980
Like all over the kitchen table,
all over the kitchen counters,

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.550
on top of the micro-- or the
toaster, all over the couches,

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:16.870
TV counter, coffee tables.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:18.530
They're like, "What
is going on?"

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:19.830
I'm like, "Art.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.130
Art, Mom. Art, Dad.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:22.430
You support this, don't you?"

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.750
So, to kind of wrap it up,

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.880
I went really fast
and I apologize.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.180
Thought I had more on here.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.480
I'm actually, right now,
it's really exciting,

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.460
because it is my senior
year; I'm thinking

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.840
about what I'm going
to do after college.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.390
And what kind-- like
what I want to do

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:37.940
when I leave, exit
a job interview.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.820
So I came up with
the idea to do,

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.320
I'm going to do 2020 calendars,

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.130
because I really
enjoy the process

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.740
of making the calendars;
the APHA ones.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:50.610
I am doing, I think as right
now, I have 10 sets I'm doing,

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:52.450
and they're going to be
all different colors.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:54.280
I have selected between
three colors.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.580
This is the first month.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:59.520
They're on coasters and then the
back piece will then by my logo.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.100
I'm going to do a polymer print
on the back to show my logo,

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.700
to be a leaveaway when
I leave a job interview.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.790
This is a type lockup
of what February was.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:11.550
And as of right now,
this is February, March.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.440
I just started this project.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.940
I mean, it's been
in the head works,

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.690
but actually physically
started it maybe four weeks ago.

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:23.110
So it's really kind of-- I'm
staying between blueish, which--

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:26.650
a blue, a green and a
pink is my color palette.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:28.780
And I'm just really
excited to see what this is.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.080
This is like my first
big project.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.550
I actually have one in my purse
if someone wants to see it.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.460
But I'm just really
excited and I love--

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.150
I have to do a little thank you
because I've-- this opportunity,

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.330
has been such a great
door opener.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.070
I've met so many amazing people

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.110
and I really appreciate
what you guys are doing.

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:45.150
I've loved like the letter press
print here is just so amazing,

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:46.910
just to go meet other
printmakers.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.800
I'm not afraid to go
talk to people now,

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.750
when we have a shared
passion because it's

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:53.090
such a small niche of a world.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:55.220
And I really, I really
do appreciate it.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.520
I think it's great;
I hope this continues

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.820
on for many, many years.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.120
So thank you.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.920
[applause] Sorry it was short.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.520
[ Applause ]

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.280
&gt;&gt; How many months did
you do in the calendar?

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.580
&gt;&gt; Cassandra (Casey)
Vanatta: Thirteen.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:09.880
&gt;&gt; Thirteen months?

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.180
&gt;&gt; Cassandra (Casey) Vanatta:

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.480
You know how many [inaudible]
we have that have 12 two's?

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.560
None. [laughter] So,
there's mostly one is--

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.740
oh gosh, I can't even
remember my typeface.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.990
But I have two of the Chettleman
[assumed spelling] typeface

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.710
and I can't-- bad designer
moment; don't hate me on that.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:24.320
I'm very tired; I haven't
slept in three days.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.870
[laughter] But yeah
it's very [inaudible].

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.170
Thank you.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:30.770
&gt;&gt; Layla Saad: Okay.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.070
Hi everybody.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:33.370
My name is Layla.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.510
I'm from George--
Washington University,

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:38.130
from the Corcoran School
of Arts and Design.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:42.000
I actually was not into art,
as a child or a young adult.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.680
So I actually only switched
over about six years ago.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:45.980
Before that, I was

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.470
in biomechanical
engineering and ER surgery.

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:49.770
[laughter] Um, yeah.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:53.400
So, I actually switched over
because a requirement of being

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.250
in the surgery program
is that you have

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:58.010
to take a painting class
or a ceramics class,

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:00.500
to hone your fine motor
skills for surgery.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.130
And I took a ceramics class
and I was like, "Well,

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.610
I guess this is where
I'm going with this."

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.410
[laughter] So at that point,
I switched over to art.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:10.840
My parents are extremely
supportive so I've been

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.730
like really appreciative
of that.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:15.140
But, part of that kind
of informs how I look

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.270
at art and how I explore it.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:20.250
And so I'm really interested
in chemistry and kind

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.540
of the material exploration
of things and how they work.

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:24.870
So like, what is the foundation?

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.250
Why is it doing this?

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:28.460
Which is kind of one of the
reasons I'm really interested

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.590
in printmaking because
there is quite a bit

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:32.030
of chemistry involved
if you actually think

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:33.330
about the processes of it.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.000
And then I'm also like,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.040
I'm always questioning
the history of intention.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.300
And so, this plays into
kind of one of my interests

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.570
in printmaking which is type.

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:46.680
And I feel like the history of
printmaking is that it was used

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.150
in many ways, to duplicate
and replicate images,

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.110
but also specifically type.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:54.020
And so there have been
discussions between me

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.220
and certain professors and
stuff, about, you know,

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.950
maybe I include too
much text in my work.

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:00.250
And for me, you know,

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:03.700
that's part of what printmaking
is, to me, personally.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.790
So, and this is not
Kerry; Kerry is awesome.

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:09.570
She always encourages my
projects, so it's not her.

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.710
[laughter] So I'm also
working at the Renwick Gallery,

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:14.780
at the Smithsonian
American Art Museum.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.660
I'm an exhibit specialist and I
think that's really interesting

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.150
because we don't
often get printmaking.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:23.430
And I know that it's like a
"fine art" and not a craft.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.330
And part of me has like
started questioning

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:26.630
that with some of the curators.

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:29.310
Like, "Why is this not
included as a craft?"

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:31.730
Because I believe it like
still is a craft, you know.

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:34.060
And obviously, the
delineation between "fine art"

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.480
and "craft" is like
so arbitrary anyway.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.460
And I'm also primarily
interested in installation art,

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.090
wood sculpture, ceramics
and printmaking.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.380
Printmaking is my
primary, 2D medium.

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:48.660
And then I also do a
lot of graphic design.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.750
So as I mentioned before,
type and printmaking to me,

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:54.280
is like part of the
essence of printmaking.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.620
And so, for me, it's like
hard to disassociate them,

00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:01.050
and I think probably about 70%
of my print work and probably

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:03.750
about 45 or 50% of
my work overall,

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:05.290
contains some sort
of lettering in it.

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:09.280
And I'm always kind of thinking
about how I can integrate type

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.510
into design; but also, how I can
incorporate design into type.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:17.390
And both of them, are you know,
they're both valid kind of,

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:18.690
like it's not just
black and white;

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:19.990
it's also white and black.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:21.990
Like, that kind of theory.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:25.650
And so, discovering William
Blake's printmaking has been

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:26.950
like super interesting.

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:31.730
And it's actually a really funny
story because I had just begun,

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:34.730
I think this was like after
I did my first printmaking

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.030
class ever.

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:39.110
And my mom sent me
a Wikipedia article

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:42.230
on William Blake's pieces,
"All Religions are One";

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.850
I believe that's like
a two-part edition.

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:47.540
And so, she was like,
"Have you seen this?"

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.080
And I was like, "Oh,
what is it?"

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.290
And she was like, "This is
really interesting the way he

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:52.590
does it.

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:53.890
He doesn't use, you know, he
doesn't use a letter press."

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.350
And I was like, "Oh,
well, I mean,

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.550
he just wrote it
backwards, duh."

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:01.020
Right? And I was like,
"It's so obvious,"

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.730
because I was telling
Kerry, but like,

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.270
I don't have an issue
writing backwards

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:05.570
or reading backwards
or upside down.

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:08.320
Like, this is not
something that ever kind of--

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.930
it was only like a year and a
half later that my mom was like,

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.470
"No, you do realize that like
most people can't just write

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:15.770
backwards, right?"

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:18.510
And at that point, I
was like, "Oh no; what?"

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.330
[laughter] Because like I'd
been doing it all my life.

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.820
And so, I went back and
I looked at the article.

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.070
Well, it's super interesting.

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:28.650
But in July of 2013,
that Wikipedia article,

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:31.670
somebody had removed the
line, from down at the bottom

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:35.370
that gave the two theories
of how he wrote backwards

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:36.670
or how he got his type on there.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:37.970
So, I was like, "Wow, this is

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:39.760
like a mystery of
the 21st Century."

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.660
And so I was like, "I'm
going to do all this research

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.750
and find out how he did this."

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:46.110
Well, so I-- like,
so two years later,

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:48.940
I had this renewed interest
in what he was doing.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.050
And I did a whole bunch
of research on it.

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:53.780
And I could not find anything,

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.980
because while there is
amazing research on it,

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.360
which I discovered
later, it's very hard

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.660
to search on the internet.

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:02.850
And so the only thing that
I ever found, on jstore,

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:05.510
was "William Blake's
Printmaking Process

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:07.130
in Jerusalem" by Steven Carr.

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:11.390
And this is more about like
his iconography and how he got

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:13.330
to that point, but he doesn't
really talk about process.

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:16.050
He like touches on it,
just enough to make me

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:17.930
like hunger for it more.

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.330
But not actually
give me anything.

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.740
So I was like, "Ah, this
is really frustrating."

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.280
So this is an example
of the etching

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.580
that I did that was backwards.

00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:28.550
So like, it was just like
something that I did.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:30.920
So I didn't realize it
was like not intuitive.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.990
So, Kerry was super awesome, and
I was actually talking to her

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:35.620
about like a week ago.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.360
And she was like, "Oh yeah.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.950
I think they have like this
thing at the Library of Congress

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:43.190
in the rare book
collection, Michael Phillips,

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:44.790
that he did like
all this research."

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:46.090
And I was like, "Oh really?

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:47.390
I should go look at that."

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:49.790
And so, Stephanie was super
awesome and she pulled out all

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:51.540
of their stuff for
me to look at.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.870
And I was like, "Wow, there
is no mystery to this.

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:56.290
They're already figured
the whole thing out."

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:58.620
[laughter] So it was like
both an amazing moment,

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.020
that all like these three years

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:03.210
of me wondering how he did
it were finally revealed.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:04.510
And then I was like, "Wow,

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:06.240
I have like no research
topic anymore

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.760
because it's already
been researched".

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.960
[laughter] So I was like, "Wow."

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.230
So anyway, I looked
at his stuff,

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:16.070
and Michael Phillips
did an amazing job,

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.200
like going into,
detailing everything.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:22.140
Collecting like, things that
were published at the time

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:26.680
that were kind of explorium
in Blake's process and also he

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:30.490
like went the full mile and
did like the replica and he,

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:34.930
you know, got all of the
historic paper like duplicated

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:36.430
and all of these things.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:39.370
And so, according to
him, the process is

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:42.430
that William Blake
wrote backwards using a

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:45.880
"stop-out varnish"
onto the copper plates.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:47.490
And then he did two acid dips.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:49.320
So he put it in the acid

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.110
until it was .05
millimeters, eaten away.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.130
And he would pull
it out and check

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:57.000
if anything was getting an
underbite on it, on the words.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.790
And then he would use
the stop-out varnish

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:03.170
to like stop-out any delicate
areas and then he'd put it back

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:05.180
in the acid, so that
it would go,

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:08.990
like for an end result
of .12 millimeters.

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:12.890
And so then he inked it
up using a leather dauber,

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:15.630
because rollers were
not yet available.

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.320
And his evidence for
this is that it has

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.580
like this textured effect that
you can get when you're doing it

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.520
with the leather dauber,
that is evident in the print.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.200
And that he used wet
paper because this was

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.020
like obviously common
practice back then,

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.550
but also because when
it shrinks afterwards,

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:32.850
it sharpens the image.

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:34.580
Which was something that was
really interesting to me,

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.260
because I noticed that
there were certain areas

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.160
that were very sharp and certain
areas that are relatively soft,

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.460
in some of Blake's prints.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.980
And it was-- I was wondering
how he got that contrast.

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:44.390
And so, that was
really interesting to me

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:47.000
that it was specifically
because it dries,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.560
it sharpens certain
parts of the image.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:54.480
And then Blake usually had them
colored in after he was done.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.140
And it would either be that
he, and sometimes his wife,

00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:58.440
would be water coloring it

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.240
or he would use this glue-based
pigment, which I had never heard

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.540
of that method before.

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.460
Where he would put a glue-based
pigment after he printed it

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:09.050
and then he would register, like
register the print in the paper

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:11.560
and he would print it, and
then I guess when the glue

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.450
like pulls off, it creates his

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:15.760
like mottled effect
or something.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.720
Yeah, I mean, maybe you
have more information--

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.540
&gt;&gt; No. I've always wondered
what that mottled effect was.

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:22.840
&gt;&gt; Layla Saad: Yes!

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.140
So I'm super interested now.

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.440
Like, I really want to try this.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.350
And I'm really interested in,
like, all his whole process.

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:32.400
But I would really love
to, specifically try that.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.880
And, so there was
a book written,

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.060
"A Treatise on Wood
Engraving" by John Jackson,

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:40.280
which Phillips references
in many

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.020
of his lectures and writings.

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:45.010
But I also went and
I got this treatise

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:48.690
and I read what Jackson
was saying about Blake.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:51.470
And he basically says, he's
like "a necessarily slow process

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:54.620
because he has to like, you
know, use the dauber by hand

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.380
and like do the whole
thing and be really careful

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.130
about it and then clean it."

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:04.830
And there was an implication in
both, one of Phillips' lectures

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:07.820
that he thinks that
Jackson was saying

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.320
that the process wasn't
innovative, but also like some

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.730
of the wording in the actual
treatise was kind of touching

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.180
on this idea that it
wasn't innovative.

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.960
And I kind of think that that's
an interesting interpretation

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.140
of innovation, because I think
we often get stuck in the idea

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:24.800
that something's more efficient
and then it's innovative,

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.960
but I think like, Blake's
process was very innovative,

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:32.260
it just wasn't necessarily
faster, but that's fine.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.310
And then I just like put a
note here that the support

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:38.750
of the reverse writing theory
mainly comes from the fact

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:42.190
that if you look at
William Blake's work,

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:45.790
if you look from the beginning
ones to the later ones,

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:47.770
like it gets progressively
smoother, the writing.

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:51.550
And then also, some of the
examples that were included

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:54.940
in like this main portfolios
that I looked at, were talking

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:57.440
about how like some of the
early works had the wrong tilt

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.990
direction, which would kind
of imply that if he wasn't,

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:03.660
you know, trained really a
lot in writing backwards,

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.330
this would kind of be a result.

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:07.500
It is kind of important to know,

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.590
which I saw like in a
few different places,

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:12.150
that it's not unheard
of to write backwards.

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:14.870
Obviously, that's how they
would sign their work;

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.150
the engravers would sign their
work by writing backwards.

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:19.140
It's just like writing
a whole paragraph

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:22.160
or something backwards
wasn't really done.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.770
And then, also, the
last thing was kind

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.860
of that there were some
manuscripts that, like,

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:31.230
the pre-- before he actually
made the design, the manuscripts

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:33.910
with the actual songs on them,
some of them had practice

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:36.280
in the margins where they
were written backwards.

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.760
So that was, again,
another thing

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.330
that was supporting the idea
that he wrote it backwards.

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:44.550
So like, the last thing that
I was thinking about was kind

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:47.360
of what are possible
alternatives to the process?

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:50.150
And I, obviously,
like am nowhere close

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:52.650
to Michael Phillips, like in
terms of researching that.

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:55.790
But I was like wondering
if there was a possibility

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:58.150
that Blake could have
inked a flat surface

00:22:58.150 --> 00:22:59.580
and then put the
flat surface on.

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:01.700
So, they didn't have a
roller, but theoretically,

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.460
if you put it on, let's
say like a piece of paper

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:05.760
and then press it
against the plate,

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.720
would that not transfer
the ink onto the plate?

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:13.190
Because he was talking about
how it took him between 45--

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:15.840
45 minutes and an hour
to ink up each one

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.300
of those tiny little
plates, every time.

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.600
And so that's like
a lot of time.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.460
And I understand that
obviously, some people will do

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.250
that time commitment, but
it's kind of interesting

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:24.550
to think about the idea.

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:27.320
And maybe that's not even
related to Blake, but like,

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.280
going forward, it would
be interesting to think

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.910
about this way of
inking something up.

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:35.130
And then the other thing
that I was wondering is

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:36.610
like is there any possibility

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:39.600
that he actually coated
the plate with the varnish

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.870
and then scraped away
whatever he didn't want.

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:44.600
Instead of like,
applying it backwards.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.230
And the only reason that I'm
curious about this is just

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:49.330
because some of those, and
you can see them over there,

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:51.630
some of them had such tiny text.

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:54.280
You know, and obviously,
you can write that way,

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.690
especially with a
calligrapher's pen.

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:59.320
Like, I do calligraphy all the
time and you can get very small.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.510
But also, the stop-out
varnish, and obviously

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:06.120
that would depend highly
on what the actual formula

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.740
that he was using was.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:09.620
But I've tried it with like
asphaltum and I've tried it

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.230
with like a few different
things, and tried to get

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:13.690
that kind of level of detail,
even though I write like that

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:15.660
with ink, is pretty hard.

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:18.530
So I'm curious if there was
another way that he did it,

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:20.580
without handwriting it.

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:24.510
And then also the-- so
when I mentioned the fact

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:28.270
that the Wikipedia page had the
two lines taken off the bottom,

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:33.790
the second line was that there
is a theory that he wrote

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:39.060
on like, some sort of a
parchment and then he put--

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.220
so he wrote normally on the
parchment and then he flipped it

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:45.080
over and put it on the
plate and then that's

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.710
like how he transferred
the resist onto it.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:49.470
Which is funny, because
I was just telling Kerry

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:50.770
that I was like, "I wonder

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:52.500
if that's how he did
it," the other day.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.080
And then I went and I found
the Wikipedia page again

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.380
and I was like, "What?"

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.490
And apparently, somebody
had added the lines back.

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:00.530
And I went back, on the Wayback
Machine, and like I managed

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:01.830
to find the one month

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:04.180
that somebody had taken off
the really important parts.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:05.790
And I was like, "I don't
understand how this

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:07.090
is possible."

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:09.520
But that was kind
of interesting.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.960
And that's been an
interesting experiment.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.220
So, that's kind of all I have.

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:16.270
Stephanie was super awesome
and she pulled out some

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:17.930
of the examples of the
replicas over there.

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:20.650
And then, I just
brought a couple examples

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:22.870
of the work that I was doing.

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:25.910
And part of that, like when
I'm thinking about innovation,

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:29.010
is the calligraph; I took
calligraph class with Kerry.

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:32.500
And so, I'm really interested in
all the alternative processes,

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:36.730
like silk organza, paper
plates, things like that.

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:39.510
Yes. If anybody has any
questions, let me know.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:44.360
[ Applause ]

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.660
&gt;&gt; I have a question.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:48.360
Are these to scale?

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.240
&gt;&gt; So for the William
Blake, yes.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:55.160
The "Songs of Innocence
you Experience"

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.010
which is what we have
here, was a smaller work.

00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:00.910
Now, he did-- his
illustrated epics get bigger,

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:04.700
but he was working with better
commissions at that point.

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.000
So, this is still sort

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.300
of the earlier works,
which a bit smaller.

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.600
"There is no Natural Religion"

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.270
which she mentioned
earlier, is quite small.

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:12.610
Because it was his first
work using this process.

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:16.580
&gt;&gt; -- uses photographs to
transfer the image to his work.

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:18.030
So--

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:19.330
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah.

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:20.680
&gt;&gt; It's a direct
copy off of Blake.

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:21.980
But [inaudible] Blake
is-- [inaudible comment].

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:27.700
&gt;&gt; I was just going
to add a comment,

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:36.580
because you were talking
about, Layla, alternative ideas

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.870
for transferring in
terms of etching.

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:45.840
You can take a photocopy,
drench it in lacquer thinner,

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:50.400
run it through the etching
press and then that will act

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.770
as a resist when
you drop it in acid.

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:54.750
So that's kind of the
modern day version of that.

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:56.970
&gt;&gt; So kind of like
letrocet in a way.

00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:58.520
Is that what's happening?

00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.120
&gt;&gt; Stay that sticks
on the plate?

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And so you're
stripping the toner off,

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:03.720
and the toner then
acts like the resist.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.020
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.320
&gt;&gt; That's interesting.

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.620
&gt;&gt; It takes-- it's persnickety.

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:08.920
It takes a lot of like, playing

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.220
around with the pressure
and all of that.

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:11.520
But it can be done, yeah.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.820
&gt;&gt; We've had people that--
you can also just use that for

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.120
like jewelry making, if you
want to like transfer text

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:17.280
or an image onto
the copper and--

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.580
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.880
&gt;&gt; Yep, that makes sense.

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:23.920
&gt;&gt; Especially we
have trouble here

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.060
because our mail gets
irradiated with--

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:27.790
when it comes into the building.

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:30.000
But now that I'm thinking
about it, that's a very part

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.600
of that substance, that
causes the catalogues

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.370
to stick together is what
you're talking about.

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:36.750
It's very strong, actually.

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:38.050
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:41.510
&gt;&gt; So, I can see if it dilutes
it and causes it to adhere,

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:47.040
that it's not going
to go anywhere.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.040
&gt;&gt; Haven't done it in a long
time, but if you want to try it

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.970

&gt;&gt; So Layla, do you see
Blake and his process,

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:23.680
sort of in forming your
own process moving forward?

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:32.020
Or did he inspire you to try--
you sort of suggested this,

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:35.470
but to maybe flip
your [inaudible]?

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:36.770
&gt;&gt; Layla Saad: Absolutely.

00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:43.170
Yeah. I'm very interested
in his entire process,

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:48.830
but I'm also kind of mostly
interested in the way he thought

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:51.350
about things and the
way he just like--

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:55.650
and there's varying
theories on why he did it.

00:28:55.650 --> 00:29:03.460
Was it because of cost that
he didn't want to have to go

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:06.220
through all this process?

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:11.370
Was it because he
didn't like the fact

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:23.410
that everything was segmented,
like the artist and then the,

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:28.060
you know, the engraver and
then the printmaker really did

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.950
the type.

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:33.050
But for me, I think it's like
not necessarily irrelevant,

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:37.330
but to me the main
interest is like,

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:40.660
well he created something
interesting and different.

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:43.790
And he decided to
do it his own way.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:46.220
So, yeah, I mean, I'd
like to, for sure,

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:47.720
try that glue-based pigment
thing and I definitely want

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.020

had the censored version.

[ Applause ]

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:23.520
&gt;&gt; George Barnum: There are
copies of the calendar you can--

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.820
&gt;&gt; It has April [inaudible]

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:26.120
&gt;&gt; Cassandra (Casey) Vanatta:
And March with Ann Levin.

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.420
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah, March.

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:28.720
I have March.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.020
&gt;&gt; Oh, very nice.

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:31.320
&gt;&gt; George Barnum: Yeah,
we're-- actually, we're mostly--

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.870
we have mostly contributors
here.

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:35.080
[laughter]

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.380
&gt;&gt; -- June?

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:37.680
&gt;&gt; June.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.220
&gt;&gt; Do you accept potato prints?

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.520
[laughter]

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:41.820
&gt;&gt; We should.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.120
&gt;&gt; I'm saying, they work.

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:46.240
&gt;&gt; George Barnum: We
are notoriously unfussy.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:50.270
[laughter] Witness the fact
that I'm going to do the cover.

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:51.570
[laughter]

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:52.870
&gt;&gt; Next year, George,
I'm expecting--

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:54.170
&gt;&gt; Ah--

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:55.470
&gt;&gt; A full-on month.

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:56.770
You've got all these
ones, all those twos.

00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:58.070
&gt;&gt; George Barnum: We hope so.

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:00.290
Actually, we were talking about
that, and one of the reasons

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:02.660
that we-- here's Chris's.

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:07.230
[overlapping comments] One
of the reasons that we ended

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:14.070
up using the, these beautiful,
weird Dutch initials is

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:18.380
that the month in Roman
numbers collection of type,

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:24.490
which is vast; this is the
only initial letter set

00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:33.890
that we could find
that had three J's.

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:36.370
[laughter]

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:38.340
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:41.380
&gt;&gt; Cassandra (Casey)
Vanatta: It's a struggle.

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:52.760
And I think I spent, maybe,
six hours, in two hour shifts,

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:57.540
just trying to count through
all our tases, counting letters,

00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:00.220
making sure to have Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.950
Friday, Saturday; all
the-- it was a process.

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:05.760
So I found I had to settle;

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:11.540
I don't remember the typeface
I used because I had to settle.

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:17.630
It was not my first, second,
third or fourth choice.

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:23.000
&gt;&gt; This is a great example
when we teach Gutenberg

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.410
and we list the number of,
the number within the sort.

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:25.710
And print people
are always shocked.

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:27.010
And even when you
try to explain,

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:28.310
well he's printed
six pages at a time,

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:29.610
that means they're all typeset,

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:30.910
that means it's six times
whatever you expect.

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:32.210
People seem to have trouble.

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:33.510
But this is very clear.

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:34.810
If you're going to print a
calendar, you need so many ones.

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:36.110
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:37.410
&gt;&gt; It's a very straightforward
way of talking about that.

00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:38.710
&gt;&gt; That's a good point.

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:40.010
&gt;&gt; And they always think,
"Oh well, sure we have--

00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:41.310
of course there's enough."

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:42.610
&gt;&gt; Cassandra (Casey)
Vanatta: You think that--

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:43.910
&gt;&gt; Until you have the whole
calendar and [inaudible]

00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:45.210
&gt;&gt; George Barnum: Well and there
are, there seem to be fonts

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:46.510
of these initial letters that
they just leave a letter,

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:47.810
an infrequently used letter out.

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:49.110
So you quite often, with
initials, you don't get an "X".

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:50.410
&gt;&gt; Or a "Z".

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:51.710
&gt;&gt; George Barnum: Or a Z. Yeah.

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:53.010
[overlapping comments]

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:54.310
&gt;&gt; Why bother?

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:55.610
You get 24 of the letters.

00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:56.910
&gt;&gt; George Barnum: Yeah.

00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:58.210
We don't need those letters.

00:33:58.210 --> 00:33:59.510
[overlapping comments].

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:01.310
Well, thank you all.

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:06.310
