00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.610
Just in case we need
to help with more party

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.790
planning for the king,
let's get ourselves

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.920
some practice with
solving systems

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.530
of equations with
simple elimination.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.910
And so here's the
exercise right over here.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.120
We have x minus 4y is
equal to negative 18,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.711
and negative x plus
3y is equal to 11.

00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:20.960
So let's try to work this out.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.760
I'll get my little
scratch pad out.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.420
This is the exact same problem.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.600
We just rewrite it again.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.760
It never hurts to rewrite
it, get more familiarity

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.630
with the problem.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.070
So x minus 4y is
equal to negative 18.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:43.590
And then we have negative
x plus 3y is equal to 11.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.790
So the thing that
jumps out at my brain--

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.850
we want to eliminate
one of the variables.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.310
And we have an x
here, and we have

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.004
a negative x right over there.

00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:54.170
So that feels like those
would cancel each other out

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.200
very well, so let's do that.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.500
Let's add negative x plus
3y to the left-hand side

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.570
of x minus 4y.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.990
And then we can add 11
to the right-hand side

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.210
because, as the second statement
shows, this is equal to this.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.520
So if we add this to
the left-hand side,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.670
we could add the same thing
to the right-hand side.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.045
But instead, we're just going
to add the 11, because it's

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:22.570
the exact same thing
as negative x plus 3y.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.970
So we're going to add 11
to the right-hand side.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.910
And so let's see what
happens when we do that.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.000
Well, the whole purpose is
that you have an x minus an x.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.530
Those cancel out.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.220
And then you're just left
with negative 4y plus 3y.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.652
Negative 4 of something
plus 3 of something

00:01:39.652 --> 00:01:41.860
is you're going to have
negative 1 of that something,

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.444
or you could just
say negative y.

00:01:44.444 --> 00:01:46.610
And then that's going to
be equal to-- and remember,

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.670
we can still say equal
because we're essentially

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.610
adding the same thing
to the right-hand side

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.276
that we're adding to
the left-hand side.

00:01:52.276 --> 00:01:56.070
11 is the same thing
as negative x plus 3y.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:04.220
11 plus negative
18 is negative 7.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.040
And now we're in
the home stretch.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.380
If we want to solve for y,
we can divide both sides

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.250
by negative 1, or multiply
both sides by negative 1,

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.830
depending on how
you want to view it.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.220
So let's divide both
sides by a negative 1.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.730
We are left with y is
equal to positive 7.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.690
But we aren't done yet.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.060
We need to figure out
what x is equal to.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.141
So we can take this
value for y, and we

00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:29.640
should be able to
substitute it back

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.990
into either of these
equations to solve for x.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.730
So let's do that.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.050
Let's use the top equation.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:44.480
So we have x minus 4 times y,
but now we know that y is 7.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.440
We know that y is
7 at the point that

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.400
satisfies both of
these equations.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.530
Why did I write y again?

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.940
4 times 7 is equal
to negative 18.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:56.940
Let's simplify.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.926
You get x minus 28 is
equal to negative 18.

00:03:01.926 --> 00:03:04.300
Now to solve for x-- and we've
done this many, many times

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.020
before-- we just add
28 to both sides.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.470
So let's add 28 to the
left, 28 to the right.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.400
And we are left with x
is equal to negative 18

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.780
plus 28 is the same thing
as 28 minus 18, which is 10.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.844
So we get x is equal to
10 and y is equal to 7.

00:03:23.844 --> 00:03:25.510
And what's really
good about this is you

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.400
can verify them for yourselves.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.790
If you take this first equation,
10 minus 4 times 7, so 10

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.940
minus 28 does indeed
equal negative 18.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.820
So it checks with
the first equation.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.340
Now let's check the
second equation.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:46.914
Negative x, so negative
10 plus 3 times 7.

00:03:46.914 --> 00:03:47.830
What is that equal to?

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.250
That's negative 10 plus 21,
which does indeed equal 11.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.340
So it satisfies both of them.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.670
So now let's check our answer
on the little exercise engine.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.380
So we have y is equal
to 7, x is equal to 10.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:11.200
So we have x is equal to
10 and y is equal to 7.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.420
Check our answer, and
we've got it right.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.519
We're ready to do some more
cupcake planning with the king.
