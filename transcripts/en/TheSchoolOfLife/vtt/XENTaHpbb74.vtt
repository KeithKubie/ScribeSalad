00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:07.560
Because our culture places such a high value
on sociability, it can be deeply awkward to

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.610
have to explain how much – at certain points
– we need to be alone. We may try to pass

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.160
off our desire as something work-related:
people generally understand a need to finish

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.910
off a project. But in truth, it’s a far
less respectable and more profound desire

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:35.199
that is driving us on: unless we are alone,
we are at risk of forgetting who we are. We,

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:41.210
the ones who are asphyxiated without periods
by ourselves, take other people very seriously

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.850
– perhaps more seriously than those in the
uncomplicated ranks of the endlessly gregarious.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.949
We listen closely to stories, we give ourselves
to others, we respond with emotion and empathy.

00:00:53.949 --> 00:01:00.539
But as a result, we cannot keep swimming in
company indefinitely. At a certain point,

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.960
we have had enough of conversations that take
us away from our own thought processes, enough

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.880
of external demands that stop us heeding our
inner tremors, enough of the pressure for

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.950
superficial cheerfulness that denies the legitimacy
of our latent inner melancholy – and enough

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:25.870
of robust common-sense that flattens our peculiarities
and less well-charted appetites. We need to

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:32.720
be alone because life among other people unfolds
too quickly. The pace is relentless: the jokes,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.580
the insights, the excitements. There can sometimes
be enough in five minutes of social life to

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.700
take up an hour of analysis. It is a quirk
of our minds that not every emotion that impacts

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.270
us is at once fully acknowledged, understood
or even – as it were – truly felt. After

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.560
time among others, there are a myriad of sensations
that exist in an ‘unprocessed’ form within

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.759
us. Perhaps an idea that someone raised made
us anxious, prompting inchoate impulses for

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.369
changes in our lives. Perhaps an anecdote
sparked off an envious ambition that is worth

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.530
decoding and listening to in order to grow.
Maybe someone subtly fired an aggressive dart

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.209
at us, and we haven’t had the chance to
realise we are hurt. We need some quiet time

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:26.690
to console ourselves by formulating an explanation
of where the nastiness might have come from.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.209
We are more vulnerable and tender-skinned
than we’re encouraged to imagine. By retreating

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.209
into ourselves, it looks as if we are the
enemies of others, but our solitary moments

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.380
are in reality a homage to the richness of
social existence. Unless we’ve had time

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.510
alone, we can’t be who we would like to
be around our fellow humans. We won’t have

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.340
original opinions. We won’t have lively
and authentic perspectives. We’ll be – in

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:04.510
the wrong way – a bit like everyone else.
We’re drawn to solitude not because we despise

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:11.530
humanity but because we are properly responsive
to what the company of others entails. Extensive

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.570
stretches of being alone may in reality be
a precondition for knowing how to be a better

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:27.510
friend and a properly attentive companion.
