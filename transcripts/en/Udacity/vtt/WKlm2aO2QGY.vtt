[Narrator] Let me ask a last question.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
When applied to robotics do we believe the histogram filter is exact or approximate?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Same here.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I know we've never talked about this.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Please just check the boxes you find most likely,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and then move on to see my explanation.
