that I think we haven't seen before
 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.310
that I think we haven't seen before
which is certainly true in my work I

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320
which is certainly true in my work I
 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.550
which is certainly true in my work I

think if you compare it's interesting in
 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.440
think if you compare it's interesting in
a way just to compare the project that

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450
a way just to compare the project that
 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.970
a way just to compare the project that

biennial the Peace Tower and in my

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710
biennial the Peace Tower and in my
 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.860
biennial the Peace Tower and in my
project that's there now you know one

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870
project that's there now you know one
 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.340
project that's there now you know one
that was about the war and this one I

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350
that was about the war and this one I
 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.350
that was about the war and this one I
mean I suppose in particular you could

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360
mean I suppose in particular you could
 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.850
mean I suppose in particular you could
say is about the environment in some way

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860
say is about the environment in some way
 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.620

but I really didn't want to do a project

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630
but I really didn't want to do a project
 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.719
but I really didn't want to do a project
that was a monumental that was an object

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729
that was a monumental that was an object
 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.280
that was a monumental that was an object
that occupied the space or even

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290
that occupied the space or even
 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.289
that occupied the space or even
dominated it I really wanted to do a

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299
dominated it I really wanted to do a
 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.230
dominated it I really wanted to do a
very quiet project that's sort of woven

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240
very quiet project that's sort of woven
 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.280
very quiet project that's sort of woven
self into the space and and really was

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290
self into the space and and really was
 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.500
self into the space and and really was
um took a backseat to it and I think I

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510
um took a backseat to it and I think I
 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.300
um took a backseat to it and I think I
think a lot of the work in the show is

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310
think a lot of the work in the show is
 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.910
think a lot of the work in the show is
with very modest materials and it

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920
with very modest materials and it
 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.940
with very modest materials and it
doesn't and for the most part it's the

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950
doesn't and for the most part it's the
 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.800
doesn't and for the most part it's the
work isn't very highly produced and it

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810
work isn't very highly produced and it
 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.219
work isn't very highly produced and it
tends to be I mean I think the best of

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229
tends to be I mean I think the best of
 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.899
tends to be I mean I think the best of
the work really

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909
the work really
 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.270
the work really
tends to be quite modest in that regard

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280
tends to be quite modest in that regard
 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:53.279
tends to be quite modest in that regard
I suppose I really like Jedediah Caesar

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289

this piece coincidentally and he told me

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150
this piece coincidentally and he told me
 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.759
this piece coincidentally and he told me
where he told a friend of mine that um

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769
where he told a friend of mine that um
 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.039
where he told a friend of mine that um
while he was making the piece bees kept

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049
while he was making the piece bees kept
 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:27.509
while he was making the piece bees kept
getting attracted to it and stuck in it

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519
getting attracted to it and stuck in it
 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.420
getting attracted to it and stuck in it
so there's all these bees in there so

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430
so there's all these bees in there so
 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.530
so there's all these bees in there so
strangely enough our be movements are

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540
strangely enough our be movements are
 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.009
strangely enough our be movements are
having right around that piece I know um

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019
having right around that piece I know um
 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.199
having right around that piece I know um

I think you know the strange thing about
 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.680
I think you know the strange thing about
performances you can't you can't walk

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690
performances you can't you can't walk
 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.440

because it's it's wrapped up in all this

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030

time with and that you need to go and
 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.659
time with and that you need to go and
experience separately so I think there's

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:15.669
experience separately so I think there's
 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:17.400
experience separately so I think there's
a lot of work happening at museum and at

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410
a lot of work happening at museum and at
 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.229
