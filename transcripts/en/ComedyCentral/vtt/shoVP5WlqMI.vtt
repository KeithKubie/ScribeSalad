00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.960
- Life sucks in bear country.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.680
Just had a grizzly with two cubs

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.970
come at me from about 80 yards.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.600
And I sprayed the shit out
of her with bear spray.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.770
She got my head good, I don't
know what's under my hat.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.420
My ear, my arm, pieces
of stuff hanging out,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.583
I don't know what's going on in there.

00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:22.920
I think my arm's broke but legs are good.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.880
Internal organs are good.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.860
Eyes are good.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.350
I just walked out three miles

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.460
now I gotta go to the hospital.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.460
So, be safe out there.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.480
- By Gods grace his life
and iPhone were spared.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.120
The guy who's head is being held together

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.210
by an adjustable cap is Todd.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.680
And a bear almost put him
into permanent hibernation.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.560
Twice the speed of Usain Bolt,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.700
more killer instinct than a
white male high school loner

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.540
with no father figure

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.530
plus four inch claws and hot salmon burps.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.350
It's no surprise bears cause
nearly two deaths a year

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.970
in the United States.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.600
The only safe bear is gummy.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.200
And not those sugar free ones,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.650
they'll rip your butt
hole worse than that bear

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.143
who won DiCaprio his sympathy Oscar.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.500
What was that movie?

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.563
Ted 2.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.200
If ya encounter a bear in the wild

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.950
you should punch it in the nose.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.400
That might be advise for a shark

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.510
but at least you'll die
with the bear's respect.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.510
When a grizzly is chomping on your skull

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.240
even PETA recommends you
blow his goddamn head off.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.120
I realize most folks watch this show

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.230
for important wilderness survival tips

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.810
but we like to laugh at people

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.730
who've been seriously injured as well.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.330
That's why I invited
that mangled mountain man

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.750
to finally answer the question,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.420
does a bear shit pieces
of Todd in the woods?

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.970
For this week's Web Redemption.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.920
Welcome to my stabbin' cabin.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.870
Rest easy, I've taken every precaution

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.000
to keep the bears at bay.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.980
- Well I appreciate that,
nice to meet you Daniel.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.600
- Oh get in here for a bear hug.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.810
Or will that put you in a bad place?

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.030
Trigger warning.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.610
Todd thank you for being here.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.443
- Thank you.

00:02:00.443 --> 00:02:01.276
- How you doing?

00:02:01.276 --> 00:02:02.560
- I'm doing well, mostly healed.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.150
Lots of scars but I'm doing well.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.260
- How many views does your video have?

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.320
- I don't know what it is now

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.730
but it had 39 million
views in like 48 hours.

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.660
I was just gonna send the
video to a couple buddies

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.100
then I'm like, well I got
a couple of other friends,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.670
it'll just be easier
to throw it on Facebook

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.130
and then all of a sudden two hours later

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.390
my phone's blowing up,
my email's blowing up,

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.090
I'm getting thousands of messages

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.270
and yeah, it was insane.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.310
- How often have you seen bears

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.060
before this moment in your life?

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.893
- Commonly.

00:02:25.893 --> 00:02:27.949
I work in the woods, I
recreate in the woods--

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:28.920
- What do you do?

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.370
- I work for the Forest Service.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.770
And I do all their trails engineering.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.280
- Do bears actually hibernate?

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.200
That seems fake.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.030
- They do, it depends on where they're at.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.536
- Alright, it just seems fake.

00:02:37.536 --> 00:02:39.450
You can't just not eat for three months

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.660
that seems crazy.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.110
Are you suffering PTSD from this?

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.060
- I'm not, I've never had any bear dreams

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.070
or any nightmares or any issues.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.930
A little more anxious, nervous
back in the woods obviously.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.550
- For the record, what
are we supposed to do

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.900
when we encounter a black
bear versus a grizzly bear.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.480
- A grizzly bear if it attacks
you, you wanna play dead.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.530
You don't wanna run

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.320
because that triggers that
predator prey response

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.370
and they're going to chase you.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.520
Black bears are a little different.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.070
You may want to try to fight it off.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.980
- What are you supposed
to do for polar bears?

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.720
- Say your prayers I think, yeah.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.870
- I mean you did do the one cardinal sin

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.120
when a bear attacks

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.760
and that's not reach for
your phone and start filming.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.530
- (laughs) Had I known the
video was gonna go viral--

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.340
- We would have been sitting on some gold.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.173
- Yes.

00:03:24.173 --> 00:03:25.470
- Don't worry I'm in show business.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.040
And I made a 100% accurate
reenactment video.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.230
I just need you to walk
us through what happened.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.610
- Well it was a Saturday morning

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.443
and I wanted to get out,

00:03:33.443 --> 00:03:35.620
it was a couple weeks
before hunting season.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.520
And I wanted to get--

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.340
- Just a heads up the part of you

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.950
is being played by three
hot chicks in bikinis.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.190
That's what we're currently
doing here in Hollywood.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.230
Gender bending the rules for the ladies.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.380
I'm told it's empowering.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.213
- Oh okay.

00:03:51.213 --> 00:03:52.750
- I hope they scissor.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.170
- Well it was a Saturday morning

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.003
and I wanted to get out,

00:03:55.003 --> 00:03:57.013
it was a couple weeks
before hunting season.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.260
And so I get about three
miles up the trail,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.290
and at the far end of the meadow

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.480
about 80 yards is a grizzly bear sow.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.313
- Hello.

00:04:05.313 --> 00:04:07.630
(girls gasp)

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.483
- With two cubs.

00:04:08.483 --> 00:04:09.650
- [Girls] Aww.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.810
- [Daniel] Female grizzly
bear is called a sow?

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:14.990
- [Todd] Sow, yes.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.510
- Now how do you know that it's not like

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.950
a single father raising his kid.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.330
- [Todd] Fathers do not raise the cubs,

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.880
it's always with the sows.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.770
- You think with the current
#MeToo movement and everything

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.830
that maybe the fathers

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.663
would step up.
- Something should change

00:04:27.663 --> 00:04:28.496
there maybe, yeah.

00:04:28.496 --> 00:04:30.130
- But no, huh interesting.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.290
- She runs over the ridge, disappears.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.040
I thought, alright she's gone that way,

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.960
I'll go up the trail and continue my day

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.370
I'll never see her again.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.820
I took a few steps, heard a noise,

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.980
and she had circled around the ridge

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.599
and came in behind me charging.

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:45.766
(roaring)

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.453
- [Daniel] Like how long of a time--

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:48.380
- Just like a minute.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.300
She had covered a couple
hundred yards, dropped her cubs.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.250
- Here take them.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.800
- And then came by herself
back around behind me.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.420
And she's coming straight down the hill

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.810
going through the brush,
the grass is flying.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.680
Pulled my bear spray,
pulled the safety out,

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.800
thinking it's probably
just a bluff charge.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.450
But just in case gonna have it ready.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.860
In that two seconds she had
already covered that distance

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.810
and all of a sudden she's on top of me.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.300
And she bit me like five
times in my right arm.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.010
(roaring)

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.310
- Now they bite and tear or
just bite and let go and bite?

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.730
- She was mostly just
biting and letting go.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.500
- You feel like Marv Albert at this point,

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.160
no you would feel like the hooker.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.350
Marv Albert used to bite
hookers in the back, didn't he?

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.183
Continue.

00:05:32.183 --> 00:05:34.030
- But five seconds and she was gone.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.680
And I'm thinking wow, I was lucky,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.490
I just survived a grizzly bear attack.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.380
And I looked and I got arms bleeding

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.410
and like alright time
to go to the hospital

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:42.740
and get some stitches.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.220
So I start down the trail

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.430
and all of a sudden I hear

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.080
just something behind me makes me turn

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.440
and that bear had come off the ridge

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.300
and she's like 10 feet behind me now

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.700
and she's coming wide
open again in a charge.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.880
And there was no time, I
had bear spray in my hand,

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.450
pistol here, no time to even turn,

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.830
I just protect my vitals--

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.580
- By the way I don't even
know what vitals are.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.860
Okay so what is that?

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.500
- Just the soft part of your stomach

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.130
that they can tear into--

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.290
- Your neck is a bad spot.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.260
- The neck could be bad,
they could just one swipe.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.710
This time she's really mad.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.710
The first bite was in my left arm

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.300
and I heard the crunch of the bone

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.540
where she broke my arm.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.524
- [Daniel] I mean I can
see a dip in your arm.

00:06:15.524 --> 00:06:16.357
- There's a big divot there

00:06:16.357 --> 00:06:17.550
that's where the tendons
were sticking out.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.990
She ripped two tendons loose,

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.170
this whole part of my forearm

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.890
was just kind of shredded from the teeth.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:22.840
So I just told myself,

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.340
I'm like you gotta play
dead, you have to hold still

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.160
or she's going to continue chewing on you.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.920
- I can't even stay still
when I'm getting a massage

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.850
at a spa if they start applying

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.920
just a little bit of mild pressure.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.470
I'm just squirming.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.630
- It's amazing what your body can do

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.160
when you're in a survival situation.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.680
I just blocked out the pain.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.220
But all my other senses are heightened,

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.870
I can hear the crunching
of like her canine teeth

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.020
going into the muscle, pick me up,

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.640
shake me, slam me back down again.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.660
- [Daniel] How long is this attack?

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.820
- Probably a couple minutes
but it felt like hours.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.910
One of her claws cut up
the side of my scalp.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.530
My scalp was hanging over my ears.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.070
So my eyes were filled with
blood, got a broken arm,

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.380
tendons sticking out, and
then the bear just stops.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.940
And she just kind of
sniffing the back of my neck

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.870
and that was the eeriest
part of the whole thing

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.450
is to actually feel and hear her breath

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:11.710
right on the back of my neck.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:13.560
Just sittin' there going oh
please leave, please leave,

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.470
don't move, trying to hold my breath,

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.990
and then she just stood there
for like 30 seconds not moving

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.340
and I'm guessing she's
kinda looking around

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.150
and I'm just like, try not to breath,

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.670
trying to not make a sound.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:26.183
And all of a sudden she just
stepped off and disappeared.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.400
And I'm like I have to get out of here

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.890
so I wiped the blood from my eyes,

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.290
kind of looked each
direction, she wasn't there.

00:07:33.464 --> 00:07:36.550
- (exhales) Good Lord
Todd that was erotic.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.750
- Not really.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.310
- Was it worth it for the story?

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.630
- No it was not.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:41.810
- I still wish you'd pulled the gun

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:42.730
instead of the bear spray.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.480
- I think I would still
pull bear spray first.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.780
99% of the time that's gonna turn 'em.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.804
- I know but welcome to the 1%.

00:07:49.804 --> 00:07:50.820
- Yeah exactly.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.163
- It's a good club, I've
been in it for awhile.

00:07:54.884 --> 00:07:56.533
I'm sorry about this Todd.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:07:59.860
What'd I tell you guys?

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.923
No bears allowed I'm into otters.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.130
Truthfully twink spray
doesn't work on bears

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.576
but it sure does rile 'em up.

00:08:08.576 --> 00:08:09.409
(groaning)

00:08:09.409 --> 00:08:12.070
(roars)

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:14.510
If you don't know the difference
between an otter and a bear

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.180
head over to West Hollywood
and ask a park ranger.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.703
We'll be right back but first.
