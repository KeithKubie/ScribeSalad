00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.940
When it's time to celebrate with fireworks,
you could just buy them, or you could improvise

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.570
and make your own. In this project, we're
making these hand-held sparklers, that will

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.370
burn for up to a minute, and cost less than
a penny each.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.670
For this project, make sure you have some
clothes pins, some safety goggles, and a thick

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.149
pair of gloves. We're gonna be making some simple hand-held sparklers, that are just

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.129
dangerous enough, to add a little pyrotechnic
thrill to your next celebration. You may notice

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.670
these sparkle sticks, are almost exactly the
same, as the slow burning fuses that we made

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.429
in a different project. We used those to ignite
some homemade smoke flares, which you can

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:58.230
see in another project video. Alright, to
get started, let's pour 60 mL of water, into

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:05.050
a pan set on medium heat. This white powder,
is a mixture of 36 grams KNO3, and 24 grams

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.020
of white table sugar. With hot water and a
little bit of mixing, the powder should dissolve

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.270
completely. Next we can mix in a few drops
of food coloring, and I chose to use 7 drops

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.750
of red. At this point we're ready to add around
12 feet of 100% cotton yarn, and this will

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.750
need a couple of minutes to soak up the liquid.
When the yarn is super saturated, let's transfer

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.750
it to a cookie sheet in a zig-zag pattern
so it's all evenly spaced. Now this goes in

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.920
an oven set to 150ÂºC for about 20 minutes.
And at the 10 minute mark, it's a good idea

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.980
to slide a spatula, under the yarn to lift
it up, and help prevent it from baking to

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:47.320
the cookie sheet. Remember that this is extremely
flammable and very dangerous, so make sure

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.850
you use extreme caution, and have a fire extinguisher
close by. Alright, our time is up, so we can

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.850
remove the tray from the oven, and leave it
to cool for another 5-10 minutes. You can

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.700
see that when the yarn has cooled, it's fairly
stiff, and holds it's shape. To finish these

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.590
up, all we need to do is snip the ends with
a pair of scissors, and these sparklers are

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.490
ready to use. I went ahead and made a couple
more batches in festive colors, just for fun.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.700
Let's test this one out, by placing it in
the end of a clothespin, just like this. When

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.849
you light your sparkler, you'll see it smoke
quite a bit, and throw off a beautifully dangerous

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.870
array of sparks. The sparks are pretty hot,
and they can burn you, so make sure this is

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.849
done with adult supervision. You can use one
sparkle stick to light another very quickly,

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.719
and of course your clothespin holders can
be used over and over again. In my experience,

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:41.409
this is a cheap, and gratifying way to share
a little excitement, and wonder, on these

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:46.749
special occasions. The best part is, you can
make hundreds of them for just a few dollars.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.069
Well there's how to make some improvised hand-held
fireworks for your next celebration. If you

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.390
liked this project, perhaps you'll like some
