00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.850
- In this one brief moment

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.730
and in this challenging
time when our government

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.320
is pushing us backward,

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.530
at a time when the truth is disposable

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.780
and deceit is used as a strategic weapon,

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.070
when the echoes of past injustices linger

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.150
just beneath the surface,

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.890
waiting to burst forth like a broken dam,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.600
we need courage not just from politicians,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.550
but from ordinary
Americans in every corner

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.930
of this land and everywhere in between.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.210
Our democracy is counting
on each and every one of you

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.860
and in your countless
acts of selfless courage

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.520
to do your part.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.870
You see, when millions of
us do just our small part

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.930
at the same time, there
is no mountain too high,

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.563
no task too daunting, no dream too big.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.810
So to every American listening,

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.710
you may not be the
tallest or the strongest

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.510
or the best looking or the richest

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.196
or the fastest or the smartest

00:00:51.196 --> 00:00:53.140
or the most well-collected.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.950
You may look different, love different,

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.200
you may pray different.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.640
It is of no moment nor matter.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.840
We must all choose to
find a way or make one

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.153
because this is our America.
