00:00:04.025 --> 00:00:06.826
- In preparation for
the Magritte exhibition,

00:00:06.826 --> 00:00:11.074
we began examining The
Portrait, from 1935.

00:00:11.074 --> 00:00:15.409
What started as a fairly
routine conservation treatment

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:18.006
uncovered some very interesting details

00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:20.188
about Magritte's painting.

00:00:20.188 --> 00:00:22.302
As soon as we unframed The Portrait,

00:00:22.302 --> 00:00:24.449
we noticed something unusual.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.224
The paint actually went around the edges,

00:00:27.224 --> 00:00:29.889
and it was painted on all four sides.

00:00:29.889 --> 00:00:31.959
That was unusual for Magritte,

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:33.544
because normally, you can see

00:00:33.544 --> 00:00:36.804
the white, priming layer on all the edges.

00:00:36.804 --> 00:00:38.731
- We began with our normal
examination process,

00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:41.727
which involves taking the
painting into the photo studio.

00:00:41.727 --> 00:00:44.047
In ultraviolet, I noticed that there was

00:00:44.047 --> 00:00:46.826
some sort of discoloration
that was occurring,

00:00:46.826 --> 00:00:49.067
that it wasn't clear if
it was in the varnish

00:00:49.067 --> 00:00:50.079
that was present,

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.205
or something coming from
beneath the surface.

00:00:52.205 --> 00:00:53.366
Proceeding with the cleaning,

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:56.479
I used a solvent-based
solution to remove the varnish,

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:58.185
and once that was complete,

00:00:58.185 --> 00:01:01.298
again took the painting
back into the photo studio.

00:01:01.298 --> 00:01:03.165
I could still see that form underneath,

00:01:03.165 --> 00:01:05.799
but it was even more robust.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.043
What was happening, is,

00:01:07.043 --> 00:01:10.224
something underneath was
fluorescing differently

00:01:10.224 --> 00:01:11.826
than the upper paint layer.

00:01:11.826 --> 00:01:14.740
In the darkroom, I held each x-ray film

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.738
up to the light box,

00:01:15.738 --> 00:01:18.169
but you can only see one film at a time,

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:20.428
and it looked very unusual.

00:01:20.428 --> 00:01:22.657
It looked like there was something else

00:01:22.657 --> 00:01:23.748
underneath the bottle,

00:01:23.748 --> 00:01:25.142
something else underneath the plate,

00:01:25.142 --> 00:01:26.744
something else underneath the glass.

00:01:26.744 --> 00:01:27.944
But without having them all together,

00:01:27.944 --> 00:01:28.794
I couldn't make it out,

00:01:28.794 --> 00:01:29.785
and it just looked like a series

00:01:29.785 --> 00:01:31.817
of confusing brush strokes.

00:01:31.817 --> 00:01:36.817
I actually rotated the x-ray
to the left, 90 degrees.

00:01:38.086 --> 00:01:40.060
I spent about a half an hour

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.523
sitting on the floor in front of it,

00:01:41.523 --> 00:01:43.496
tracing my finger long it until I could

00:01:43.496 --> 00:01:45.301
make out the form underneath.

00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:47.745
I moved them closer and
closer and let them overlap,

00:01:47.745 --> 00:01:51.255
and I could see the outline
of a nude woman beneath.

00:01:51.255 --> 00:01:54.258
I was shocked and
immediately got out my phone

00:01:54.258 --> 00:01:56.360
and took pictures and texted my colleagues

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.145
to get the word out as fast as possible.

00:01:59.145 --> 00:02:02.129
- After seeing this
incredible image emerge

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:03.348
from underneath the portrait,

00:02:03.348 --> 00:02:06.727
we were immediately wanting
to know what the source was.

00:02:06.727 --> 00:02:09.129
One of my colleagues
from the Menil Collection

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.785
happened to be here and see it,

00:02:10.785 --> 00:02:14.376
and suggested a painting that was actually

00:02:14.376 --> 00:02:17.013
done by Magritte in 1927,

00:02:17.013 --> 00:02:19.055
and was thought to be lost.

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:22.503
This work under The
Portrait actually matched

00:02:22.503 --> 00:02:25.173
a quarter of a section
of The Enchanted Pose,

00:02:25.173 --> 00:02:27.694
which was a much larger painting.

00:02:27.694 --> 00:02:30.746
Now, we believe that he must
have cut up the painting

00:02:30.746 --> 00:02:34.079
into four sections and
re-used the sections

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.341
for paintings in 1935.

00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:38.757
- I've been working at MoMA

00:02:38.757 --> 00:02:40.452
for a little over five years now,

00:02:40.452 --> 00:02:42.762
and been fortunate enough to help with

00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:45.606
a lot of x-radiography
that is performed here,

00:02:45.606 --> 00:02:47.138
but this was a first for me,

00:02:47.138 --> 00:02:50.646
and probably the
opportunity of a lifetime.
