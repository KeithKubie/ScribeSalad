00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.180
PrepClass is an academic
solutions provider.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.260
We help students [? direct ?]
in local tests and examinations

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.350
to prepare by providing
them with past questions,

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.450
along with detailed answers and
solutions to those questions.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.140
We also help parents
who are looking

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.290
to get tutors for their children
who are specific needs, to find

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.970
tutors that are best fit for
their kids, and engage them.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.690
Regarding technology challenges.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.705
I would generally say
they kind of reduced

00:00:33.705 --> 00:00:38.010
as we went on, because we
learned to be more handy

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.280
and use simpler things.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.130
When we started,
it was a lot more

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.190
elaborate in terms of
product development, like I

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.720
said before.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.050
So we wanted it to be
perfect and all of that,

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.180
but as we went on we learned
to put more effort on things

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.920
that the market emphasizes.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.370
And then, managing
my own psyche means

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.520
keeping a positive
outlook irrespective

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.100
of whatever is
happening, because it

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.180
affects your productivity a lot.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.780
Sometimes you have
to wonder why sales

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.150
was lower than you expected, or
why the next big thing didn't

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.370
turn out so big.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.600
Or you come up with this
idea and the whole team

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.210
is going crazy,
like, Oh, this is

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.080
the silver bullet, and stuff.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.690
And two weeks later you're like,
Oh no, that didn't work at all.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.820
It's easy to get
negative about it,

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.522
but then that affects your
productivity a whole lot,

00:01:27.522 --> 00:01:29.730
especially because you're
still running a small team.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.670
And the outlook of the founders
gets to affect everyone else.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.970
At the beginning, there
was no "register for free,"

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.180
for instance.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.870
You had to pay before you had
any access to our platform.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.370
In time, we realized we have
to get people into the door.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.860
At least let them
have an account.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.520
Let them see what the platform
looks like on the back end,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.230
and then let them also get
access to some questions

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.090
before they decide, OK, I want
to put my money into this.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.220
So those were some of the
evolutionary processes that

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.370
happened in terms of
subscription model.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.120
So first it was, you
visited the platform

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.370
but you had to pay for
you to come in at all.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:13.067
Then at some point, we decided
to have a free version where

00:02:13.067 --> 00:02:15.025
you get to access a
limited number of questions

00:02:15.025 --> 00:02:17.210
and you get to have
a free account.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.950
And then you have
to pay a premium fee

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.580
if you want access to rest.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.190
And later on we did a
bit of a [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.350
that now brings some
revenue, as well,

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.520
but it's not a
subscription-based model.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.670
It's more an outlook.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.710
You decide, OK, I
want to do this.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.220
And it's not what
everybody does,

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.810
but it can create
value if it works.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.110
It's a risk, right?

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.610
But if it works it
can create value.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.220
And I think that's where
entrepreneurship begins.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.440
I don't think it begins
when you quite your job

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.480
or start out your own business
or do anything so dramatic,

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.560
as the case may.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.960
But if you have the
initiative, even

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.420
if you're working at a job,
to do things differently,

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.310
and it's going to create
value not only for yourself

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.530
but for the entire company, or
the community that you're in,

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.760
or the entire society.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.030
I think that's being
entrepreneurial.
