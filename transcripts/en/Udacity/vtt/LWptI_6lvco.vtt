In addition to [UNKNOWN] mehta talks about, meta at all talks about services.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:12.210
Now these are not, services in the sense of services that the, user sees or

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.370
even service in the sense of client server. Okay that words,

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.060
it's a unit of computational service. These are services that connect or

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.880
provides the overall architecture. According to Mehta, it's a service

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.770
category that represents the broad interaction role the connector fulfills, and

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.840
they lay out four different categories of services including Communication.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.650
That is the transmittal of data. Coordination which is the trans,

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.990
transfer of control. Conversion that's when some kind of a translation is

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.729
going on, particularly among data formats. Okay? And

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:55.120
Facilitation that is some kind of mediation or operation optimization activity.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.080
And they use the abbreviations, T,O,X and F respectively on,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.489
in their diagrams to abbreviate those particular four categories of services.
