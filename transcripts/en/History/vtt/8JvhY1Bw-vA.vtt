[music playing]

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:04.629
DANNY: When the local Fox 5 News
team asked us for some help,

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:06.423
we knew this was going to be
a totally different project.

00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:07.799
It's not every day
you're asked to paint

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.301
cartoon foxes on a storm
chaser type of vehicle.

00:00:10.301 --> 00:00:12.429
But my crew went
above and beyond.

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:13.513
And I got to tell
you, I couldn't

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:15.515
be happier with this vehicle.

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:17.225
Todd and Terri
from Fox 5 are here

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:20.103
today to take this storm chaser
vehicle back to the station.

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:22.313
And I just hope they are as
blown away over this thing

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:23.606
as I am.

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:26.443
So tell me now, you
brought us a 2005

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:27.861
Expedition, Ford Expedition.

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:30.071
And the object of the
game for this truck

00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:32.991
is Fox 5 is going to
take it to schools?

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:34.325
Yes.

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:35.493
Well, we have a good
team meteorologist.

00:00:35.493 --> 00:00:36.786
And they want to
go out to schools

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:39.539
and educate kids on whether.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:40.874
I dig it.

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:44.085
So over at Fox 5,
you all have a mascot.

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:45.044
Rusty the Fox.

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:46.212
Rusty the Fox.

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:49.090
I understand you
really like Rusty.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.592
The kids love Rusty.

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:52.343
The kids love Rusty.

00:00:52.343 --> 00:00:53.887
Then you're really going to be
pleased with the look of this,

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:57.640
because Rusty is an integral
part of this vehicle.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.933
- Oh, perfect.
- You ready for this?

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.059
- I'm ready.
- We're ready.

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.227
Come up here.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:02.520
Let's wander up
in this direction.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.732
I got two of my guys
bringing him out.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:11.070
Yo, Ryan and Mike, bring out
that beautiful truck, man.

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:19.954
Oh, my gosh.

00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:20.914
Oh.

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:22.499
That's incredible.

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:23.792
How cool is that?

00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:25.251
That is incredible.

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.045
[engine revving]

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:28.046
DANNY: Feeling it?

00:01:28.046 --> 00:01:29.672
Yeah.

00:01:29.672 --> 00:01:31.800
DANNY: To get this baby
ready to tackle any storm,

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.219
we toughened her up by adding
cages to the headlights,

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.222
the tail lights, and a bright
LED light bar to the roof,

00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:39.933
and some heavy duty
Nerf Bar running boards.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.644
But the real story here,
man, is the paint job.

00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:45.772
Ryan and his team hand-painted
every square inch of this truck

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:48.942
with Fox 5 mascot Rusty the
Fox, and all the weather

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.819
and landmarks of Las Vegas.

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:52.612
They topped it off
with a satin clear,

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:56.074
making it fingerprint proof so
it can handle a storm of kids

00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:58.743
as well.
- That is awesome.

00:01:58.743 --> 00:01:59.953
Look at this.

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:01.412
Well, there's
your Rusty the Fox.

00:02:01.412 --> 00:02:02.372
He made it.

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:03.331
He's alive.

00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:04.415
He's back.

00:02:04.415 --> 00:02:06.167
The detail is incredible.

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:07.794
It's nothing what I expected.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.504
It's meant to be interactive.

00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:11.840
Every inch on this truck,
if you just keep looking,

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.092
you'll just keep discovering
more and more things.

00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:17.220
And the idea behind
the satin clear on this

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.347
is it's kid hand friendly.

00:02:19.347 --> 00:02:22.684
So by all means, have them
walk up, touch it, feel it.

00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:24.352
And you're not
worried about, oh, kid

00:02:24.352 --> 00:02:25.854
hands all over the shiny paint.

00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:28.106
Yeah, there's a lot of
depth and dimension to it.

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:29.691
And there's even Mount
Charleston right here.

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:30.984
Yep.

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:31.860
Well, we said the
kids could touch it.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.195
We didn't say you could.

00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:39.784
The whole thing is all
literally hand-done artwork.

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:41.286
It's incredible.

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:42.912
We don't have a chopper,
but we have a balloon.

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:44.163
This is amazing.

00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:45.832
It's fantastic.

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:48.501
Taking away from the paint
right now for just a moment,

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:51.421
we wanted to rugged
the truck up a bit.

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:54.173
So we stepped up the
wheel and tire package.

00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:58.469
We went with these really cool
Cooper Discover AT3s on them.

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:00.722
They're an all-terrain tire.

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:03.266
They're an all-weather,
all-season tire.

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:05.184
They're great for
off road, and they're

00:03:05.184 --> 00:03:06.895
also great on the highways.

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:09.856
So this truck can be rolling
down the highway all day long,

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:12.567
and then take it off on the
trails and things like that.

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:15.278
You've got the push bars, the
headlight protectors, the tail

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:16.571
light protects, all of that.

00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:19.157
The truck drives
great, looks great.

00:03:19.157 --> 00:03:21.034
It's got that tough vibe.

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:23.953
But then you look at what she's
saying, and every inch of her

00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:26.331
tells a story that's going
to draw the kids right in.

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:28.750
And it's all the things
that happened in Vegas

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.251
that are weather related.

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:31.044
We have everything.

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:31.920
We've got snow.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.296
We've got rain.

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:34.756
And that's where it
gets people interactive.

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:37.091
Who hasn't been in a
car wreck in the rain?

00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:38.801
Who hasn't been
abducted by aliens out

00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:39.969
in the middle of the desert.

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:42.221
That's right.

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:43.806
Did you go see the hood?

00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:45.767
You guys got to
look at this one.

00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:48.478
This is, in my opinion,
a show vehicle.

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:50.813
The artwork is
staggering all over it.

00:03:50.813 --> 00:03:53.149
But the finish, man,
being able to touch it,

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:54.567
I don't ever touch our vehicles.

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.277
I just got to do that.

00:03:56.277 --> 00:03:58.863
It will take the wind, the
rain, the sand, and the kids.

00:03:58.863 --> 00:03:59.906
Yeah, we're done.

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:01.282
See you later.
