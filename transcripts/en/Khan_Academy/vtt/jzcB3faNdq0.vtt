00:00:00.187 --> 00:00:01.778
- [Voiceover] Potassium sorbate, and they

00:00:01.778 --> 00:00:03.299
give us its formula right over here,

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:07.117
has a molar mass of 150 grams per mole.

00:00:07.117 --> 00:00:08.477
They put this decimal here to show us

00:00:08.477 --> 00:00:10.567
that these are actually
three significant figures.

00:00:10.567 --> 00:00:12.621
Even the zero is a significant digit here.

00:00:12.621 --> 00:00:16.023
Is commonly added to diet
soft drinks as a preservative.

00:00:16.023 --> 00:00:18.705
A stock solution of potassium sorbate,

00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:20.597
dissolvent's an aqueous solution here,

00:00:20.597 --> 00:00:23.419
of known concentration must be prepared.

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.922
A student titrates 45
millileters of the stock solution

00:00:27.922 --> 00:00:32.922
with one point two five
molar hydrochloric acid

00:00:32.927 --> 00:00:36.452
using both an indicator and a pH meter.

00:00:36.452 --> 00:00:39.264
The value of K A for sorbic acid is

00:00:39.264 --> 00:00:42.748
one point seven times ten
to the negative fifth.

00:00:42.748 --> 00:00:46.159
All right, so let's tackle
this piece by piece.

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:50.699
Write the net ionic equation
for the reaction between

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.674
potassium sorbate and hydrochloric acid.

00:00:54.674 --> 00:00:56.973
All right, so first off, let's
write the ionic equation,

00:00:56.973 --> 00:00:58.831
and then we'll, I'll write
the net ionic equation,

00:00:58.831 --> 00:01:00.653
and hopefully you'll see the difference.

00:01:00.653 --> 00:01:04.953
So ionic, ionic equation.

00:01:06.273 --> 00:01:07.736
And the way we think about ionic equations

00:01:07.736 --> 00:01:09.886
is we think about well,
if these are dissolved

00:01:09.886 --> 00:01:12.068
in water, it's an aqueous
solution, these are going

00:01:12.068 --> 00:01:15.970
to disassociate into their, into ions.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.292
And so we would write
that out on both of the,

00:01:18.292 --> 00:01:21.170
on both the reactant and the product side.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.991
So the potassium sorbate,
we can write that as,

00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:29.517
it's gonna be a potassium ion dissolved

00:01:29.517 --> 00:01:34.517
in an aqueous solution, plus the

00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:39.551
C six H seven O two, this is also

00:01:39.671 --> 00:01:44.484
going to be an ion dissolved
in the aqueous solution,

00:01:44.484 --> 00:01:47.282
plus the hydrochloric acid
will dissolve, so you have

00:01:47.282 --> 00:01:52.282
the hydrogen proton dissolved
in the aqueous solution

00:01:52.413 --> 00:01:57.351
plus the chloride ion, or
anion I guess we could say it.

00:01:58.281 --> 00:02:02.966
so that's going to be
in our aqueous solution,

00:02:02.966 --> 00:02:05.011
and then they react.

00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:06.427
What happens?

00:02:06.427 --> 00:02:08.215
Well, you're going to have the

00:02:08.215 --> 00:02:10.595
C six H seven O two react with

00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:15.053
the hydrogen proton to get to sorbic acid.

00:02:15.053 --> 00:02:16.981
So you're gonna have sorbic acid,

00:02:16.981 --> 00:02:21.245
H C six H seven O two,
that's the sorbic acid.

00:02:25.185 --> 00:02:28.348
It's going to be in an aqueous solution.

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:33.027
So I took care so far of that and that,

00:02:33.027 --> 00:02:35.100
and then you're going to have,

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.247
and then you're going to
have your potassium ions,

00:02:39.247 --> 00:02:43.868
your potassium ions
and your chloride ions.

00:02:43.868 --> 00:02:45.660
It's going to be just like that.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.121
So this right over here
is the ionic equation,

00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:51.140
not the net ionic equation.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.103
I have the ions on the reaction,

00:02:53.103 --> 00:02:54.321
on the reactant side, and then on

00:02:54.321 --> 00:02:56.063
the product side right over here.

00:02:56.063 --> 00:02:57.840
And did I, yep, I included everything.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.499
Now you do the net ionic reaction,

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:01.346
you can imagine what's
going to happen here.

00:03:01.346 --> 00:03:02.738
I have potassium ions on the left.

00:03:02.738 --> 00:03:04.225
I have potassium ions on the right.

00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:06.663
I could net them out on both sides.

00:03:06.663 --> 00:03:08.242
So let's net them out on both sides.

00:03:08.242 --> 00:03:09.820
I have chloride ions on the left.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.470
I have chloride ions on the right.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.318
I could net them out on both sides.

00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:15.802
And then I can write
the net ionic equation.

00:03:15.802 --> 00:03:20.486
So the net ionic equation,
net ionic equation,

00:03:24.486 --> 00:03:29.311
is going to be well, I
have my C six H seven O two

00:03:31.351 --> 00:03:34.505
ion dissolved in an aqueous solution.

00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:37.130
You combine that with the hydrogen proton

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.109
dissolved in the aqueous
solution, and it's going to,

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.825
it's going to give us sorbic acid:

00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:50.761
H C six H seven O two
in our aqueous solution.

00:03:53.561 --> 00:03:54.397
So there you have it.

00:03:54.397 --> 00:03:58.574
That is the net ionic equation.
