00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.733
Graph B can help us visualize the first inequality, and graph A can help us

00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:07.676
visualize the second one. Now, we're not totally there yet in terms of the

00:00:07.676 --> 00:00:11.834
actual inequalities themselves, but at least in both cases, we now have the

00:00:11.834 --> 00:00:16.058
curves and lines graph that we need in order to show these inequalities on the

00:00:16.058 --> 00:00:20.362
graphs. Remember that when we were dealing with solving equations graphically,

00:00:20.362 --> 00:00:24.327
you could look at both sides of an equation and set each one individually equal

00:00:24.327 --> 00:00:28.388
to y, and then graph the two equations that gave us. So in this first graph over

00:00:28.388 --> 00:00:32.170
here, which we know of course belongs to x squared minus 16 is greater than

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.272
zero. I've graphed the parabola, y equals x squared minus 16, and I've graphed

00:00:36.272 --> 00:00:41.453
the line, y equals zero. Just the x-axis. Over here in coordinate plane b, I've

00:00:41.453 --> 00:00:46.096
graphed the parabola y equals x squared, and the line y equals 16.
