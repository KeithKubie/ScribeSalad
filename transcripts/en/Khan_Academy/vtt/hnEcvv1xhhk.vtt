00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.504
- [Voiceover] An individual
has lost the ability

00:00:02.504 --> 00:00:07.320
to activate B cells and mount
a humoral immune response.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.580
Part A, propose one direct
consequence of the loss

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.722
of B-cell activity on
the individual's humoral

00:00:14.722 --> 00:00:18.273
immune response to the initial exposure

00:00:18.273 --> 00:00:20.594
to a bacterial pathogen.

00:00:20.594 --> 00:00:23.008
So, just as a reminder what B cells are,

00:00:23.008 --> 00:00:24.693
and what a humoral immune response are,

00:00:24.693 --> 00:00:29.476
a humoral immune response is
one that involves antibodies.

00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:32.775
And B cells are the ones that
will recognize an antigen,

00:00:32.775 --> 00:00:35.696
something that the body
doesn't want in its body,

00:00:35.696 --> 00:00:38.143
and then in response to
that, those antigens,

00:00:38.143 --> 00:00:41.210
it will produce, it will
one, it'll proliferate,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.753
it'll differentiate into plasma cells

00:00:43.753 --> 00:00:46.803
that produce antibodies
which are essentially

00:00:46.803 --> 00:00:51.128
these macro molecules that
tag the antigens for cleanup,

00:00:51.128 --> 00:00:55.141
and then it can differentiate
into memory B cells.

00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:59.228
So that next time, when
that same antigen shows up

00:00:59.228 --> 00:01:01.668
it can mount a faster response.

00:01:01.668 --> 00:01:06.235
So part A, propose one direct
consequence of the loss

00:01:06.235 --> 00:01:08.507
of B-cell activity on
the individual's humoral

00:01:08.507 --> 00:01:11.414
immune response to the initial exposure

00:01:11.414 --> 00:01:13.496
to a bacterial pathogen.

00:01:13.496 --> 00:01:15.624
So there won't be a humoral response.

00:01:15.624 --> 00:01:16.728
So I could say,

00:01:16.728 --> 00:01:21.212
No, no antibodies,

00:01:21.212 --> 00:01:24.535
bodies will

00:01:24.535 --> 00:01:27.466
be produced,

00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:30.495
so no humoral immune response.

00:01:30.495 --> 00:01:33.195
So there

00:01:33.195 --> 00:01:35.601
will be

00:01:35.601 --> 00:01:38.667
no humoral immune response.

00:01:38.667 --> 00:01:43.257
Humoral immune,

00:01:43.257 --> 00:01:47.330
immune response

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.315
to the initial exposure.

00:01:49.315 --> 00:01:53.209
To initial,

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:56.503
initial exposure.

00:01:56.503 --> 00:01:58.752
So you're not going to have
any tagging of these antigens

00:01:58.752 --> 00:02:02.842
that then can be cleaned
up by other immune cells.

00:02:02.842 --> 00:02:04.992
None of that's going to happen.

00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:08.508
Part B, propose one direct
consequence of the loss

00:02:08.508 --> 00:02:11.370
of B-cell activity on the
speed of the inidividual's

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.394
humoral immune response
to a second exposure

00:02:14.394 --> 00:02:16.885
to the bacterial pathogen.

00:02:16.885 --> 00:02:19.746
Well you have no memory B cells.

00:02:19.746 --> 00:02:24.273
No memory B cells

00:02:24.273 --> 00:02:27.203
and no antibodies.

00:02:27.203 --> 00:02:30.269
Antibodies.

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.909
Specific or, I could say,

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:35.181
for second exposure to pathogen.

00:02:35.181 --> 00:02:37.922
For second

00:02:37.922 --> 00:02:40.947
exposure

00:02:40.947 --> 00:02:44.866
to pathogen.

00:02:44.866 --> 00:02:47.975
So no humoral response.

00:02:47.975 --> 00:02:50.635
So no

00:02:50.635 --> 00:02:54.061
humoral response.

00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:56.841
And overall immune
response will be slower.

00:02:56.841 --> 00:02:58.740
The whole point of B
cells and the antibodies

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.506
is that the second time it shows around,

00:03:00.506 --> 00:03:01.805
it gets tagged very quickly.

00:03:01.805 --> 00:03:03.490
It gets recognized very quickly.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.611
And then the immune system can respond.

00:03:05.611 --> 00:03:06.848
Well now you're not going to have that.

00:03:06.848 --> 00:03:09.547
You're not going to have this
in the secondary exposure,

00:03:09.547 --> 00:03:12.155
that quick recognition of the antigen.

00:03:12.155 --> 00:03:14.164
So you're not going to
have humoral response,

00:03:14.164 --> 00:03:16.207
and you could say, overall,

00:03:16.207 --> 00:03:19.367
overall immune response,

00:03:19.367 --> 00:03:21.590
immune response will be slower.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.783
Immune response

00:03:24.783 --> 00:03:27.392
is going to be slower and less effective.

00:03:27.392 --> 00:03:28.707
Slower and

00:03:28.707 --> 00:03:32.683
less effective.

00:03:32.683 --> 00:03:35.235
Alright, let's think about part C.

00:03:35.235 --> 00:03:38.256
Describe one characteristic
of the individual's

00:03:38.256 --> 00:03:40.166
immune response to the bacterial pathogen

00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:42.911
that is not affected
by the loss of B cells.

00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:43.934
Well the B cells are all about

00:03:43.934 --> 00:03:45.772
the humoral immune response.

00:03:45.772 --> 00:03:49.615
It's about tagging things with antibodies,

00:03:49.615 --> 00:03:51.498
having the memory B cells around

00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:55.383
so that the next time
you get the pathogen,

00:03:55.383 --> 00:03:57.795
the second exposure, you
have a quicker response.

00:03:57.795 --> 00:03:59.915
But it's not the only
part of our immune system.

00:03:59.915 --> 00:04:02.747
Our immune system has,
still, many facets to it.

00:04:02.747 --> 00:04:05.112
One, you're still going
to have the cell mediated

00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:06.490
immune response.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.254
Still have

00:04:10.254 --> 00:04:13.970
cell mediated,

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.318
mediated immune response.

00:04:17.318 --> 00:04:21.569
Immune response.

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:25.410
And these are things like phagocytes

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.137
that will go and engulf,

00:04:27.137 --> 00:04:29.633
that will engulf the pathogens.

00:04:29.633 --> 00:04:31.911
Phagocytes.

00:04:31.911 --> 00:04:35.956
Phagocytes, you have T cells

00:04:37.668 --> 00:04:39.377
that can recognize the antigen

00:04:39.377 --> 00:04:42.493
and similarly try to go
about destroying the antigen.

00:04:42.493 --> 00:04:45.921
So you still have the cell
mediated immune response.

00:04:45.921 --> 00:04:48.547
You also have things like the skin,

00:04:48.547 --> 00:04:52.267
things that just block pathogens

00:04:52.267 --> 00:04:53.033
from entering your body.

00:04:53.033 --> 00:04:55.318
And that's considered part
of your immune system.

00:04:55.318 --> 00:04:59.325
Still have

00:04:59.325 --> 00:05:02.454
skin protection.

00:05:02.454 --> 00:05:03.645
And you can go into more detail

00:05:03.645 --> 00:05:05.604
but these are still the types of things

00:05:05.604 --> 00:05:06.903
that the body has,

00:05:06.903 --> 00:05:09.074
even if it lost its B cell capability

00:05:09.074 --> 00:05:11.966
in order to prevent
pathogens from entering,

00:05:11.966 --> 00:05:13.808
in the case of skin,

00:05:13.808 --> 00:05:16.505
and also still once the pathogens get in,

00:05:16.505 --> 00:05:18.420
to still recognize them and engulf them

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.805
or destroy them in some way.
