00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.992
Julia just mentioned that a few
of you had commented,

00:00:02.992 --> 00:00:05.471
when we were
talking about the genetic code,

00:00:05.471 --> 00:00:07.712
that some of you thought the
fact that it

00:00:07.712 --> 00:00:10.539
was degenerate,
it had some redundancy in it,

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:12.755
like multiple
codons or threonine,

00:00:12.755 --> 00:00:15.426
that that was kind of cool,
and some of you

00:00:15.426 --> 00:00:18.631
thought it was sort of a waste
and would have maybe designed

00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:19.927
the thing
differently.

00:00:19.927 --> 00:00:22.445
That's, you know,
part of when you study biology

00:00:22.445 --> 00:00:25.812
you don't
get to design it from first

00:00:25.812 --> 00:00:27.000
principles.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.733
You found out what happened
during evolution and what got

00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:31.800
selected for.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.914
And once it gets selected for
then that gets sort of fixed in

00:00:35.914 --> 00:00:36.600
nature.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.650
If there were four nucleotides
then you could have one,

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.666
two and
three-letter words.

00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:46.200
And it's going to be a
three-letter word to have at

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.127
least 20 then you've got some
degeneracy or redundancy,

00:00:50.127 --> 00:00:53.167
but that's
not necessarily a bad thing.

00:00:53.167 --> 00:00:55.800
And, in fact,
if you go into the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.708
evolution of the code more
deeply, people are beginning to

00:00:59.708 --> 00:01:02.755
suspect it
evolved from a simpler one.

00:01:02.755 --> 00:01:07.040
And there actually are some
relationships between some of

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.141
the codons that go back to the
similarities,

00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:13.355
the chemical similarities
between the amino

00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:13.725
acids.

00:01:13.725 --> 00:01:16.507
And it also allows some things
for some cells,

00:01:16.507 --> 00:01:19.072
for example,
if they want proteins to be

00:01:19.072 --> 00:01:21.640
present at very low levels they
will use a

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.258
codon that has just a very low
level of the corresponding tRNA.

00:01:25.258 --> 00:01:27.667
And if
they want to make a lot of the

00:01:27.667 --> 00:01:29.927
protein they'll use a tRNA that
it

00:01:29.927 --> 00:01:31.269
makes in abundance.

00:01:31.269 --> 00:01:33.812
And so it's sort of another way
of

00:01:33.812 --> 00:01:35.653
controlling levels of proteins.

00:01:35.653 --> 00:01:38.623
There are a lot of different
subtleties in here.

00:01:38.623 --> 00:01:41.060
And also in biology redundancy
is not

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.268
necessarily a bad thing.

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:44.684
It's just like on a space
flight, if something

00:01:44.684 --> 00:01:47.842
goes wrong and if there's some
kind of redundant function then

00:01:47.842 --> 00:01:49.272
you've
got some backups,

00:01:49.272 --> 00:01:49.498
too.

00:01:49.498 --> 00:01:49.668
OK.

00:01:49.668 --> 00:01:51.935
Well, in any case,
today is a pretty

00:01:51.935 --> 00:01:54.064
interesting first part of the
lecture.

00:01:54.064 --> 00:01:57.214
I've heard a few people
express the view that why can't

00:01:57.214 --> 00:01:59.187
I just teach what's in the
textbook

00:01:59.187 --> 00:02:00.849
and get on with it?

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:04.000
And I think this part,
for those of

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.083
you who are following,
really trying to understand

00:02:08.083 --> 00:02:11.478
what I'm trying to do
with this course,

00:02:11.478 --> 00:02:14.695
I hope this will help you to
see this.

00:02:14.695 --> 00:02:17.611
Because what
I've talked about,

00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:22.000
this thing that Crick called
the "central dogma"

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.300
which was the direction of
information flow in biology

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.806
which
was from DNA to RNA to

00:02:29.806 --> 00:02:30.545
proteins.

00:02:30.545 --> 00:02:33.583
And I'll just remind you,
although

00:02:33.583 --> 00:02:37.215
proteins do many things they
are, for example,

00:02:37.215 --> 00:02:40.298
enzymes that are
biological catalysts.

00:02:40.298 --> 00:02:42.807
And it was pretty
well-established,

00:02:42.807 --> 00:02:45.952
even by the
time I was an undergrad that

00:02:45.952 --> 00:02:49.080
this was the way information
flow went in

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.487
biology and this was how it
worked.

00:02:51.487 --> 00:02:54.247
And there were various
statements in

00:02:54.247 --> 00:02:57.912
the literature that what was
true for E.

00:02:57.912 --> 00:03:00.936
coli was true
for an elephant.

00:03:00.936 --> 00:03:05.106
And it is still true today in a
broad sense that,

00:03:05.106 --> 00:03:08.212
as I've tried to emphasize
throughout the course,

00:03:08.212 --> 00:03:11.989
when you get down to a cellular
molecule level there's an awful

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.155
lot
in common and things look much

00:03:14.155 --> 00:03:16.497
more alike than different
compared to

00:03:16.497 --> 00:03:18.873
what we see at a more
macroscopic scale.

00:03:18.873 --> 00:03:22.297
However, that doesn't mean
that all the details are the

00:03:22.297 --> 00:03:22.593
same.

00:03:22.593 --> 00:03:24.783
And maybe you could begin to
get a

00:03:24.783 --> 00:03:28.327
glimmering of that when I told
you that although the genetic

00:03:28.327 --> 00:03:30.464
code is
virtually universal.

00:03:30.464 --> 00:03:33.075
That almost every organism,
with

00:03:33.075 --> 00:03:36.059
only a couple very tiny
exceptions, uses exactly the

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:39.062
same genetic code
to have nucleotides correspond

00:03:39.062 --> 00:03:41.383
to three-letter words in the
nucleic

00:03:41.383 --> 00:03:44.835
acid alphabet correspond to
particular amino acids in a

00:03:44.835 --> 00:03:45.538
protein.

00:03:45.538 --> 00:03:49.692
But the other languages that
are written in there such as the

00:03:49.692 --> 00:03:53.846
sequence to start transcribing
a gene, making an RNA copy or

00:03:53.846 --> 00:03:54.192
stop.

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:57.446
Those are different between
different organisms.

00:03:57.446 --> 00:03:58.000
Yeah?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.856
Glycolysis enzymes are
amazingly

00:04:05.856 --> 00:04:06.328
similar.

00:04:06.328 --> 00:04:08.568
They are very clearly,
they arose once,

00:04:08.568 --> 00:04:11.215
and they have
stayed right through evolution.

00:04:11.215 --> 00:04:13.284
You could, in principle,
sometimes in

00:04:13.284 --> 00:04:16.323
evolution you get something
that creates a function and

00:04:16.323 --> 00:04:17.835
something
that starts out,

00:04:17.835 --> 00:04:20.713
and then like what they call
convergent evolution you

00:04:20.713 --> 00:04:23.259
end up with two things that
came from a different

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:25.741
evolutionary origin
but have learned to do,

00:04:25.741 --> 00:04:28.141
let's say, catalyze the same
biochemical

00:04:28.141 --> 00:04:29.808
reaction or something.

00:04:29.808 --> 00:04:31.399
Glycolysis came once.

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:33.926
But if you
were to look inside E.

00:04:33.926 --> 00:04:35.749
coli or yeast,
let's say E.

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:38.505
coli and look at
how those enzymes are

00:04:38.505 --> 00:04:41.920
regulated, the thing that says
this is the start of

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.008
a gene, start making the RNA,
it would look totally different

00:04:46.008 --> 00:04:48.638
than if
you looked in a mouse because

00:04:48.638 --> 00:04:51.459
the language,
the promoter does not have

00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:55.020
the same sequence in an E.
coli and in a human or in a

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.423
mouse.

00:04:55.423 --> 00:04:59.247
And I'll
tell you more about that today.

00:04:59.247 --> 00:05:02.669
But there were --
I want to just now tell you

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.141
sort of three things that were
sort of

00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:07.947
exceptions to this general way
of thinking.

00:05:07.947 --> 00:05:10.790
Every one of them
generated a Nobel Prize.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.425
And this is a fun lecture for
me to give

00:05:13.425 --> 00:05:16.489
because the individuals
involved in all of these things

00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:19.263
had a very, very
close association with MIT.

00:05:19.263 --> 00:05:21.711
And when I told you when Crick
called

00:05:21.711 --> 00:05:25.490
this a central dogma he meant a
hypothesis, or at least an idea

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.964
for
which there was not reasonable

00:05:28.964 --> 00:05:30.000
evidence.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.454
And he learned later it was
something a true believer cannot

00:05:35.454 --> 00:05:36.028
doubt.

00:05:36.028 --> 00:05:40.908
And once this gets established
it does get in the

00:05:40.908 --> 00:05:44.245
textbook and it does get in
your thinking.

00:05:44.245 --> 00:05:47.468
And so information goes
down this way.

00:05:47.468 --> 00:05:49.839
But there were a few oddities.

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:53.950
I mean there were some
viruses that had RNA inside

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:54.346
them.

00:05:54.346 --> 00:05:56.006
They didn't have DNA.

00:05:56.006 --> 00:05:59.072
So how where
these handled?

00:05:59.072 --> 00:06:03.444
Well, there turned out to be
two

00:06:03.444 --> 00:06:05.452
classes of RNA virus.

00:06:05.452 --> 00:06:09.375
One that was studied quite
heavily called,

00:06:09.375 --> 00:06:13.560
it's a
plant virus called the tobacco

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.959
mosaic virus.

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:17.220
And it had a coat.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.814
And then it had in it a piece
of RNA.

00:06:20.814 --> 00:06:27.801
Now, you can see if that virus
were to inject RNA in the cell

00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:31.000
it could encode proteins.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.869
But that genetic material has
to be copied.

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:55.000
And the RNA was copied --
-- by an RNA dependent

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.836
RNA polymerase.

00:06:57.836 --> 00:07:04.454
And so it's sort of just like
the

00:07:04.454 --> 00:07:08.263
RNA polymerase before,
except instead of using DNA as

00:07:08.263 --> 00:07:10.477
its template
it can use RNA.

00:07:10.477 --> 00:07:14.269
So that sort of somehow would
be a little loop in

00:07:14.269 --> 00:07:18.142
here about RNA being able to
copy itself that hadn't been

00:07:18.142 --> 00:07:19.180
anticipated.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.917
And although this is an
important virus in the plant

00:07:22.917 --> 00:07:26.071
industry, for
plants and agriculture,

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:29.000
it's not so important for
humans.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.137
But there's another class of
RNA viruses that are very

00:07:36.137 --> 00:07:37.887
important.

00:07:37.887 --> 00:07:42.543
And these are called
retroviruses.

00:07:42.543 --> 00:07:50.204
And the reason these are so
important is that the HIV-1

00:07:50.204 --> 00:07:55.665
virus that's associated with
AIDS is such

00:07:55.665 --> 00:07:57.270
a retrovirus.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:04.555
It's a virus that has a coat
and it has an RNA that's its

00:08:04.555 --> 00:08:06.694
genetic material.

00:08:06.694 --> 00:08:11.100
And the person who worked out
how

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.839
this goes was a person at MIT,
Dave Baltimore.

00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:16.867
He was a colleague of
mine here for many years.

00:08:16.867 --> 00:08:19.500
He was the person who founded
the White-

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.866
head Institute and got that up
and going.

00:08:21.866 --> 00:08:23.699
And he then finally,
to move

00:08:23.699 --> 00:08:27.899
up one more administrative
challenge, went to Caltech

00:08:27.899 --> 00:08:29.316
to be president.

00:08:29.316 --> 00:08:31.884
And that's where he is today.

00:08:31.884 --> 00:08:34.274
And
David was working on this

00:08:34.274 --> 00:08:37.248
problem trying to figure out how
these

00:08:37.248 --> 00:08:38.674
retroviruses work.

00:08:38.674 --> 00:08:40.417
And they're important.

00:08:40.417 --> 00:08:43.935
Not only the HIV-1
virus, but there are certain

00:08:43.935 --> 00:08:46.517
viruses that are associated with
cancer.

00:08:46.517 --> 00:08:48.596
In
general, what they do is

00:08:48.596 --> 00:08:51.749
they've picked up what's called
an oncogene

00:08:51.749 --> 00:08:56.582
which is sort of often a
mutated version of one of your

00:08:56.582 --> 00:08:57.799
normal genes.

00:08:57.799 --> 00:09:01.356
And if that virus gets inside
one of

00:09:01.356 --> 00:09:05.702
your cells and brings in this
mutated gene it's sort of kind

00:09:05.702 --> 00:09:07.713
of
the same consequence as

00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:10.784
mutating one of your own genes
along that

00:09:10.784 --> 00:09:12.310
progression of cancer.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:15.499
So it can kind of,
say, bring in a cell that

00:09:15.499 --> 00:09:19.482
screws up the control on when
cells are supposed to replicate

00:09:19.482 --> 00:09:21.612
and stop
dividing and so on.

00:09:21.612 --> 00:09:24.927
So David started to work on
these, and what

00:09:24.927 --> 00:09:28.023
he discovered was that these
viruses encoded,

00:09:28.023 --> 00:09:31.552
they had information
encoding proteins.

00:09:31.552 --> 00:09:35.375
And one of the proteins encoded
in

00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:42.125
their RNA is an enzyme he
characterized which is given the

00:09:42.125 --> 00:09:45.090
name "reverse transcriptase".

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:48.875
And what this can do is take an
RNA

00:09:48.875 --> 00:09:53.961
template and make the
corresponding complimentary DNA

00:09:53.961 --> 00:09:56.035
strand in this
way.

00:09:56.035 --> 00:10:02.500
So that if we took the -- We'll
just take this RNA out of the

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.108
virus.

00:10:03.108 --> 00:10:09.500
What this virus encodes then is
an enzyme that's able to take

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.899
this RNA and make the
corresponding DNA copy.

00:10:13.899 --> 00:10:19.027
So there's the original
RNA that was in the virus.

00:10:19.027 --> 00:10:22.527
There is the RNA that it
started out.

00:10:22.527 --> 00:10:25.380
And so
what is happening,

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:30.500
if you will in that case,
is the information is

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:42.000
flowing in the other direction.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.886
That was a marvelous discovery.

00:10:43.886 --> 00:10:46.200
And it was discovered by
someone who

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.466
wasn't willing just to take
what was in the textbooks but

00:10:49.466 --> 00:10:52.252
was trying to
figure out what could possibly

00:10:52.252 --> 00:10:53.302
be going on here.

00:10:53.302 --> 00:10:55.621
Now, the way these
viruses work then,

00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:58.799
once they've done this it's not
so bad because they've

00:10:58.799 --> 00:11:03.000
got their information now in
the form of DNA.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.751
So this strand of DNA can be
made into a double-stranded DNA

00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:12.885
by just
using the kinds of enzymes that

00:11:12.885 --> 00:11:15.636
we've already talked about.

00:11:15.636 --> 00:11:19.364
A DNA
dependent DNA polymerase will

00:11:19.364 --> 00:11:22.577
be able to copy the other thing.

00:11:22.577 --> 00:11:25.950
And
now you've got a DNA copy of

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:29.908
the information that used to be
in the

00:11:29.908 --> 00:11:30.616
virus.

00:11:30.616 --> 00:11:36.635
But what happens to that is
that you have a piece

00:11:36.635 --> 00:11:38.877
of the host DNA.

00:11:38.877 --> 00:11:44.200
And this viral DNA then inserts
into

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:51.651
it, so you end up with this
situation where you have DNA

00:11:51.651 --> 00:11:59.833
from
the host, and this is the virus

00:11:59.833 --> 00:12:01.000
DNA.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.317
So this is the DNA that encodes
the information needed for the

00:12:07.317 --> 00:12:08.250
virus.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:14.820
And if this was our DNA then it
would be inserted that way.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:18.218
And
there are just a handful of

00:12:18.218 --> 00:12:22.750
health messages I've tried to
drive home in

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:24.036
this thing.

00:12:24.036 --> 00:12:27.895
I mentioned smoking the other
day.

00:12:27.895 --> 00:12:31.435
If you smoke --
If you stop smoking you

00:12:31.435 --> 00:12:33.869
basically, well,
let me try another way.

00:12:33.869 --> 00:12:36.179
The
risk of smoking is about equal

00:12:36.179 --> 00:12:38.614
to the sum of everything else
you can

00:12:38.614 --> 00:12:42.269
possibly do in your life that
will affect your chances of

00:12:42.269 --> 00:12:44.850
getting
cancer, leaving aside what you

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:46.587
inherited from mom and dad.

00:12:46.587 --> 00:12:49.040
The one
single thing to not do if you

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.538
want to avoid cancer,
or to help loved

00:12:51.538 --> 00:12:54.984
ones who smoke avoid cancer,
is just don't smoke,

00:12:54.984 --> 00:12:57.490
or if you
do smoke, stop.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:03.197
You freeze the risk of whatever
increased risk you've got,

00:13:03.197 --> 00:13:07.000
and then just live with that,
but it doesn't

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.521
keep getting worse with time.

00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:13.000
The other one is practice safe
sex, and

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.074
this is why.

00:13:14.074 --> 00:13:16.044
HIV-1 is a retrovirus.

00:13:16.044 --> 00:13:19.000
If you get infected with it,
it

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.090
makes a DNA copy of the RNA,
it makes the other strand of

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:27.618
the DNA,
and it sticks itself in.

00:13:27.618 --> 00:13:33.063
So what you've got is your DNA
here, your DNA there.

00:13:33.063 --> 00:13:36.600
And HIV-1 is a permanent
traveling

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.127
companion for the rest of your
life.

00:13:39.127 --> 00:13:41.799
There's no way of getting that
out

00:13:41.799 --> 00:13:43.296
of there right now.

00:13:43.296 --> 00:13:47.000
All the systems for dealing
with AIDS are just

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.785
managing the infection.

00:13:48.785 --> 00:13:52.200
So when someone is HIV-1
positive, they've

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:57.399
got those viral genes now
permanently integrated

00:13:57.399 --> 00:13:58.739
into their DNA.

00:13:58.739 --> 00:14:02.133
So it's extremely important
that you

00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:05.235
be aware of that,
or if you know people who don't

00:14:05.235 --> 00:14:08.021
appreciate this
because they haven't got so

00:14:08.021 --> 00:14:10.664
much of a biology background
that you help

00:14:10.664 --> 00:14:11.982
them understand that.

00:14:11.982 --> 00:14:12.170
OK.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:14.931
So I just wanted to show you,
I found one

00:14:14.931 --> 00:14:16.412
other picture last night.

00:14:16.412 --> 00:14:19.197
And this is you see all these
old scientists,

00:14:19.197 --> 00:14:19.573
right?

00:14:19.573 --> 00:14:23.464
Of course, David didn't look
like this when he was doing his

00:14:23.464 --> 00:14:23.773
work.

00:14:23.773 --> 00:14:26.494
In fact, I think he's fairly
cleaned up here.

00:14:26.494 --> 00:14:30.051
I found this one
in the Cold Spring Harbor

00:14:30.051 --> 00:14:32.000
archives last night.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.981
I've seen pictures of him
looking considerably more shaggy

00:14:34.981 --> 00:14:36.970
and perhaps
disreputable and stuff.

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.428
But anyway, when David was
making all these

00:14:39.428 --> 00:14:41.827
discoveries he was still quite
a young man.

00:14:41.827 --> 00:14:44.725
I believe he got his
Nobel Prize when he was still

00:14:44.725 --> 00:14:45.599
in his thirties.

00:14:45.599 --> 00:14:48.470
And so many of these
discoveries are made by people

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:50.570
that are not all that much older
than

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:50.788
you.

00:14:50.788 --> 00:14:53.847
But, again, it's trying to
understand why we know what we

00:14:53.847 --> 00:14:56.648
know
and then trying to fit other

00:14:56.648 --> 00:14:58.000
things into it.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.294
Now, the next thing I want to
tell you about that has some of

00:15:04.294 --> 00:15:08.619
this same
character, I've sort of told

00:15:08.619 --> 00:15:12.123
you that you have a piece of
DNA.

00:15:12.123 --> 00:15:15.942
Let's
say there's a gene here and

00:15:15.942 --> 00:15:20.664
this is the coding region,
and then we make

00:15:20.664 --> 00:15:26.225
a mRNA copy,
and then we use the genetic

00:15:26.225 --> 00:15:30.288
code and we
make the protein.

00:15:30.288 --> 00:15:34.544
And so if we sequence the DNA
and

00:15:34.544 --> 00:15:38.574
find the beginning of this
protein we can read along using

00:15:38.574 --> 00:15:41.749
that genetic
code and away it should go.

00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:44.725
And that was beautifully worked
out,

00:15:44.725 --> 00:15:49.198
understood, just like I sort of
finished up telling you the

00:15:49.198 --> 00:15:50.134
other
day.

00:15:50.134 --> 00:15:54.908
So Phil Sharp who got a Nobel
Prize for this work and is a

00:15:54.908 --> 00:16:00.000
colleague in the Biology
Department.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.558
He's in the Cancer Center just
across the street from the

00:16:04.558 --> 00:16:06.050
building
I'm in.

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:09.970
That was the cancer center that
Salvador Luria,

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:12.466
who Jim
Watson trained with,

00:16:12.466 --> 00:16:13.401
had founded.

00:16:13.401 --> 00:16:16.361
And Phil was studying this
process.

00:16:16.361 --> 00:16:19.013
It was before we could sequence
DNA.

00:16:19.013 --> 00:16:20.755
It was in the mid '70s.

00:16:20.755 --> 00:16:24.013
And he was
working with the tools we had

00:16:24.013 --> 00:16:27.270
then trying to map the
relationship of an

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:30.218
RNA to a gene that was on a
virus.

00:16:30.218 --> 00:16:33.166
It was a DNA virus,
not an RNA

00:16:33.166 --> 00:16:37.479
virus, so don't get yourself
mixed up with that.

00:16:37.479 --> 00:16:41.940
But what he had was
basically a fragment of DNA

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.654
that he knew encoded the gene.

00:16:44.654 --> 00:16:48.398
So he knew
somewhere on this piece of DNA

00:16:48.398 --> 00:16:52.164
there was a gene somewhere in
here, and he

00:16:52.164 --> 00:16:54.184
had isolated the mRNA.

00:16:54.184 --> 00:16:58.499
And one way you could map,
physically see the

00:16:58.499 --> 00:17:03.131
relationship of an RNA and a
DNA would be to take,

00:17:03.131 --> 00:17:07.303
let's just take
away one of these strands.

00:17:07.303 --> 00:17:10.817
So we have the complimentary
strand

00:17:10.817 --> 00:17:12.755
of the DNA to the RNA.

00:17:12.755 --> 00:17:16.453
And if we mix them together and
let them

00:17:16.453 --> 00:17:20.569
slowly cool down they will form
hydrogen bonds.

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:24.312
They'll form a
DNA-RNA hybrid just the same

00:17:24.312 --> 00:17:26.773
way two strands of DNA come on.

00:17:26.773 --> 00:17:29.996
And so if
the gene was a little shorter

00:17:29.996 --> 00:17:33.362
than the piece of DNA then you
might have

00:17:33.362 --> 00:17:39.000
expected to see something that
looked like this.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.714
And the way you'd see this,
if you looked in an electron

00:17:43.714 --> 00:17:51.677
microscope --
-- perhaps it would look sort

00:17:51.677 --> 00:17:53.363
of
like this.

00:17:53.363 --> 00:17:57.798
You cannot actually see the two
strands, but you'd see a

00:17:57.798 --> 00:17:58.640
thick part.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.858
That would be the RNA duplex.

00:18:00.858 --> 00:18:03.000
So this would be just DNA.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.571
And the thick part is RNA base
paired with a single strand of

00:18:08.571 --> 00:18:09.221
DNA.

00:18:09.221 --> 00:18:10.228
You got it?

00:18:10.228 --> 00:18:14.528
That's what textbooks said you
should have seen.

00:18:14.528 --> 00:18:16.669
And so
this is more.

00:18:16.669 --> 00:18:21.006
This is data from Phil's paper
describing this.

00:18:21.006 --> 00:18:24.896
And
let me focus on this one in

00:18:24.896 --> 00:18:26.212
particular.

00:18:26.212 --> 00:18:36.000
That's what
he actually saw.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.828
You guys got any idea what's
going on?

00:18:38.828 --> 00:18:43.221
Why don't you take a minute,
find somebody who's near you

00:18:43.221 --> 00:18:46.398
and see if you can come up with
any ideas.

00:18:46.398 --> 00:18:47.775
Here's the hybrid.

00:18:47.775 --> 00:18:51.598
Forget about this little bit at
the 3 prime end.

00:18:51.598 --> 00:18:53.167
That's not a worry.

00:18:53.167 --> 00:18:54.652
Here is the thing.

00:18:54.652 --> 00:18:56.798
And this, I think,
is a

00:18:56.798 --> 00:19:02.000
piece of single stranded DNA
sticking out the end.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.602
But it looks a bit more
complicated.

00:19:05.602 --> 00:19:06.632
Any ideas?

00:19:06.632 --> 00:19:11.298
Most people put this
data in their drawers.

00:19:11.298 --> 00:19:12.552
Phil didn't.

00:19:12.552 --> 00:19:16.000
Phil and his colleagues didn't.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.303
What they realized was,
I'm going to try and redraw

00:19:21.303 --> 00:19:28.292
this just very
slightly to help you see what's

00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:30.000
going on.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.267
What they were seeing was
something that looked rather

00:19:34.267 --> 00:19:36.843
like what they
were expecting.

00:19:36.843 --> 00:19:41.271
They were seeing a region of
hybrid DNA and they were

00:19:41.271 --> 00:19:45.192
seeing a region of
single-stranded DNA like this,

00:19:45.192 --> 00:19:49.001
but what it looked
like was there were little

00:19:49.001 --> 00:19:52.544
loops of single-stranded DNA
sticking out.

00:19:52.544 --> 00:19:58.181
And what Phil had discovered
was a phenomenon we now know

00:19:58.181 --> 00:20:06.000
as RNA splicing.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.557
And here's what goes on.

00:20:07.557 --> 00:20:10.153
In bacteria,
with very few exceptions,

00:20:10.153 --> 00:20:13.343
you can look at the DNA,
you can find the open reading

00:20:13.343 --> 00:20:16.087
frame and you
can just read off the sequence

00:20:16.087 --> 00:20:16.977
of the protein.

00:20:16.977 --> 00:20:18.461
You find the ATG,
AUG,

00:20:18.461 --> 00:20:20.907
methionine codon,
and then it keeps going no

00:20:20.907 --> 00:20:24.367
stops, and finally you come
to a stop codon and you see

00:20:24.367 --> 00:20:25.730
there is the protein.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:28.846
So the coding
information is essentially

00:20:28.846 --> 00:20:32.289
continuous in almost all
bacterial genes.

00:20:32.289 --> 00:20:35.363
And there's a few,
some genes like

00:20:35.363 --> 00:20:38.963
that in eukaryotes,
but many eukaryotic genes are

00:20:38.963 --> 00:20:42.086
constructed,
it's almost as if you took the

00:20:42.086 --> 00:20:44.816
gene you'd find in a bacterium
and then

00:20:44.816 --> 00:20:48.584
you'd cut it in a bunch of
places and stuck extra DNA in

00:20:48.584 --> 00:20:50.594
between all
of the pieces.

00:20:50.594 --> 00:20:54.270
So you'd get something like
this where there's,

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:59.000
in the DNA there'd be coding
information.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:05.832
And then non-coding information
and another block of coding

00:21:05.832 --> 00:21:07.598
information.

00:21:07.598 --> 00:21:16.199
And then a block of non-coding
and say another one of coding

00:21:16.199 --> 00:21:18.041
information.

00:21:18.041 --> 00:21:22.956
So this is a double-stranded
DNA.

00:21:22.956 --> 00:21:27.862
And what
happens then when the cell

00:21:27.862 --> 00:21:33.398
makes RNA is the whole thing
gets copied into

00:21:33.398 --> 00:21:42.000
what's known now as a
pre-messenger RNA.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.171
And so there's a bit of coding
stuff here, there's a bit of

00:21:46.171 --> 00:21:49.275
coding stuff
here, and there's some more

00:21:49.275 --> 00:21:50.700
coding stuff there.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:54.955
But what the cell has
is sort of like your unedited

00:21:54.955 --> 00:22:01.031
footage from your family summer
vacation when you were running

00:22:01.031 --> 00:22:03.000
the video camera.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.921
And maybe you don't want to
show everybody ever second of

00:22:06.921 --> 00:22:09.679
video that
you took during the thing.

00:22:09.679 --> 00:22:12.663
So what you do,
you get in there and you

00:22:12.663 --> 00:22:13.216
edit it.

00:22:13.216 --> 00:22:17.497
In the old days you used to
have to take the film and splice

00:22:17.497 --> 00:22:17.704
it.

00:22:17.704 --> 00:22:21.847
And now you can all do it with
iMovie or something like that.

00:22:21.847 --> 00:22:24.463
But
what you do is take the pieces

00:22:24.463 --> 00:22:27.164
of information you want,
and this is

00:22:27.164 --> 00:22:29.224
what the cell is doing.

00:22:29.224 --> 00:22:32.000
It takes this part of the RNA.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:39.037
And this part of the RNA,
and joins it together,

00:22:39.037 --> 00:22:42.332
and then this part.

00:22:42.332 --> 00:22:50.512
And when it's done it has the
mRNA that now looks like the

00:22:50.512 --> 00:22:56.208
kind of mRNA
that you would find in a

00:22:56.208 --> 00:23:03.000
bacterium where you can find the
start codon.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:10.000
And then you could read in
three-letter words all the way

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.299
through to the end of the
protein.

00:23:13.299 --> 00:23:17.000
So, in essence,
what Phil found was

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.257
that in many organisms at least
there's another step in here

00:23:23.257 --> 00:23:26.121
where
we get RNA splicing.

00:23:26.121 --> 00:23:31.000
And only after that you get
down to proteins.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.455
What was quite remarkable about
this result and why I'm kind of

00:23:34.455 --> 00:23:36.909
hammering
on it a little bit is this is

00:23:36.909 --> 00:23:39.248
the data that's out of Phil's
paper.

00:23:39.248 --> 00:23:41.222
You can look it up on the
Internet.

00:23:41.222 --> 00:23:43.372
Type in Phil Sharp 1977 and
you'll

00:23:43.372 --> 00:23:46.353
find this original paper with
that figure in it.

00:23:46.353 --> 00:23:49.405
The moment Phil
realized what it was and talked

00:23:49.405 --> 00:23:51.622
about it at a meeting,
a whole lot

00:23:51.622 --> 00:23:55.360
of people suddenly sort of
almost simultaneously discovered

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.445
RNA
splicing because they opened

00:23:57.445 --> 00:23:59.873
their drawers and there were all
these

00:23:59.873 --> 00:24:04.000
uninterpretable electron
micrographs they had.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.665
And they were in very short
order able to save it in the

00:24:07.665 --> 00:24:08.132
system.

00:24:08.132 --> 00:24:10.153
The
same thing was going on,

00:24:10.153 --> 00:24:12.745
but it was just confusing,
it didn't fit,

00:24:12.745 --> 00:24:15.121
and
to some extent most people's

00:24:15.121 --> 00:24:17.798
minds were set by this paradigm,
this

00:24:17.798 --> 00:24:21.741
central dogma as something that
a true believer cannot doubt.

00:24:21.741 --> 00:24:24.699
And you
had to have a flexible enough

00:24:24.699 --> 00:24:27.000
mind to be able to see that.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.409
And so this is an important
piece of biology that hadn't

00:24:32.409 --> 00:24:34.074
been
anticipated.

00:24:34.074 --> 00:24:36.850
And it can be quite remarkable.

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:41.090
I'm just going to give
you a couple of extreme

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:41.909
examples.

00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:45.000
Well, not even extreme
examples.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.523
But just show you how much
non-coding information there can

00:24:50.523 --> 00:24:51.000
be.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.181
Factor 8 is a protein that
plays a part in blood clotting.

00:24:56.181 --> 00:25:00.193
And the
gene is 200 kilobase pairs.

00:25:00.193 --> 00:25:04.333
And the pre-mRNA is just a
direct

00:25:04.333 --> 00:25:07.849
copy, so it's 200 kilobases.

00:25:07.849 --> 00:25:12.999
It's just a single strand so
it's not a

00:25:12.999 --> 00:25:14.186
base pair.

00:25:14.186 --> 00:25:21.664
And the actually spliced mRNA
when it's done is 10 kilobases.

00:25:21.664 --> 00:25:29.075
So that means that only 5% of
the gene is coding information

00:25:29.075 --> 00:25:34.597
and 95%
of that information gets thrown

00:25:34.597 --> 00:25:39.000
away when the RNA gets spliced.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.511
And even a more extreme example
is a protein called dystrophin.

00:25:44.511 --> 00:25:48.127
This is
what's affected in a human

00:25:48.127 --> 00:25:51.800
genetic disease known as
Duchenne

00:25:51.800 --> 00:26:01.000
Muscular Dystrophy.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.207
In this case,
the gene is two mega- base

00:26:07.207 --> 00:26:08.162
pairs.

00:26:08.162 --> 00:26:16.917
So of course then the
pre-mRNA is also two megabases

00:26:16.917 --> 00:26:22.010
but the pre-RNA is 16 kilobases.

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:28.855
So in
this case less than 1% of the

00:26:28.855 --> 00:26:37.710
gene has coding information
for making a protein.

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:44.995
There are a lot of interesting
reasons as to why it would be

00:26:44.995 --> 00:26:45.781
like this.

00:26:45.781 --> 00:26:50.403
One this, things can evolve
more rapidly sometimes because

00:26:50.403 --> 00:26:53.569
you have parts of proteins that
are sort

00:26:53.569 --> 00:26:59.000
of like modules and evolution
can probably connect them.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.711
In fact, it also provides ways
of regulating because we now

00:27:02.711 --> 00:27:05.127
know there
are alternative ways of

00:27:05.127 --> 00:27:06.022
splicing RNA.

00:27:06.022 --> 00:27:10.036
So you can take one RNA and
then splice it in different

00:27:10.036 --> 00:27:12.634
ways in different cells and end
up

00:27:12.634 --> 00:27:16.335
generating different proteins
that were all encoded by one

00:27:16.335 --> 00:27:17.571
particular
gene.

00:27:17.571 --> 00:27:21.726
And so it gives cells different
kinds of regulatory

00:27:21.726 --> 00:27:23.681
strategies they can use.

00:27:23.681 --> 00:27:26.532
Now, the third sort of thing
that

00:27:26.532 --> 00:27:30.513
came out that falls in this
same kind of thing of people

00:27:30.513 --> 00:27:33.908
having their
minds open and not fixed by the

00:27:33.908 --> 00:27:36.664
current understanding or bounded
by

00:27:36.664 --> 00:27:41.116
the current understanding is
the discovery that RNA can act

00:27:41.116 --> 00:27:42.230
as an
enzyme.

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:46.797
And I've already talked to you
about that and I've told it was

00:27:46.797 --> 00:27:50.311
ribozyme, but it was discovered
by Tom Cech.

00:27:50.311 --> 00:27:54.203
Tom is currently
president of the Howard Hughes

00:27:54.203 --> 00:27:56.932
Medical Institute,
but he did his

00:27:56.932 --> 00:28:02.000
post-doctoral work at MIT with
Mary Lou Pardue.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.142
I'd been a post-doc at Berkeley
when he was just finishing his

00:28:06.142 --> 00:28:08.491
graduate work,
and I met him out there.

00:28:08.491 --> 00:28:11.258
And then he came to MIT to
do his post-doc.

00:28:11.258 --> 00:28:14.425
And a year later I got a job so
I'd become friends

00:28:14.425 --> 00:28:17.293
there and became friends when
we started here.

00:28:17.293 --> 00:28:20.284
So I had a pretty
close link to this particular

00:28:20.284 --> 00:28:20.639
story.

00:28:20.639 --> 00:28:22.711
Here's a picture of Tom
together

00:28:22.711 --> 00:28:23.286
with Phil.

00:28:23.286 --> 00:28:26.855
That's actually my wife right
there who was in this picture.

00:28:26.855 --> 00:28:31.000
But Tom actually looks much
more like that.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.643
He's very colorful,
very fun, a very interesting

00:28:36.643 --> 00:28:37.483
person.

00:28:37.483 --> 00:28:42.349
But anyway,
when Tom left MIT to take a

00:28:42.349 --> 00:28:47.569
faculty position at Bolder he
was interested

00:28:47.569 --> 00:28:55.855
in trying to understand the
biochemistry of RNA splicing.

00:28:55.855 --> 00:29:01.763
And so he went -- He did what a
good scientist will

00:29:01.763 --> 00:29:01.946
do.

00:29:01.946 --> 00:29:05.291
They'll try and find an
experimental system where the

00:29:05.291 --> 00:29:08.041
question they want to address
is simple enough you can

00:29:08.041 --> 00:29:09.346
actually get
an answer.

00:29:09.346 --> 00:29:12.349
There's a kind of way of doing
science where you pick a

00:29:12.349 --> 00:29:15.360
system that's too complicated
and you never actually get an

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:15.880
answer.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.423
It sounds very important
because you're working on

00:29:18.423 --> 00:29:20.670
something that's
important but you cannot,

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:22.940
you don't have the tools you
need to get to

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:23.494
the answer.

00:29:23.494 --> 00:29:26.469
So Tom wanted to work on the
biochemistry of RNA splicing

00:29:26.469 --> 00:29:30.000
because that had just been
discovered.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.374
And so he went to a small
little tiny organism called

00:29:34.374 --> 00:29:35.635
tetrahymena.

00:29:35.635 --> 00:29:39.706
And the reason he looked at
that was because it had a

00:29:39.706 --> 00:29:41.271
ribosomal RNA,
so

00:29:41.271 --> 00:29:45.655
it was an RNA that was made in
great abundance within the

00:29:45.655 --> 00:29:46.360
organism.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:48.868
And
it only had one of these

00:29:48.868 --> 00:29:50.420
non-coding regions.

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:54.201
I'll tell you the words
for these coding and

00:29:54.201 --> 00:29:55.113
non-coding.

00:29:55.113 --> 00:29:58.181
To me they're non-intuitive,
but I

00:29:58.181 --> 00:30:01.863
guess you should know them.

00:30:01.863 --> 00:30:06.500
The coding region is called,
the

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:15.640
part that codes is called an
exon and the non-coding part is

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.615
called an
intron.

00:30:18.615 --> 00:30:28.500
So, anyway, Tom worked on this
organism because the pre-mRNA

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:31.808
was basically this.

00:30:31.808 --> 00:30:38.250
Or the pre-mRNA before the
splicing

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:40.314
looked like this.

00:30:40.314 --> 00:30:44.807
This was going to give this
like that.

00:30:44.807 --> 00:30:50.173
He could get
large quantities of this RNA,

00:30:50.173 --> 00:30:55.250
so he was all set to make
extracts of the

00:30:55.250 --> 00:31:02.250
cells of this organism and then
start cooking up this RNA

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:05.317
substrate
with all sorts of cell

00:31:05.317 --> 00:31:05.958
extracts.

00:31:05.958 --> 00:31:08.665
And then his plan was to purify
the

00:31:08.665 --> 00:31:10.651
enzymes that did the RNA
splicing.

00:31:10.651 --> 00:31:12.998
And so I first heard about
this, Tom

00:31:12.998 --> 00:31:15.906
was working on this when he was
here.

00:31:15.906 --> 00:31:18.330
And he went off to,
I guess

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:22.012
it was Denmark to learn how to
grow this organism.

00:31:22.012 --> 00:31:25.685
Then they were back
and he was off at Bolder.

00:31:25.685 --> 00:31:29.000
And we used to play squash all
the time.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.507
And whenever I got out to
Bolder we'd try and get in a

00:31:32.507 --> 00:31:33.500
squash game.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:37.250
So I was out there at a meeting
and we were sitting around in

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:38.375
the locker
room.

00:31:38.375 --> 00:31:42.500
And I said so how's the
splicing biochemistry project

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:42.928
going?

00:31:42.928 --> 00:31:45.000
Tom says, well,
it's going OK,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:45.571
I guess.

00:31:45.571 --> 00:31:47.937
There's only one
little problem,

00:31:47.937 --> 00:31:48.437
he says.

00:31:48.437 --> 00:31:50.062
The controls are splicing.

00:31:50.062 --> 00:31:52.771
Now, what he
meant was if you were trying to

00:31:52.771 --> 00:31:55.000
add cell extract and get this
thing to

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.062
go what you would start out
with is the RNA in a tube

00:31:59.062 --> 00:32:00.000
basically.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.844
And that would be your control.

00:32:01.844 --> 00:32:04.284
And then you'd start adding
stuff to it

00:32:04.284 --> 00:32:06.103
and start looking for splicing.

00:32:06.103 --> 00:32:08.568
And what Tom was finding was
that if you

00:32:08.568 --> 00:32:12.151
just took this RNA and let it
sit in a test tube that the

00:32:12.151 --> 00:32:14.924
splicing
happened without him putting

00:32:14.924 --> 00:32:15.810
anything in.

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:18.529
And here he was
already to find all the

00:32:18.529 --> 00:32:20.521
enzymes, the proteins that did
it.

00:32:20.521 --> 00:32:23.535
And Tom did
an absolutely gorgeous piece of

00:32:23.535 --> 00:32:27.697
science to prove that what was
happening was the RNA was

00:32:27.697 --> 00:32:30.000
catalyzing its own splicing.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.168
And he had to work very,
very hard to prove that it

00:32:33.168 --> 00:32:35.135
wasn't a
contaminating protein.

00:32:35.135 --> 00:32:37.385
Remember we had this sort of
discussion?

00:32:37.385 --> 00:32:39.483
We
were talking about is DNA the

00:32:39.483 --> 00:32:41.597
genetic material and how would
we

00:32:41.597 --> 00:32:44.668
know that it wasn't just a
little tiny bit of something

00:32:44.668 --> 00:32:47.195
else in our
DNA perhaps that was doing it.

00:32:47.195 --> 00:32:49.329
Tom had to go through pretty
much a

00:32:49.329 --> 00:32:51.871
similar exercise,
but this was one of these key

00:32:51.871 --> 00:32:54.718
insights that lead to
the proof that RNA could

00:32:54.718 --> 00:32:57.065
function as a catalyst,
what we now

00:32:57.065 --> 00:32:58.884
know as a ribozyme.

00:32:58.884 --> 00:33:02.333
And I've shown you now we now
sort

00:33:02.333 --> 00:33:07.549
of accept that the actual
ribosome itself is a ribozyme

00:33:07.549 --> 00:33:12.075
and that the
formation of the peptide bond,

00:33:12.075 --> 00:33:15.664
the thing that's the heart of
all

00:33:15.664 --> 00:33:21.312
proteins is made by a ribozyme,
not catalyzed by ribosomes and

00:33:21.312 --> 00:33:23.126
not by a
protein.

00:33:23.126 --> 00:33:23.425
OK.

00:33:23.425 --> 00:33:28.997
So the next topic that I want
to try on which sort of

00:33:28.997 --> 00:33:34.781
we've already set up from this
is that if the information is

00:33:34.781 --> 00:33:38.507
all in
DNA to begin with then if you

00:33:38.507 --> 00:33:42.332
make an RNA copy you're only
taking a

00:33:42.332 --> 00:33:49.000
segment of that information at
a time.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.690
And that gives the cells a lot
of possibilities for regulating

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:58.141
how
they respond to the environment

00:33:58.141 --> 00:34:01.500
or just controlling what genes
are

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:02.419
expressed.

00:34:02.419 --> 00:34:07.750
And there are basically two
kinds of strategies that are

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:11.643
involved in these regulatory
decisions.

00:34:11.643 --> 00:34:24.909
They can either be --
Can either be reversible

00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:29.000
changes.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.799
For example,
a bacterium and a food source.

00:34:31.799 --> 00:34:35.732
If you're a bacterium and
you've got enzymes that let you

00:34:35.732 --> 00:34:38.331
eat a hundred different kinds of
food

00:34:38.331 --> 00:34:42.371
and you're in an environment
where there's only one of them

00:34:42.371 --> 00:34:45.006
there,
you're really wasting energy if

00:34:45.006 --> 00:34:47.664
you make the proteins to make
the other

00:34:47.664 --> 00:34:47.861
99.

00:34:47.861 --> 00:34:51.607
So you might guess that somehow
evolution has selected for

00:34:51.607 --> 00:34:54.291
systems
that have learned how to turn

00:34:54.291 --> 00:34:56.996
on and off the things they need
to eat

00:34:56.996 --> 00:35:01.664
certain food sources depending
on whether the food source

00:35:01.664 --> 00:35:02.911
is available.

00:35:02.911 --> 00:35:06.491
We only carry umbrellas when it
rains.

00:35:06.491 --> 00:35:10.230
If you had to carry an umbrella
and a snowsuit and a

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:13.643
surfboard, everything all the
time, it would slow you down in

00:35:13.643 --> 00:35:14.382
evolution.

00:35:14.382 --> 00:35:17.172
So the other type,
which we've talked about as

00:35:17.172 --> 00:35:20.350
well when we talked
about starting as a single cell

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:22.690
and going to the 10^14 cells
that make

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:26.449
us up, then many of those
changes, as those cells go along

00:35:26.449 --> 00:35:29.111
and
progressively more specialized

00:35:29.111 --> 00:35:31.000
need to be irreversible.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.083
And this is particularly
important

00:35:37.083 --> 00:35:37.988
in development.

00:35:37.988 --> 00:35:41.248
We don't want a cell in our
retina suddenly deciding

00:35:41.248 --> 00:35:44.871
it should be part of a heart
and start to make a heart in the

00:35:44.871 --> 00:35:47.092
middle
of your eye or something like

00:35:47.092 --> 00:35:47.382
that.

00:35:47.382 --> 00:35:49.581
So things in development tend
to be

00:35:49.581 --> 00:35:52.962
once you're off you're off or
once you're on you're on or

00:35:52.962 --> 00:35:53.748
something.

00:35:53.748 --> 00:35:57.220
And just to give you another
little look at that picture I've

00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:59.561
shown you
before of the nematode.

00:35:59.561 --> 00:36:02.065
And at the time,
the first time I

00:36:02.065 --> 00:36:04.743
showed you this,
I was just trying to emphasize

00:36:04.743 --> 00:36:08.109
that we could take the
gene encoding green fluorescent

00:36:08.109 --> 00:36:10.329
protein and put it in anything
and

00:36:10.329 --> 00:36:11.392
it would go green.

00:36:11.392 --> 00:36:13.518
In this case,
Barbara Meyer who is at

00:36:13.518 --> 00:36:16.128
Berkeley now
but used to be my office-mate

00:36:16.128 --> 00:36:18.597
at MIT for many years,
what she's done is

00:36:18.597 --> 00:36:21.188
she's taken that green
fluorescent protein,

00:36:21.188 --> 00:36:22.731
the gene for that,
and

00:36:22.731 --> 00:36:25.861
she's put it under the control
of a regulatory system,

00:36:25.861 --> 00:36:29.097
a gene that is
made to be expressed in the

00:36:29.097 --> 00:36:31.000
esophagus of the worm.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.831
And so even though that gene is
present in all the cells of that

00:36:35.831 --> 00:36:39.697
organism, it's under the
control of a system that usually

00:36:39.697 --> 00:36:42.366
permits the
genes to be made that are

00:36:42.366 --> 00:36:45.498
needed for making esophagus but
not in other

00:36:45.498 --> 00:36:46.777
parts of the body.

00:36:46.777 --> 00:36:50.331
So you probably didn't pick
that part up now but

00:36:50.331 --> 00:36:54.244
sort of take another look at
that same thing and see

00:36:54.244 --> 00:36:56.094
something
different.

00:36:56.094 --> 00:37:00.000
So how do we learn about gene
regulation?

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.250
The key work,
like so many of these things,

00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:09.107
started kind of
inauspiciously,

00:37:09.107 --> 00:37:10.392
if you will.

00:37:10.392 --> 00:37:15.000
There were two French
scientists, Jacques

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.543
Monod, who is a biochemist,
Francois Jacob who was a

00:37:20.543 --> 00:37:21.739
geneticist.

00:37:21.739 --> 00:37:25.603
And
they were working on the

00:37:25.603 --> 00:37:30.000
metabolism of lactose by E.
coli.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.030
Lactose is galactose,
beta 1,4 glucose.

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:39.406
And you don't have to know
exactly the structure.

00:37:39.406 --> 00:37:44.000
You can just remember there
were a lot of

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.768
different hydroxyls,
and that was one particular

00:37:48.768 --> 00:37:49.579
linkage.

00:37:49.579 --> 00:37:53.779
And there's
an enzyme that cleaves this

00:37:53.779 --> 00:37:56.558
into galactose and glucose.

00:37:56.558 --> 00:38:01.379
And this can
go right into glycolysis and

00:38:01.379 --> 00:38:05.000
make energy for the organism.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.502
And the galactose undergoes a
couple of different

00:38:08.502 --> 00:38:10.398
transformations,
and it

00:38:10.398 --> 00:38:12.327
can get in there as well.

00:38:12.327 --> 00:38:15.798
But in order to get at the
energy that's in

00:38:15.798 --> 00:38:19.656
those carbohydrates,
this linkage has to be broken.

00:38:19.656 --> 00:38:23.292
And it was broken
by an enzyme called

00:38:23.292 --> 00:38:25.386
beta-galactosidase.

00:38:25.386 --> 00:38:29.174
That's a
protein that's able to catalyze

00:38:29.174 --> 00:38:32.000
the cleavage of those two
sugars.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:39.250
That's what Jacques Monod and
Francois Jacob were studying.

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:42.666
They
were helped out in this

00:38:42.666 --> 00:38:43.710
exercise.

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:48.000
I guess part of the reason they
got

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.535
going on this was people had
noticed for many years that if

00:38:54.535 --> 00:39:01.894
you grew E.
coli in glucose there was no

00:39:01.894 --> 00:39:04.000
beta-gal.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:12.570
I'm going to abbreviate this as
beta-gal just so I won't have to

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:16.262
keep writing the same thing.

00:39:16.262 --> 00:39:21.141
But if they grew E.
coli in lactose

00:39:21.141 --> 00:39:23.641
beta-gal was present.

00:39:23.641 --> 00:39:29.713
And they had to be able to
assay for this enzyme.

00:39:29.713 --> 00:39:43.271
And they used --
There were standard types of

00:39:43.271 --> 00:39:46.110
biochemical assays you could
use.

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:50.344
But some chemists that helped
design a very cleaver kind of

00:39:50.344 --> 00:39:52.410
substrate
that helped them,

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:55.490
that could be used in these
kinds of studies,

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:57.933
and I'll
show you one of them.

00:39:57.933 --> 00:40:01.443
What this enzyme really looks
at is it looks

00:40:01.443 --> 00:40:03.502
at, let's see,
galactose.

00:40:03.502 --> 00:40:07.840
What it sees is sort of the
galactose side of this linkage,

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.230
and then it reaches in and
catalyzes the

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:12.095
cleavage of what's joined to
it.

00:40:12.095 --> 00:40:14.382
And it turns out not to be
specific

00:40:14.382 --> 00:40:16.690
for whether glucose is on the
other side.

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:20.125
It can accept substrates that
have other things as well.

00:40:20.125 --> 00:40:22.690
So some chemists made some
variants like

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:23.015
this.

00:40:23.015 --> 00:40:26.195
This is a compound that's
commonly known as X-gal.

00:40:26.195 --> 00:40:28.958
If you
talk about it in the lab it's

00:40:28.958 --> 00:40:31.000
got a longer chemical name.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.905
But what happens if
beta-galactosidase is there,

00:40:35.905 --> 00:40:38.906
it's
able to cleave this substrate

00:40:38.906 --> 00:40:42.271
so you get galactose,
which is colorless.

00:40:42.271 --> 00:40:45.516
But if you get just X,
this is colored,

00:40:45.516 --> 00:40:50.081
but up here this original
material is also colorless.

00:40:50.081 --> 00:40:53.543
So this is very convenient
because if you

00:40:53.543 --> 00:40:58.118
use a substrate such as this
you could put the cells on a

00:40:58.118 --> 00:41:00.676
plate with
this indicator.

00:41:00.676 --> 00:41:04.065
And if they are colored,
and the

00:41:04.065 --> 00:41:06.486
color is blue,
you'd know they were making

00:41:06.486 --> 00:41:07.607
beta-galactosidase.

00:41:07.607 --> 00:41:09.534
And if
you don't see a color,

00:41:09.534 --> 00:41:10.810
you know they're not.

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:13.849
There are a variety of
ways of assaying for this

00:41:13.849 --> 00:41:14.274
enzyme.

00:41:14.274 --> 00:41:16.463
With that I'm just trying to
give

00:41:16.463 --> 00:41:19.850
you a little bit of flavor of
one of the different ways that

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:21.436
they could
assay for it.

00:41:21.436 --> 00:41:24.731
Now, one of the issues was it
looked as though E.

00:41:24.731 --> 00:41:28.864
coli didn't have any
beta-galactosidase activity if

00:41:28.864 --> 00:41:33.000
lactose was absent when growing
in glucose.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.447
And they made it if lactose was
present.

00:41:35.447 --> 00:41:38.582
Well, that would be kind
of what you would expect

00:41:38.582 --> 00:41:41.284
evolution would have figured out
how to do,

00:41:41.284 --> 00:41:44.746
only make the enzyme for
metabolizing lactose if the

00:41:44.746 --> 00:41:46.979
lactose
is present, but they had to

00:41:46.979 --> 00:41:49.568
figure out what the molecular
basis of this

00:41:49.568 --> 00:41:49.808
was.

00:41:49.808 --> 00:41:53.231
And one of the possibilities
was that the protein was made

00:41:53.231 --> 00:41:55.418
that
it was all sort of unfolded,

00:41:55.418 --> 00:41:57.856
and when the substrate came in
then it

00:41:57.856 --> 00:42:02.000
folded all around it and then
it could cleave it.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.085
Or another possibility,
which would be the kind we're

00:42:05.085 --> 00:42:07.964
talking about now,
is the protein is not made

00:42:07.964 --> 00:42:10.664
until the lactose is present,
and then it

00:42:10.664 --> 00:42:11.480
makes it new.

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:14.244
So they had to figure out,
between these two,

00:42:14.244 --> 00:42:16.264
which of
these two was true.

00:42:16.264 --> 00:42:19.331
When you see the lactose
present, is it just

00:42:19.331 --> 00:42:22.597
beta-galactosidase is already
made but it's inactive,

00:42:22.597 --> 00:42:26.973
or is it being
made de novo when you add the

00:42:26.973 --> 00:42:28.000
lactose?

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:34.669
So what they did was they grew
cells in glucose plus

00:42:34.669 --> 00:42:41.166
radioactive
C14-leucine for a long time.

00:42:41.166 --> 00:42:50.571
So all the proteins --
-- were radioactive.

00:42:50.571 --> 00:42:56.439
And once they
got, that's going for a long

00:42:56.439 --> 00:42:56.741
time.

00:42:56.741 --> 00:43:00.333
So every protein being
made is radioactive.

00:43:00.333 --> 00:43:04.554
Then they add excess unlabeled
leucine.

00:43:04.554 --> 00:43:10.998
So this means that from now on
any new proteins that are

00:43:10.998 --> 00:43:16.701
made will not be radioactive
because you're just going to

00:43:16.701 --> 00:43:21.350
swamp out any
radioactive stuff with this.

00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:25.665
And they added glucose,
excuse me, now

00:43:25.665 --> 00:43:33.000
they added lactose to the cells.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.149
And then they isolated the
beta-gal enzyme.

00:43:36.149 --> 00:43:38.861
It was actually pretty easy
to do.

00:43:38.861 --> 00:43:41.793
It's a huge enzyme and it's a
tetramer.

00:43:41.793 --> 00:43:42.873
So very large.

00:43:42.873 --> 00:43:46.101
Even in
those days it was fairly easy

00:43:46.101 --> 00:43:47.928
to isolate this enzyme.

00:43:47.928 --> 00:43:50.664
And then they
looked to see is it

00:43:50.664 --> 00:43:51.590
radioactive?

00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:54.599
If it's radioactive it was
there all

00:43:54.599 --> 00:44:00.000
along and it's refolded to
become the active enzyme.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.571
Or if it had been only after
lactose then it would be made de

00:44:05.571 --> 00:44:07.933
novo in
response to it.

00:44:07.933 --> 00:44:13.000
And what they found was that it
was non-radioactive.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:25.500
Which implied that it was made
after

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:29.379
you added the lactose.

00:44:29.379 --> 00:44:35.375
So they knew then that they
were

00:44:35.375 --> 00:44:40.984
studying a system in which a
protein was only made after the

00:44:40.984 --> 00:44:45.394
cells had
experienced a particular growth

00:44:45.394 --> 00:44:46.449
substrate.

00:44:46.449 --> 00:44:52.045
And so a lot of work
went into figuring out how this

00:44:52.045 --> 00:44:53.477
system worked.

00:44:53.477 --> 00:44:54.500
Let's see.

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:57.782
We're a
little short on time.

00:44:57.782 --> 00:45:00.863
So I'll tell you what I'll do.

00:45:00.863 --> 00:45:03.520
I'll
tell you, I'll just put out

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:06.748
quickly the mechanics of what
they saw, and

00:45:06.748 --> 00:45:10.336
we'll start in on the
regulation on how this works.

00:45:10.336 --> 00:45:13.901
And some of you may
be able to figure it out.

00:45:13.901 --> 00:45:17.081
What we now know is that the
gene that

00:45:17.081 --> 00:45:21.521
encodes beta-galactosidase is
in a stretch of DNA that's

00:45:21.521 --> 00:45:23.173
pretty
interesting.

00:45:23.173 --> 00:45:24.792
It's got three genes.

00:45:24.792 --> 00:45:26.258
It's the gene lacZ.

00:45:26.258 --> 00:45:30.517
This is the
gene for beta-galactosidase.

00:45:30.517 --> 00:45:34.284
And another gene called lacY
and

00:45:34.284 --> 00:45:34.924
lacA.

00:45:34.924 --> 00:45:37.355
There's a promoter.

00:45:37.355 --> 00:45:42.856
That's a start signal for
transcription.

00:45:42.856 --> 00:45:44.924
Remember that?

00:45:44.924 --> 00:45:51.427
So there's a sequence here that
says start

00:45:51.427 --> 00:45:54.354
transcription.

00:45:54.354 --> 00:46:00.000
Down here is a terminator.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:05.208
Another word written in the
nucleic acid alphabet that means

00:46:05.208 --> 00:46:06.955
stop making
mRNA.

00:46:06.955 --> 00:46:11.251
And there is one long mRNA,
as you can see,

00:46:11.251 --> 00:46:15.902
that has the
peculiarity of encoding three

00:46:15.902 --> 00:46:17.565
different genes.

00:46:17.565 --> 00:46:23.123
So if you have
more than one gene in a single

00:46:23.123 --> 00:46:40.000
message then that's
called an operon.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.028
You've got one mRNA.

00:46:42.028 --> 00:46:47.000
But, in any case,
so whenever beta-galactosidase

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:52.055
was being made then RNA has to
start being made here,

00:46:52.055 --> 00:46:53.416
goes to there.

00:46:53.416 --> 00:46:56.800
And
we won't worry about the

00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:01.000
functions of these other two
genes.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.754
But, as you might guess from
the way evolution has selected

00:47:04.754 --> 00:47:07.979
for it, they
have related activities to what

00:47:07.979 --> 00:47:09.724
beta-galactosidase does.

00:47:09.724 --> 00:47:12.421
And for
bacteria it's a very efficient

00:47:12.421 --> 00:47:15.179
way to control the expression of
a bunch

00:47:15.179 --> 00:47:16.360
of genes at once.

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:19.907
Then there was another gene up
here known as lacI

00:47:19.907 --> 00:47:24.635
that had a promoter and a
terminator, and it made

00:47:24.635 --> 00:47:26.631
an mRNA as well.

00:47:26.631 --> 00:47:33.250
And that mRNA encoded a protein
that's known as the lac

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:34.336
repressor.

00:47:34.336 --> 00:47:38.250
And what that lac repressor
does,

00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:44.059
it's a protein that has the
ability to recognize a very,

00:47:44.059 --> 00:47:48.884
very specific
DNA sequence and bind there.

00:47:48.884 --> 00:47:53.250
And I'm just going to kind of
blow up

00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:56.423
this part of the thing.

00:47:56.423 --> 00:48:01.666
So what we have here is the,
this is

00:48:01.666 --> 00:48:04.375
the promoter here.

00:48:04.375 --> 00:48:11.000
And it happens that the binding
sequence --

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:22.000
-- for lac repressor overlaps
with

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.421
the promoter.

00:48:25.421 --> 00:48:28.842
Weird, right?

00:48:28.842 --> 00:48:32.000
Maybe not.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.570
So I'll tell you,
well, you can think about this

00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:39.097
over the weekend,
if you haven't run into this

00:48:39.097 --> 00:48:40.100
system before.

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:42.884
So this gene gets made all
the time.

00:48:42.884 --> 00:48:45.860
So this protein gets made all
the time.

00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:49.277
What does that
protein do if it's just like

00:48:49.277 --> 00:48:49.636
this?

00:48:49.636 --> 00:48:52.360
Its job in life is to look for
this

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:54.624
sequence and bind to it.

00:48:54.624 --> 00:48:57.452
If it binds to it,
it covers

00:48:57.452 --> 00:48:59.031
up the promoter.

00:48:59.031 --> 00:49:02.583
And the beta-galactosidase gene
is

00:49:02.583 --> 00:49:06.261
not expressed because the cell
cannot make mRNA.

00:49:06.261 --> 00:49:09.100
So this may seem
a little obscure,

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:12.358
but there's something very
important here.

00:49:12.358 --> 00:49:15.293
Now
the conditionality on whether

00:49:15.293 --> 00:49:20.147
this gene is expressed or not is
controlled by a protein,

00:49:20.147 --> 00:49:20.664
right?

00:49:20.664 --> 00:49:24.055
It's controlled by this lac
repressor.

00:49:24.055 --> 00:49:27.203
If it's on there the gene won't
be made.

00:49:27.203 --> 00:49:30.832
And if it's
off the gene now you can make

00:49:30.832 --> 00:49:31.082
it.

00:49:31.082 --> 00:49:35.934
There's a promoter and the RNA
polymerase will see it.

00:49:35.934 --> 00:49:39.498
And so you've learned something
about

00:49:39.498 --> 00:49:40.271
proteins.

00:49:40.271 --> 00:49:42.761
They can bind various things.

00:49:42.761 --> 00:49:47.525
And so what lac repressor
has, it's got a little binding

00:49:47.525 --> 00:49:50.831
site that lactose is able to
bind to and

00:49:50.831 --> 00:49:54.497
change the confirmation of the
lac repressor.

00:49:54.497 --> 00:49:59.331
So why don't you take
those pieces of information and

00:49:59.331 --> 00:50:04.505
see if you can figure out how
the circuitry goes.

00:50:04.505 --> 00:50:05.121
Yeah?

00:50:05.121 --> 00:50:08.570
Did I do something wrong?

00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:09.210
Sorry.

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:10.276
Oh, sorry.

00:50:10.276 --> 00:50:11.342
Excuse me.

00:50:11.342 --> 00:50:12.515
Yes, Z-Y-A.

00:50:12.515 --> 00:50:13.581
Excuse me.

00:50:13.581 --> 00:50:13.900
OK?

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:18.026
We'll walk
through that on Monday,

00:50:18.026 --> 00:50:22.856
but focus on the fact that if
the repressor is

00:50:22.856 --> 00:50:30.000
there and lactose isn't,
it binds to this sequence.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.452
The repressor is made all the
time, but this repressor is

00:50:33.452 --> 00:50:36.428
something that
can tell you whether lactose is

00:50:36.428 --> 00:50:37.237
there or not.

00:50:37.237 --> 00:50:39.837
So you can put the circuit
together, OK?
