[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.786 --> 00:00:08.660
MIKE ABRAMS: Welcome.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:09.840
Thank you for being here.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:09.960
CAMERON MYLER: Thank you.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.376
TRACY EVANS: Thanks
for having us.

00:00:11.376 --> 00:00:15.030
MIKE ABRAMS: So let's
start with your sports.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.480
You both are in fairly
uncommon sports.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.320
How did you initially get
involved in luging and flipping

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.410
multiple times in the air
on skis at an early age

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.780
to become an Olympian?

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.640
CAMERON MYLER: OK.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.409
So I grew up close to Lake
Placid in upstate New York,

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:36.085
and my parents volunteered
at the Olympics in 1980

00:00:36.085 --> 00:00:37.640
at the luge track.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.260
So I'd been skiing already,
and I went with my parents

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.420
to see luge every day.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.670
So I saw the best athletes
in the world competing,

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.370
and Lake Placid is
a really small town

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.130
so I kind of got the
Olympic bug and saw other--

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.170
I saw figure skating
and hockey and I

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.690
saw Eric Heiden win his medals.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.100
So I was, like, all
excited about the Olympics.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.460
And after the games there
was a two-week luge camp,

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.510
so my parents let me skip
school and go to luge camp.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.790
I got on a sled, loved it
from the very first time,

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.760
and at the end of the two weeks
I won the Junior Olympics race

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.270
in my age group, and that
was kind of the beginning

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.630
of the next 18 years on a sled.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.630
MIKE ABRAMS: And how old
were you when you first

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.090
went to luge camp?

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.370
TRACY EVANS: Really?

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.560
You're going to ask me that now?

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.840
MIKE ABRAMS: No, when
you went to luge camp.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.190
TRACY EVANS: Luge camp.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.480
MIKE ABRAMS: When you started.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.940
CAMERON MYLER: Yes.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:25.630
I was 11.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.990
MIKE ABRAMS: 11.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.560
CAMERON MYLER: I was 11.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.620
Which is pretty typical.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.680
So in luge there are
like a dozen or so tracks

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.230
around the world, and you
don't get very many runs

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.610
on each track every year.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.640
So it really takes
years to be good

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.240
and to be successful
internationally.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.826
So 10 or 11 is pretty typical
for jumping on a sled.

00:01:44.826 --> 00:01:45.742
MIKE ABRAMS: 10 or 11.

00:01:45.742 --> 00:01:46.000
Wow.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.810
And what about you?

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:47.560
TRACY EVANS: Yeah.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.000
Well, it's kind of a
family affair in our house.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.090
So my brother was
actually an aerialist

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.070
on the US ski team
for many years, way

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.630
before I got into it.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.150
I was 21 when I actually
got into the sport,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.530
so a little bit later.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.910
But yeah.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.330
So my brother was in it, and
I was actually at school,

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.420
going to school down at
Florida State University.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.470
And-- yep.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.320
A lot of good skiing
down that way.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.930
But, you know, there
wasn't a lot athletically

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.940
for me to get involved
in down there.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.610
I was actually riding horses
and doing gymnastics growing up

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.710
a ton, and both my
brother and I skied

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.150
since we could walk, come from
a very, very avid skiing family.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.830
But anyway-- so I decided
I was either going

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.030
to take a semester off and
go to Winter Park Colorado

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.530
and ski where my brother was
skiing with a freestyle club

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.350
there, or I was transferring
to University of New Hampshire

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.120
where there was an
equestrian riding team.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.570
So I first went to Winter
Park, went out there, always

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.850
thought I'd be a bump
skier, a mogul skier.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.170
My brother did aerials.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.490
I thought he was nuts.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.610
There is no way I would
have ever done that.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.890
So anyway, I went out.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.200
And with freestyle you
usually do all the events

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.200
at a regional level.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.210
So I did, and actually
did the best in aerials.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.070
So obviously I didn't
transfer to UNH.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.960
I ended up coming
out to Salt Lake City

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.790
and training with
a coach out there,

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.550
and basically I was
the only woman training

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.940
with five other men out there,
and it took a little convincing

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.040
for the coach to even
let me come and train.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.360
So, yeah.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.790
So it's been kind of--

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.277
then I was on, basically,
about 12 years on the US team.

00:03:25.277 --> 00:03:26.860
MIKE ABRAMS: So what
was that training

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.590
like, from when you
first started to right

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.030
before your first Olympics?

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.979
What was the schedule
like, and the effort that

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:36.020
goes into becoming one of
the best in your sports

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.760
in the world?

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.510
TRACY EVANS: Yeah.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.610
Absolutely.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.340
Do you want to--

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.645
CAMERON MYLER: Sure.

00:03:39.645 --> 00:03:40.660
TRACY EVANS: Go ahead.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.785
CAMERON MYLER: I can start.

00:03:41.785 --> 00:03:45.160
So I was on the national
team for 14 years, and--

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.960
I think Tracy will
probably agree--

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.810
competing on the
level that we did

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.070
is basically a full-time job.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.230
So the off-season is when
most of the really intense

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.820
physical training takes place.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.480
So for luge there are
kind of two components.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.090
And it's the start,
which is the only chance

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.220
that you have to
accelerate the sled,

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.900
and then once you pull
off from the handles--

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.380
and you wear spikes on your
fingertips-- paddle down

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.220
the ramp, and then you lie down
and then it's all about skill

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.720
and how well you
can drive the lines.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.180
So in the summertime we would do
a lot of sort of basic training

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.340
at first, and then
it's all about sort

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.700
of power and quickness
and speed on the start.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.570
So a lot of upper body,
back, core work, and a lot

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.680
of Olympic lifting
in the summertime.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.070
And then in the
winter we would be

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.610
on the road from usually
the beginning of October

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.610
until December.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.160
So usually 10 weeks in the fall.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.620
You'd come home for,
like, a week at Christmas.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.170
And it was kind of enough
time to wash your clothes,

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.390
eat a couple of meals
that your mom made,

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.570
and then back on the road
for another eight weeks

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.060
for the World Cup and
world championship season.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.180
So definitely kind
of year-round.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.850
And I was able to
work, actually,

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.090
undergrad into that schedule
because I went to Dartmouth

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.200
and it had--

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.930
it's on quarters, so I would go
with the luge team in the fall

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.430
and winter and then
I'd go to school

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.560
in the spring and summer.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.391
I was there for a little
longer than four years.

00:05:16.391 --> 00:05:17.140
TRACY EVANS: Yeah.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.680
So for aerials, basically
it starts on a trampoline.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.850
And there are hours and
hours of refining your skills

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.420
for doing backflips and
twists and multiple twists

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.050
and multiple flips
and all of that.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.530
And you're in a big
harness as well, which

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.010
has a spinning belt. So
that's attached to ropes.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.410
So there's a lot of--

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.260
trampoline training is a
really, really big facet of it.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.300
Then you actually transfer
it to water ramping,

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.670
where you're coming down--

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.780
Lake Placid and Park City have
two water ramp facilities.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.110
And you come down the
ramps on plastic surface,

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.330
go off, and land into
a big swimming pool

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.481
with all your skis, your boots.

00:05:57.481 --> 00:05:58.980
You know, you have
a life jacket on.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.400
Usually you have a dry suit
or a wet suit, and a helmet,

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.980
of course.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.510
And I've always
had the question,

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.810
do your ski boots get wet.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.256
And I'm like,
yeah, they get wet.

00:06:09.256 --> 00:06:10.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.450
And we break skis and
all sorts of things.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.290
And water does hurt.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.460
It's a great way to train.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.480
That's where you-- like I said,
there's a very long process

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.580
in taking what you see on snow--

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.160
there's a qualification
process for every single jump

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.072
that you do on snow.

00:06:28.072 --> 00:06:30.030
So you have to do it a
certain number of times,

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.180
you have to qualify it in
front of a US team coach safely

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.050
five times in a
row, and then you're

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.010
able to transfer it on to
snow once the season starts.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.056
And then I think-- like
what Cameron said--

00:06:43.056 --> 00:06:44.430
I think one of
the misconceptions

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.690
about Olympic athletes is
that the only thing they

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.180
train for and compete
in are the Olympics.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.370
And we have a World
Cup circuit that we

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.210
are on every single year.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.330
And so you go--

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.130
CAMERON MYLER: You
may not see our sports

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.690
except at the Olympics on TV.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:00.481
TRACY EVANS: Right.

00:07:00.481 --> 00:07:00.570
Yeah.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.870
Right.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.070
And we have world
championships every other year.

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.180
So we were on tour from
December all the way

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.880
to April every year, and
then our summer training also

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.260
we would do trampoline starting
in May through October.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.170
So we had a little bit of time
off in April and a little bit

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:17.790
of time off in
October, but other

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:20.470
than that it was year-round
training for sure.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:21.220
MIKE ABRAMS: Yeah.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.696
And so you obviously did a
lot of the trampoline training

00:07:23.696 --> 00:07:24.570
and all these things.

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.100
Have you seen the
training evolve

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.340
from when you started doing
it your first couple of years

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.950
to where we are today with the
technology and the advancements

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:32.840
that have happened?

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.590
TRACY EVANS: Yeah.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.070
Well, I know for aerials--

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.700
you know, I think the
water ramp facility

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.380
itself has become better.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:45.480
The jumps that we used
to use for water ramping

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.500
were not as similar as the jumps
that we now create on snow,

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.100
but now they are
very, very similar.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.330
So that transition
from water to snow

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.570
is not nearly as different.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.692
And really the only thing that
you have to modify for on snow

00:08:00.692 --> 00:08:02.400
is the landing hill,
because we obviously

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.320
land on a very, very
steep landing hill,

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.557
and water you're
landing pretty much--

00:08:06.557 --> 00:08:08.640
you really don't try to
land straight up and down,

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.070
but we try to land with our
tips going into the water.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:14.250
But aside from
that, there's still

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:15.850
tons of trampoline training.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.840
And I don't think that there's--

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.120
I think where, at
least for aerials,

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.340
it's changed is
more time on snow.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.750
The more time that we can
actually train on snow--

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.590
so more training camps have
come about where we've been able

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:29.610
to--

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:33.900
where the team's been able
to be on snow more often.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.450
CAMERON MYLER: So
with luge the--

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.730
it's hard to see when
you watch it on TV

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:40.559
or even when you're
standing at the track

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:43.220
and a sled goes by
at 90 miles an hour,

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.980
but the sled is-- there's
a lot of technology that

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.250
goes into the sled.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.540
So a single sled-- and
women just do singles,

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.670
men can do singles or doubles.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.670
But the single sled
weighs about 50 pounds.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.700
So it is-- there's a
part that you lie in.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.630
Your body is sort of
in a fiberglass shell.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:06.160
There are handles that you hold
onto, and then runners that go

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.890
the whole length of the sled.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:12.690
Attached to that on the bottom
are steels, and they are--

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:16.120
there's sort of a lot of
technological espionage

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.690
in the sport, so
people are always

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:21.540
trying to see what other
countries are doing.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.450
And when I was on the team--
and it's definitely still true

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:25.470
today--

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.330
our coach would make the sleds.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.340
So, everything.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.730
So from the fiberglass
to the runners.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.220
The steels are-- that's
probably the most

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:39.330
technologically-complicated
part of the sled

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:40.980
and the most important.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.040
And it's really--
it's very nuanced sort

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.400
of what metals comprise the
runners and what goes fast.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.410
And sometimes it's just
really hard to know.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:53.340
You might have steels
that are made--

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:57.240
two made exactly the same
material at the same time,

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.730
and one will be
faster than the other.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.010
So it's like, yes, there's
a lot of technology,

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:06.130
but there's also some
art to it as well.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:07.770
So I had a--

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.800
one of our assistant
coaches from Italy--

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.605
one summer he said,
OK, so we think

00:10:13.605 --> 00:10:15.480
these steels are really
fast, but what I want

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.690
you to do this summer is to--

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:19.620
and I'm not joking here--

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.670
bury them in your backyard
so the sun and the moon

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:26.860
can get on the steels, and I
think we'll go even faster.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.050
I was like, OK.

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:28.660
I'll do that.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:29.340
TRACY EVANS: I'll try anything.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:29.880
[LAUGHING]

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.296
CAMERON MYLER: And
they were fast.

00:10:31.296 --> 00:10:33.930
I have no idea if it was,
like, burying in the backyard.

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:40.350
It required a lot of sanding
to get the rust off, but--

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:44.100
so there's definitely a lot
of technology in the sleds.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.560
I didn't mention
before, one part

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.270
of the training
in the summertime

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.880
is practicing the start on ice.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.360
So in Lake Placid there's an
indoor start ramp facility.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.780
So you can practice
the start on ice.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:02.340
You go down the ramp and
then up the other side.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.350
Because it makes a
really big difference,

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.525
sort of being on ice
versus being on wheels,

00:11:07.525 --> 00:11:09.150
which is possible,
but you don't really

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.060
get the same sort of feel.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.520
One of the start ramps in--

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.820
it's actually the one at the
track in La Plagne in France,

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.070
where the Olympics were in '92.

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:24.030
So the ramp is so steep that
when you're-- so with luge

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:26.250
you're sitting on the
sled at the start,

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.480
hands around the handles.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.080
So normally you can see the
ramp, see the first curve.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.240
This ramp-- it's so
steep, you can't see it.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.780
So you're sitting at the
start, you can't see the ramp,

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.711
and you just see
the first curve.

00:11:38.711 --> 00:11:39.210
OK.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.470
I hope I'm going to go straight
down there [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:41.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:43.590
I always had to pray a little.

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:44.850
MIKE ABRAMS: So that
leads into my question,

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:46.320
which is, most of
this audience--

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.410
I don't want to assume anyone--
maybe some people have--

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:50.659
but most of this audience
has probably never gone down

00:11:50.659 --> 00:11:52.300
a luge ramp at
80-plus miles an hour

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.540
or flipped multiple
times on skis.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.850
Can you describe that
experience of being in the air?

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.350
Or when you get down that
ramp in the first curve?

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:01.350
CAMERON MYLER: Go ahead.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:02.391
TRACY EVANS: Oh goodness.

00:12:02.391 --> 00:12:04.650
You know-- gosh.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:07.860
It is so difficult
to describe what it's

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.390
like to be 60 feet in the air.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.330
I was actually the
first woman in the world

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.400
to do a triple-twisting
double back-flip,

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.400
and a double-twisting
triple backflip.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.290
CAMERON MYLER: Can
you demonstrate?

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.310
TRACY EVANS: Yeah, yeah.

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:19.055
Not so much right here.

00:12:19.055 --> 00:12:19.555
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:19.555 --> 00:12:25.170
But you know-- oh my goodness.

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:27.750
It is-- I think, you know--

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:28.730
I'm scared of heights.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:29.750
So if you put me on top of a--

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:30.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.690
I know.

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:31.777
Everyone says, oh my gosh.

00:12:31.777 --> 00:12:32.610
You're an aerialist.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:33.960
How can you be afraid--

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:38.850
but just looking out and down
is just nerve-wracking to me.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:40.420
It makes my legs all weak.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.529
But going-- you know, you're
doing something in the air.

00:12:43.529 --> 00:12:44.320
You're coming down.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.200
You're not focused on,
really, how high you are.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.158
Except for you need to
get your feet under you.

00:12:48.158 --> 00:12:55.860
But, you know, it's just that
an amazing, amazing feeling of--

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.625
you know-- like I said,
it's hard to put in words.

00:12:58.625 --> 00:13:00.750
You're at the top of the
end run and you definitely

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.660
have to figure out how to
channel the fear in a really

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.310
positive, productive
way, otherwise

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:07.710
you'll never be an aerialist.

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:09.810
But, you know,
the adrenalin rush

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:13.620
that you get coming down
and doing a triple flip

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.480
and landing and skiing away--

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.070
when you're down
at the bottom, it

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:22.990
is such an intense amount of
emotion in all of six seconds.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:23.490
And it is.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:24.330
It's just amazing.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:25.080
I always say this.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.150
And I love my husband
to death, but I really

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.160
haven't found quite
something that's give me

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.710
quite the adrenaline
rush that aerials has.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:32.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:36.450
That might be too much
information, but nonetheless.

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:37.960
That's the way it goes.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:41.178
[LAUGHING] On to you.

00:13:41.178 --> 00:13:42.144
CAMERON MYLER: OK.

00:13:42.144 --> 00:13:43.519
TRACY EVANS:
[IMITATING DRUMROLL]

00:13:43.519 --> 00:13:46.230
CAMERON MYLER: So
luge is the fastest

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.760
of all of the sledding sports.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.020
So it's faster than bobsled.

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.674
It's faster than skeleton.

00:13:50.674 --> 00:13:52.340
And it's actually the
only Olympic sport

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.820
times the thousandth
of a second.

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.960
So the fastest
track in the world

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.540
is Vancouver, from
the men's start

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.850
is about 97 miles an hour.

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:05.640
So I have not gone that fast.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.310
I've been from the
men's start in Park City

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.350
and gone about 87 miles an hour.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.120
So fast enough.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.990
So if you've driven
that fast in your car,

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.990
imagine sort of that
speed lying on your back

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:23.520
on a fairly small sled
going down an ice track.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.510
Some of the tracks are--

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:27.100
and every track is different.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.660
So some tracks are sort
of wide open curves.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.890
Of course you have to
steer on all of them,

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:36.100
but some require less steering.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.820
So the one in Park City is a
little more like an autobahn.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:42.420
It's very fast, not a ton of
steering, a really fun kind

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.280
of smooth ride down.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.560
There are other tracks,
however, that are really

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.840
technically
difficult. And if you

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.810
don't steer in exactly
the right place at exactly

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:53.880
the right time, you'll crash.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.410
So I like those tracks,
and I was good at those.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:58.320
MIKE ABRAMS: Great.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.180
So let's go to the
first Olympics,

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.820
as you both are
multi-time Olympians.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:05.970
That first Olympics-- what
was the emotion when you first

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:08.370
qualified, and then what
was emotion at the opening

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:09.804
ceremonies when you were there?

00:15:09.804 --> 00:15:11.970
Were you really excited to
be there and ready to go,

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.740
or were you really nervous
about the competition?

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.690
Kind of what was going
through your head?

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:18.780
CAMERON MYLER: So my first
games was in '88 in Calgary,

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.750
and that year to
qualify for the team

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:25.020
there were a series of
races in Lake Placid.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.070
So I qualified.

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:30.266
And, it's like, you know when
you qualify it's like, OK,

00:15:30.266 --> 00:15:31.390
I've made the Olympic team.

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:33.050
Super excited about that.

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:35.920
But it wasn't really until
I walked into the opening

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.720
ceremonies that I
thought, oh my gosh,

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.340
like, I've made
the Olympic team.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.230
I'm here representing
the United States.

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:44.100
And all of-- I was
19 at my first games,

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:47.050
so I had spent sort of
eight years preparing

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:49.360
for that moment.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.420
And with that games
I didn't really

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:55.720
have any particular
expectation about my finish.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.450
Like, I didn't really
expect that I had a chance

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:02.530
to win a medal, so I was
really just going to do my best

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:08.030
and hopefully have as good
a race as I possibly could.

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:11.020
So that games I was ninth.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.010
I had great runs.

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:14.620
I was happy with the results.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.690
And had a few more
games after that, but--

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:18.190
yeah.

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:21.070
So it's that
moment, I think when

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.350
you walk into the
opening ceremonies

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:24.430
is a pretty special one.

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:25.180
TRACY EVANS: Yeah.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:25.810
Yeah.

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:29.846
So my mine was
1994, and I was 26.

00:16:29.846 --> 00:16:33.280
[LAUGHS] And
actually Cameron was

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.920
the flag bearer at the
1994 Olympic games,

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.650
so that's a huge honor.

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:40.480
And they are voted--

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:44.220
the flag bearer is
voted by our teammates.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.990
So she was voted by all of us
to be the flag bearer, which

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:48.970
was amazing.

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:53.110
For me, also, my brother was
actually-- after he retired--

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.680
went on to coach the Australian
freestyle ski team in aerials.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:02.290
So in 1994-- again, a family
affair, he was coaching aerials

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:03.410
while I was competing.

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:05.410
So it was-- and my
parents were over there.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:09.310
So that was something that
was just obviously amazing.

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:12.430
And like Cameron
said, the process of--

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:14.770
at least for freestyle--

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:17.230
of qualifying for the
games is a pretty long one,

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:20.710
and so we didn't find
out our team until, like,

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:21.869
two weeks before the games.

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:23.109
So, yes.

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:24.730
That's a step.

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:27.490
But my mentality going into
all the Olympics as well

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:30.190
was to make sure that I
had a degree of difficulty

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:33.190
that if I won or could win--

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:35.410
I just put myself
in a place to win.

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:37.390
And that was just always--

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.520
like, the Olympics is
not a place to hold back.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.040
So that was-- yeah.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:45.040
That was just-- I mean,
Lillehammer, for sure,

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.700
was just an amazing,
amazing first games.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.590
But I will say my
last games-- real

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.260
quick-- is that it's rare that
an Olympian gets to compete

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:57.640
in their own home country
during your career, let

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.110
alone your own backyard.

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:01.160
So I live in Park City, Utah.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.070
So the fact that
Salt Lake City held

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:05.300
the 2002 Olympic
games was amazing,

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.700
and that was how I
got to end my career.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.949
So it's been-- it
was pretty cool.

00:18:10.949 --> 00:18:12.990
CAMERON MYLER: I thought
about going for a fifth.

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:13.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:17.560
Because '98 was my last
Olympics in Nagano, Japan.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.640
And for that reason, because
2002 was in the United States,

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.740
I thought, oh, maybe one more.

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:27.542
But decided to go to
law school instead.

00:18:27.542 --> 00:18:28.306
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:28.306 --> 00:18:30.740
So, nearly as much fun as luge.

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:31.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:36.760
Although I was in Park City
because, as Tracy mentioned,

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.880
I carried the flag at
the opening ceremonies

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:44.500
in '94, which was a huge
honor and really humbling

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:48.040
to be there for the
US team and really

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:52.030
for everybody back home as well.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.190
Although when I was--

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:57.340
each sport nominates someone
to carry the flag, and then

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.800
the team captains of
all the sports vote

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.780
on who will be elected.

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:05.620
And Dan Janzen and Bonni
Blair were nominated.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.340
And I was like,
OK, so this is kind

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.040
of going to be like the Oscars.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.110
I'm really honored to
have been nominated

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:15.850
in this great pool of people,
and then and then I got picked.

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:18.640
So I was super surprised
and really, really honored.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:23.050
But in Salt Lake City
the organizing committee

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:27.070
invited all of the flag bearers
to come and run with the torch

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:30.250
from the opening ceremony
stadium to the first medal

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:31.830
ceremony.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.270
And everyone who had
carried the flag from--

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:36.250
basically who was living
and who could come

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:38.680
and manage to carry the torch.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:42.340
And they said, well, you're
young and in pretty good shape

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:43.220
and all of that.

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.690
And I was like, OK, I'm
working in a law firm

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:49.240
on Wall Street,
like, 20 hours a day

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.420
and I can't remember the
last time I worked out.

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:54.490
So when we were
running you had to run

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:58.580
behind the van with the
camera on you the entire time,

00:19:58.580 --> 00:19:59.260
so I thought--

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:02.230
and I was like, oh my gosh,
my arm's really tired.

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:03.990
If I drop it, like,
should I switch hands.

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:06.010
Like, that's not really going
to look good, but if I drop it

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:06.910
that's even worse.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:07.409
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:07.409 --> 00:20:08.720
But it was all OK.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.670
TRACY EVANS: And you're
trying not to huff and puff.

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:10.210
[BREATHING LOUDLY]

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:10.580
CAMERON MYLER: I know.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.620
I was like, oh my gosh.

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:12.120
Yeah.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.180
MIKE ABRAMS: So is that
more nerve-wracking,

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:14.590
or carrying the flag in
the opening ceremony?

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:16.090
CAMERON MYLER: Well,
before I walked

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:20.230
into the stadium at the opening
ceremonies in Lillehammer

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:25.360
the director of marketing
for USA luge said, oh, so

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.360
like two billion people
are watching the Olympics,

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.479
so don't trip and
fall with the flag.

00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:31.270
I was like, really?

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:32.440
Like, you had to say that to me?

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:32.990
TRACY EVANS: You tell
me that right now?

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.989
CAMERON MYLER: I didn't.

00:20:33.989 --> 00:20:34.794
It was all good.

00:20:34.794 --> 00:20:36.710
MIKE ABRAMS: So Tracy
brought up a good point,

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:39.130
that you got to compete
in your home country,

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:39.970
and really hometown.

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:40.720
TRACY EVANS: Yeah.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.140
MIKE ABRAMS: Did you ever feel,
when you went on the road,

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.460
that you didn't get
enough practice time

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:47.710
or the courses were different?

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:51.892
Or I guess, what was that
experience being a road course?

00:20:51.892 --> 00:20:53.350
Or was it common
practice since you

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:54.710
traveled throughout the year?

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:55.460
TRACY EVANS: Yeah.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:56.050
No.

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:58.780
You know, I think one
of the things that--

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:03.190
even in Cameron's sport, that's
one of the things as an athlete

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:05.410
you have to be able to
do, is be able to change

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:07.120
from site to site
from week to week,

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.660
and you have to be flexible.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:12.040
You have to know how to adjust
and deal with obstacles,

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.472
and all that kind of thing.

00:21:13.472 --> 00:21:16.030
So, not really.

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:18.640
I mean, that was something
throughout all our years

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.210
of training that we were
used to on a weekly basis.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:24.430
Like I said, World Cup
was a different site

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:25.430
every single week.

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:28.330
So every Sunday we would
travel somewhere else

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:30.569
and then train a couple
of days and compete,

00:21:30.569 --> 00:21:31.860
and do it again somewhere else.

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.532
So you just learn to adapt.

00:21:33.532 --> 00:21:34.990
MIKE ABRAMS: What
about the tracks?

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:36.420
Luge tracks are very different.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:36.760
CAMERON MYLER: Well, yeah.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.840
So the luge tracks
are very different.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.870
But I'll just
mention that when--

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:43.160
I made the national
team when I was 15,

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:46.300
and my first couple
of years on the team

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:50.470
there was still East Germany
and Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:53.710
And we went to all of
those places, so it was--

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:56.890
I mean, it was a really great
adventure, among other things,

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:59.440
being on the team at that time.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.190
TRACY EVANS: Yeah.

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:02.140
CAMERON MYLER: Food
was always a challenge.

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.945
Like, I cannot identify whatever
is on my plate right now,

00:22:05.945 --> 00:22:08.320
so you'd always bring, like,
peanut butter and jelly with

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.540
you, just in case.

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:10.600
TRACY EVANS: Definitely.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.600
CAMERON MYLER: So, yeah.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:15.130
Luge tracks are definitely
very, very different from track

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:15.700
to track.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.300
And the US-- we were at a
little bit of a disadvantage

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:22.510
because Germany has four tracks.

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:25.030
Germans sort of run the
International Federation,

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:28.750
and there tend to be
three or four World Cups

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:31.360
on German tracks every year.

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.180
So usually the way it
works with countries

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.580
is that, if you have a track--

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:37.750
US has a track--

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:39.370
that everyone else
wants to train on.

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:41.953
If you're Germany-- they have a
track people want to train on.

00:22:41.953 --> 00:22:44.350
You might swap training times.

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:46.600
No one wanted to train on
the track in Lake Placid,

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:51.240
so it was kind of worth nothing
in sort of track time leverage.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:55.620
So we ended up getting, like,
not great training times.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:59.620
And with the luge
track it's about--

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.350
so luge, bobsled, and skeleton
all go on the same track.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:07.150
From the top of the course some
tracks are nearly a mile long.

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:09.850
So most of them are concrete.

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:12.460
There are pipes running
throughout the entire track,

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.010
and there's a big
refrigeration plant

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:18.160
that pumps some ammonia
compound throughout the pipes,

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:22.510
and you spray water on the
track and it makes ice.

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:25.149
However, one thing
that the Germans

00:23:25.149 --> 00:23:27.190
liked to do when we were
training on their tracks

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.746
was-- like, give us track time
at, like, 9 o'clock at night.

00:23:29.746 --> 00:23:30.246
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:30.246 --> 00:23:30.746
Yeah.

00:23:30.746 --> 00:23:31.330
Great.

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:33.290
And then 6:00 o'clock
the next morning.

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:37.810
And then they would crank up
the refrigeration so it grows,

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.410
like, frost on the ice.

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:43.960
So the track would be really
slow when we were training.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:47.350
And in luge,
because it's so fast

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:49.480
and it's timed to the
thousandth of a second--

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.610
if the track is even,
like, half a second

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:54.710
slow it makes a really big
difference in your timing

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:56.110
in how you steer.

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:58.900
So training-- there would be
all sorts of frost on the ice,

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.100
and then race day--

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.020
I mean, literally you
would sit on your sled

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.600
and, like, look at the ice at
the start and think, like, oh.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.700
Like, I can see my
reflection in the ice.

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.610
It's so-- the ice would be,
like, really hard and really

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:11.312
smooth, and very fast.

00:24:11.312 --> 00:24:13.270
So that was always a
little bit of a challenge.

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:15.430
But, like Tracy said, you adapt.

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:19.190
It's something that you learn
how to do as an athlete.

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.940
TRACY EVANS: Yeah.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:20.860
Yeah.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.350
You know, it's so
different for aerials.

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:26.200
It's like-- you know,
we have four jumps

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.290
and there's usually two double
kickers and two triple kickers.

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:32.620
And we arrived there
and they're just big,

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:38.200
you know, piles of snow that
we have to basically go shape.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:42.520
So there's certain shapers
from different countries,

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:46.450
and so each jump is shaped
just a little bit different.

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:48.010
Sometimes people
like steep jumps.

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:50.910
Some people like a little
bit less at the top

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:53.440
so it doesn't throw you up quite
so much, it throws you out.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.990
But everybody-- I don't know.

00:24:55.990 --> 00:25:00.250
You know, that definitely-- we
all trained at the same time.

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:02.350
Everybody was very supportive.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:04.730
And not that that's
not an extreme sport,

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:07.024
but I don't know.

00:25:07.024 --> 00:25:08.440
There was definitely
a camaraderie

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:12.220
between our countries
and between everyone

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:16.270
to make sure that the jumps
were just right for everybody.

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:17.440
So, yeah.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.090
MIKE ABRAMS: Well,
you have family

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:19.500
that's a coach from
another country, too.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.050
TRACY EVANS: Well, yeah.

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:20.560
Exactly.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.160
That, too.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.124
But, yeah.

00:25:23.124 --> 00:25:25.540
CAMERON MYLER: Yeah, definitely
a little different dynamic

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:26.140
in luge, I think.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:27.390
TRACY EVANS: Yeah, definitely.

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:29.769
CAMERON MYLER: And I think
the Olympics in Vancouver

00:25:29.769 --> 00:25:31.560
are probably a pretty
good example of that.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:36.330
Because-- so prior to Vancouver
the two other times Canada

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:39.300
hosted the Olympics-- so
Montreal in '76 and then

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.860
'88 in Calgary--

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:42.660
they didn't win any gold medals.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:44.236
0 at home, which is really--

00:25:44.236 --> 00:25:44.944
TRACY EVANS: Wow.

00:25:44.944 --> 00:25:45.190
That's rare.

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:46.648
CAMERON MYLER: It's
really unusual.

00:25:46.648 --> 00:25:48.900
So usually you kind of have
the home field advantage

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.760
and you're going to
win more gold medals.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.760
Canada had not done that, so
they were determined, I think,

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.340
in Vancouver to make
sure that they won gold.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:58.290
So one of the
strategies-- they funded

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:01.500
a lot of athletes they thought
had the chance to win medals.

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:05.040
And then the other strategy
was to limit access

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:09.280
to Olympic venues for
athletes from other countries.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.050
So, I mean, if you are a figure
skater or a hockey player,

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:16.140
maybe not such a big deal
because a lot of the rinks

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.880
are fairly similar.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.920
Maybe a little bit
different ice quality,

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.960
or it's slightly
different dimensions,

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.410
but fairly much the same.

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:26.040
Luge, not so much.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.030
And that was the fastest
track in the world.

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:30.200
So actually, the day
before the opening

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:34.150
ceremonies an athlete from
Georgia died on the track.

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:37.260
So he had 25 runs, and I
think the average Canadian

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.360
had, like, 250.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.430
So, yeah.

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:41.970
It matters.

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:42.678
MIKE ABRAMS: Wow.

00:26:42.678 --> 00:26:44.359
So let's pivot to post-olympics.

00:26:44.359 --> 00:26:45.150
CAMERON MYLER: Yes.

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:46.191
MIKE ABRAMS: So there's--

00:26:46.191 --> 00:26:48.180
a lot of Olympians,
in some cases,

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.760
struggle
post-professional-athletic

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.320
career and pivoting
to a new career.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.520
You two have done very well.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.460
So can you tell us
what you're doing now

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.520
and talk about maybe
your foundation as well?

00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.390
CAMERON MYLER: Sure.

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:00.140
TRACY EVANS: Yeah.

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:00.930
So-- gosh.

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:04.760
I retired after,
obviously, the 2000--

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.450
actually, I retired
after the '98 games,

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:09.720
took two years off, and
went down to California

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.210
and started a division of my
brother's sports marketing

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:13.034
company.

00:27:13.034 --> 00:27:15.450
CAMERON MYLER: Oh, you went
to a warm place for two years.

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:15.990
I'm jealous.

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.795
TRACY EVANS: I did.

00:27:16.795 --> 00:27:17.295
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:17.295 --> 00:27:18.970
I needed a break.

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.810
Anyway-- yeah.

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:24.060
And started a
sportscasting company,

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.580
and placing athletes in
different sport production--

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:29.070
mainly commercial
and print stuff.

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:32.130
It was a great break, and
I came back, obviously,

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:33.240
for the 2002 games.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.260
And then afterwards
went back to casting.

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:39.420
So, you know, I feel
just very fortunate.

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:42.060
I mean, I did finish
getting my degree.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.890
It took me 10 years, but I
had done that while I was--

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:45.190
CAMERON MYLER: I beat you.

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:46.284
It only took me seven.

00:27:46.284 --> 00:27:47.739
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:47.739 --> 00:27:50.280
TRACY EVANS: I had my 10 year
high school reunion the weekend

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:53.320
I was walking on
my college degree.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.570
CAMERON MYLER: That's awesome.

00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:56.321
TRACY EVANS: But anyway--

00:27:56.321 --> 00:27:56.820
yeah.

00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:00.390
So I feel pretty
fortunate that I

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:02.070
had a pretty smooth transition.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:04.590
I also was very much in the--

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:05.800
that's just my personality.

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.550
Like, I knew I had to have
something to move on to.

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:13.920
And so having a business that
was already somewhat set up

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:14.880
was great.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.510
And I did that for a long
time, and still doing that.

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:24.630
But also along the way I
went on a volunteer trip

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:26.490
to my mother's
prompting, basically,

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:29.520
and ended up starting
a foundation called

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.690
Kids Play international.

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:33.510
And this really truly
is my absolute passion,

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:34.410
without a doubt.

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:38.630
And it was really this
one little boy's words.

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:39.285
10 years old.

00:28:39.285 --> 00:28:40.360
His name's Thomas.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.900
I went on a volunteer
trip, and he

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:47.070
said to me at the end of the
trip, I can see girls can play.

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:50.299
And the background to that
is that we were there--

00:28:50.299 --> 00:28:51.340
CAMERON MYLER: In Africa.

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:52.800
TRACY EVANS: --in
Malawi, Africa.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.550
Yep.

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:57.477
And basically, of course,
we were playing soccer,

00:28:57.477 --> 00:29:00.060
but we also introduced some new
sports with the boys and girls

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:00.870
over there.

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:03.660
And obviously developing
countries-- girls just are not

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.190
encouraged to play sport.

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:08.490
So when we actually
pulled out, you

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:11.610
know, baseball and softball
after playing soccer

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:13.830
where the boys were just
absolutely aggressive

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:16.020
and the girls stood
there like orange cones

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:19.050
and wouldn't interact
very well together--

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:21.457
but we pulled out
baseball, softball,

00:29:21.457 --> 00:29:23.040
and it just leveled
the playing field.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.740
They had never picked
up a bat, never played,

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.930
never heard of the sport,
never played the sport.

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:28.950
And it was just--

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:33.630
for me to watch how differently
boys and girls were learning

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:37.770
side-by-side, and know
just that-- everything

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:40.350
that sport and the Olympic
values have taught me.

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:44.040
And I really came
back after that trip

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.980
and decided that I
wanted to do something

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.810
with gender equality and sport.

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:54.820
And so it's been about
10 years in the making.

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:58.254
We have a year-round
program in Rwanda, Africa,

00:29:58.254 --> 00:29:59.670
and it's really
all about building

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:01.710
better relationships
between boys and girls

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:03.290
from a very young age.

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:08.130
You know, boys and girls are
so segregated in developing

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:11.130
countries from an early
age that it's just--

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:13.320
through our program
it definitely

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.120
goes from simple to
complex learning.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.940
But it's been an
amazing, amazing journey,

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:21.210
and such a great way
to be able to take

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:23.760
everything that sport has given
me and pay it forward a bit.

00:30:26.812 --> 00:30:29.020
MIKE ABRAMS: And you're
involved, too, in [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:30.830
CAMERON MYLER: I am an athlete
ambassador, and I've been to--

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:31.170
TRACY EVANS: Oh yes.

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:31.670
[LAUGHS]

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:35.380
CAMERON MYLER: I've been to
Rwanda, where our program is,

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:36.420
a couple of times.

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:41.440
And I went first in 2011
and it was really, like,

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.700
one of the best things, I think,
that I've done sort of at the--

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:49.290
using sport in a way
that makes a difference.

00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:52.240
So I went back this
last summer on a trip

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:55.120
that was funded by a
State Department grant.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:58.780
And it's amazing to sort of see
the difference that the program

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:00.280
has made in the community.

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.190
So not just with the kids,
but the parents and teachers

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:06.400
and everyone had
really great stories

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.520
of how the Let's
Play Fair program has

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.011
impacted them personally.

00:31:12.011 --> 00:31:13.260
MIKE ABRAMS: And you're also--

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:14.500
you went to law school after.

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:15.375
CAMERON MYLER: I did.

00:31:15.375 --> 00:31:20.650
So '98 was my last games, and
I went to law school that fall.

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:23.380
And I decided to
go to law school

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:26.590
because I had been on
the US Olympic Committee

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:29.830
board of directors and on
the athletes advisory council

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:30.940
for eight years.

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:34.940
And there are a lot
of lawyers in sport.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.550
You know, NBA is
nothing but attorneys.

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:40.480
So it's true in
Olympic sport as well.

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.330
A lot of lawyers
practicing or working

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:45.040
at a sports organization.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.720
And I thought, oh,
well, maybe that's

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.480
an interesting way to sort of
combine professional career

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.860
with my interest in sport.

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:53.020
I wasn't quite sure how
that was going to happen,

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:57.310
but it seemed like a good sort
of general direction anyway.

00:31:57.310 --> 00:32:01.200
So I went to it went to
BC for law school, and--

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:01.972
AUDIENCE: Woohoo!

00:32:01.972 --> 00:32:02.930
CAMERON MYLER: Oh, yay.

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:03.640
Right on.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:04.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:12.320
And I've been in New York
since I graduated law school.

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:16.270
So I worked on Wall Street at
a big, big firm, Milbank Tweed,

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:20.440
for two years, kind of went
through the law firm boot camp.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:25.240
And then I went to a
smaller Median Entertainment

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:29.260
boutique that had really
interesting clients.

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:33.820
So I worked on the last JD
Salinger copyright infringement

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:34.590
case.

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:35.590
Nike was a client.

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:39.910
So I mostly litigated
intellectual property cases.

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:42.340
While I was there I also had--

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.860
because I'd been involved
with the US Olympic Committee,

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:46.834
after I graduated law
school I put my name--

00:32:46.834 --> 00:32:48.250
there was, like,
a list of lawyers

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:51.730
who were available to athletes
who had some kind of issues.

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:54.820
So I put my name on the
list, and I got a call

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:56.560
from an athlete who
had tested positive

00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:00.280
for some drug called modafinil,
and-- there were actually

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.460
three or four athletes.

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:04.000
I represented all of them.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.422
And so I settled that case.

00:33:07.422 --> 00:33:09.130
And when you're a
lawyer it's like you're

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:11.588
learning something new all the
time, especially when you're

00:33:11.588 --> 00:33:12.100
litigating.

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:16.430
So I knew, of course, the
whole drug testing routine.

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:20.560
But it wass-- from the
lawyer's perspective

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.800
I kind of enjoyed the process.

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:27.630
But at the end of that first
case one of my clients,

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:28.570
Chryste Gaines--

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:31.600
she was a two-time gold
medalist and ran on the 4

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.750
by 100 meter relay
team with Marion Jones.

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:37.672
You probably see
where this is going.

00:33:37.672 --> 00:33:39.880
She was one of the athletes
who was sort of caught up

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:43.930
in the Balco investigation
in California.

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:47.590
And that ended up being
a 16-month-long sort

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:54.210
of made-new law in the
doping world kind of case.

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:56.060
So I practiced law for 10 years.

00:33:56.060 --> 00:34:01.900
And the spring of my last
year I got a call from NYU

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:04.690
and they asked me to
come speak on a panel

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:05.610
about women in sports.

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:06.420
So I did that.

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.010
I went out to dinner with
the faculty afterward,

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:13.360
and the academic
director at the time

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.730
said, oh, we'd love you
to come teach a class.

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:16.389
Like, right.

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:18.409
In my free time,
practicing law in New York.

00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:18.909
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:20.320
OK.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.739
So actually I left my firm.

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:26.020
I went to Rwanda with Tracy,
and then that summer NYU--

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:26.900
they sent an email.

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:29.920
It was a Monday and
they said, would you

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.989
be interested in teaching
international sports

00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:32.570
governance?

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:34.400
And I thought, well,
I know that world.

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:37.300
It's like the IOC and
National Olympic Committees.

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:38.300
And I said, great.

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:39.400
Yeah, I'd love to.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.659
So I said yes to that.

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:43.239
And then on Friday they
called and they said,

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:44.150
how about sports law?

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:44.860
Can you teach that?

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:46.068
I'm like, well, I don't know.

00:34:46.068 --> 00:34:47.760
What are the topics?

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:51.100
So I looked at this-- it's a
pretty broad survey course,

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:53.830
and a lot of the things,
like IP, I'm like, fine.

00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:55.650
Like, I did that for 10 years.

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:57.460
I can certainly teach that.

00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:01.060
But antitrust and labor
law were on the syllabus

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.070
and I said, OK, just
full disclaimer here,

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:05.770
I don't know anything
about these areas of law,

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:06.549
like, at all.

00:35:06.549 --> 00:35:07.840
And they said, it's no problem.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:08.548
You can learn it.

00:35:08.548 --> 00:35:10.630
And I'm like, OK.

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:13.880
And I think that's something--
like, that's in my nature

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.550
anyway, being a luge athlete.

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:17.791
Like, I'm really not
afraid of anything.

00:35:17.791 --> 00:35:18.790
So I'm like, yeah, sure.

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:19.150
Why not?

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:19.750
I can do that.

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:21.730
So I did.

00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:26.190
The first semester was a
little bit of a learning curve.

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:28.150
International sports
governance was great.

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:31.350
I had terrible reviews
in my sports law class.

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:32.290
Like, I cried.

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:33.360
I'm like, oh god.

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.200
It's awful.

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:35.320
And I said, listen.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.130
Like, I said to the
academic directors,

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:40.650
if you want to get someone else
to teach the class, totally

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:41.230
fine with me.

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:44.280
Like, I don't need
this kind of thing.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:48.570
And he said, go and take
Christmas break and come back,

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:50.709
but I think you should
teach it one more time.

00:35:50.709 --> 00:35:51.500
And I said, oh god.

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:52.500
All right.

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.450
So I came back
and I thought, OK.

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:57.090
And again, I think both
of us, as athletes,

00:35:57.090 --> 00:36:00.300
like, we're very determined and
you don't get to three or four

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.810
Olympic games without
having some sense

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:06.017
of feeling like
you can accomplish

00:36:06.017 --> 00:36:07.100
what you've set out to do.

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:09.000
So I said, OK.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.400
I'll give it another try,
and then it was great.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.440
And so that was seven years ago.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:17.130
I'm on the full-time faculty
in the sports business program,

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:18.426
and I love it.

00:36:18.426 --> 00:36:19.300
MIKE ABRAMS: Awesome.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:20.340
So let's briefly talk--

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:22.380
the Olympics are coming
up in a couple weeks.

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:22.860
CAMERON MYLER: Yes.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:23.760
MIKE ABRAMS: What
advice would you

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.550
give to a first-time athlete
going to their first Olympics?

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:28.230
CAMERON MYLER: Oh, OK.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:29.430
Oh, go ahead.

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:30.800
TRACY EVANS: Oh gosh.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:35.670
I think-- you know,
you're so obviously

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:40.050
focused on just your
sport, and obviously

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:41.860
that's what you
should be focused on,

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:44.020
and competing and all of that.

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:47.520
But I think for me it was
always about also a balance.

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:51.690
I could not-- at least for the
way I worked as an athlete--

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:55.410
I could not 24 hours a
day think about my sport.

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:57.990
It really did me a disservice.

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:01.200
And so I always like
to try to remind people

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.580
to take a little bit of--

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:06.720
do something else that will
take your mind off of it.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:12.004
And that doesn't mean go party
outside before your event

00:37:12.004 --> 00:37:12.920
or anything like that.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:13.860
CAMERON MYLER: We
don't do that anyway.

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:14.010
TRACY EVANS: No, no, no.

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:15.030
Nobody did that.

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:16.380
But anyway--

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:18.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:20.410
But-- or spend too much
time in the cafeteria.

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:21.600
That was the big thing.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.760
Everyone said, do
not spend so much

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:26.100
time in the cafeteria
inside the Olympic village.

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:29.530
Because that was just the
biggest social place ever.

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:33.120
But anyway-- it is--

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:36.000
you really should just be able
to take a little bit of time

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.330
away from your sport.

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:39.300
And so balance your
Olympic experience.

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:44.430
And it's OK to, like I said,
go out and enjoy yourself.

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:46.320
Mostly after your
event, but even

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:50.190
leading up to it, to have
a good balance of, I think,

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:51.630
just mental--

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:54.680
you know, the physical
side of it, at that point,

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:55.890
you're not Russian--

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:58.950
I mean, yes, you're maintaining
whatever you need to do,

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:02.520
but you're not looking to,
like, get a major workout

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.830
in to hope that your
quads are stronger

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:06.550
for a landing at that point.

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:07.890
But it's really a mental--

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:12.030
it's such a mental
point at that.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:14.670
I always say, after the
Olympics people say, like,

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:18.420
gosh how do you feel
after your event's over,

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:19.620
after the Olympics are over?

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:22.230
And I literally
felt like I had held

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:24.640
my breath for about four years.

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.210
And so when you
finally were done,

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:31.830
the exhaustion is
really hard to describe.

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:35.097
But it's like you finally get
to breathe again before you just

00:38:35.097 --> 00:38:36.180
start ramping it up again.

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:37.830
But still, you do.

00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:38.990
It's exhausting.

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:43.260
So my advice is
just to make sure

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:46.530
that you give yourself
a little bit of a break.

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:49.680
CAMERON MYLER: So
I would say to try

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:52.080
not to be distracted
by everything

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.610
that's going on at the games.

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:57.720
Because-- Tracy, I'm
sure, would agree--

00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:01.050
it is such a different
experience than any other race

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:03.000
that you go to.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.090
So if you're on
the World Cup tour

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:08.310
you're there with
only luge athletes,

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:10.500
and everybody goes
from track to track

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:14.610
and you see the same people
at training and in the race.

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:18.180
And in that context with the
team, you stay in a hotel,

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:20.820
you eat all of your meals
together at the same time,

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:23.370
there's a room where
you keep your sleds,

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:24.840
where you can work
on your sleds.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.730
You get your sled, you
go put it in the van,

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:27.720
you drive to the track.

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:30.780
It's pretty-- you know,
it's pretty simple.

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:35.190
At the Olympics it's an
entirely different thing.

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:38.160
So you're staying at
the village with people

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:42.180
from what I last read
for Pyeongchang, there

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:45.840
are 93 countries right now
sending athletes to the games.

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:49.560
So you're in a village with
athletes from dozens and dozens

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:51.540
of countries.

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:56.370
You are not eating necessarily--
where the dining hall is maybe

00:39:56.370 --> 00:40:00.630
not right where you stay, and
where your equipment is stored

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:01.680
is someplace else.

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:05.730
So logistically it's
much more complicated.

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:09.569
And, I mean, there's
so much going on.

00:40:09.569 --> 00:40:10.360
TRACY EVANS: Media.

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.250
You're definitely
being pulled on that.

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:11.880
CAMERON MYLER: Yeah.

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:12.570
Definitely.

00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:15.750
Media requests,
press conferences.

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:18.840
And so there's a lot that
can sort of draw you,

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:24.930
I think, outside of your zone
of focus during the games.

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:27.210
Luge-- I felt like we
were always really lucky

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:30.780
because the race is at the
beginning of the Olympics

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:31.750
every time.

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:33.990
So the opening
ceremonies are on Friday.

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:37.890
Men's singles race on
Saturday and Sunday.

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:40.260
The women are on
Monday and Tuesday.

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:43.150
Doubles on Wednesday,
and then you're done.

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:45.480
So it's like six days
into the games, there

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:48.690
are 11 more days to
go and you can go

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:51.540
and you can go-- so you go
see your teammates compete,

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:53.880
and then you figure
out which sponsors

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.290
are having the best parties.

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:55.790
TRACY EVANS: Yeah.

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:56.020
CAMERON MYLER: Yeah.

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:56.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:57.080
TRACY EVANS: Yeah.

00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:57.820
See, for aerials--

00:40:57.820 --> 00:40:58.820
CAMERON MYLER:
After a competition.

00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:00.000
TRACY EVANS: Yeah.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.390
Moguls was always first and
aerials was always second week.

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:05.430
So we actually, for
Nagano, did not even

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:06.810
show up for opening ceremonies.

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:11.190
We were at a training
camp before we came.

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:15.310
So we came well into the
first week of the games.

00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:16.841
So, yeah.

00:41:16.841 --> 00:41:17.340
Yeah.

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:18.030
And there are.

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:20.670
There's definitely a lot
of distractions, for sure.

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:23.230
I always found it so nice--
like you said-- you know,

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:26.580
when we actually got to
our site it felt like home.

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:29.250
Because you're
obviously-- that's

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:33.090
the familiarity of
your sport being there.

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:34.830
And you're right,
nothing can prepare you

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:37.764
for when you look down--

00:41:37.764 --> 00:41:39.930
well, it's different probably
at the top of a track.

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:42.900
But for us at the
top of a hill, you

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.675
look out and see the entire--

00:41:45.675 --> 00:41:47.100
all the spectators.

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.440
And it's massive.

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.810
Like, we obviously
have had spectators

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:53.620
at World Cups and
world championships.

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:55.470
Nothing was like the first time.

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:57.300
I was like, oh.

00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:57.900
Oh, wow.

00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:58.400
OK.

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.070
Let's not focus on that.

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:00.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:00.830
You know?

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:03.371
Let's just turn around and just
think about what we're doing,

00:42:03.371 --> 00:42:04.550
not everyone down there.

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:07.440
In fact, this is a
very funny story.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:12.270
In 2002 in Deer Valley
where our site was

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:14.550
I was at the top of
the hill just training,

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:17.730
and I could just hear
somebody down at the bottom

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:21.414
really, like, just
annoying, yelling something.

00:42:21.414 --> 00:42:22.830
I was just like,
god, who is that?

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:26.100
Land, ski, do a practice jump,
come down, back up, same thing.

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:27.130
Come down again.

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:29.610
I'm really, like, wow, I
don't know why this is really

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:30.420
irritating me.

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:31.697
It was my family.

00:42:31.697 --> 00:42:32.600
That's why.

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:33.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:33.306
Yeah, yeah.

00:42:33.306 --> 00:42:34.290
It was my family.

00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:35.632
And I was like, oh my gosh.

00:42:35.632 --> 00:42:37.965
I went over, found my phone,
called my brother and said,

00:42:37.965 --> 00:42:40.220
you need to go over there
and tell them to be quiet.

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:43.770
I was like, oh my gosh,
that is really annoying.

00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:47.790
So it's amazing that that--

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:48.895
you heard that, but

00:42:48.895 --> 00:42:49.220
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:49.820
TRACY EVANS: Yes.

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:50.319
Yes.

00:42:50.319 --> 00:42:50.950
Exactly.

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:51.450
So anyway.

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:53.991
MIKE ABRAMS: So do you want to
open up to audience questions?

00:42:53.991 --> 00:42:55.440
There's microphones
on both sides.

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:57.314
CAMERON MYLER: And maybe
we'll just mentioned

00:42:57.314 --> 00:43:00.140
that we're both going to
the Olympics in Pyeongchang.

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:04.560
So I am an arbitrator on the
court of arbitration for sport,

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.440
and I'm one of six
arbitrators who

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:10.720
will decide any doping case
that comes up at the Olympics.

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:13.640
So I'll be over there for
the whole time doing that.

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:14.390
TRACY EVANS: Yeah.

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.640
Yeah.

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:15.810
CAMERON MYLER: I think
all of the Russian cases

00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:17.362
will be taken care of by then.

00:43:17.362 --> 00:43:18.237
TRACY EVANS: [LAUGHS]

00:43:18.237 --> 00:43:20.070
CAMERON MYLER: And
Tracy's going to be there

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:21.220
as well, getting an award.

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:23.474
TRACY EVANS: Well, yeah.

00:43:23.474 --> 00:43:25.640
MIKE ABRAMS: So I have a
fun question while people--

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.170
if people want to
start lining up.

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:31.100
My fun question is, what
is the craziest, wildest,

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:34.790
family-friendly story of things
you saw during the Olympic

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:35.330
village--

00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:36.640
in the Olympics village?

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:37.723
TRACY EVANS: Oh, goodness.

00:43:37.723 --> 00:43:38.435
Family-friendly?

00:43:38.435 --> 00:43:39.650
Hm.

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:40.400
Wow.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.760
Goodness.

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:43.610
Hm.

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:44.567
Well--

00:43:44.567 --> 00:43:46.400
CAMERON MYLER: I don't
know that I have any.

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:47.080
TRACY EVANS: Yeah?

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:47.579
Yeah.

00:43:50.394 --> 00:43:51.560
CAMERON MYLER: I'm a lawyer.

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:52.535
I have no stories.

00:43:52.535 --> 00:43:53.910
TRACY EVANS: You
have no stories.

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:54.960
Yeah, exactly.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:55.460
No.

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:56.915
You know, I think just with--

00:43:56.915 --> 00:43:59.890
the Olympic village really--
it has everything and anything.

00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:01.910
If you wanted to go
get your hair done,

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:04.210
go get your nails done.

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:10.220
You know, they had
a disco, a bar--

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:11.690
there was no alcohol in sight.

00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:12.380
CAMERON MYLER: OK,
I do have a story.

00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:12.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:13.547
TRACY EVANS: OK.

00:44:13.547 --> 00:44:14.879
CAMERON MYLER: Speaking of bars.

00:44:14.879 --> 00:44:15.800
TRACY EVANS: Yeah.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.300
There was no alcohol
on campus, was there?

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:18.610
CAMERON MYLER: Well,
you finish your story.

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:19.620
TRACY EVANS: Yeah, OK.

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:20.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:24.620
Anyway, yeah.

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:25.730
I don't know.

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:29.300
It was just very much
an all-inclusive.

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:33.197
But it was just a very
unique all-inclusiveness--

00:44:33.197 --> 00:44:34.280
CAMERON MYLER: Experience.

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:35.280
TRACY EVANS: Experience.

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.080
Yes.

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:39.110
CAMERON MYLER: So
in 1992 the Olympics

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:42.980
were in France in Albertville,
and the main village

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:45.590
was in the city of Albertville.

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:48.140
But none of the venues
were very close to town,

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:51.950
so you had to drive basically
two hours to any venue,

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:55.004
and you'd have to drive down a
valley and then up a mountain.

00:44:55.004 --> 00:44:56.420
And then to get
to any other venue

00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:59.090
you'd have to go back
down the mountain, back

00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:00.920
down the valley to
Albertville and then out

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:01.970
in some other direction.

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:05.150
So at that games we--

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:07.310
the luge athletes
and bobsled athletes

00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:11.150
were together in a sort
of separate "village,"

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:14.480
and it was a Club
Med in La Plagne

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.359
and there was beer and wine.

00:45:16.359 --> 00:45:17.400
TRACY EVANS: Oh goodness.

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:18.310
CAMERON MYLER: Like, on tap.

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:19.726
Well, it was--
they were treated--

00:45:19.726 --> 00:45:23.690
it was like the sort of Club Med
practices were still going on.

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:27.050
So they'd drive around
with the cheese carts.

00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:29.120
And I think after maybe,
like, the first five

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:31.220
days of the games
maybe we drank, like,

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:34.000
all of the wine and beer and ate
all of the cheese or something.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.090
But they're like, OK, maybe we
need to cut all of that off.

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:37.840
TRACY EVANS: Yeah.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:38.339
Yeah.

00:45:38.339 --> 00:45:39.050
Exactly.

00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:41.290
MIKE ABRAMS: We have
an audience question.

00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:43.130
AUDIENCE: Thanks
so much for coming.

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:45.520
I'm curious, just given
how intense the training

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:49.330
is between games, how
athletes support themselves,

00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:53.777
sort of year to year to year, as
their careers sort of stretch.

00:45:53.777 --> 00:45:54.610
CAMERON MYLER: Yeah.

00:45:54.610 --> 00:45:55.630
Great question.

00:45:55.630 --> 00:46:00.250
So I was on the national
team for 14 years.

00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:04.280
And luge had, and
still has, some--

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.140
there's like a race
incentive program.

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:10.470
So you can, depending on where
you finish in World Cup races,

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:14.760
win money that comes from
the US luge association.

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.140
So I did well enough that--

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:20.050
I got enough money that I
supported myself through that.

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:22.340
And there were also
grants available,

00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:24.900
like through the US
Olympic Committee.

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:28.120
So I feel like I was fairly
fortunate in that respect,

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:30.730
that I didn't have
to work that much.

00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:34.840
I did some at school, but
otherwise I didn't really

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:37.060
have that really big
challenge, I think,

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:41.410
of sort of balancing work and
training at the same time.

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:44.020
So I think some athletes
sort of survive that way.

00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:46.390
Some have sponsorships
that help support them.

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:47.860
And then others, I think--

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:50.570
I think it can be a really big
challenge to support yourself.

00:46:50.570 --> 00:46:51.320
TRACY EVANS: Yeah.

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:52.430
Absolutely.

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:52.930
Yeah.

00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:53.230
Yeah.

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:53.840
Same here.

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:57.320
I mean, we would have ski
sponsors, boot sponsors,

00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:58.330
had gear sponsors.

00:46:58.330 --> 00:47:00.700
So you would set up a
retainer with your sponsor,

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:02.380
and then a victory
schedule depending

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:04.439
on how well you did
throughout the year,

00:47:04.439 --> 00:47:05.980
or if you made the
world championship

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:09.640
team you get a bonus for that,
or obviously an Olympic team,

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:10.700
and all of that.

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:14.170
And also for us the way-- you
were on A team, B team, C team,

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:17.060
so you would get some funding
from your federation as well,

00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:22.730
cover flight and travel and
training expenses, basically.

00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:26.230
But having said that-- exactly.

00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:28.810
What's really difficult,
I think, in general

00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:32.020
with sport is when you're trying
to come up through the ranks.

00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:34.930
It's such a double-edged sword
because you can't get sponsors

00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:35.710
without results.

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:37.626
Well, you can't get
results until you actually

00:47:37.626 --> 00:47:38.680
start competing.

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:42.100
And so it is so
difficult, I think,

00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:47.320
for upcoming athletes to be able
to-- unless you have parents

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:48.680
that can finance it--

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:49.210
you do.

00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:50.740
You have to get a second job.

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:54.137
Eric Bergoust, gold medalist
in 1998, lived out of his car,

00:47:54.137 --> 00:47:55.720
ate peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches

00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.000
for I-don't-know-how-many
summers and years.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000
I mean that-- you
just wanted to do it.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.240
One good thing is, the
Olympic training centers now--

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:06.520
you know, Lake Placid
and Colorado Springs,

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:07.750
depending on your sport--

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:10.660
you can go there and
live and have that.

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:12.970
But again, you have to also
have worked your way up

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:14.450
to a certain point.

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:16.180
So it's difficult. Yeah.

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:18.310
It's not always an easy--

00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:21.520
unfortunately you probably lose
some really incredible talent

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:23.600
just due to lack of support.

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.720
CAMERON MYLER: And I
think in Olympic sport

00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:28.990
most athletes don't
have really big sponsors

00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:31.122
or a ton of financial support.

00:48:31.122 --> 00:48:32.830
So, like, the Michael
Phelps of the world

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:35.620
are very few and far
between in Olympic sports.

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:37.950
So most of us do it
because we love it.

00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:38.950
TRACY EVANS: We love it.

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:39.450
Yeah.

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:41.440
The shelf life of
even a gold medalist

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.900
these days is so
short, especially now

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:46.010
with the Olympics
being every two years.

00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:49.060
So as soon as the winter
games are over, boom,

00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:52.900
you've got maybe a month
to kind of really--

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:56.860
if you want a medal and
do everything with media

00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:59.770
that you can, try to
reap those benefits.

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:02.590
But then sponsors are
looking at the next Olympics

00:49:02.590 --> 00:49:04.300
already right after that.

00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:06.940
So again, there's
clearly exceptions

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:10.604
to those rules for sure, but
the majority of Olympians--

00:49:10.604 --> 00:49:11.770
you got to love what you do.

00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:12.940
You got to love the sport.

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:14.235
You got to love it.

00:49:14.235 --> 00:49:16.360
You're not going to-- even
if you are a gold medal,

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:19.525
does not mean you
are set for life.

00:49:19.525 --> 00:49:21.600
MIKE ABRAMS: Do you have
an audience question?

00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:22.141
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:49:22.141 --> 00:49:23.115
I have two questions.

00:49:23.115 --> 00:49:25.240
The first is actually
related to what you were just

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.323
talking about with this
shift from being every two

00:49:27.323 --> 00:49:29.290
years as winter and
summer versus when

00:49:29.290 --> 00:49:32.500
they were concurrent, like,
how you saw things change.

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:35.620
And the other is, can
you talk about your day

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:37.081
to day or, like, a week--

00:49:37.081 --> 00:49:38.830
what would a week look
like with training?

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:40.480
And how did your
training groups change

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:43.730
as you went from one
Olympics to the next?

00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:47.880
CAMERON MYLER: So I kind of
went through the transition

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:51.660
from when the summer and winter
games were in the same year

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:54.330
to being staggered every two.

00:49:54.330 --> 00:49:58.890
So 1992 was the last year
that summer and winter

00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:02.550
were in the same year, and
then winter was again in '94.

00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:05.100
So normally-- which,
it sounds great.

00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:07.400
Like, I had four
Olympics in 10 years.

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:10.350
But actually it was a
really quick turnaround,

00:50:10.350 --> 00:50:13.020
because normally
after a games you've

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:15.270
kind of got a year
where you might

00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:17.190
experiment with your
equipment and try

00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:19.740
a new sled or some
different things that,

00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:22.225
because you've got some time
leading up to the next games.

00:50:22.225 --> 00:50:23.100
TRACY EVANS: Recover.

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:24.808
CAMERON MYLER: But
after '92 it was like,

00:50:24.808 --> 00:50:27.570
OK, we're actually-- that next
season you were qualifying

00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:29.670
for the Olympics again already.

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:31.740
So I think though that--

00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:33.660
for winter sports
particularly I think

00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:36.330
it's good that the
games are every two

00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:40.470
years because the
media can focus on--

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:45.540
give as much attention,
almost, to winter as to summer.

00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:51.010
So I think that in
general it's positive.

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:55.680
And on the training front--

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:58.090
so it's different sort of in
the winter and the summer,

00:50:58.090 --> 00:50:59.730
sort of in season
and out of season.

00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:05.040
But in season usually we would
be at a track for no longer

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:06.240
than a week.

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:08.530
So if you're in the
World Cup season,

00:51:08.530 --> 00:51:12.150
the race ends on Sunday, you
pack up all of your stuff.

00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:15.970
And luge-- like, the
equipment is heavy.

00:51:15.970 --> 00:51:19.380
And one time we
were in the airport

00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:21.600
and there was a
scale in the floor

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:23.786
and we actually put
all of the stuff on.

00:51:23.786 --> 00:51:25.410
So we had to weigh
it, and always we're

00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:28.050
paying extra baggage fees.

00:51:28.050 --> 00:51:31.680
And we literally had
a ton of equipment.

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:35.700
So you had to pack that up
every Sunday into the cargo van,

00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:37.770
and then you drive
to the next place.

00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:39.810
So usually then Monday,
like, afternoon you'd

00:51:39.810 --> 00:51:40.680
be on the track.

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:42.590
You'd train twice
a day on the track,

00:51:42.590 --> 00:51:47.430
get a physical workout in, work
on your sled, take a nap, eat.

00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:50.880
So you're pretty
much in a routine.

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:52.890
Summertime you might be--

00:51:52.890 --> 00:51:55.980
I was at Dartmouth a lot of
the time, or in Lake Placid,

00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:58.530
and that's more,
like, in the gym

00:51:58.530 --> 00:52:01.560
doing start practice and
more physical training.

00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:02.310
TRACY EVANS: Yeah.

00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:04.110
Yeah.

00:52:04.110 --> 00:52:04.610
Yeah.

00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:07.890
So my first Olympics was '94,
and my first year on the team

00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:08.710
was '91.

00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:13.620
So your having been in Olympics
and then have to turn around--

00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:14.980
I did not experience that.

00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:17.580
But I was actually very
happy when I got on the team

00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:19.650
that the Olympics were
coming again in two years.

00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:21.340
So for me--

00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:22.220
Yeah.

00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:23.500
And I agree.

00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:26.760
I think it's good
for winter Olympics

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:31.650
to be its own year,
so to speak, because I

00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:35.790
do think that when they were
concurrent that summer always

00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:37.770
kind of overshadowed winter.

00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:42.840
So anyway, I think
that it's a good thing.

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:43.840
So training-- yes.

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:44.340
Gosh.

00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:47.850
For training for aerials,
our summer time training

00:52:47.850 --> 00:52:50.730
is definitely far
more intense than it

00:52:50.730 --> 00:52:52.320
is when we're on the road.

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:54.450
Once you're on the road
and competing week to week

00:52:54.450 --> 00:53:00.170
it's more of a maintenance-type
of mentality, so to speak.

00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:03.520
But our summer training
definitely was pretty intense.

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:06.650
We would get up and have a
couple hours on the trampoline.

00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:09.660
We'd do a couple
hours water ramping.

00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:10.410
We'd have lunch.

00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:12.600
We'd go to the gym for
another couple hours,

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:15.510
and sometimes even a trampoline
session at night time.

00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:17.880
So it kind of--

00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:19.230
inside the gym, so to speak.

00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:21.720
But, so-- yeah.

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:25.710
And you were just really trying
to-- you would definitely--

00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:28.980
I think it depends on where
you are in your career.

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:30.984
Obviously if you're
just starting off

00:53:30.984 --> 00:53:32.400
and you're a rookie,
you're really

00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:35.370
trying to do a lot more jumps
and qualifying a lot of jumps.

00:53:35.370 --> 00:53:38.040
As you're becoming more
of a veteran on the team

00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:40.860
you're trying to have a
different type of training.

00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:44.190
It's quality over
quantity, basically.

00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:48.210
So that's kind of how it
worked in the summertime.

00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:51.000
Everyone kind of had more
of an individualized plan

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:55.910
depending on what you were
doing with your jumps.

00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:58.920
But then the winter, pretty
much what Cameron said.

00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:01.320
I mean, it's week
to week traveling.

00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:05.250
You'd get into a site on Monday,
you would work on the jumps,

00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:07.829
you would hopefully at least
have one day of training

00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:08.370
on the jumps.

00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:10.470
Sometimes with weather
you didn't even

00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:12.900
get to train on the jump
until the day you competed,

00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:14.310
which was never fun.

00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:16.770
But usually you have at least
one or two days of training,

00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:20.299
you'd compete, pack up,
move on to the next place.

00:54:20.299 --> 00:54:21.840
CAMERON MYLER: And
probably one thing

00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:25.100
I would add to this for
both of us would be,

00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:28.050
maybe later in your career you
might spend some time in sports

00:54:28.050 --> 00:54:32.535
medicine doing some rehab
on your various joints.

00:54:32.535 --> 00:54:33.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:36.180
I had four knee surgeries
and one on each shoulder,

00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:41.100
so it definitely takes
a toll on the body.

00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:43.350
TRACY EVANS: For a skier I
actually have both my ACLs,

00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:44.610
which is very rare.

00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:45.780
So I've been--

00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:48.483
I feel like I got out of
the sport pretty unscathed.

00:54:48.483 --> 00:54:50.865
Eh, you know, I definitely
have some things, but--

00:54:50.865 --> 00:54:52.550
MIKE ABRAMS: Well,
Tracy, Cameron,

00:54:52.550 --> 00:54:53.680
thank you for being here.

00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:54.180
CAMERON MYLER:
Thank you so much.

00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:55.930
MIKE ABRAMS: Thanks,
everyone, for coming.

00:54:55.930 --> 00:54:56.956
And that's it.

00:54:56.956 --> 00:54:57.830
TRACY EVANS: Awesome.

00:54:57.830 --> 00:54:58.230
Thanks everybody.

00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:59.146
CAMERON MYLER: Thanks.

00:54:59.146 --> 00:55:01.580
