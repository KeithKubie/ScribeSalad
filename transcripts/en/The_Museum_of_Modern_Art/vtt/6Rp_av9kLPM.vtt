00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:11.656
- The performance for me makes sense

00:00:11.656 --> 00:00:13.142
if it's live.

00:00:13.142 --> 00:00:15.974
And doesn't make so much
sense if it's documentation.

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:18.087
Everything else would left over,

00:00:18.087 --> 00:00:20.804
like photograph or video,
not the real thing.

00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:23.080
The real thing the audience
have to be in the place

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.100
what happen and to see that.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.630
So maybe the most
documentation, which is valuable

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.442
would be the memory of the audience

00:00:29.442 --> 00:00:33.305
and the actual story which they
will tell to somebody else.

00:00:33.305 --> 00:00:36.686
And somehow all the artists
in the '70s left just

00:00:36.686 --> 00:00:39.281
documentation and not
any kind of (mumbles)

00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:41.362
and how this actually can turn

00:00:41.362 --> 00:00:43.289
into the kind of live process.

00:00:44.135 --> 00:00:45.926
Because some artists
absolutely don't want to be

00:00:45.926 --> 00:00:48.637
re-perform the pieces
because they felt that they

00:00:48.637 --> 00:00:52.291
done it in such a beautiful
time that doesn't work later on.

00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:55.411
Another artist and critics
will think that if there

00:00:55.411 --> 00:00:58.165
somebody else re-perform the
piece, actually is not anymore

00:00:58.165 --> 00:01:00.185
the piece of the artist idea.

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:01.393
It would be a new piece because

00:01:01.393 --> 00:01:05.479
he add his own personality inside.

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.080
But I really think that
it's very important

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.028
to re-perform the pieces
even with all this danger

00:01:11.028 --> 00:01:12.840
that becomes somebody else piece.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.672
But still you have to refer
to the original source

00:01:15.672 --> 00:01:17.367
and you can make your own version.

00:01:17.367 --> 00:01:20.989
If today you can re-perform
Bach, and make techno Bach

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:24.170
out of this, why you can't
re-perform the performance?

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:28.720
The only way that reformists
of this live element inside.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.299
So I have to live like that

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.853
because otherwise it's
just dead photograph

00:01:33.683 --> 00:01:37.630
on the paper or just another video.
