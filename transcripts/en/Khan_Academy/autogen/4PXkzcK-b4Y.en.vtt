00:00:00.135 --> 00:00:01.772
 In this video I want to solve a few examples by looking at it 

00:00:01.772 --> 00:00:04.615
 its distribution and its various characteristics, 

00:00:04.615 --> 00:00:08.489
 such as crowds, gaps and peaks. 

00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:10.549
 Here I want to solve some examples. 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:12.699
 Which of the following are true descriptions? 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:14.550
 of the distribution below? 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.787
 Choose all the correct answers. 

00:00:16.787 --> 00:00:20.060
 The first statement states that the distribution has a distant point. 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.163
 A distant point is a data point that is a long distance 

00:00:23.163 --> 00:00:24.930
 from where other data points are located. 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.077
 It has a greater or lesser value and is at a distance 

00:00:27.077 --> 00:00:28.619
 from where they are clustered 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.109
 all other data points, and if we look at it here, 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.448
 we have many points with data between 0 and 6. 

00:00:34.448 --> 00:00:35.842
 Let's just think what they measure: 

00:00:35.842 --> 00:00:38.411
 this is the shelf life of each apple 

00:00:38.411 --> 00:00:41.921
 in the store of Gorg. 

00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:45.183
 For example, we see that there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 

00:00:45.183 --> 00:00:49.667
 5, 6, 7 apples that have a shelf life 

00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:52.877
 0 days, so (laughter) they will spoil. 

00:00:52.877 --> 00:00:56.709
 You see that you have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:59.299
 8 apples that will be fit for another day. 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:00.987
 You have 2 apples that will be fit 

00:01:00.987 --> 00:01:03.968
 another 6 days and you have an apple, 

00:01:03.968 --> 00:01:06.020
 which will be ready for another 10 days, and this is unusual. 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.127
 This is a remote point, it has a much higher score of fitness 

00:01:10.127 --> 00:01:12.339
 of all other data, so I would say, 

00:01:12.339 --> 00:01:14.076
 that we definitely have a remote point here. 

00:01:14.076 --> 00:01:15.445
 We only have this data point, 

00:01:15.445 --> 00:01:18.147
 which is so far to the right, much larger, 

00:01:18.147 --> 00:01:20.633
 with a much longer shelf life than anything else, so the distribution definitely 

00:01:20.633 --> 00:01:23.874
 there is a remote point and this will be the point. 

00:01:23.874 --> 00:01:26.772
 Distribution is crowded in 4 to 6 days. 

00:01:26.772 --> 00:01:29.767
 We really see crowding in 4 to 6 days. 

00:01:29.767 --> 00:01:33.392
 The clustering, as you can imagine, is the grouping of data, 

00:01:33.392 --> 00:01:35.780
 who are there or have apple groupings, 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.857
 which have a shelf life between 4 and 6 days, 

00:01:37.857 --> 00:01:40.478
 as you see that cluster there. 

00:01:40.478 --> 00:01:42.040
 Since I have already chosen two things, 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.671
 I definitely will not choose "None of the above". 

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:45.963
 I will check my answer. 

00:01:45.963 --> 00:01:50.413
 Let's solve some of these tasks. 

00:01:50.413 --> 00:01:52.805
 Which of the following are true descriptions? 

00:01:52.805 --> 00:01:54.336
 of the distribution below? 

00:01:54.336 --> 00:01:57.458
 We will choose all who are faithful. 

00:01:57.458 --> 00:02:00.163
 The distribution has a distant point. 

00:02:00.163 --> 00:02:02.103
 Let's look at this distribution. 

00:02:02.103 --> 00:02:04.281
 I really have one point here that is finally 

00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:06.608
 and I have one more here, which is at the beginning, 

00:02:06.608 --> 00:02:08.697
 but I do not have any data points that are located 

00:02:08.697 --> 00:02:12.254
 at a great distance above or below all data. 

00:02:12.254 --> 00:02:14.258
 If I had a data point you are here, then yes, 

00:02:14.258 --> 00:02:16.417
 I would say she is far to the right 

00:02:16.417 --> 00:02:19.355
 or away from others if I had a point far left 

00:02:19.355 --> 00:02:21.507
 on the screen here, maybe it would be a distant point. 

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:23.459
 But I really do not see any obvious distant point. 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.450
 All the data is quite crowded in one place. 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.676
 So I would not say that the distribution has a distant point. 

00:02:30.676 --> 00:02:34.728
 The distribution has a peak at 22 degrees. 

00:02:34.728 --> 00:02:36.745
 Yes, it really seems like there is - 

00:02:36.745 --> 00:02:38.199
 let's just look at what we actually measure. 

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:42.619
 The height of the temperature every day in Eugarton, Iowa in July. 

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:44.996
 It really seems that we have the largest number 

00:02:44.996 --> 00:02:49.060
 days in July that they had 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.925
 temperature 22 degrees Celsius, 

00:02:51.925 --> 00:02:55.853
 so it's a peak. 

00:02:55.853 --> 00:02:57.710
 Imagine it was like a mountain, 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.488
 this is the tip, the highest point. 

00:02:59.488 --> 00:03:03.856
 You have, at least in this place, the greatest number of days 

00:03:03.856 --> 00:03:06.748
 with 22 degrees Celsius. 

00:03:06.748 --> 00:03:08.862
 So I would say we definitely have a peak there. 

00:03:08.862 --> 00:03:10.746
 Since I chose something, I will not choose 

00:03:10.746 --> 00:03:12.066
 None of the above. 

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:14.486
 Let's solve some of these tasks. 

00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:16.308
 Which of the following are true descriptions? 

00:03:16.308 --> 00:03:17.827
 of the distribution below? 

00:03:17.827 --> 00:03:20.629
 The first is that the distribution has a distant point. 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:21.244
 So, the number of visitors per day 

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:26.004
 in Seth's sandwich shop. 

00:03:26.004 --> 00:03:28.594
 Let's see, at least ... 

00:03:29.514 --> 00:03:31.884
 There are no days ... 

00:03:31.884 --> 00:03:36.074
 There are no days in which he had between 0 and 19 visitors, 

00:03:36.074 --> 00:03:38.888
 no days in which he had between 20 and 39 visitors, 

00:03:38.888 --> 00:03:40.343
 it looks like there are about 9 days, 

00:03:40.343 --> 00:03:42.417
 in which he had between 40 and 59 visitors, 

00:03:42.417 --> 00:03:45.625
 it looks like about 20 days between 60 and 79 visitors. 

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:48.011
 It's up to where - it looks like maybe 8 days - 

00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:51.441
 had between 180 and 199 visitors. 

00:03:51.441 --> 00:03:54.402
 But the question of remote points - does not seem to exist 

00:03:54.402 --> 00:03:57.833
 some day when he had an unusual number of visitors. 

00:03:57.833 --> 00:03:59.774
 There is no day to be here, 

00:03:59.774 --> 00:04:02.061
 in which, for example, there were 500 visitors. 

00:04:02.061 --> 00:04:05.713
 So I would say that the distribution has no remote points. 

00:04:05.713 --> 00:04:09.272
 The distribution has a crowd of 0 to 39 visitors. 

00:04:09.272 --> 00:04:13.557
 So, from 0 to 39 visitors are right here. 

00:04:13.557 --> 00:04:16.958
 There were no days in which he had between 0 and 39 visitors, 

00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.730
 neither from 0 to 10 nor from 20 to 39. 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.063
 So we definitely do not have a crowd there. 

00:04:21.063 --> 00:04:23.743
 I would say that the crowding will be between the days, 

00:04:23.743 --> 00:04:27.851
 which are between 40 and 199 visitors. 

00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:30.029
 Definitely not at 0 and 30, there were no days, 

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:32.469
 which have from 0 to 39 visitors. 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.903
 So I would say quite confidently - None of the above. 

00:04:35.903 --> 00:04:37.875
 Let's solve one more of these tasks. 

00:04:37.875 --> 00:04:39.550
 Which of the following are true descriptions? 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.053
 of the distribution below? 

00:04:41.053 --> 00:04:42.224
 (laughter) Okay. 

00:04:42.224 --> 00:04:45.905
 The distribution has a peak of 12 to 13 points. 

00:04:45.905 --> 00:04:50.650
 Let's see what is measured here for what this data is about. 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.950
 Results of each student's test in Mrs. Freen's class. 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.484
 There was 1 student who received between 0 and 1 

00:04:58.484 --> 00:05:01.049
 20-point scale, so we have a ... 

00:05:01.049 --> 00:05:04.926
 I suppose that out of 20 questions, he got between 0 and 1 point. 

00:05:04.926 --> 00:05:07.278
 And then you see there are no students, 

00:05:07.278 --> 00:05:09.932
 who received between 2 and 3 or 4 and 5 or 6 and 7 points. 

00:05:09.932 --> 00:05:12.142
 Then we have another student who has received between 8 and 9, 

00:05:12.142 --> 00:05:14.560
 it seems that 3 students received between 10 and 11, 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.435
 and then continue to grow. It looks like around 

00:05:16.435 --> 00:05:20.600
 12 students received 16 or 17, 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.748
 or something between them maybe, 

00:05:21.748 --> 00:05:25.303
 if you can get a fractional expression for the exam points. 

00:05:25.303 --> 00:05:29.316
 And then it seems that 10 students have received from 18 to 19. 

00:05:29.316 --> 00:05:31.877
 Well, here it says that the distribution has a peak 

00:05:31.877 --> 00:05:35.986
 from 12 to 13 points. 

00:05:35.986 --> 00:05:37.952
 There were 5 students there, but that's not the tip. 

00:05:37.952 --> 00:05:40.591
 If you move to 14-15 points, you already have more students there. 

00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:41.611
 So that's definitely not a peak. 

00:05:41.611 --> 00:05:43.833
 If you look at this as some type of mountain, 

00:05:43.833 --> 00:05:46.078
 you would definitely not describe this point as a peak. 

00:05:46.078 --> 00:05:48.165
 You would say that the distribution has a peak, 

00:05:48.165 --> 00:05:49.462
 there are the largest number of students, 

00:05:49.462 --> 00:05:51.327
 who received between 16 and 17 points, 

00:05:51.327 --> 00:05:54.414
 so that's where the top is, not 12 to 13 points. 

00:05:54.414 --> 00:05:57.137
 So I will not choose the first answer. 

00:05:57.137 --> 00:05:59.614
 The distribution has a distant point. 

00:05:59.614 --> 00:06:01.480
 Well yes, look at this. You have this remote point. 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.411
 Most students received between 8 and 19 points, 

00:06:05.411 --> 00:06:07.104
 and then you have this one disciple, 

00:06:07.104 --> 00:06:09.338
 which has received from 0 to 1, this really is a remote point. 

00:06:09.338 --> 00:06:11.293
 You even see it clearly, 

00:06:11.293 --> 00:06:13.669
 it is not even related to the rest of the distribution. 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:15.130
 It is far left. 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.464
 If something is far left or far to the right, 

00:06:17.464 --> 00:06:21.655
 it is a distant point if it is unusually low or unusually high. 

00:06:21.655 --> 00:06:23.733
 I would say that this distribution definitely 

00:06:23.733 --> 00:06:26.207
 there is a remote point and I will not choose "None of the above" 

00:06:26.207 --> 00:06:27.905
 since I found an answer. 

00:06:29.135 --> 00:06:30.761
 I think we're done.
