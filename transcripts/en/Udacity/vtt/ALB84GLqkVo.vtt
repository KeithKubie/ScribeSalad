Just a few lines of code. Create a new XMLHttpRequest object like before. We

00:00:04.973 --> 00:00:09.847
call request.open again, pretty much the same except that we've changed

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:15.747
weapon.jsan to bgmenu.ogg, and we set request.responseType to be arraybuffer.

00:00:15.972 --> 00:00:21.936
And if we fire this up in our browser, we see that we do make that request, and

00:00:21.948 --> 00:00:24.219
it starts playing our sound file.
