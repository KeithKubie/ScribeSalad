1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,920
What in the fuck is that $5,000 a pound?
Japan's King of tuna.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,060
Is that racist? Is that racist? Uh,

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,040
the way I said it, it seemed racist.
Uh, the first tune auction of the year,

4
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:18,690
a Tokyo's new fish market set a record
price more than 3 million for a giant

5
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:22,110
Bluefin tuna, a critically
endangered species. Wow. Yeah.

6
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:26,340
See that's where you gotta go, man. Is
he critically endangered? And if it's,

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:30,090
if it is, so should you really
be cutting that fucker up?

8
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,700
I don't know about that. When I
was in Hawaii, uh, we caught some,

9
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:40,170
uh, yellowtail my youngest daughter loves
fishing, so went out with her and we, uh,

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,420
went on this boat and we
were actually jigging.

11
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,370
There's like this shelf in this big drop
off in these yellow tails hanging out

12
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:49,200
there.
And we caught a gang of them.

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,500
And one of the things they were saying
was that the big island had a farm where

14
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:59,070
they were farming yellowtail.
Like they had this gigantic,

15
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,060
like sort of netted in area where the
fish couldn't leave and they were,

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,920
they were trapped in this area.

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,040
But then the storm came and broke down
all the nets and the fish escaped and now

18
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,360
they're everywhere and you're
catching them. We caught like, oh,

19
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,970
I'm like six or seven of them and they're
fucking pig like 10 pounds and you're

20
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:20,520
fighting them on like a light,
a spinning rods,

21
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:26,220
like really awesome, awesome time.
But they were unbelievably delicious,

22
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,690
but these are non native.

23
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:29,370
They brought him over there
and released him and I'm like,

24
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:31,900
they've been our start doing
that with other fish right there.

25
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,670
Really should set up these fish farms
and just released these motherfuckers out

26
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:39,090
into the ocean because they're just
taking nets and pulling them across the

27
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:39,620
bottom of the [inaudible]

28
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,110
Lauren even,
it's like such a,

29
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,530
there's something to be said about
going out and catching the fish,

30
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,423
like you're saying,

31
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:51,340
rather than taking a net and just scooping
everything up in its path. Everything.

32
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:51,460
Yeah,

33
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,820
turtles, dolphins, whatever the fuck
is there. Everything gets jacked.

34
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,980
And the problem is, you know, there's,

35
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,110
who knows how many countries have boats
that are doing that and they're all

36
00:02:02,111 --> 00:02:05,770
operating in international water. And
I don't know what the fucking laws are,

37
00:02:05,771 --> 00:02:07,530
but they're just pull in what any,

38
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,390
you know the other thing they do
that's fucked up when they're done.

39
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:14,260
A lot of times they cut the, the net
loose and they just leave it in the ocean.

40
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,870
They just dropped the net
to the bottom of the ocean.

41
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,680
It's funny they have the
regulations for like hunting. Yeah.

42
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,700
They don't have it like in the ocean,
you know it's because nobody owns it.

43
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,640
You only own like a certain,

44
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,640
I'm out of your shore.

45
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,150
Like I'll off like say from Malibu out.

46
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,270
I don't know how much they
the United States owns,

47
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,990
but we only own a certain amount and
then it becomes international waters,

48
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,580
international waters. It's like kind of
anybody could be out there. It's weird.

49
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,800
I mean it makes sense but there's no,
I don't think there's any,

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,430
I think if you have a boat you
can just kind of go anywhere.

51
00:02:52,431 --> 00:02:55,340
That's international water, just
no regulations here. What is,

52
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,770
what parts of the ocean are
considered international water?

53
00:02:57,771 --> 00:03:02,771
Territorial waters or seas defined by
a 1982 United Nations convention on the

54
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:04,810
Law of the sea.

55
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,200
It's a belt of coastal waters extending
at most 12 nautical miles from the

56
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:14,680
baseline. Usually the mean low
water mark of the coastal state.

57
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:16,930
So 12 miles or 12 miles out,

58
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,080
or a 13.8 miles nautical miles.
Nautical miles is different. Huh? Hm.

59
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,530
Interesting.
Why is it different or weird?

60
00:03:25,531 --> 00:03:29,150
Is that nautical miles is different than
regular miles? The fuck get it together.

61
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,440
Yeah. Don't call it a mile then
he fucks. Imagine, hey buddy,

62
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:33,940
I'll meet you at 12 miles.
All right.

63
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:37,870
12 nautical miles and the guys
at mile on a 0.8 away from you.

64
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,530
Although stores use the
label Sushi grade fish,

65
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:43,840
there is no official standards
for using this label.

66
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,930
The only regulation is that
parasitic fish such as salmon,

67
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,320
should be frozen to kill any
parasites for being consumed raw.

68
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:52,600
The best ones are assigned grade one,

69
00:03:52,601 --> 00:03:54,700
which is usually what
be sold as Sushi grade.

70
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,880
But what about Sashimi grade is
when he said it's the same thing.

71
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,700
So I looked up and that's what popped up.
Yeah.

72
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,480
You're not supposed to eat salmon raw.

73
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,710
Apparently salmon is a freshwater
fish and salmon. It can fuck you up,

74
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,250
but you could pull a tune out of
the right out of the ocean. Yeah.

75
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:12,040
I have a buddy of mine who when
a tuna fishing off of San Diego,

76
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:15,430
they call it a tuna and they sliced it
up and ate it right there on the boat.

77
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,560
Like right as they read after
they pulled it out of the water.

78
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,330
That I haven't done, but uh, that,

79
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,740
that to me would be the bus eating
right out of the water. I mean,

80
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,700
I just hope they don't wait until there's
nothing left before they start doing

81
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:31,420
something to save them. It just doesn't,
it doesn't seem like the, I mean,

82
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:35,050
if you're taking us fish and
you're buying it for $3 million,

83
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,870
that's almost like a scene in the
movie. Right. That's like the end.

84
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,930
This was one of the last tune I looked.
They bought it for 3 million.

85
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:42,910
Everybody's smiling and
they're cutting it up.

86
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:47,230
It's like hunting regulations
are critical, but you could,

87
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,130
you know what the population
is. It's very, they, they do.

88
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,710
The fish and wildlife departments have
all these different methods they use,

89
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:58,260
whether it's, I'm using reports from
Hunter's, whether it's uh, they,

90
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,260
they fly over with airplanes and
helicopters and things along those lines.

91
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,790
Whatever they use.

92
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,610
They have a bunch of different ways that
they can determine what the population

93
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:08,980
is. Then they had determined
the population of predators,

94
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,660
how many animals are lost,

95
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:13,660
how many animals are our shot
during any hunting season.

96
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,300
And then they determine how
many tags can be divvied out.

97
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,960
So like say if you live in an area,
um,

98
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,750
there might be a 500 tags available,

99
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,900
but there might be like 2000 hunters
that are applying for those tags.

100
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,370
So most people are not going
to get it. It's a, it's a,

101
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,700
a very smart way. They've really got
it down to a science because of that.

102
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,160
There's more white tail
deer in this country than,

103
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,180
than even when Columbus landed. Yeah,
it's a, they've got a really good system.

104
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,670
If they could figure
something out for the ocean.

105
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,610
The problem is you'd have to get
everybody to cooperate in some,

106
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,700
like they can't even get Japan to
stop killing whales. Like there's,

107
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:52,240
there's certain Japanese folks who,
uh,

108
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,860
they have this really sneaky thing they
do and there's this, there's this, um, um,

109
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,350
conservation group called
the sea shepherds and they
catch these fucking people

110
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:01,184
all the time.

111
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,630
But what they basically do is they say
we're a research boat and they use a

112
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:09,200
research boat and go slaughter
whales and then sell the whales.

113
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:13,430
But they pretend that it's, that it's
research, but if they kill a whale,

114
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:18,560
certain countries still value parts
of Wales. They make things with it.

115
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,670
What the fuck did they make with whales?
I think they make some perfumes.

116
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,220
Like what? But people are
still killing whales. It gets,

117
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,880
it gets weird when things are smart.
That's when it gets weird. Yeah. You know,

118
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,410
something as smart as a fucking whale.

119
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:39,020
Yeah. I mean, uh, the end,
these, in these countries,

120
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:43,310
the, they're using, like you
said, parts of the fish for,

121
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,750
you know, they put it on their
mantle. They got like a a, I dunno,

122
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:52,190
a tooth or, or what have you
found from a whale or a shark

123
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,910
or whatever it is.
That's the big thing with rhinos.

124
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,160
Guys cut the rhino horns off and they
drink it like in a tea and supposed to

125
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:00,994
make your dick hard.

126
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,810
Oh, is, see, this is what I'm talking
about. You know, these things.

127
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,180
I mean, I don't know how the hell you
remember all this stuff. I'm going to,

128
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,860
I've just forgot the mileage
off the coast. Great. Now,

129
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,840
13.8 models. Miles 12 nautical
miles. One point difference.

130
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:28,430
1.8 difference at 12 miles, which is, who
knows how long you get to 500 miles out.

131
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,450
You gotta do the math. It's crazy.
It's stupid. Yeah. Um, yeah.

132
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,850
I don't know how I remember these things.

133
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,540
It's a fucking screw we brain.
I wish I had your memory, Joe.

134
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,090
That's what I'm saying. It's
not the best. I'm telling you.

135
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,000
It's like there's still a lot
of shit that I don't remember.

136
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:51,840
I just remember things that are
interesting. You know, I have, uh,

137
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:56,090
it's, it's an odd, it's an odd
sense of memory, but the, uh,

138
00:07:56,091 --> 00:08:00,470
the Rhino Horn thing is kind of sad
because it doesn't even work, you know,

139
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:04,410
especially in this day and age where
people can get Viagra. It works. Yeah.

140
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,140
But there's something about it,

141
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:10,700
I think in some Asian cultures where
it's considered like a sign of wealth.

142
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:15,800
You drive a Rolls Royce, you drink
