00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740
Math ain't about numbers.

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.740
If you think math is about numbers, you probably think that Shakespeare is all about words.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.040
You probably think that dancing is all about shoes.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.960
You probably think that music is all about notes.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.140
Math ain't about numbers.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.620
Math is about logic, it's about beauty, it's about connections, it's about

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.540
how you get from one place to another.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.540
And for me,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.060
the cool thing about math is a part of it, called topology.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.440
I'm not even gonna tell you about topology because what I'm interested in

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.840
is a little section of topology called
Non-Orientable Manifolds.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.440
More specifically, I'm interrested in Klein Bottles.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.200
This is a Klein Bottle.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.460
Wait a second. Wait a second.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.660
We haven't even touched upon a Möbius Loop.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.860
How can I talk about a Klein Bottle without talking about a Möbius Loop?

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.420
I take a piece of paper

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.320
As everybody knows, if I have this piece of paper, it has two sides, four edges.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.000
Turn around this way it becomes a cylinder, give it a half-twist, and a piece of tape.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.360
Becomes a Möbius Loop.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.840
Well, the cool thing about a Möbius Loop (then there is about fifty or sixty cool things about Möbius Loops)

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.240
is that, it's got one side, it's got one edge.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.480
Take two Möbius Loops, one left-handed one, the other right-handed one, and I try to connect them.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.620
Hey! This one has one edge, this one has one edge.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.060
What happens if I take two Möbius Loops and sew their edges together?

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.060
Well, I know from experience,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.100
that if I have four edges here and four edges here and I connect them.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.840
Oh! I'll get something that has fewer edges.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.240
So if I apply that to a Möbius Loop. I got one edge here, one edge here, sew them together.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.460
I should get something that has... oh.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.420
I'd lose this edge, I'd lose that edge. I ought to have something with no edges.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.940
Cool.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.980
If I take two Möbius Loops, hook them together. I'll get something without any edges.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.060
Okay, I'm gonna try it.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.200
HOT DAMN

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.160
far out

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.300
Here is a Möbius Loop, here is another Möbius Loop.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.240
The cool thing is that if I take two Möbius Loops and try to sew them together.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.400
I end up with a shape that requires four spacial dimensions to exist.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.940
In that shape it's called a Klein Bottle

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:32.440
Named after Felix Klein! Felix Klein! This guy in 1882 came up with the absolutely nifty idea,

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.480
that if you can take a cylinder, turn it around, and orient one end of it, and loop it through.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:47.520
So, his idea was: take a cylinder, bring it through itself, and have the end of the cylinder welded to a base.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.600
That this would have the cool property of having only one side. What do I mean by one side?

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.280
If I have an ant crawling around here. [The] ant or caterpillar crawls around.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.340
Oh, clearly it can cover this whole thing.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:10.220
It can then slide continuously, over there, through this tube, and get to the other side of this piece of glass.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.740
We never cross an edge to get to the inside. Absolutely nifty.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.840
In an ordinary... Let me get an ordinary bottle.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.200
Ordinary bottle.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.560
Well, if I take—

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.060
if I leave the cap on the bottle, clearly it has two sides.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.780
Here's an outside...

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.760
and the inside of the bottle is where I'm touching right now.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.980
An ant walking around here couldn't get to the other side.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.940
If I take the top off, watch this.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.880
An ant walking along here can get to the other side, but he has to cross

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.320
a peculiar location called an edge.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.380
If I make this bottle

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.280
arbitrarily thin,

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.360
this edge becomes sharp,

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.960
and the ant cuts— cuts herself when she tries to walk from the outside to the inside.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.540
In other words, an ordinary bottle

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.020
has two sides: an outside that I'm touching,

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.020
and an inside that my finger is touching right now.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.060
And they're separated by the lip of the bottle.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.060
And, okay, we all know this.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.360
A Klein Bottle, meanwhile... watch this.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.260
You'd walk around here just like [you'd] walk around here,

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.880
but the other side of my finger

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.180
I can get to without ever crossing a sharp edge,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.640
by carefully walking along, never crossing an edge,

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.840
going through this tube,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.040
and getting to the place that's just on the other side of my finger,

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.620
without ever crossing an edge.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.660
In other words: this is a bottle without an edge.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.740
BRADY: Cliff, I'm comfortable with that, except you just told me that this wasn't

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.160
possible in three dimensions.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:55.680
CLIFF: If we lived... Aw! If we lived in a universe with four spacial dimensions, four-space,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.500
this tube wouldn't have to intersect itself

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.980
This weird place where there is self intersection, right... *hard k* ...there.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.720
That would not self-intersect, and an ant walking along this way would go:

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.080
*boop* *boop* *boop* *boop* *boop* *boop* *voop* *voop* *voop* *voop* *voop* *voop* *voop*

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.460
and would go right through this piece of glass right here and keep walking to the inside

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.560
And an ant walking around this way:

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.780
*dg* *dg* *dg*  *dg* *dg* *dg* *dg* *dg* *hard K*

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.760
would go right through this and keep walking this way.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:29.060
BRADY: Cliff! So that hole you've created there so the tube can get through is like the floor?

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:37.400
CLIFF: This is worse than the floor. It's this place right here where the manifold... where the glass intersects itself

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.860
It's a figment of living in a three dimensional universe

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.240
If we live in four-space, we could go right through

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:53.400
On the other hand, that guy Felix Klein showed that in three dimensions you have to have this intersection

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.940
In a quality universe that has four spacial dimensions, Klein Bottles would be terrific!

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:05.020
Here, unfortunately, my Klein Bottles has to have this self intersection.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:14.740
When I make Klein Bottle hats... Right? Here's a hat that is the same thing as that glass Klein Bottle.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:24.240
Instead of welding it together, I've knitted this hat so that the peak of the hat comes through itself.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:34.800
So that the hat itself can... the loop of the hat can be pulled through itself

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:42.600
and turn it inside out. But I'd rather not do this because it takes about five minutes to do

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.560
and I'm stretching things that shouldn't be stretched

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:56.640
but ultimately, I ought to be able to pull this sort of inside out. It's continuously deformable back to itself.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:58.820
BRADY: Cool!

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.800
CLIFF: And, along with a matching  Möbius scarf

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.040
Ah!

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.960
I'd like to say I'm ready for a California winter

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.340
Look! Look! Look! Look! Look! Look!

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.680
[A] friend of mine, Robert Leng, made a paper origami Klein bottle.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.680
I mean, absolutely sweet. One sheet of paper: it's an origami Klein bottle

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:29.080
One of the neat things about mathematical topology is that you don't care what size something is.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:36.580
I could expand this, contract it. I can make this... I could stretch it and it'll still have the same mathematical properties

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.440
Same number of sides, same number of holes, same number of handles.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.180
Instead of making a big one, I could make it smaller.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.500
I could make an even smaller Klein Bottle.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.040
I mean... I can make a Klein Bottle even smaller.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:58.420
To a mathematician, these are all the same thing.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.820
And, of course, I can go in the other direction as well.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.840
I can make 'em big!

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:10.480
So, I had to put a thousand Klein Bottles some place, so I put 'em under my house.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:15.100
...and the wheels. You know? Their little motors drive the wheels around...

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:23.780
*whirring*
