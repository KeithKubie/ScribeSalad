00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:07.859
 There is no doubt from public opinion polls that people care so much about the issue of sincerity 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.160
 The person they deal with, whether that person is their doctor or their political leader. 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:24.300
 However, it is more complicated. We often do not want to know the truth. Do you 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.410
 Want to know that your husband is cheating on you? Do you want to know that person 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.480
 Which you recommend to do something in your company scares? Would you like to know that 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.610
 Are your children taking heroin? Of course these things are all things you want to know but you 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.000
 Of course you do not want to know. So the question is whether we are already 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 We want to catch a very complicated liar. We think we want it. What if we discover that both presidential candidates 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:03.559
 Do you lie? When will we do? I'm not saying they're lying, and I never comment 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.470
 To any person in a position or running for office. Only when they leave office does it become 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.100
 Allowed ... Clinton said: "I did not have sex with that woman" and then 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.100
 He called it. The term "woman" was placed at a distance from himself. there are many reasons 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.500
 Behind lies people and some of them deserve respect. I study the lies that the community cares about, which he cares about 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:41.150
 Usually by exposing them. The most common reason why people lie is in order 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.890
 Avoid punishment for breaking the law. Usually, some laws are broken by mistake. 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:04.790
 They may cut off the gallery very quickly and expect a $ 2,000-carrying vase. 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.489
 You did not mean to do that. "Did you sign that vessel?" You will not say 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.810
 "Yes, I did it ...." "No, I do not know who threw that pot. 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.950
 "You do not want to be punished, but there 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.670
 Many times you make the decision to break the law, 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.650
 I will cheat and lie. I will not admit that I was cheated. No 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.319
 I want to reveal my order. Therefore, the decision to lie is taken at the same time as a decision 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:43.319
 Cheating. When we know people, we do the workshops by teaching people how to do it 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:52.450
 Lies, it will take us 32 hours ... Discover the very small expression is over 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.819
 Things are useful. It is an expression that lasts about 25 parts per second. We have tested 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:09.819
 More than 15,000 people in all areas of life and more than 99 percent of them did not see these terms, 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:17.569
 However, after an hour of online training, they can learn to see these terms. But 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.720
 This expression may tell you that a person hides only a sense. this is a lie-- 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.730
 They do not tell you what they really feel. But may not tell you they are perpetrators 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.730
 the crime. This is a terrible example but I have to use it - they found my wife dead. 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.489
 I will be the first suspect because, unfortunately, the first person who often kills his wife 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:47.659
 He is the husband ... "But I love my wife, I did not kill her 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:53.849
 Their time they insult me! Time passes and they are not looking for 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:59.069
 The real person. "I may feel very angry with them and hide my anger 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:04.650
 You have noticed my anger hidden, it does not mean that I killed my wife. It just means that I am 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.650
 I hid my anger. Now, if the lie is about what Paul already feels, and 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:19.629
 You have noticed a very small expression, then you have discovered something. Second, know that 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:29.199
 The signals for your cultural community are the signals you will only know. This is the specific body language, 

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:35.050
 But you know it originally. You can not - if I ask you how many signals are used in 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.990
 America today, you will give me about 12 signal, but it is actually 80. If I see you 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.360
 Each of these 80 signals, you will know its meaning. And one amazing signal 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:53.360
 Which had a huge result is the most common signal we use is shaking the head, 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:05:00.449
 Yes and no. I just made it. These are already "yes" and "no". But it happens 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.080
 Very quickly. I worked in a case of a fief who embezzled more than 100 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:15.080
 Million dollars. He was very famous but appeared Bernie Madoff. He accused this embezzler 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:23.180
 People in a number of banks that they are part of the deal, this means that these banks 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:29.779
 Will have to pay for the embezzlement. When asked about a person who falsely accused them 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:36.779
 "Did it help you steal money?" "Yes, of course 

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:46.029
 "I did." He shook his head with a nod to the word no, so it was smaller than my movement 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.679
 One signal. There is one facial expression.
