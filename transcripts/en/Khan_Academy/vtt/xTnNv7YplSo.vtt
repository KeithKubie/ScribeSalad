00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.859
- [Voiceover] When we wanna categorize life

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:03.680
as we know it at a very high level,

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.120
we can categorize it as either eukaryotic,

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.800
eukaryotic or as a eukaryote,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.340
eukaryote, or as a prokaryote,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.260
prokaryote.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.040
And the largest distinction between a eukaryote and a

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.940
prokaryote are membrane-bound structures

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.240
that eukaryotes have that prokaryotes don't have.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.320
The most noticeable of which is a membrane-bound nucleus.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.500
So in a eukaryote, the genetic information is going to be

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.660
inside a membrane-bound nucleus.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.140
So this right over here, this is the nucleus.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.270
This is the nucleus and you have your genetic

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.680
information inside it, you have your DNA.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.610
Here, for a prokaryotic cell, you're going to have your DNA.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.680
It might be bundled up into a section of the cell.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.800
We would call that a nucleoid but it's not membrane-bound.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.020
So let me we write this down

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.949
no membrane...

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.050
Let me write a little membrane-bound,

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.020
membrane-bound nucleus.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.000
But that's not the only distinction in between

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.140
eukaryotes and prokaryotes.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.800
It's almost the one that's most noted.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.060
In fact, the word eukaryote, the karyote part

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.380
comes from the Greek for nut or kernel.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.340
So let me make this clear.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.320
So this is referring to a nut

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.370
or a kernel

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.040
while prokaryote means before the nut or kernel.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.980
So we don't see and you know, I just could think of the

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.640
nut or the kernel as the membrane-bound structure,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.240
especially the membrane-bound nucleus over here.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.100
But that's not all.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.300
Eukaryotes will also have other membrane-bound structures

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.400
that you will not see in prokaryotes.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.540
For example, you will tend to see a mitochondria,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.160
mitochondria,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.200
in a eukaryotic cell, both plant and animal cells,

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.100
but you won't see it in a prokaryotic cell.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.940
And there's other types of membrane-bound structures.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.620
You could see things like Golgi apparatus.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.780
This over here is a micrograph of a eukaryotic cell.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.100
And you see the Golgi apparatus, right over here,

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.410
which helps package proteins.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.700
You see a micrograph of mitrochondria.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.640
This is a micrograph of the nucleus.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.720
So this, right over here, is the nuclear membrane.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.540
And then you see all the genetic information.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.320
It's all spread out.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.130
It's in chromatin form right over here but you see

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.620
it's especially densely packed right over here.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.960
And we've also put it in this and right over there.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.060
So this is all the DNA in chromatin form

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.990
but this part that looks extra dense or dark

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.590
in this micrograph right over there,

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.290
we call that the nucleolus.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.680
We call that the nucleolus.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.240
And we now know that this is where

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.780
ribosomal RNA is being produced.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.800
And ribosomal RNA, that forms part of the structure

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.980
of ribosomes which are essential in the translation,

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.200
well I guess you can say, the construction of proteins

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.040
based on the information in mRNA.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.880
We'll go into a lot more depth in that in other videos.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.680
So these are ribosomes right over here

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.200
and they're made up of ribosomal RNA

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.440
and they're also made up of proteins.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.340
And so this nucleolus over there, that's where

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.580
that's happening, that denser part of the nucleus.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.960
So the key distinction, eukaryotic cell,

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.840
you have a membrane-bounded nucleus,

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.720
you have other membrane-bound structures like mitochondria.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.100
In fact, there's some theories that

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.560
mitochondria first evolved as prokaryotic organisms

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.210
that eventually lived in symbiosis

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.640
inside of a larger eukaryotic cell.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.880
And then the other distinction is that in eukaryotes,

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.000
the DNA tends to be in multiple strands.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.760
So the DNA, if you were to kinda straighten it out,

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.660
it would be in multiple strands.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.360
On a prokaryote, the DNA tends to be circular.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.180
It can be all flipped around and whatever else

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.230
but at the end of the day, it would be circular DNA.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.070
So those are the three core distinctions:

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.889
nuclear membrane, other membrane-bound organelles,

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.120
like mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus,

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.760
and then you also have multiple single strands of DNA

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.860
versus circular DNA.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.880
Other things is that eukaryotes tend to be larger,

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.820
while prokaryotes tend to be smaller, they tend to be simpler.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.500
So now that we know the key distinctions,

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.140
what are examples of eukaryotes?

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.200
Well, eukaryotes include most of

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.290
what we interact with on a daily basis

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.650
or we think we're interacting with on a daily basis.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.110
These includes all multicellular organisms,

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.100
so multicellular,

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.770
multicellular organisms.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.040
So I'm thinking animals, plants, fungi.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.320
It includes protists.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.300
This is a paramuseum right over here.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.340
This is eukaryotic.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.580
It's going to have a membrane-bound nucleus

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.960
and other organelles.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.720
This right over here, these are onion root tip cells.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.000
So these are plant cells.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.550
And you could actually see it's been stained

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.610
You can actually see the membrane-bound nucleus here.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.380
And this is actually a cool picture because you can see

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.880
the cells at different stages of mitosis,

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.200
which is interesting.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.260
Animal cells, the things that make you you,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.300
you are eukaryotic.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.320
So what is prokaryotic?

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.250
Well, bacteria is probably the most common example of that.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.340
Bacteria, right over here,

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.540
these are prokaryotes.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.400
And the lesser talk or things that's

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.100
talked about lot less is archaea.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.630
And archaea, people initially thought that

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.000
these were a form of bacteria that just lived

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.500
in vary extreme conditions.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.650
But now they know it's a completely different domain of life,

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.260
archaea.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.670
And so when we think about the domains of life,

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.150
the current thought is that you have bacteria here,

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.180
bacteria here, you have archaea.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.020
You have archaea,

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.000
And then you have,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.180
and then you have eukaryotes.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.210
I'll do it there, and then you have eukaryotes.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.050
And these are things that have all of

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.520
the traits that we've talked about

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.700
and so this include plants and animals

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.260
and fungi and unicellular eukaryotes,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.160
protists, and things like that.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.540
And so, if we once again, just high level

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.100
we would consider these prokaryotes

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.560
and these of course are the eukaryotes.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.470
So hopefully that gives you a good overview of things.
