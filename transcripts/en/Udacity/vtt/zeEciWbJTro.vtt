00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.404
For these four examples, we were able to complete the square and turn each

00:00:03.404 --> 00:00:08.295
expression into a perfect square by adding a certain amount. The amount that we

00:00:08.295 --> 00:00:13.020
added in each case depended upon the b coefficient for the x term. In the first

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.150
example, the b term was a 6 and we ended up having to add 9 to make a perfect

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.282
square. In the second example, our b was 12 and we ended up adding 36 pieces to

00:00:23.282 --> 00:00:29.513
get a perfect square. In this third case, b was negative 4 and we added four

00:00:29.513 --> 00:00:36.354
pieces. And in the last case, b was negative 10 and we added 25. So, for any

00:00:36.354 --> 00:00:39.546
value of b, how much do you think we need to add in order to complete the

00:00:39.546 --> 00:00:44.025
square? In other words, see if you can look and find a pattern between these

00:00:44.025 --> 00:00:49.947
two numbers. How do we go from this b to the added amount? Now, you might think

00:00:49.947 --> 00:00:54.038
the answer would be b plus 3, but we know that can't be correct. Sure, if we

00:00:54.038 --> 00:01:00.280
add 3 here, we get 9. But if I added 3 to 12, I would get 15 and not 36. So,

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.940
what expression could we write here that uses the letter b and gives us the

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.927
appropriate value? The expression should work for each of the four cases. And

00:01:08.927 --> 00:01:12.788
be sure to take some time to think about it. This one's tough. If you get

00:01:12.788 --> 00:01:15.580
stuck, look for a hint in the instructor's comment.
