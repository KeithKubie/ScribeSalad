00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:05.299
- Hey it me, Destin.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.320
This is hard to explain.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.883
So lemme just start here.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.550
Everyone has a unique world view,

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.060
and that world view is shaped
by different perspectives.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.220
Perspectives are shaped by how

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.140
you choose to spend your time.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.310
For the past 15 years, I
have been a federal employee,

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.470
specifically something called a

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.850
Department of Defense civil servant and

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.440
as part of that, I took an oath

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.900
to defend the Constitution against

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.970
all threats foreign and domestic

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.810
and I've been using math
and science to do just that.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.710
I've been doing that in the role of

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.190
something called a Missile
Flight Test Engineer

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.530
for the Army Test Evaluation Command.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.950
We, the men and women of the
Army Test Evaluation Command

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.900
have been tasked with a
job of protecting soldiers

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.260
by testing their equipment
to make sure that

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.070
if someone's gonna use an
offensive system against them,

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.390
they can defend themselves and

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.030
in order to do that, you
must first become an expert

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.530
on the offensive systems.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.363
Does that make sense?

00:01:02.363 --> 00:01:05.600
This is the part that's
hard to explain but,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.350
for the last however long,

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.010
I've been learning how
to use these systems.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.040
For example, this is me,
operating a mortar and

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.360
I have to learn everything
about this thing.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.490
This is me operating a mini gun.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.820
Now, it looks like
you're just shooting but

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.240
that's not what's happening here.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.140
This is me learning failure modes,

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.660
how to operate it,

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.320
the capabilities and
limitations of the system.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.400
This is me learning
common jams that happen,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.920
how to clear those jams.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.420
There's a lot of stuff going on here.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.495
It's not just shooting
out of a helicopter.

00:01:38.495 --> 00:01:41.578
(machine gun firing)

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.140
This is me in a Bradley
infantry Fighting Vehicle,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.160
firing the M242 25 millimeter cannon.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.040
That's something I spent
a lot of time doing.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.680
The thing that I spent
the most time on was

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.820
missles and rockets.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.800
This is me participating in a test

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.427
of a javelin missile system.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.915
- [Soldier] Windows open.

00:02:06.915 --> 00:02:08.665
3-2-1 FIRE!

00:02:11.015 --> 00:02:13.848
(missile hissing)

00:02:15.846 --> 00:02:18.846
(missile exploding)

00:02:21.326 --> 00:02:24.326
(missile exploding)

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.120
- Footage like this goes on forever

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.040
and it's hard to believe that I was

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.500
blessed enough to do this job.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.900
I took it very seriously and

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.150
my teammates who are still doing it are

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.960
some of the most amazing
people I've ever worked with.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.850
The men and women there are brilliant.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:41.730
Now you know me.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.617
The world is interesting and amazing and

00:02:43.617 --> 00:02:45.340
one of my favorite things to do is

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.400
to be handed a complex question

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.810
and work with a team of
competent individuals

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.810
to arrive at a solution to that

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.700
and then afterwards, I love sharing

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.640
that path of discovery with others.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.430
I was talking about perspective
earlier and this is why.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.100
Over 15 years you can kind of understand

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.150
major trends and shifts
that are happening.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.150
For example, in 2003 the main
issues were terrorism, okay?

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.920
Slowly, that started to shift and

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.080
I noticed that over time,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.150
here in the last couple years especially,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.490
the US is mostly concerned
about major state actors.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.880
You can imagine how difficult it's been,

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.550
going into work everyday,

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.140
working on huge problems that matter

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.920
and that have huge implications

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.760
and then not being able to
talk about it with anyone.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.150
Well, this video changes that.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.420
I'm going back to school, right?

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.420
On my way out the door,

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.750
I get this call from a
four-star general and he said,

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.730
Destin, would you like to
film your last mission and

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.030
after your mission come to
my office and interview me,

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.010
a four-star general, and
we'll just talk about

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.800
what you've been doing all this time

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.750
and how your little piece of the puzzle

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.830
fits into the overall bigger picture?

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.780
And then he told me that we can

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.140
make that a publicly releasable video.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.700
So yes, I'm excited about this.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.440
Let's go to Hawaii and
let me share with you

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.810
my last mission.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:10.750
For my last mission,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.140
I was told I'd be filming
a mission in the Pacific,

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.700
off the coast of Kauai
as a part of RIMPAC.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.380
RIMPAC is the Rim of the Pacific exercise.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.660
It is the largest naval
exercise in the world

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.550
and it happens every two years in Hawaii

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.730
and involves countries
from all over the world.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.070
Often with RIMPAC, they'll
do what they call a sink ex.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.500
It's an exercise which involves
actually sinking a ship.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.670
In this case, the USS Racine.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.950
My job was to fly out in a helicopter,

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.920
over the Pacific, dozens
of miles away from shore,

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.190
as they're hitting this thing
with missles and rockets

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.270
and bombs and torpedoes
and all that stuff.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.790
I'm gonna be in the helicopter up top

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.990
and my job is to get footage of impact.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.360
So, that's why I had to
go through dunker training

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.550
with the Marines because that helicopter,

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.060
if it goes down in the ocean,
there's nowhere to land,

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.500
so you have to be able to figure out

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.730
how to get out and survive.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.640
It took us about an hour
to get out to the ship.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.890
We flew out over the water,
which felt like forever

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.730
and we finally got there and

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.010
we realized that we have some challenges.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.690
Number one, we had to
loiter at 10,000 feet,

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.220
which meant we were like
looking through a soda straw

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.410
'cause we had our lenses zoomed all the in

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.300
and with the rocking of the helicopter,

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.940
that made it really hard
to focus on the ship.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.400
So I was really concerned that

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.110
my shot would be out of focus.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.500
Another issue is we didn't know exactly

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.420
when the impact was going to take place.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.460
We knew that there was
this window of time,

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.090
which meant that me, on
the high speed camera,

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.560
and the Barking Sands
Missile Range guy to my left,

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.580
who was operating a stabilized camera,

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.130
we had to just focus on
the ship the entire time,

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.060
but we couldn't look at
it with our naked eyes.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.020
So we didn't know when
impact was gonna happen.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.660
We had to rely on the pilot to cry out,

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.010
impact, impact, impact,
whenever he saw smoke.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.240
So thankfully, he was very attentive,

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.820
he did his job well, we did our job well

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.810
and we were able to capture the images

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.070
and get the engineers
data that they needed.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.840
They wanted to know what
the warhead effects were,

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.620
they were trying to do a specific thing

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.700
with this specific
Norwegian strike missile.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.620
It's a Norwegian missile that
was operated by the US Army,

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.090
which in itself, is a fascinating thing,

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.450
using targeting data from other systems.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.800
So this is really a big
interoperability test.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.510
It was fascinating.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:22.770
That was the first thing that happened

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.110
and then over the course of the day,

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.150
the Racine just got walloped.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.700
It was monitored by a US Army Gray Eagle.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.840
The Australians hit it with a Harpoon.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.690
The USS Olympia, a submarine,
they hit it with a Harpoon

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.980
and then the Japanese Defense Forces,

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.240
they hit it with a
surface to ship missile,

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.440
so I had another opportunity to film that

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.960
in slow motion as well and that was hard

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.370
because again, we had the same problems.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.010
We didn't know exactly
when it was gonna hit

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.720
because it was so far from shore.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.990
I almost missed it.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.890
We got it right as it
approached the ship but

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.770
I was very thankful we got
the data that we needed.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.620
I wish I had triggered it just

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.840
not even a hundred milliseconds earlier,

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.220
but thankfully, we did get the bare-bones

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.020
data requirement that we needed.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.700
The USS Racine had a really bad day.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.080
After we hit it with all
these missiles and stuff,

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.080
some Apaches came all
the way out from shore

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.230
and they did some work
on the deck with rockets

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:23.250
and 30 mike-mike and then
after that the grand finale,

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:27.200
a Mark 48 torpedo fired from a US sub and

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.640
this is something I will never forget.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.297
In a helicopter, over the USS Racine,

00:07:32.297 --> 00:07:34.360
was can get down closer
because there's not

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.500
a huge safety fan issue like there was

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.320
with missiles flying at you.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.720
You can be right there on it.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.050
I chose to get the 4k camera
and just get right on that ship

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.580
and just hold it as best I could and boom.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.550
You can see it happen.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.170
The cool thing to me is you can see that

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.660
big air bubble form under the ship

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.740
and then it just breaks the keel.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.750
It's like breaking the spine of the ship

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.270
and that thing is done.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.660
Later it was finished off
buy some aerial stuff,

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.340
but the USS Racine is no more.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.690
I'm gonna level with you here.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.480
I speak rocket, I speak missile,

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.990
and I'm not intimidated by those things.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.510
This was an intimidating
exercise for me personally,

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.380
because I don't understand how to

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.010
coordinate battlefield maneuvers.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.510
Now I understand that
people in the military

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:18.620
do know these things.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:19.453
I don't.

00:08:19.453 --> 00:08:21.170
I asked my friend Captain Mackenzie Harp

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:22.750
to help me get smarter on the topic.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.080
So she took me to speak with someone

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.870
from the Asymmetric Warfare Group,

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.541
which is a part of TRADOC.

00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:29.040
Alright this is Lieutenant
Colonel Davis with TRADOC,

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.340
Training and Doctrine Command, right?

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.204
- That's correct.

00:08:31.204 --> 00:08:34.060
- How does the battlefield
work these days?

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.793
- So right now, when you think
about the modern battlefield,

00:08:36.793 --> 00:08:39.010
what you're thinking about is

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:41.930
your thinking about chess
pieces moving on a map.

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:45.800
Could we create new version of that,

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.620
that is three dimensional?

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.170
Some of us grew up on Star Wars,

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:50.640
even my kids grew up on Star Wars.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.980
There's a famous scene
that keeps getting repeated

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.280
where they are playing chess with

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.190
these little creatures on a map

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:58.410
and they're in three dimensions and

00:08:58.410 --> 00:08:59.600
they're playing this
three dimensional chess.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.040
Well when I was a kid,
I always wanted to play

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.680
three dimensional chess.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.350
That's what we're trying to
do now with this battle space.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:08.890
So there are five
acknowledged domains right now

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:10.600
and arguably there's sixth

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.780
but the five domains and just go

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.120
from lowest to highest 'cause it's

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.690
typically easiest that way.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:17.293
There's sea,

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.983
there's the land,

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.130
there's the air, which are
our traditional domains

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.250
which is why we have
Navy for the sea domain,

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:27.990
the Army for the land domain

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.100
and then the Air Force for the air domain.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.730
And what we've realized in
the last couple of years

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.200
is that there's also the space domain

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.090
and then we also have the cyber domain.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:38.120
Because as we all know,

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.540
the internet has changed the
connectivity of our planet

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.150
and it's also changed not only

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:44.350
the way we exchange information,

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.370
but the way that we are going to

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:48.240
interact with our environment.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.830
- [Destin] So you're saying
the battlefield is not

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:53.000
land, with Abrams tanks or

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.570
sea with a ship or something like that

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.370
or an airplane flying overhead.

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:00.200
You're saying it's more than than now.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.033
- Yes.

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:02.290
- [Destin] The battlefield is different?

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.030
- The operational space has changed,

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.540
just like the world has changed.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.523
- Like a futuristic commander,

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:14.800
he could be fighting a cyber
war or cyber battle to his left

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.740
and he can have a naval
battle to his right

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.950
and he's also thinking
about the air battle.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.100
So he could be fighting multiple battles

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.580
at once in the same conflict.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:24.480
- Absolutely.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.910
- [Destin] And that's called what?

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.950
- Multi-domain operations and then you

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.040
would be doing cross-domain maneuver,

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.270
within that multi-domain operation.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:34.270
- [Destin] Explain a
cross-domain maneuver.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:36.420
- We in the military
would define a maneuver as

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.160
the ability to shoot and move,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.710
and often we add communicate to that

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.700
because you can't do
one without the other.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.840
The ability to shoot, move and communicate

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.130
within multiple domains.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.290
Air, land, sea battles,
our traditional way

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:51.770
of thinking of warfare,

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:53.910
is a cross-domain maneuver when we are

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:57.460
shooting from the sea
through the air to the land.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.360
That is a cross-domain maneuver.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.780
Now we have soldiers
who have the ability to

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:06.250
see through the cyber domain,

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:10.720
by using the space
domain, i.e. a satellite,

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.840
in order to conduct a ground movement

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.770
inside of a city.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:16.940
- You are working with how people

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.370
interact with each of these domains.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:19.980
I need to find the person who

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.560
is basically playing the chess game.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.570
And who would that be?

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:25.670
- So, this is Four Star
General Robert Brown,

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:27.520
which is a really big deal,

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.434
Sir, thank you.

00:11:28.434 --> 00:11:29.546
- Well I don't know about that but, yeah.

00:11:29.546 --> 00:11:30.990
- For even considering talking to me.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:34.020
What I've noticed, when
I started 15 years ago,

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.040
we were fighting insurgencies,

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:36.873
- Right.

00:11:36.873 --> 00:11:37.785
- Terrorism, things like that.

00:11:37.785 --> 00:11:38.618
- Right.

00:11:38.618 --> 00:11:39.451
- It's changing.

00:11:39.451 --> 00:11:40.284
- Yeah, sure.

00:11:40.284 --> 00:11:41.190
- [Destin] So from your perspective,

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:44.190
what I've learned about
talking to all these other

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:45.350
folks that work for you is

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:47.640
something called multi-domain

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.473
- Operations.

00:11:48.473 --> 00:11:49.306
- [Destin] Operations.

00:11:49.306 --> 00:11:50.139
- Yeah.

00:11:50.139 --> 00:11:51.040
- [Destin] And can you explain that to me?

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.150
- So multi-domain operations,
I will tell you it's a,

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.104
I am positive, one thing I am positive,

00:11:56.104 --> 00:11:59.230
it's the way of the future and in warfare

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.200
and we're either going
to do like we are now,

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.830
innovate and move towards
multi-domain operations,

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:09.000
to either win a conflict
in the future or prevent it

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.860
because nobody'd be stupid
enough to fight against us,

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.290
or we're gonna be forced to do it because

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:16.440
we lose someday pretty badly and

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.273
we're going to have to do it

00:12:17.273 --> 00:12:18.597
and I hope that's not the case.

00:12:18.597 --> 00:12:19.430
- [Destin] You're trying
to get ahead of the curve.

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:21.680
- Get ahead of the curve,
not fight last fight

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.030
but fight the future fight

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:24.840
and in fact, maybe not have to fight

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.800
because we're so darn
good nobody can match us.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.780
So this is an evolutionary thing.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:32.420
You go back to the Civil
War, the Battle of Vicksburg,

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.130
the Army had to work with the
Navy in a river in that case,

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:36.766
to win at Vicksburg.

00:12:36.766 --> 00:12:38.660
- [Destin] Grant actually
diverted the river.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:39.493
- There you go.

00:12:39.493 --> 00:12:40.326
Exactly.

00:12:40.326 --> 00:12:41.159
- [Destin] Grant's Canal.

00:12:41.159 --> 00:12:42.280
- And so you got domains in play there,

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.070
a little bit of maritime and land.

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:50.000
However, things have changed
as you know as well as anybody.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.360
The world's gotten so complex and

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.310
now there're these other domain out there.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:58.310
Cyber, space, I would also
count the human domain as well,

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.060
I think is the most important.

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:02.760
- [Destin] What do you mean by that?

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.070
- What I mean by the human domain is

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.540
that when you look at conflict,

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:12.760
it's a contest of wills
and people are involved.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.593
It's about people.

00:13:13.593 --> 00:13:17.970
I mean, there maybe machines
going against each other

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:21.090
some people say, oh it'll
all be autonomous, AI

00:13:22.363 --> 00:13:23.420
and all machines in the future.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.730
I certainly don't believe that.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.760
There'll be autonomous
vehicles, there'll be a lot

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.700
that's done but people are
always gonna have to be

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.930
involved, that's the nature of conflict

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:35.720
and so it's influence over those people.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.373
What we're seeing today is,

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.620
you can influence someone before

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.600
you're even at conflict with them

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.970
and you can influence them in the cyber

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.160
domain and you can influence
them in the space domain

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.950
and you can influence and
there are no boundaries

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:51.800
in these domains.

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:55.400
- Forgive me Sir.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.460
You're four-star General,

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:57.293
- Yeah.

00:13:57.293 --> 00:13:58.158
- You're a very important individual

00:13:58.158 --> 00:13:58.991
(General laughing)

00:13:58.991 --> 00:14:01.537
but I'm a simple man and so
I need it broken down for me.

00:14:01.537 --> 00:14:02.590
- Okay.

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:04.800
- For example, I've been
keeping up with the news

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.590
and I know that there's
huge social media campaigns

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.270
that occur before an actual
battle ever occurs now.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.103
- Right.

00:14:11.103 --> 00:14:12.043
- Is that true?

00:14:12.043 --> 00:14:13.710
- Well they call it the gray zone effect.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:16.640
You look at what some nations are doing.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.080
Russia's pretty darn good at it.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.610
China as well where,

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:22.940
in what we used to call
Phase Zero, pre-conflict.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.440
I don't like that term at all.

00:14:25.883 --> 00:14:29.300
There's always gonna be competition

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.210
and we're in a
hyper-competition now, always.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.320
You're exactly right.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.400
They will be working
to shape and influence

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:41.400
people's perceptions before
a conflict even occurs.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.530
What happens is, it's a fait accompli,

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:48.040
that before we even fire a
bullet they've already won.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.490
If you look at Russia and Ukraine.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:51.323
Little bit of that.

00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:52.930
We call them little green men.

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:54.480
They took off their patches,

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.630
claimed they weren't Russians,

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:58.893
just to put just enough
doubt, cyber stuff happening,

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:01.770
events happening and it wasn't quite,

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:05.760
just staying right below the
threshold of conflict but yet

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.690
- [Destin] And then as soon as
it was time to turn conflict,

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:08.840
it was already over.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.673
- Already over.

00:15:09.673 --> 00:15:10.700
They already had the territory,

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:11.757
they already had what they wanted,

00:15:11.757 --> 00:15:13.410
now they hold onto it.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:15.560
So this is new.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.640
There are other aspects that are new.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.210
I would tell you that the

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.640
the speed of human velocity,
of human interaction,

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.660
is that a rate never before seen.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.800
You can put out a video
and millions look at it.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.200
When I was your age, there was no way

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.730
I could get millions of
people look at anything.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:35.581
I have a private that does something in,

00:15:35.581 --> 00:15:38.340
I have 106,000 people in
the US Army in the Pacific.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:41.570
I have a private that does
something that's on CNN tonight,

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:43.890
worldwide impact, influence.

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:44.833
Good or bad.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:46.623
That's changed.

00:15:46.623 --> 00:15:48.193
The speed of perception.

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.654
I was talking this one time
and someone confronted me

00:15:51.654 --> 00:15:53.800
and said, well things moved
fast in the Civil War,

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.670
by telegraph, things moved fast.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:56.580
They might have moved fast,

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:58.720
they didn't diffuse rapidly.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:15:59.923
Now you can diffuse.

00:16:02.436 --> 00:16:04.410
Send a tweet and halfway around the world,

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:07.465
billions of people are paying
attention to it, right?

00:16:07.465 --> 00:16:09.900
So this has an impact in conflict,

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.500
it has an impact in
everything in our society.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.360
Business, sports, military conflict,

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.050
it's a huge impact.

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:19.757
So you've got all the domains,
air, land, sea, space,

00:16:19.757 --> 00:16:21.300
and I think around the all of them

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:25.030
is this human domain,
that is the most complex,

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.000
the most important.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.036
Let's get back to multi-domain operations,

00:16:29.036 --> 00:16:30.260
we're going all over the place.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.250
I wanna try and simplify
it best I can for you.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:34.280
It's an evolutionary process.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.850
Over time we've had
air land, air land sea.

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:41.460
We're evolving but it's
a revolutionary impact,

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:45.560
where you're maneuvering in all domains

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.610
to a position of relative advantage.

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:49.000
So what we were just talking about

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.800
was maneuvering in cyber to a position

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.030
of relative advantage pre-conflict,

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:56.950
maneuvering in space to a
position of relative advantage

00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:00.950
and to take advantage of
multi-domain operations,

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:03.700
if you truly work together,
one of our strengths,

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.150
we're more joint than
any force in the world,

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:07.320
the US Military.

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.230
We're still not joint enpugh.

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:11.430
We've got to work where
it's not the exception

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:14.280
where we're working really well together,

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:18.050
not a joint integration,

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:20.530
I'm sorry joint interdependence,

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:21.840
but joint integration.

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.130
- Lemme ask you this.

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:26.320
So yesterday I was over the water,

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.650
watching an engagement
by a foreign nation,

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:33.480
engaging a target with information from

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.070
US satellites provided on a different

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:37.570
type of communication network.

00:17:39.415 --> 00:17:40.880
I just see the engagement.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:41.760
I'm a missile tester.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.230
I test the missile

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:45.510
but I don't get to see the chess games.

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:46.610
I'm a little too close to the board,

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:47.443
I'm the pawn.

00:17:47.443 --> 00:17:50.500
- So think about in the past

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.140
if the services are in stove pipes

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.090
and you can do things in
your service pretty well

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:57.890
but if you have a menu of options

00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:59.910
of all the service capabilities,

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:01.770
like you saw yesterday.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.100
There was a missile that
launched from the land,

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.550
can destroy a ship at sea

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:10.750
and it was controlled by an Army element,

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:14.850
but using Navy, Air Force,
Marine and as you mentioned,

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:16.200
some national satellite means

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.690
things never before
used to pull it together

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:21.620
and enable it to talk and work together,

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:25.260
that gives you more options
against an adversary.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.960
Anybody would want more options.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.910
It allows you to present multiple dilemmas

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:32.300
to an adversary instead of a linear,

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:33.672
here comes the land force,

00:18:33.672 --> 00:18:36.110
here's the maritime forces,

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:37.800
here's the air, we're working together,

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.990
it's very linear and predictable,

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:41.117
It's very unpredictable,
multi-domain operations.

00:18:41.117 --> 00:18:42.980
- [Destin] So that's the
goal, is to be unpredictable.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.950
- Unpredictable, present multiple dilemmas

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:48.360
to you adversary that
they have to deal with

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.330
and then multiple options
to your leadership

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.660
and that's what you saw a
little taste of yesterday,

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.610
now picture if that ship

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:59.040
is trying to skirt into
the littorals to avoid

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.750
our strength at sea that our Navy,

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:02.050
the best in the world has,

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.320
so they're trying to skirt around it.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.660
Well the Army can engage
that ship now and destroy it

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:10.340
so now it has to go back out
to sea and be right in our

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:14.290
engagement area, where
we're going to destroy them.

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:17.250
So you're your pairing
up together, all domains,

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:19.430
maneuvering to a position
of relative advantage

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:21.630
and each domain working together

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:23.940
to create those windows of opportunity

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.650
where you can dominate your adversary.

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:27.567
The other good thing is,

00:19:27.567 --> 00:19:29.720
and the reason I talk
about the human dimension,

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.210
the human domain in all this,

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:34.695
you can't do this if you
can't empower people.

00:19:34.695 --> 00:19:35.730
- [Destin] What do you mean?

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.870
- If you've got someone
that you tell them a task

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:40.370
and that's all they can
do, this would never work.

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:42.570
You have to have the ability to empower,

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:44.170
what we call in the Army mission command,

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:46.600
but the other services
have similar versions,

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.860
where I can give someone
an outcome I want.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.330
They figure out how to get there,

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:52.030
they'll amaze you with what they do.

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:55.240
Talented young leaders, our
people, are our advantage.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.950
The best non-commissioned
officers in the world.

00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:59.730
The best leaders that are taught to

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:01.890
thrive in ambiguity and chaos.

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:04.000
- Multi-domain battle,
we have multiple layers

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.203
are playing 4-D chess,

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:08.030
but you're saying it's like

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:10.210
the chess pieces are alive themselves.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:11.043
- Yeah.

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:12.040
- and they can think on their own.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.078
- Good analogy.

00:20:13.078 --> 00:20:15.296
- [Destin] What move is best.

00:20:15.296 --> 00:20:16.320
- Yeah it's not you.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.590
There's no longer the central
figure moving that piece,

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:20.980
it moves too rapidly.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.210
Those pieces are empowered
and can move themselves

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:24.740
but work together and know how to work

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:25.840
so they're integrated

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.370
because they practice
together all the time,

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:28.570
just like we were doing yesterday

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:31.360
and just like you saw,
historically for the first time,

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.980
doing that on a regular basis.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:37.360
You really develop a web of options

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.600
that you can use to keep an adversary

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.120
completely off guard and you're completely

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.070
unpredictable on that.

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:46.230
So you're using all
domains, all angles you can,

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.010
to present those multiple dilemmas

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.860
and that requires incredible
joint integration.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:55.000
That's not natural 'cause we
all grow up in stove pipes,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.520
37 years I've been Army,
trained in Army schools.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.980
I did joint time, I was on
the Joint Staff and stuff but

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.120
I think of an Army solution first.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.080
So you gotta get out of those stove pipes.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.640
Maybe there's a better air solution.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.170
Maybe a better cyber solution.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:08.543
Maybe a better maritime solution.

00:21:08.543 --> 00:21:10.943
- I think I see what's
happening right here Sir.

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:13.720
This is US Army Pacific.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.553
- Right.

00:21:14.553 --> 00:21:16.940
- You're the guy in charge
of the 4D chess board

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:17.773
- Yeah.

00:21:17.773 --> 00:21:19.010
Well, portions of it maybe.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.860
- Portions of it.

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:26.320
If multi-domain operations,
we've got land, sea, space, air,

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.163
cyber.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.360
Is this video a weapon?

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.193
- Absolutely.

00:21:31.193 --> 00:21:32.480
- What?

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.950
So I just made a weapon?

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:35.660
- Yeah pretty much.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:38.070
Well, if it can help folks
understand number one,

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:40.930
if it can deter those
that would do us harm,

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:42.690
it's a hell of a weapon

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:46.060
and if it can help those
who are working this

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.780
understand it a little better,
support it a little better,

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:50.543
then it's a heck of a weapon.

00:21:50.543 --> 00:21:53.210
Yeah I guess you could almost say that,

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:54.120
that's why you're doing this.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.420
Pretty clever with these
analogies here, yeah.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.280
- I don't know what to do
with this information now.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.648
That's pretty amazing.

00:22:01.648 --> 00:22:04.220
So war is changing.

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:07.140
- Yeah, there's no question,
we're at an inflection point

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:11.310
and some of the things,
the reasons we go to war,

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.400
maybe not changing, but
the character of war,

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.750
with technology,

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.490
I mean, significantly changing.

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:18.410
- I'll be honest, when I was growing up,

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:22.070
a soldier, the stereotype
of an American soldier,

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:24.630
was a tough person with big
muscles that could run far

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:25.700
and pick up big things.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.533
- Yeah.

00:22:26.533 --> 00:22:29.130
- Now it's a hyper-intelligent individual?

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:31.480
- I wouldn't go away, physical

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.220
prowess is key for a soldier,

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:36.960
'cause it's still tough work

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.640
and I would say in all the services,

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.280
being physically fit is still key.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.530
In fact, we just developed a new

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:45.200
Army combat physical fitness
test that's excellent.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.210
It help you prepare you for
what you will face in combat.

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:49.270
So you still have to be physically fit,

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.300
you gotta be more of a holistic person,

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:52.770
but you got to learn

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:55.560
and I wouldn't say it's
hyper-intelligence,

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.120
I'd say it's the ability
to solve a complex problem

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.680
in a timely manner with
a creative solution,

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.900
the ability to thrive
in ambiguity and chaos,

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.660
that's not necessarily hyper-intelligence.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.830
That's the ability to
make the right decision,

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:11.740
know when you have enough information,

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.840
know when you don't
have enough information.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.790
It's common sense, it is intelligence,

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:19.010
but it's training education
that we have to do

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:22.200
and we're doing different
than we did in the past.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.380
We might have told somebody in the past,

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:25.330
here's your task, here are the exact steps

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.290
you need to take to accomplish it.

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:28.410
Shouldn't do that anymore.

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:29.960
Here's the outcome I want,

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.810
you figure out how to get there.

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:32.910
That's the difference.

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:35.570
- War is changing.

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:36.980
Thank you very much for your time.

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:37.813
- [ General] Absolutely.

00:23:37.813 --> 00:23:40.080
- I feel like you're the
game master or something.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.330
- I don't know about that.

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:43.313
- There's a huge, not a
game, war is not a game.

00:23:44.209 --> 00:23:45.042
- One thing I am positive though,

00:23:46.239 --> 00:23:47.490
is if we do this right,

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:50.893
if we truly come together and
integrate in a joint manner,

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.210
as the United States along
with our International,

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:56.380
our allies are so key
that's why as you saw,

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.240
we had a Japanese ground
self-defense force involved

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.540
and our great allies around
the world are critical.

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:02.820
We're not gonna do anything alone.

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:04.240
But if we come together and we truly get

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.320
multi-domain operations right,

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.820
it'll be an absolute key
to peace and stability

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.260
in the future, 'cause no
one would be foolish enough,

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:14.360
and some of these nations
we've been talking about,

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.273
many out there,

00:24:16.913 --> 00:24:18.240
they don't have the people,

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.050
the ability to empower people,

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:21.230
the way we do

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.840
and it's that American Spirit,

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.420
that is a huge advantage.

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:26.960
It has been for a long time.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.530
We can't handcuff those folks.

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:30.530
We gotta empower them and that's what

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:33.090
multi-domain operations is all about and

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:34.740
I sure wouldn't want to go against us

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:35.890
when we do it right.

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:37.260
Nobody wants to fight.

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:38.850
The best thing would be
again, the deterrence

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:39.980
where we never have to fight,

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.680
because nobody'd be foolish
enough to go against us.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.150
So that's the best thing.

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:46.170
I thank you for interested in this,

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:47.680
flying around in a helicopter,

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.160
above a missile being fired,

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.116
several missles being fired.

00:24:50.116 --> 00:24:50.949
- [Destin] It was awesome.

00:24:50.949 --> 00:24:51.782
- Pretty gutsy

00:24:51.782 --> 00:24:53.680
and coming out and seeing
some of these things,

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.053
just a small taste of it,

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:58.700
got a lot to connect, a lot of work to do,

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.480
pull all the pieces together
but if anybody can do it,

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.630
the United States military can.

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:05.420
I feel very confident and I'm
very proud United States Army

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.663
leading the way with
multi-domain operations.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.630
- The General mentioned that
this video could be a weapon

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:12.463
and I hope it is.

00:25:12.463 --> 00:25:13.890
I hope it's a countermeasure.

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:15.990
The one thing I want you to
take away from this video

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:19.730
is that multi-domain operations
are the future of warfare.

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:21.560
I find it fascinating that General Brown,

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.240
a four-star General, a person who wields

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.340
incredible military might,

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.770
is concerned about the cyber domain.

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:29.770
You heard him say it, right?

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:30.890
Several times.

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:32.840
The cyber domain and the human element

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.460
affected by the cyber domain.

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:36.850
Let's think about what's
different about the cyber domain.

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:38.640
If you roll up into a bay in a a ship

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.690
and you start shooting stuff,

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:41.330
people are gonna notice, right?

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:44.100
But how do maneuvers take
place in the cyber domain?

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.630
They're more subversive than that, right?

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:49.490
People don't wear
uniforms on the internet.

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:52.770
Surfninja385 is not declaring his intent

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:54.440
to be hostile before he does something.

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.780
Maneuvers and actions in the cyber domain

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:58.300
don't make loud noises.

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.870
This type of conflict
is based on deception

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:03.010
and the most important deception

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:05.590
is to convince you that
you're not at conflict.

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:06.960
Heck, even a couple days ago,

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.530
I was tweeting something
asking about this stuff

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:12.490
and I was accused pretty
quickly of tinfoil hattery.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:14.090
I think the reason that is,

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:16.660
is because we like to think
about this place that we gather,

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.270
the internet place here,

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:21.790
as just a fun, consequence-free place

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.730
where we can like and up vote and comment

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:26.360
and subscribe and all that kind of stuff,

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.193
but come on.

00:26:27.193 --> 00:26:30.200
We can all feel it, we just
don't know how to say it.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.670
I feel this us versus them thing and

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:36.210
I've seen really smart
friends fall into it

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:38.420
and I'm guilty myself.

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:39.450
Something's happening.

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:41.930
I just had a four-star
General tell me that

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:45.540
the cyber domain and specifically,
the human elements, us,

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.600
affected within that cyber domain,

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.770
is one of the five most
important components

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:51.020
to modern warfare.

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:52.730
There's an old saying
from when I was a kid.

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:56.070
Knowing is half the battle
and it totally applies here.

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:57.080
Think about it.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:01.330
Just knowing that the cyber
domain is a battle space

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:03.570
and I'm in it, is huge.

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:05.170
So what about the other
half of the battle?

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:06.080
Straight-up.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.870
I believe the biggest threat right now

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:09.703
is division.

00:27:09.703 --> 00:27:11.800
They're gonna find the
division within our society

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.630
and they're gonna try to amplify it.

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:15.860
I would like to submit
for your consideration,

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.060
a countermeasure.

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.730
A way to get through
this modern bombardment,

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:23.090
in this new battle space that
we haven't experienced before.

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:24.440
If they're trying to divide us,

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:28.190
I think the way to get
around this is proactive,

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:29.840
intentional unity.

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:30.780
We can all do this.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:33.300
We all need to be more
conscious of what types

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.050
of content we're consuming online.

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:35.920
What are we liking?

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.100
What are we sharing?

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.230
How is that affecting our minds?

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:41.320
Is it affecting the way we treat people,

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.360
both online and offline?

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.050
If we extend patience and political grace,

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:47.440
not just to those people we like,

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.880
but also to those with whom we disagree,

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.310
these maneuvers in the cyber
domain meant to divide us,

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:54.900
simply will not work.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.610
Political grace.

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:59.830
Basically the art of disagreeing well.

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:01.640
This is the ultimate countermeasure

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.770
to this kind of attack.

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:05.320
Thanks for watching this video.
