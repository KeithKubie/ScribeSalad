00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.420
Alright Michael. Tell me the answer. let's go across.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.740
&gt;&gt; Alright. Across. So. The first row it's all left, left,

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.830
but the second left doesn't matter because that's in state four. Oh

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.230
it might matter. I take it back. So left, left you

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.280
did was seven. Left and then, player two goes to medium, middle.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.740
&gt;&gt; Middle.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.080
&gt;&gt; That would be three, so then the pay off is three.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.700
&gt;&gt; Mm hm.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.660
&gt;&gt; If

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.580
the first player does left, left and the second player does right, right;

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.940
then we're going to go left, right, left again, or for a minus one.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.510
&gt;&gt; Mm hm. Oh wait, hang on. Left, right,

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.200
left. Yes, huh, yeah. The next row should be

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.210
exactly the same as this one, except for in

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.860
that third case. So it should be seven, three.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.820
And the r, the difference there. The r in four

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.790
only matters in this case where we've gone to the

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.624
right state in [INAUDIBLE], sorry, right action from state two.

00:00:58.624 --> 00:01:01.490
And so that should give us a plus four, so four.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.050
&gt;&gt; Correct so far.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.150
&gt;&gt; All right half way there, so, all right now, now, we've

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.980
got something different so now player one is going to the right,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.410
so now actually player one's choice in state four never matters, so

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.410
the next two rows are going to be identical to each other.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.604
And so in the first case, oh, actually

00:01:18.604 --> 00:01:21.080
[LAUGH] all of these numbers are going to be

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.850
identical to each other, so player one goes

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.020
right, player. Or, sorry, player A goes right, player

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.290
B has to go right. There's no choice.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.646
So we're going to get 2s, no matter what now,

00:01:30.646 --> 00:01:32.878
so it's going to be two, two, two, and then

00:01:32.878 --> 00:01:35.470
the second row will repeat that two, two, two.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.940
&gt;&gt; Okay. So there you go. Michael, you are correct. You can feel very

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.430
good about yourself. Very good, very good. So you're right, Michael, we do have

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.790
we do have this nice little matrix and we

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.760
have these numbers, and you know what's really interesting about

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.870
this? That we can figure out what the payoffs

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.070
are for B without having to do any additional work.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.250
&gt;&gt; That's true. But it's even more interesting than that. Which is, now that

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.350
I've written down this matrix, nothing else

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.070
matters. This whole tree, all these rules.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.120
&gt;&gt; None of it matters. It's irrelevant.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.310
&gt;&gt; Wait, wait, but. Okay.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.340
&gt;&gt; Because everything about the game is captured here in this matrix.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.710
This is actually called the matrix form of the

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.450
game, and it comprises everything you need to know about

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.080
it. It doesn't matter ha, what it means to go

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.140
left or right or what it means to go middle

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.350
or whatever. The point is by following this strategy and

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.160
this strategy, you end up with seven for a. This

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.880
strategy and this strategy, you end up with two for

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.710
a, period. And how you got there does not matter.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.990
&gt;&gt; But it does creep me out a little bit that

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.570
what your saying is that all that matters is the matrix.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.400
&gt;&gt; You know

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.690
we should write a movie about that.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.860
&gt;&gt; I think it's been done and it's scary.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.430
&gt;&gt; Well, not the first one.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.710
&gt;&gt; It was kind of scary. Like people are

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.720
trapped in this big box and their slurpyness.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.890
&gt;&gt; But their happy.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.370
&gt;&gt; But they don't know their happy.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.630
&gt;&gt; What do you mean they don't know their happy?

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.924
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:02:48.924 --> 00:02:51.560
&gt;&gt; What is means to be, Michael, Michael, Michael.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.100
&gt;&gt; Speaking of which now how do we, how do

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.030
we figure out. What do we do with this now?

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.300
&gt;&gt; So that's the big question right?

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.000
So, what was the whole point of doing reinforcement learning? The whole point

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.980
of doing reinforcement learning was to

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.460
optimize your long term expected reward right?

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.080
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.700
&gt;&gt; And so you pick the policy that would get you to the best place

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.470
possible, so here's a question I have for you. Give that this is everything we

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.370
need to know, this little matrix of values. These are all the policies A could

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.130
choose from. We're calling them strategies here.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.560
But, you know, strategies, policies. There are four

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.590
A can choose from. And there are three B can

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.720
choose from. What will you think A and B actually do?

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.620
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, you know? A wants the rewards to be high.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.780
So, seven is the highest, so A should choose the upper left corner.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.350
&gt;&gt; But A can't choose the upper left corner.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.130
&gt;&gt; Why?

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.770
&gt;&gt; A can only choose a strategy. B gets to choose some strategy.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.760
&gt;&gt; I see. So A is choosing the row and then B

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.740
gets to choose the column.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.410
&gt;&gt; So then B should choose that also because that's what A wants.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.620
&gt;&gt; No, B wants to maximize what B gets. And remember, B always gets the

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.687
opposite of A because. Because it's a two-player,

00:03:58.687 --> 00:04:02.390
zero-sum, finite game of perfect information, deterministic something.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.780
&gt;&gt; So, so you're saying that if we, if A chooses the first row.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:06.180
&gt;&gt; Say. Mm-hm.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.640
&gt;&gt; Which is the left, left strategy, and B now has

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.340
a choice between three values and will choose the one that

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.450
is worst for A, which would be the minus

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.990
1, so that would be a terrible thing to do.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.610
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.950
&gt;&gt; Okay then, so then what if A chooses the second row?

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.640
&gt;&gt; Okay if A chooses the second row?

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.050
&gt;&gt; So now again B is not going to let them have that seven which is kind of

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.430
sad, but still cant make it to bad for

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.180
A so B would choose the middle right. Strategy.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.210
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.920
&gt;&gt; And then get, and then that would be a 3 for A, a minus 3

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.930
for B. But wait, hang on. So that was done thinking of it as A move,

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.710
A kind of making the choice first.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:48.683
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:48.683 --> 00:04:49.650
&gt;&gt; That doesn't seem fair.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.080
&gt;&gt; Okay, well then do it the other way.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.460
&gt;&gt; Alright, so if B chooses first, then B could choose

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.520
the far right column because that's where the minus 1 is.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.845
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:57.845 --> 00:05:00.190
&gt;&gt; That's where it's going to be happiest. See,

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.160
B seems kind of, kind of mean. It's like

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.000
it's happiest when others are suffering. Well, but

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.090
A is also happiest when others are suffering.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.190
&gt;&gt; I see. So, if B chooses that column

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.020
then A wants to choose the second row and get the four, so

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.830
B could choose the middle column, which then A would choose the two.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.860
&gt;&gt; A would choose what?

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.700
&gt;&gt; One of the twos. One of the bottom two rows.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.450
&gt;&gt; No he wouldn't.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.810
&gt;&gt; Oh, right. A is trying to maximize, so A would choose

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.620
one of the top two rows. Oh, yeah, that makes more sense.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.940
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.730
&gt;&gt; Then choose a three which is better for B

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.340
than having chosen the far right, and B could choose

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.680
the far left column, but then A would choose one

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.760
of the sevens, and B would be unhappy with that.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.670
So we'd end up with B choosing the middle column

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.540
and A either choosing the top or the second row. Mhm.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.120
&gt;&gt; So that's kind of the same answer we got the other way.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.640
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.360
&gt;&gt; Huh.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.160
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.160
&gt;&gt; And is that, was that just luck, or

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.110
did you make this example to make that happen?

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.520
&gt;&gt; No, I didn't make this example to make that happen.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.700
In fact, the process you went through is exactly the process

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.510
you would expect to go through, and you will always end up with the, with the

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.150
same answer. For a two player zero sum

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.760
game. You know, deterministic, finite, all those other words.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.225
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:06:13.225 --> 00:06:16.040
&gt;&gt; The process you just went through, is exactly the

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.780
process you would expect to go through. So let's see

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:18.980
if we can, if we can be a little bit

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.570
more, you know, explicit about the process you went through.
