in Venice I think that we haven't yet

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459
in Venice I think that we haven't yet
 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.490
in Venice I think that we haven't yet
seen a I mean we've seen Stiles develop

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500
seen a I mean we've seen Stiles develop
 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.399

in China that are peculiar to China and

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:26.409
in China that are peculiar to China and
 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.429
in China that are peculiar to China and
have a resonance in China and tell a

00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:29.439
have a resonance in China and tell a
 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:32.699
have a resonance in China and tell a
particular story about China but I think

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709
particular story about China but I think
 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.969
particular story about China but I think
that the way that our production is at

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:35.979
that the way that our production is at
 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:39.390
that the way that our production is at
the moment is that it's often harder to

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400
the moment is that it's often harder to
 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.699
the moment is that it's often harder to
export those styles we haven't seen that

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709
export those styles we haven't seen that
 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.360
export those styles we haven't seen that
happen yet in fact one might identify

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370
happen yet in fact one might identify
 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.460
happen yet in fact one might identify
other kinds of influences going into

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470
other kinds of influences going into
 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.020
other kinds of influences going into
China at the moment I think that

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030
China at the moment I think that
 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.789
China at the moment I think that
certainly when we see Chinese Styles

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799
certainly when we see Chinese Styles
 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.709
certainly when we see Chinese Styles
homegrown sells exported then we'll

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:55.719
homegrown sells exported then we'll
 

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:58.469
homegrown sells exported then we'll
really know that New York is no longer

00:03:58.469 --> 00:03:58.479
really know that New York is no longer
 

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:00.569
really know that New York is no longer
the center of the art world but that it

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579
the center of the art world but that it
 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:05.670
the center of the art world but that it
resides somewhere else

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680
 
 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.260
 
artists that I would identify both of

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270
artists that I would identify both of
 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.059
artists that I would identify both of
them are in some ways from a younger

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069
them are in some ways from a younger
 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.240
them are in some ways from a younger
generation the first would-be self a who

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250
generation the first would-be self a who
 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.319

is a young woman who lives in Beijing

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329
is a young woman who lives in Beijing
 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.020
is a young woman who lives in Beijing
and I think that her project for the

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030
and I think that her project for the
 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.110
and I think that her project for the
Venice Biennale involving second life is

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120
Venice Biennale involving second life is
 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.980
Venice Biennale involving second life is
really a great introduction I think for

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990
really a great introduction I think for
 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.470
really a great introduction I think for
us in terms of ways that aren't and

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480
us in terms of ways that aren't and

look to history in different ways in
fact in many cases they're going back to

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:50.620
fact in many cases they're going back to
 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.090
fact in many cases they're going back to
the classics and reusing them in very

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.100
the classics and reusing them in very
 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.490
the classics and reusing them in very
different ways for example one artist

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:56.500
different ways for example one artist
 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.700
different ways for example one artist
called hong ha has taken a very

00:06:59.700 --> 00:06:59.710
called hong ha has taken a very
 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.900
called hong ha has taken a very
important Chinese scroll painting and he

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:03.910
important Chinese scroll painting and he
 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:07.890
important Chinese scroll painting and he
has inserted contemporary figures into

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:07.900
has inserted contemporary figures into
 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.020
has inserted contemporary figures into
that scroll painting and so it's a real

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.030
that scroll painting and so it's a real
 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.720

bringing together of a traditional form

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:12.730
bringing together of a traditional form
 

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.170
bringing together of a traditional form
and contemporary everyday life so I

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:16.180
and contemporary everyday life so I
 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.570
and contemporary everyday life so I
think that that's one kind of use of the

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:18.580
think that that's one kind of use of the
 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.660
think that that's one kind of use of the
classics but I think we must also be

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:21.670
classics but I think we must also be
 

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.380
classics but I think we must also be

mindful that Chinese visual traditions
continue on and in fact there is a very

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:28.420
continue on and in fact there is a very
 

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.140
continue on and in fact there is a very
lively ink painting scene in China

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:31.150

through associations as well as at the
 

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.030
through associations as well as at the
art academies and that's one of the

art academies and that's one of the
 

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.930
art academies and that's one of the
important things to remember about

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:39.940
important things to remember about
 

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.820

what what is also interesting to know
 

00:08:16.059 --> 00:08:19.559
what what is also interesting to know
about China right now is that the

00:08:19.559 --> 00:08:19.569
about China right now is that the

in fact and what's really interesting

00:08:40.649 --> 00:08:40.659
in fact and what's really interesting
 

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:43.050
in fact and what's really interesting
about this is that there has been a huge

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:43.060
about this is that there has been a huge
 

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.259
about this is that there has been a huge
return to the homeland and many of these

00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:46.269
return to the homeland and many of these
 

00:08:46.269 --> 00:08:48.269
