Hi, My name is Russ cox. I'm a member of the
Go team here at Google. Go has many interesting

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.679
features including built-in support for concurrency,
and a novel type system. But one of the main

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.160
reasons that I enjoy programming in Go is
that it's just plain fast. Most of my builds

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.190
when I'm programming take well under a second.
Let me show you.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.300
[whoosh!]
This is the math package with implementations

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.950
of things like sine and cosine. It's over
a thousand lines of Go in about twenty files,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.430
and if we build the whole package, it builds
in about 200 milliseconds.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.850
We can also run the tests for the package,
which rebuilds the package including test

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.730
functions and runs it, and that runs in well
under a second.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.819
[whoosh!]
This is the whole Go package tree. There's

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:46.269
about a hundred and twenty thousand lines
of source code and we're going to build the

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.199
whole thing. And the package tree includes
flags and regular expressions and the math

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.760
library and the formatting library, an rpc
package, a full parser for the Go language,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.420
and many other packages and there: it built
in under ten seconds. And that's just running

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.960
on one machine, my laptop.
[whoosh!]

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.000
When builds are that fast, I can get a lot
done in a day. Go is a fast, fun, and productive

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.650
language, and we hope you'll try it.
There's more information and downloads available

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.750
at golang.org.
