00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.259
Officials from both Emory Healthcare and
the Hawks hosted the Grand Opening of

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.580
the Emory Sports Medicine Complex

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.660
RESSLER: "This partnership between Emory Healthcare and the Atlanta Hawks will

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.710
be great for our franchise, hopefully
great for Emory,

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.100
but most importantly great for the
community."

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.620
It was only 18 months ago that Tony, Steve, Bud, and I

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.860
had the pleasure of announcing
our partnership and plans to

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.160
reimagine what true integration looks
like between a professional sports

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.080
franchise and a major academic health
care system. Our physicians, therapists,

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.800
and trainers will work with the elite
professionals and weekend warriors from

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.680
all sports in the same facilities, and
our slogan, that you'll read when you take

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.760
the tour, 'Go where the players go,' 
will never have been more true."

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.309
BODEN: "This is the main patient lobby."
Dr. Scott Boden, Director of Emory's

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.140
Orthopaedic and Spine Center, kicked off
the press tour of the new facility.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.580
One of the first stops was Peak Performance Project,
a sports training and evaluation service area

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.530
more commonly called P3.
P3 is a world leader in athlete

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.720
performance measurement and sports
science. This P3 headquarters is one of

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.799
only two such facilities in the country.
BODEN: "So there's room for seven physician

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.210
teams to be seeing patients. 
The physicians move this way in this space

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.860
and the patients move across." In addition
to the latest state-of-the-art medical equipment,

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.170
the patient care space is designed 
to enhance efficiency and

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.680
collaboration between the different
clinicians who will be working here.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.030
BODEN: "This facility and the broader Sports Medicine
Program it supports will allow us to

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.090
continue to recruit and retain the best
talent in physicians, nurses, therapists, trainers,

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.490
and all their support staff.
HAWKS STAFF:  "This is where basically
 every practice day starts..."

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.299
Housed in the same building
will be the Hawks' training and

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.509
administrative headquarters.
HAWKS STAFF:  "The next major free agent that Travis

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.300
signs he's going to sign in that room."
Everything from the room where

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.260
draft picks will be evaluated
to a gourmet kitchen

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.080
were on display.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.870
HAWKS STAFF: "We try to communicate
good healthy eating habits."

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.190
Torian Prince, the Hawke's forward, showed us around
the team's locker room and spa.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.820
PRINCE: "From the courts to the training room to the
kitchen to the smoothie area to the

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.460
locker room his first class... and as
players we're definitely appreciative and

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.830
we don't take it for granted.
But perhaps the most impressive spectacle was the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.600
massive world-class practice court where
Atlanta's pro basketball team will hone their skills.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.160
BUDENHOLZER: "When you have a facility
like this, it just takes player

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.780
development to a whole other level.
