00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.910
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
Welcome to the African

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.920
and Middle Eastern Division.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.630
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb,
chief of the division.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.870
And I'm really delighted
to see you all here today.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.700
I'm also extremely happy

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.790
to welcome Kyrgyz Ambassador
Kadyr Toktogulov to the African

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.220
and Middle Eastern Division
of the Library of Congress.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.230
He has been here several times
before, however today he is here

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.390
in an official capacity to
present a short documentary

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.310
on Chingiz Aitmatov, the
most important Kyrgyz author

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.450
of the 20th Century.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.200
Ambassador Toktogulov
was the person

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.110
who originally introduced us to
today's speaker, Jeffrey Lilley.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.810
But in fact we had met
earlier ten years ago

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.840
when we first had a major
conference on Chingiz Aitmatov.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.740
And he was there and he
told me that he was there

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.260
and he had just started
writing his book

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.200
and today we're having Jeffrey
Lilly with a book completed

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.980
and ready to share
with everyone here

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.600
and across the world because,
as you know, we're being webcast

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.380
and therefore this
program is going

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.620
to appear around the world.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.600
And the book with
the wonderful title,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.350
"Have the Mountains Fallen?"

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.650
It's an intriguing title.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.340
I want to hear more about it.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.300
It will be on sale
after this program.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.480
Now a few worlds about
Ambassador Kadyr Toktogulov --

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.790
On December 31,

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:07.370
2014 Kyrgyzstan's President
Almazbek Atambaev appointed him

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.610
as Ambassador Extraordinary
and Plenipotentiary

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.030
of the Kyrgyz Republic to
the United States of America.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.250
And two months later
on February 23,

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.950
2015 he presented
his credentials

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.690
to President Barack
Obama and took office.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.600
However that was not all.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.650
The following year
on February 24,

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.430
2016 Kadyr Toktogulov
was again appointed

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.050
by President Almazbek Atambaev
as Ambassador Extraordinary

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.690
and Plenipotentiary
to Canada this time,

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.950
but as he could not
divide himself into two,

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.170
his residence is
officially in Washington D.C.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.790
So he presented his credentials
to the Governor General

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.550
of Canada David Johnston
on March 22, 2016.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.480
We're thus very honored
today to have

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.370
with us two Ambassadors
in one person.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.600
So we are delighted
to welcome him here.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.790
Prior to his appointment
as Ambassador,

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.940
Kadyr Toktogulov served

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.470
as President Atambaev's Press
Secretary having worked earlier

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.370
as the Chief of Information
Policy in the Office

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.870
of the Prime Minister
of Kyrgyzstan.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.670
There he was in charge of
coordinating media relations

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.190
for the Prime Minister,
his deputies,

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.230
and key government officials.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.400
He also coordinated
media coverage

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.000
of the work of the government.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.850
Ambassador Kadyr Toktogulov
is also a very experienced

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.530
journalist, having
worked as a correspondent

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.190
for the Associated Press
between 2003 and 2006,

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.540
the Dow Jones Newswires, as well
has having contributed a number

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:58.830
of stories for the Wall Street
Journal between 2006 and 2011.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.370
He holds a BA degree
in Journalism

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.880
and Mass Communications
from the American University

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.520
of Central Asia,
Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan,

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.300
and was an exchange student
at Ankara University, Ankara,

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:20.380
Turkey, 1998 and 1999 and also
at Ithaca College between 2001

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.290
and 2002, here in New York.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.620
So in addition to
Kyrgyz he's fluent

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.730
in Russian, English,
and Turkish.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.450
And now let us all
welcome the Ambassador

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.510
who will introduce
a film for today.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:43.470
[ Applause ]

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.770
&gt;&gt; Kadyr Toktogulov:
Thank you very much

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.480
for this very generous
introduction Dr. Mary-Jane Deeb.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.070
Dear friends it's wonderful
to see you all today

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.420
at the book launch of
the newly released book

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.810
by my friend Jeff Lilley.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.320
We've spoken earlier
today to figure

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.340
out what year we actually met
in Kyrgyzstan and we figured

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.100
out it was 2005 in Bishkek.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.540
Before I speak about
today's event and the book

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.300
and the author, Jeff Lilley,

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.230
I'd like to express
my deepest gratitude

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.490
to the Library of Congress.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.350
It's a very special institution
that holds a unique importance

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.450
for the United States
and the world libraries.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.260
Special thanks to the African
and Middle Eastern Division,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.050
Chief of the Division
Dr. Mary-Jane Deeb

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.320
and Joan Weeks Head Near East
Section and Turkish Specialist.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.570
Thank you very much for
hosting today's event.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.630
My embassy colleagues and I
have enjoyed working with you

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.500
on putting together
this book presentation.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.970
I especially enjoyed our
conversations about the vast --

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.400
I especially enjoyed
our conversations

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.100
about the vast collection
of Central Asian literature

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.490
that the Library holds.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.380
And the best moments of our
discussions were talking

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.520
about my home country Kyrgyzstan

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.650
and our most famous writer
the late Chingiz Aitmatov.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.840
I'm grateful to the Library
and to you Dr. Mary-Jane Deeb

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.980
and Joan Weeks for agreeing
to host the presentation

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.500
of this fascinating book,
"Have the Mountains?"

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.140
You told me you liked the title
of the book [laughs] back then

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.350
when we were discussing the
details of today's event

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.040
and I really like it too.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.160
I was a journalist
when Jeff and I met.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.320
He was working in Bishkek
as the Country Director

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.150
of the International Republican
Institute in Bishkek Office.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:29.750
He recently returned
to Kyrgyzstan

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.110
to continue his support
for my country

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.550
and my country's
democratic development.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.630
The book is really fascinating.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.200
It's my country's journey to
independence through the stories

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.910
of its two outstanding
sons that had lived

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.990
through Kyrgyz nation's
tragedies

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.170
in the 20th Century before
the country declared its

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.560
independence in 1991.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.890
I'm very happy that this
event is taking place

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.220
as we celebrate the
90th birthday

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.760
of our great writer
Chingiz Aitmatov.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.660
His books and stories
put Kyrgyzstan on the map

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.960
for many people around the world

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.770
and helped my country stand
firmer in today's world.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.400
I have personal stories about
the two heroes of the book

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.380
that I'd like to share with you.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.380
Chingiz Aitmatov is
my favorite writer.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.440
His books kept me
awake at nights

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.170
as I was reading his
stories about the lives

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:20.750
of his characters during

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.420
and after the Word
War II in Kyrgyzstan.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.280
I was happy when I got
to see him in Ankara

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.350
at the conference
when I was a student.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.200
I would manage to get an
autograph in a book by him

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.730
that I was reading at the time.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.010
He was a great master in how
he told a story of my country

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.540
and people during difficult days

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.850
which tested human beings
courage, decency, kindness,

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.490
generosity, and love
for the country.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.450
The importance of Chingiz
Aitmatov to the Kyrgyz Republic

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.960
and the Kyrgyz people
is significant.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.730
Nobody has made a
stronger contribution

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:54.120
to today's Kyrgyzstan
self-identity than Aitmatov.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.600
This year we're celebrating the
90th birth of our great writer

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.560
and we see this book launch
as part of the celebrations.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.440
When I was here in
the U.S. 2001, 2002,

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.350
I attempted to meet
Azamat Altay.

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:09.800
I was very much fascinated
by his personal story

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.970
of his journey all the
way from Kyrgyzstan

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:15.260
to the U.S. though the horrors
of World War II and challenges

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.200
of his life in Europe.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.620
Through some Kyrgyz contacts
I managed to get hold

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.720
of his home phone
number and dialed him.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.780
As Azamat Altay picked up
the phone and I spoke to him

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.850
in Kyrgyz and told him
that I wanted to visit him,

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.210
he gave me his home address.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.550
But back then there
were no smartphones

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:38.100
that would guide you though
a city that you don't know.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:43.050
I couldn't get any tips on how
to get to Flushing Meadows.

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:46.270
I was in New York for
a couple of days only

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:47.820
so I failed to visit him.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.370
And to be honest I regret not
having made the efforts back

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.950
then to see this great man.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.700
Jeff, you did a great job in
telling the intertwining stories

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.900
of Chingiz Aitmatov
and Azamat Altay.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.220
And through their stories you
told a story of my country.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.890
You really took us through
the days of the Urkun,

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.390
the Great Tragedy and the
flight of the Kyrgyz people

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.480
to China during their
violent crack

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.090
down by the Soviet
Russian troops.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:16.050
You took us through the tragic
years of the World War II.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.650
And in your book you took us

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:21.510
through my country's
journey to independence.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:25.020
It's an emotional book and it's
an important book if one wants

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.500
to learn about the
Kyrgyz Republic

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.580
and its best representatives.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.050
Chingiz Aitmatov and
Azamat Altay are among them.

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:34.760
As Ambassador of an
independent Kyrgyzstan I'd

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.740
like to say thank
you for the book,

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.350
for your hard work writing this
book, and your respect and love

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:45.330
for my country, my
country's people and heroes.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.630
Thank you, Jeff.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:49.590
I really look forward to
the presentation and last

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.170
but not least I'd like to
thank Venera Djumataeva,

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:56.160
Director of Kyrgyz Service of
RFE/RL who came all the way

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:00.240
from Prague for this
event and also helped us

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.000
with the presentation by
making, producing this video

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.810
that we'll see that will
introduce the heroes of the book

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:12.380
that Jeff wrote before
his presentation.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.180
Thank you.

of the century.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.980
Chingiz Aitmatov, the
most famous Kyrgyz writer,

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:01.980
lost his father to Stalin's
repressive regime in 1938

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.300
and only found where his
father had been executed

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.380
and buried 53 years
after it occurred.

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.410
Not only his father, a
promising young Kyrgyz leader,

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:12.790
but several of his
uncles also fell victim

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.890

Aitmatov hid his deep inner
sadness after losing his father

his life to educating himself

to stay in the west after
World War II after realizing

that he would be punished
in the USSR since serving

as a POW in a Nazi Camp.

for 55 years.

at their dachas often built
atop hills with better reception

from Williams College
and a master's degree

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:11.280
in Soviet Studies
from Johns Hopkins.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:17.050
And do you realize it was the
last time they gave that degree

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:23.080
because Soviet Studies turned
into studies of about all

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.610
of the Central Asian Countries.

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:29.430
And he worked as a
journalist in Russia reporting

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:33.630
for the Far Eastern Economic
Review and Sports Illustrated

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:35.990
as well as Voice of America.

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:38.830
And after witnessing the
collapse of the Soviet Union

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:44.220
as a journalist in the 1990s,
he moved to Central Asia in 2004

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.640
where he began to work in the
field of international democracy

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:51.690
and governance in support of
transitions in the countries

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:53.850
of Eurasia in the Middle East.

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:59.880
And during a three-year period
as a posing in Kyrgyzstan

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:04.310
from 2004 to 2007, he
started reading the works

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:06.330
of Chingiz Aitmatov.

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:10.140
He slept in yurts, which I
think is a fabulous opportunity

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.190
to really get to
know the country.

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:13.950
He drank fermented mare's milk.

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:15.550
I'm not sure I'd do that.

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:18.330
He hiked in the country's
beautiful mountains.

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:21.540
And over the next ten years he
worked in the field of democracy

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:22.840
and governance support

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.560
in Washington D.C.
in the Middle East.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:28.860
He continues his research and
finished his book as well.

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:31.720
In 2016 he returned
to Kyrgyzstan

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.490
to lead a British funded
parliamentary support program.

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:39.120
He's also the author of
"China Hands: Nine Decades

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:42.300
of Adventure, Espionage,
and Diplomacy."

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.470

and Joan, I spent a good number

of hours in this Library
working with microfiche,

working with books, and doing
the research for this book,

which is a labor of love,

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:22.020
which as was mentioned took me
ten years to research and write.

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.500
to mark Chingiz Aitmatov's
80th Birthday.

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.590
But instead it became a
celebration of his life

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:51.200
after he died in June 2008.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.340

launched this book project,

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:11.040
which not comes to a close
right here full circle.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:16.030
So onto the book, I'm
going to -- yeah --

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:19.680
so I know everybody here
knows where Kyrgyzstan is

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.900
and I know they know
exactly how it's spelled.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.870
My father, who was a diplomat
was a little bit shaky

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:28.390
on how to pronounce it.

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:31.320
But anyway this is
a map of Kyrgyzstan.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:34.340
And I'll just point out here
-- can you guys see my cursor?

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:37.850
Yeah, Sheker is where Chingiz
Aitmatov is born in the west.

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:40.860
And Kodjomberdiev, right here on
the beautiful Lake Issyk-Kul was

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:44.700
where Azamat Altay was born.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:48.620
So these are two warriors for
freedom from Kyrgyzstan --

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.700
Chingiz Aitmatov
and Azamat Altay.

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.960
And it's a country as
was mentioned by Joan

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.500
that I first lived
in from 2004 to 2007.

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.290
Aitmatov was an intellectual
warrior

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:02.940
and Altay was a battle
hardened warrior literally

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:05.770
who carried the scars of
war with him through life.

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:09.090
Both were embolden by
their experiences to fight

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:14.020
with words -- one writing,
one speaking, the good fight.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.860
So as was mentioned
I arrived in 2004

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.560
and I started reading
Aitmatov's body of work.

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:23.480
Short stories and novels written
over 40 years during my posting

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.940
and I finished a
couple of years later.

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:30.000
That was just the reading, when
working back in Washington D.C.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.510
"Have the Mountains Fallen?"

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:35.880
is a story of the Cold War
from the other side with roots

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.000
in the 1920s and '30s

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.380
when Soviet power was
establishing itself

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.980
across the Eurasian landmass.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.080
It tells the parallel
stories of Aitmatov and Altay,

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:49.850
two men who travel separately
though life until they meet

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:54.790
and find common cause, in of all
places New York City in 1975.

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:56.380
Their life stories
are testaments

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.000
to the human spirit's
quest for freedom.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.550
Their lives are proof that
lives live only for so long.

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:05.550
That truth, as evidence by
the attainment of justice

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:08.630
and redemption is
achievable and that the search

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:13.190
for a meaningful life is
based on individual freedom.

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:17.260
So everybody is familiar
with Kyrgyzstan country,

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:21.530
descended from nomads, 90%
mountains, and home to some

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:25.190
of the most beautiful and
pristine nature in the world,

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:28.420
as you can see from
the cover of the book,

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:30.140
which is actually
my wife's photo.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:32.610
My wife is a photographer
and she's here today.

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:33.910
And we thought we
could do better

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:36.870
than Indiana University Press,
which got a beautiful photo

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:39.790
but my wife's was better.

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:42.710
So let's move on.

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:45.280
Like so many other
citizens, this is a picture

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.820
of Torekul Aitmatov,
Chingiz Aitmatov's father

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.710
and a young Chingiz
when he was probably

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:52.420
about two years old in 1930.

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.840
Like so many other citizens
at that time, Azamat Altay

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:59.180
and Chingiz Aitmatov's
father pictured here,

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:01.900
believed in Soviet power
which had brought literacy,

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:06.130
electricity, hospitals and
schools to the Kyrgyz people.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:09.180
They served it loyally until
Stalin's terror started

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:12.850
to wreak havoc across the
Soviet Union in the 1930s.

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:17.500
The purges swept up
Torekul Aitmatov in 1938.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:22.600
Train station, there's a
vivid scene in the book

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.080
where Chingiz Aitmatov
says goodbye to his father

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.160
and not even knowing that
he'll never see him again

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:30.930
on the train station in Moscow.

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:37.070
Those purges made a
disbeliever out of Azamat Altay

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:41.100
and they shape Chingiz
Aitmatov's life.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:46.040
World War II was a crucible for
both Altay and Chingiz Aitmatov.

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.210
They were eight years
separated, the men.

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:49.700
Altay was born in 1920.

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.730
Chingiz Aitmatov
was born in 1928.

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:56.340
So by the time World War II
happened in the Soviet Union,

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.130
they were both young men.

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:01.780
As a 14-year-old in a
village bereft of men

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:05.480
because they had all
been called to the front,

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.870
Chingiz Aitmatov
delivered death notices

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:11.310
to families whose fathers, sons,
or uncles had died in the war.

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:17.150
So I want to read you a little
passage from the book on that.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.400
So Chingiz Aitmatov has just
delivered a death notice

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.000
to a family.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.930
Chingiz would then stare at
the ground uncomfortable,

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:30.530
14 years old, shifting his feet.

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:32.910
Usually he would hear a
heavy sigh from the mother,

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:34.800
then whimpering or heaving,

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:38.120
and finally crying would rend
the air like a plate shattering.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.890
Chingiz would stand there a
young boy with nowhere to run

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:43.430
and no way to console.

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:45.920
Villagers began associating
the young village assistant

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.220
with bad luck.

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.840
As soon as households
saw him riding

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.900
down the street they would
shun him like an evil spirit.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.900
"Don't come to our house,"
they would say, "Pass by.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.670
Don't bring us bad news."

00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:00.310
Such a young boy shouldering
such heavy responsibilities

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:03.530
to suffer the village's grief
as the messenger of bad news,

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:06.810
a piece of paper in
exchange for a son.

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:09.860
But this was how Soviet Society
endured during World War II

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:13.790
or the Great Patriotic War
as it is known in Russian.

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:16.610
Ironies overwhelm, the
distant war reeking havoc

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:18.490
in an isolated village,

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:21.820
teenagers running village
affairs and a boy not big enough

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:24.470
to mount his horse
delivering death sentences --

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:28.110
not death sentences,
death notices.

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:32.200
Meanwhile Soviet conscript Altay
was scrambling for his life

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.930
after being overrun by the
German Blitzkrieg in June 1941.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:38.150
He was serving in
Soviet occupied Lithuania

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:39.900
at that point.

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:43.690
Altay escaped from Nazi
POW camps not once,

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:45.380
not twice, but three times.

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.260
Eventually joining
French Freedom Fighters

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:49.790
on the march to liberate Paris.

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:52.770
He dreamed of returning to
his home village on Issyk-Kul,

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:56.530
you saw that, but Soviet
Leader Stalin's perverse logic

00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:59.830
considered Soviet
POWs as traitors just

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:03.660
because they had the
misfortune to be captured alive.

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:07.220
That meant prison camp in
Siberia for someone like Altay,

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:09.590
even though he had
crisscrossed Europe fighting

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:13.500
for his own survival and
always opposing the Nazis.

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.040
It was absurd.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.540
Altay ended up making a decision

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:20.840
which irrevocably
change his life.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:22.870
After midnight on --
this is from the book --

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:26.830
After midnight on January
1st, 1946 Altay was serving

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:28.850
as a Soviet border guard then --

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:30.150
as revelers and cities

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:32.390
around Europe were raising
their glasses to the end

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:36.420
of World War II, Soviet border
guard Azamat Altay tossed aside

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:39.970
his rifle, threw off his
military overcoat and stole

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:41.820
across the boarder
into the English zone

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:44.160
of recently liberated Germany.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.590
Altay headed south from the
English zone in Germany,

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:50.120
he was determined to get
to France, the only country

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.080
that had welcomed him
and where he had friends

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.820
from his partisan days.

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:55.790
Using a smattering
of French, German,

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:58.760
and Russian he begged a ticket
off an elderly station worker

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.060
at the Saarbrucken
Train Station.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:04.700
Lacking permission to cross the
still-militarized German-French

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:08.850
border, he stowed away, hiding
in the first-class bathroom.

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:11.680
Altay arrived in Paris,
a free but penniless man,

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.650
with not a French
franc to his name.

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:16.810
A passerby gave him two
francs to ride on the subway.

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:19.350
It was a bumble start
to a new life,

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:23.470
but with each mile he traveled
on foot by train or subway --

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:26.800
he was leaving behind the
tragedies of the past.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.790
In Europe after the war, Altay
scrambled to make a living.

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:32.690
He did manual labor in
small towns in France.

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:35.910
It was a lonely time with few
friends among the rural French

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:38.090
who had no idea where
he came from.

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:40.850
As a matter of fact there's
this little story in the book

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:44.840
about Altay was so
lonely that he got a dog

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:48.010
and he would put this dog in
a cart and then he would kind

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:50.990
of wheel the cart I guess around
the little village he was in

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:53.430
and he named the dog
"My Friend" in Kyrgyz,

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:55.010
which is "Menin Dosum".

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:56.310
And they called him --

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:59.070
the French villagers called
him "The Chinese with a dog."

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:04.450
That's the best they could get.

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:08.150
Altay eventually educated
himself anew, immersing himself

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:10.680
in European philosophy in
the struggle for independence

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.060
of Soviet Central Asia.

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:14.640
in 1953, as we saw in
that wonderful film,

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.670
he became the voice of Radio
Liberty broadcasting back

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:19.040
into Soviet Kyrgyzsia.

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.520
So it's two parallel stories.

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.850
So I'm going to be
jumping back and forth.

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:25.930
Meanwhile, Aitmatov, scarred by
the disappearance of his father,

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:27.960
here's Aitmatov as a
young man you can see.

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:32.100
I guess he's to his
mother's left.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:35.680
And this is his brother Ilgez,
and this is his sister Roza

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.350
who is still alive and well.

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:40.290
And Ilgez and Roza are both
alive and well in Bishkek

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:44.450
in their 80s, and this is
his sister Luzia behind him.

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:48.720
So scarred by the disappearance
of his father in 1937,

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:51.720
Aitmatov was keeping his head
down and as the eldest male

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.230
in the family, nine years old,

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:55.200
trying to help his
family survive,

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.760
he was considered the son
of an enemy of the people,

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:02.060
denied his scholarship, refused
his stipend, and denied entrance

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:05.310
into graduate school
despite stellar grades.

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:07.120
He took to writing instead.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.350
He wrote stories of independent
minded fallible people

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:13.720
who on the outside may have
been loyal Soviet citizens.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:17.170
But reading between the lines
his heroes bucked the system.

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:18.940
Whether it was patriarchal
tradition,

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:21.770
Soviet ideology, or groupthink.

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:24.860
How Aitmatov did this under
Soviet censorship is one

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:27.410
of the most fascinating
parts of this story.

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:30.950
He contorted himself, hid
behind the Kyrgyz language,

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:34.020
which sensors didn't
understand, and compromised

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.820
where and when necessary.

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:37.660
As someone who knew
him well told me

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:40.500
when I was researching the book,

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:44.800
"When Chingiz Aitmatov got
behind a desk he couldn't lie."

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:52.700
So he starts to break into
fame and be famous., in 1963,

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.000
and his reputation

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.940
or his family's reputation
is resurrected

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:59.360
when he wins the Lenin
Prize of 1963 for a series

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:03.020
of short stories, one of which
was "Jamila", who I'm sure a lot

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.360
of people in this
room have read.

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:05.660
Beautiful story.

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:07.580
So here is a wonderful picture

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.570
of Chingiz Aitmatov selling
his books at a book fair.

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:13.190
And you can see "Jamila"
right there in the background.

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:16.010
It was a couple of years
after "Jamila" came out.

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:17.880
Just a neat, neat
picture that I found

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:20.390
in the archives in Bishkek.

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:26.930
So then Altay fearful that
Soviet spies would try

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:29.890
to assassinate him for his
radio work, Altay immigrated

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:33.650
to the U.S. and he was one of
the first Kyrgyz ever to do so.

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:36.980
He settled in New York
City as Kadyr knows,

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:38.880
in Flushing Meadows, right?

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.440
A melting pot of nationalities
and Cold War intrigues.

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.340
And he started a
20-year career working

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:47.330
in the New York public libraries
-- a New York public library

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:48.630
and Columbia University Library.

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:52.480
I think Altay would feel very at
home at the Library of Congress.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.340
I am sure he was
here many times.

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:57.880
So now it gets neat.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.870
You have these two parallel
stories of men living

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:03.120
and what was fascinating
to me is when I decided

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:06.210
to incorporate Altay into the
story, which is a couple years

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:09.940
after I had started
research Aitmatov's life,

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:13.440
I found out the way
their lives intersected.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:17.610
So far from home, cut off
from his family and culture,

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:19.230
Altay suffered immensely.

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:22.220
He was a persona non grata
having been declared a traitor

00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:24.910
after jumping lines and
sentenced to 25 years

00:34:24.910 --> 00:34:27.520
in jail should he ever
return to the Soviet Union.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.820
His name was blackened

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:31.790
by propaganda campaigns
in Soviet Kyrgyzia.

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:34.860
His solace was music
of his homeland.

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:38.060
Lilting melodies played on the
Kyrgyz three-string guitar,

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:42.090
the komuz and Aitmatov's
stories, which formed part

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:46.170
of his collection of 5,000,
6,000 books on Central Asia

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:49.510
in his personal library
in Queens New York.

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:53.150
So about that meeting
in 1975, in the 1970s

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:55.600
when the two men's lives
intersected for the first time.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.090
Now this is the Cold War.

00:34:57.090 --> 00:35:00.740
Alta is persona non grata
in the Soviet Union.

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:04.450
The KGB is alive and
strong and here's a picture

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:05.750
of these two men meeting

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:09.010
in Altay's apartment
in Queen's New York.

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:12.330
So that's the American
angle to the book.

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:14.760
During a period of warming
and U.S. Soviet relations

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.660
in the 1970s when
Space cooperation

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:19.530
between the countries started

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:21.270
and cultural exchanges
took place,

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:23.970
we all call that detente,
we called it detente.

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:27.140
Aitmatov got invited to the
U.S. for the performance

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:29.900
of a play he had
written about Stalinism

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:32.870
and the scars it had left
on the Kyrgyz people.

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:35.260
As a big fan of Aitmatov's
works,

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:39.730
Altay played an instrumental
role in Aitmatov getting invited

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:41.420
by the U.S. State Department.

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:44.070
He was very helpful
in getting the visa.

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:46.990
The two men met in
Aitmatov's New York hotel room

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:50.780
on the very day that Soviet and
American astronauts shook hands

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:53.830
in space during the
Apollo-Soyuz hookup.

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:56.080
You can't make that stuff up.

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:59.990
And I just want to read
a passage from the book.

00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:03.030
The scene was an uncanny
terrestrial version

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:05.880
of the nomadic events that had
happened earlier in the day.

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:09.610
At noon New York time Apollo
had achieved a firm linkup

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:13.040
with Soyuz over the
Atlantic Ocean 620 miles west

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.340
of Portugal.

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:16.470
In a culmination of
three years of joint work

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:18.350
by the Cold War rivals.

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:21.840
Soviet cosmonaut Alexey Leonov
welcomed American astronaut Tom

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:25.180
Stafford through the hatches
with a hearty handshake.

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:28.500
President Ford and General
Secretary Brezhnev sent

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.730
congratulating messages
to the crews.

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.540
It Aitmatov's hotel
that evening,

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:40.340
620 miles lower a celebratory
atmosphere prevailed

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:42.120
but of a far different nature.

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:44.700
The impromptu gathering
of Kyrgyz in New York,

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:48.150
though unpublicized had
as much significance

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:52.510
for the Kyrgyz people as did
the Apollo-Soyuz handshake,

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:53.810
maybe even more.

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:55.620
It represented a coming together

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:58.170
of the disparate parts
of the Kyrgyz elite.

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:01.290
Two leading cultural lights of
Soviet Kyrgyzia in the same room

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:03.760
with the founding voice
of the Kyrgyz service

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.600
of American's Radio Liberty.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.110
A Kyrgyz Hall of
Fame, if you will.

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:11.750
What unified then was blood,
and the simple joy of connection

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:13.570
that stood as an affirmation

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:16.370
that the Kyrgyz people
were living, existing,

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:20.190
and staying together, even
across ideological divides

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:22.980
that seemed insurmountable
to so many --

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:25.390
the day's events
not withstanding.

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:31.200
In 1979, Altay returned
to Radio Liberty in Munich

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:33.460
and headed the Kyrgyz service.

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:36.080
He arrived in time to
chronicle the demise

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:39.130
of his archenemy
the Soviet Union.

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:42.830
As the Soviet Union stumbled
into Afghanistan in the 1980s,

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:46.150
Aitmatov's pros got stronger.

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:48.590
Aitmatov was widely
published in the USSR

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:52.600
and around the world
in 160 languages.

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:55.510
But his public statements
often sang the praises

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:57.240
of the Soviet system.

00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:01.700
That was the price of Aitmatov's
inner freedom to write his mind,

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.000
to write his conscience.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.110
Freedom inside had
to be purchased

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:07.870
with compromise from
the outside.

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:14.670
With the advent of perestroika
the two men, Azamat Altay

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:16.800
and Chingiz Aitmatov
met more frequently

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:21.680
with Aitmatov brushing
aside the increasingly KGB.

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:25.020
Aitmatov was appointed a member
of Gorbachev's reform team

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:26.780
and spoke openly about failures

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:30.380
of the Soviet system during
perestroika and the importance

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:32.560
of restoring the place
of language, history,

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:34.410
and culture for the Kyrgyz

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:37.840
and other constituent
Republics of the USSR.

00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:44.100
This photo, likely from 1989
shows a relaxed gathering

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:47.360
in Munich, Kyrgyz
style, with Aitmatov,

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:50.590
the honored guest getting
the head of the lamb.

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:54.220
Altay, the oldest at the table
is seated to Aitmatov's left.

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:58.940
But one meeting in particular
symbolized the new era.

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:02.060
A time of hope and
ultimately redemption .

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:05.760
Aitmatov was in Munich
presenting his latest book.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:08.890
Unbeknownst to him, Altay
and other Kyrgyz working

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:11.620
at Radio Liberty
were in the audience.

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:14.140
The KGB in an effort
to avoid a meeting

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:17.470
between the two men hustled
Aitmatov and his wife Maria

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:21.250
out of the hall and
into a waiting car.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:25.420
A James Bond like
car chase ensued.

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:27.530
So this is from the book.

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:29.700
When the car carrying
the Aimatov's arrived

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:33.140
at their hotel a white van
pulled up right behind.

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:34.600
Outstepped Azamat Altay

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.530
with several Kyrgyz
adults and children.

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:41.100
The wary KGB agent rushed
to block their approach

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:43.450
but Aitmatov halted them.

00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:47.680
"These are my people.

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:52.190
Let me speak with them."

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:53.490
He said.

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:05.670
Aitmatov's simple
gesture spoke volumes.

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:09.370
It said, "That's enough."

00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:12.300
Excuse me.

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:15.550
And with his command to
the two KGB officers fear

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:18.640
and silence engrained in the
Kyrgyz people for decades

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:22.070
and carried by Aitmatov
himself started to recede.

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:25.790
It was as if Aitmatov were
saying it was time to learn how

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:28.140
to live in a normal society.

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:34.970
No more keeping silent, no more
fear, and no more tragedies.

00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:37.710
Yes, the fatherless
Aitmatov seemed to be saying,

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:40.370
"Let the next generation
of Kyrgyz grow

00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:43.890
up with their fathers and
let the KGB learn another way

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:46.400
to carry out its work.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.700
So this is a fun picture.

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:54.390
Altay returned to Kyrgyzstan in
1995 after a 55-year absence.

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:56.800
His criminal sentence was
abolished and he was greeted

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:59.610
like a hero in independent
Kyrgyzstan.

00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:01.010
When he stepped off the plane

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:03.410
onto the tarmac he
kissed the ground.

00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:07.240
There to meet him
was Chingiz Aitmatov.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:14.070
So you can see here Altay
is under the orange arrow,

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:15.470
Chingiz Aitmatov
is under the blue,

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:18.120
and under the green is
Chingiz Aitmatov's son, Askar,

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:21.750
who is a Kyrgyz diplomat
in New York at the time,

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:25.030
and Askar got Azamat
Altay the visa

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:29.330
and Askar accompanied Azamat
Altay all the way back

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:31.420
to Kyrgyzstan at a time
when there weren't --

00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:33.740
you had to go through Tashkent

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:35.040
and wait hours, hours,
and hours.

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:38.050
So it's really kind of neat
that the Aitmatov's were

00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:41.660
on both sides taking
care of Altay.

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.050
So what are the lessons
from their lives?

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:45.600
The individual accounts.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.330
Freedom of thought, speech, and
religion are the foundations

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:50.540
of a democratic society.

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:53.060
And take nothing for granted.

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:54.560
Nothing is guaranteed.

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.600
Dedicate yourself to what you
believe in, structure your life

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.610
to achieve it, base
decisions upon it and yes,

00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:03.980
be ready to make compromises
to achieve the larger goal,

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:06.460
and in the case of Azamat Altay,

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:09.530
be ready to lose precious
things along the way.

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:12.310
"The moral arc of history
bends towards justice."

00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:14.130
Martin Luther King said.

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:17.550
Both men, Azamat Altay and
Chingiz Aitmatov found justice

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:21.270
in their lifetimes and that's
the redemption in the title.

00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:25.710
So Altay's redemption we could
see was returning to Kyrgyzstan

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:29.590
and as we saw in that wonderful
film, being greeted like a hero

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:33.820
by his fellow countrymen
and women.

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:40.270
A few years earlier Aitmatov
himself before Altay's return,

00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:44.200
Altay himself after decades
of looking found his father,

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.600
Torekul Aitmatov was at
the bottom of a grave

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:49.880
with 137 other skeletons
piled on top,

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.240
all victims of Stalin's purges.

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.190
Dry conditions in
the mass grave,

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:55.830
which had been a brick kiln,

00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:59.570
had preserved the written order
sentencing Torekul Aitmatov,

00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:02.170
his father, Chingiz's, to death.

00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:05.970
The excavation of the mass
grave captivated Soviet Kyrgyzia

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:07.960
during the Summer of 1991.

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:12.860
And I'm going to show you a
little bit of a video here.

00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:19.380
So this is a video that
was taken by the people

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:21.710
who were excavating
the grave and pulling

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:25.450
out these skulls, 137.

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:30.270
Pulling out personal
objects that were preserved

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:35.970
in the climate, this
warm climate.

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.500
These are shoes.

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:47.000
This is the brick kiln that
became the burial ground.

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:58.840
Here are other artifacts.

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:04.730
This all happened
in July of 1991,

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:07.000
six months before the
collapse of the Soviet Union.

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:20.630
So here you can see in his
kalpak the worker is digging.

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:24.480
And here they're
pulling out the letters.

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:27.630
These are the sentencing
documents that preserved

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:31.460
that had the names of the
people who were executed

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:36.070
and then they were able to
match the bodies to the people

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:37.620
and they were able
to tell relatives

00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:41.850
who had waited 53 years that
they had found the remains

00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:47.590
of their fathers,
brothers, husbands.

00:44:47.590 --> 00:44:53.360
So that gives you a sense.

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:56.150
Aitmatov himself gave
voice to the miracle --

00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:57.850
so this is from the book --

00:44:57.850 --> 00:45:00.850
this is a quote e from
Chingiz Aitmatov --

00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:03.050
"Everything disappeared,
disintegrated,

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:05.990
the bodies of the unfortunate
people, their shoes, clothes,"

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:09.580
Aitmatov would say a few weeks
later, "except this paper,

00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:11.780
this document from
that era, with the name

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:19.340
of Torekul Aitmatov, which
remained intact enough to read."

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:21.550
Dry conditions had
preserved the documents,

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:24.580
but the Aitmatov family know
that something else was at work

00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:26.770
in solving the gruesome mystery.

00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:29.380
And so did many other Kyrgyz.

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:31.610
"There is in the world
some higher justice.

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:32.910
"There is in the world
some higher justice,

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:34.210
timeless, and absolute."

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:37.190
Aitmatov said, "something maybe
beyond our everyday existence."

00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:39.730
Loss, redemption, and
hope, a true story

00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:43.510
of the Cold War from
Central Asia.

00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:55.040
[ Applause ]

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.340
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Thank you so much

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.100
for such a brilliant
presentation.

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:01.510
We have all been so
inspired by all of this.

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:04.060
We do have time for
a couple of questions

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:08.000
so if someone has a
question please go ahead.

00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:20.590
&gt;&gt; I didn't ask of this, Jeff,
but how did you come to decide

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:25.290
to write about [inaudible],
both of them on one book.

00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:28.160
They have own books and stories.

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:35.550
It was very [inaudible]
managed to tell the stories

00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:39.530
of two great men in one book.

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:41.680
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Lilley: I initially
wanted to write a biography

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:46.430
of Aitmatov because I really
liked his writing and I thought

00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:47.990
that this is writer

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:50.600
that actually Americans
should know about.

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:55.470
So that was the original idea
and I didn't find any biography

00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:56.900
of Aitmatov in English.

00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:59.920
And so that's what I started
out for three years doing

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:04.720
and then I was interviewing
[inaudible] from Radio Liberty

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:08.390
and he -- I was interviewing
him about Aitmatov

00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:10.140
and he mentioned Altay.

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:12.930
And I had never known -- I had
never heard of Altay's name.

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:15.790
The whole time I was in
Kyrgyzstan for three years,

00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:19.240
and he told me all about him and
I just thought wow, you know,

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.890
that's a pretty interesting
story too and he was outside,

00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:24.280
Aitmatov was inside, and I
didn't know what I would find

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:25.980
but I just -- it would
be more interesting --

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:29.540
it was just a more interesting
story to me at that point.

00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:31.160
And as you as a formal
journalist,

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:34.440
you know good stories are
important and weaving it.

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:37.200
So I just then decided
to weave them,

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:40.580
and then as I said the
other day, I think a writer,

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:42.680
you have to be lucky too.

00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:44.750
And I was lucky because
I didn't know

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:48.350
that they had met
in New York in 1975.

00:47:48.350 --> 00:47:49.650
I mean I think [inaudible]
said that,

00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:53.330
but then I found a letter
courtesy of [inaudible]

00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:56.940
that Altay wrote to a friend
after he had just met Aitmatov

00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:59.320
and he realized what
an important meeting

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:00.680
that was for him.

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:04.460
The photos were there and
then people were still alive,

00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:06.880
you know, and I could
get the story.

00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:11.190
Yes Mary-Jane?

00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:19.550
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:23.140
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Lilley: Yes, well
I'll tell you, as was mentioned

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:28.680
in the film, Aitmatov lost a lot
of cousins and family members --

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:30.580
three uncles, and I
can't even remember,

00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:32.480
and his father to the purges.

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:35.200
Of his own family,
there were four kids,

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:40.180
Chingiz was the oldest
and Ilgez was second,

00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:43.940
and Ilgez was a scientist, a
geologist, he's still alive.

00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:46.480
He was head of the
Academy of Sciences.

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.020
He was -- you know, worked

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:52.320
in the geological
mining industry I think,

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:56.020
I'm not quite sure,
but he is about 80 --

00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:58.130
he must be 87 or something now.

00:48:58.130 --> 00:49:02.030
Because Chingiz would be 90,
so he's two years younger,

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:03.370
88, distinguished man.

00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:07.260
And then Roza is alive
and well in Bishkek

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:08.560
and she was the youngest.

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:11.810
And she was nine months old
when her father disappeared.

00:49:11.810 --> 00:49:13.150
Never knew her father.

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:14.870
She's written a bunch
of good books,

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:18.240
which have been very helpful,
about the family history.

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:20.710
So she's alive and
well and was very --

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:24.720
she was trained as a teacher
and very active in NGO work

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:27.040
for many years after
independence.

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:30.170
And then, actually
Roza is youngest.

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:38.350
Luzia was the third and Luzia
went to the Technical Institute

00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:40.700
and got a degree -- I can't
remember, in engineering.

00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:42.920
She died relatively young.

00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:44.480
I think in the mid '70s.

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:46.630
But she was born as a twin.

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:48.410
And there was a boy and a girl.

00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:50.660
Luzia was born and the boys name
was Revo [assumed spelling],

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:54.850
so when you put it
together it's a Revo-Luzia,

00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:57.180
which shows you how
their parents

00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:03.100
where such committed
Communist to the cause.

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:07.770
And yet the father gets
purged, you know, it's insanity.

00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:12.140
So she passed away but she
has a son, a couple of kids,

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:16.170
and he is a writer and he has
written some interesting works

00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:19.800
about legacy of his uncle.

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:28.880
Roza remained, Ilgez
remained, yes, and yeah.

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:31.510
That's right.

00:50:31.510 --> 00:51:29.680
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:31.940
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Lilley: Right, I
mean, I think -- I don't know.

00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:38.680
I probably did 30, 40
interviews around the world --

00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:40.940
Europe, US., Kyrgyzstan.

00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:51.850
In terms of feedback, good
feedback, I was very gratified

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:56.120
to get an email the other
day from the former president

00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:59.920
of Norton Publishing and
the former chairman emeritus

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:03.970
of the Yale University Press,
one man, who was very helpful

00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:08.590
to me during the attempt
to find a publisher

00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:12.990
because I didn't write this
book having a publisher saying,

00:52:12.990 --> 00:52:15.970
"Jeff, we're going to
publish this book."

00:52:15.970 --> 00:52:21.070
So it was, I was I had to go out
and market it and as they say,

00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:25.550
you only need one person to
say yes, but a lot do say no.

00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:29.590
So his name is -- well,
it's not important --

00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:35.740
but he said something to
the effect of "History told

00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:39.320
at its best, narratives, scope,

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:42.880
pace" and that was
really gratifying.

00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:46.190
I think, yeah, the other
people I've talked to --

00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:48.250
I haven't been back to the
states since it was published,

00:52:48.250 --> 00:52:53.060
I just got back four days ago,
have found it to be a good read,

00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:59.990
a page turner, you know, yeah
and educating them about a part

00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:01.660
of the world they may not
have known much about.

00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:04.860
But I think the thing
that I hope connects is

00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:06.490
that these are two
human individuals

00:53:06.490 --> 00:53:09.010
and it's actually
a universal story

00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:14.960
that transcends geography
or state borders.

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:17.510
Yes?

00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:27.790

00:53:27.790 --> 00:53:29.320
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Lilley:
Yes, you know,

00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:32.530
I think I was pretty lucky --

00:53:32.530 --> 00:53:35.120
no I was very lucky and I
think that's a testament

00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:38.860
to Kyrgyzstan being open.

00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:41.700
You know, I had researchers
on the ground because I wasn't

00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:46.690
in Kyrgyzstan for a lot of
the time and they were able

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:49.770
to get everything, you
know, that we needed.

00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:54.080
But I made requests here
as well, FOIA requests,

00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:56.860
and you know, our bureaucracy
is slow but, you know,

00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:59.350
eventually I got a response,

00:53:59.350 --> 00:54:04.430
so actually the research
was pretty darn good,

00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:09.070
pretty darn good, and I
felt lucky about that.

00:54:09.070 --> 00:54:10.900
Yeah.
