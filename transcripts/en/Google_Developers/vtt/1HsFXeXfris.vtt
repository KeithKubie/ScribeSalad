AMIR SHEVAT: So hi everybody.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.630
Thank you for coming.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.850
I hope you've enjoyed
Google I/O up until now.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.160
My name is Amir Shevat.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.770
I used to run Campus Tel
Aviv, if you heard about that,

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.930
and now I run our global
startup outreach out

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.560
of developer relations.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.730
We have a distinguished
list of panelists

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.860
and I'll let them
introduce themselves.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:29.360
Yep.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.787
Let's do that.

00:00:30.787 --> 00:00:31.620
FADI BISHARA: Great.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.259
Thanks, Amir.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.380
So my name is Fadi Bishara.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.540
I'm the founder of Black Box.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.600
We are an accelerator based
here in Silicon Valley focusing

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.360
exclusively on helping startups
from outside of Silicon Valley.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.750
So we act a little bit
more like an accelerator

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.390
off other accelerators.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.920
We help some of
these companies come

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.100
in here and access resources
and launch into this market.

00:00:57.594 --> 00:00:58.260
EDEN SOCHAT: Hi.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.580
Eden Sochat.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.140
I guess I built stuff.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.990
So I build GeekCon I
spoke about before.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.730
Biggest geeks conference,
makers conference in Israel.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.230
After that, The Junction which
is now the number one startup

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.650
accelerator in Israel.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.380
After that face.com
that is now Facebook.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.130
Before that, Eternity
that is a company that

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.430
is not very interesting
but is growing really fast.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.390
And now part of a VC in Israel
called Aleph, a $150 million

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.240
fund out of Israel.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.080
ROY GLASBERG: So
I'm Roy from Google

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.900
running developer relations
programs for Europe

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.455
and running Campus Tel Aviv.

00:01:36.455 --> 00:01:37.770
AARON HARRIS: I'm Aaron Harris.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.040
I'm a partner at Y Combinator
down in Mountain View.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.030
AMIR SHEVAT: So the topic
of the conversation,

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.430
unless you have other
interesting topics,

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.170
is the connection between--
the difference between startups

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.530
in the Silicon Valley and
startups outside of the Silicon

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.030
Valley.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.460
So the first question I have is,
we hear a lot about the Silicon

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.410
Valley, we hear about
the Silicon [INAUDIBLE],

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.560
we hear about the
Silicon roundabout.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.340
I'd like to know, what is,
in your way of thinking,

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.030
what is the difference
between startups here versus

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.590
startups outside, and what are
the different challenges they

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.784
have?

00:02:13.784 --> 00:02:14.950
FADI BISHARA: I start again?

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.160
AMIR SHEVAT: Great.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.840
FADI BISHARA: OK.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.990
So startups in Silicon
Valley, they're

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.220
playing in a familiar
environment, familiar ground,

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.980
experienced ecosystem.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.340
A lot of the participants
have come from companies

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.410
that they've been through
some of the fast growth stage

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.560
so they have a lot more
experience in stepping

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.100
out and starting again and
launching their companies.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.350
So that's one of the
most obvious distinction.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.130
The ecosystem that we have here
doesn't exist anywhere else

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.460
and in the capacity
it does here.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.689
I've been travelling the
passed three years more than 40

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:55.980
countries and I'm meeting
with entrepreneurs all around

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.010
the world, and the common
things that I see different,

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.880
that is they lack the expertise
of experienced entrepreneurs

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.070
who are mentors and experts who
built companies themselves that

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.390
they typically would be
very effective in helping

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.270
the founders in that journey.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:22.530
So the startups there, they
tend to be a little bit more,

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.680
in my opinion, more
hungrier, attachment

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.404
to who they're working with.

00:03:29.404 --> 00:03:31.820
One of the things that I've
noticed in Silicon Valley that

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.760
is-- well, of course,
the willingness

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.830
to fail in Silicon
Valley or the permission

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.340
to fail that we have here
doesn't exist anywhere else.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.030
In Europe you're pretty
screwed if you launch a company

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.860
and raise money and
then the company fails.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.550
You probably can't get
job in some countries.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.260
So the issue that
I think here is

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.120
kind of like went a little too
far is we've taken this failure

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.980
concept I think to an extreme.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.580
Where a lot of
entrepreneurs here

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.800
are just swinging
the bat just looking

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.100
for very high, fast
growth, and if something

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.260
doesn't work there isn't
the kind of sinking

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.384
their teeth, the bulldozer
thing that I think if I meet

00:04:06.384 --> 00:04:08.550
good entrepreneurs, passionate
entrepreneurs outside

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.580
of Silicon Valley, they tend to
be a little bit more attached

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.800
and more persistent in figuring
something out and doing

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.990
something that works well.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.200
So the issue with failure is
definitely much more difficult

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.830
for them, there's
not enough ecosystem,

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.430
they're trying with Greenfield--
not much to learn from.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.022
Startups outside of
the US, they tend

00:04:30.022 --> 00:04:32.480
to-- the founder-- they tend
to drink a lot more beer which

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.880
is, I think, another advantage.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.770
And, yeah, that's probably
what I can think of.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.030
EDEN SOCHAT: So I guess Israel
is fairly similar in many ways

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.460
to the lack of
issue with failure.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.420
So that's something that
differentiates Israel

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.900
from most of the
world and makes it

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.860
fairly similar to
Silicon Valley.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.220
So Wix, the founders' recent
IPO-- $1.2 billion IPO--

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.850
failed in their three
previous endeavors.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.000
Another thing to keep
in mind is Israel

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.640
is a very small country--
so 8 million people--

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.310
of which 270,000 are part
of the high tech industry.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.030
So that's a pretty small number.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.660
But they own 16% of the GDP.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.220
So it's a highly
centralized-- that's

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.550
one of the fastest money
suppliers to that market.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.342
And as such, you still have a
constant scarcity of resources.

00:05:23.342 --> 00:05:25.050
So in many ways,
Israel, the disadvantage

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.040
is distribution, by far.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.460
And we'll talk about
distribution later I think.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.510
Because it is away from
that central market.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.860
But the other disadvantage
which becomes the advantage

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.430
is scarcity.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.850
There is relatively less
capital and so, for example,

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.160
pre-money valuations in
Israel is much lower.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.210
Money is not as available
which makes companies much more

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.070
efficient.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.300
That's the upside of
starting up and being

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.930
able to fail many times,
but that's also the downside

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.890
because when we want to
grow, having someone funnel

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.590
$50 million checks
is not as common.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.160
So that's the biggest
differentiator.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.460
Yes, there's absolute
willingness to fail,

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.450
distribution is not as
easy, money is more scarce

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.610
making companies--
starting a company easier

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.840
because people are used
to, but it's harder

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.645
to scale the
company's afterwards.

00:06:16.645 --> 00:06:18.520
ROY GLASBERG: Totally
agree with what you guy

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.250
said so I can add maybe
two interesting points

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.420
of perspective.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.110
One of them is the
disruptive thinking,

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.760
is actually believing that as a
startup you can build something

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.880
totally new that's going
to change everything

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.100
that we know so far and going
to teach people or users

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.720
and get them to do stuff that
they haven't done before.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.840
So I think that disruptive
thinking is something

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.259
that for sure you can see
here in Silicon Valley

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:44.550
but you can also see in Israel.

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.210
Which is very interesting.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.570
Not only mainstream startups
building on other ecosystems

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.890
building on other
platforms being

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:55.650
an add on or some cool addition
to it, but just thinking I

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.885
can build a new ecosystem, I
can build a new monster company

00:06:58.885 --> 00:07:00.260
that's going to
change the world.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.650
So that's one thing that I
think is a great differentiator

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.860
especially when
you look at Europe.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.000
A second differentiator is
the hunger, the basic hunger.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.280
You talked about being
scrappy, as we are in Israel,

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.740
but the hunger to do things,
the hunger to create,

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.270
the hunger to
achieve, the hunger

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:22.006
to step out of your
comfort zone and go and do

00:07:22.006 --> 00:07:24.130
crazy stuff although you're
not going to make money

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.470
for a lot of time,
maybe not at all,

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.400
is another differentiator
that I think

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.520
is a very basic, very
primitive, but a very important

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.710
element of building a
successful startup industry.

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.060
So these are, I think, the
main two differentiators

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.955
that I notice.

00:07:39.955 --> 00:07:41.580
AARON HARRIS: I don't
think I have much

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.120
to add to what you guys said.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.904
It's pretty exhaustive.

00:07:45.904 --> 00:07:46.820
AMIR SHEVAT: Oh, yeah.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:47.250
Of Course.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:47.640
FADI BISHARA: Yeah.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.680
Just want to add one more thing.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.850
I just agree with Roy.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:53.250
I think there's some
psychological difference

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.610
with the founders that I see.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.395
In Silicon Valley
there is definitely

00:07:56.395 --> 00:07:58.520
that belief that you could
go and change the world,

00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.880
do something.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.860
Outside of here, very difficult
for entrepreneurs to really

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.740
have that big thinking mentality
that-- to go for something big.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.480
It's just a self permission
that-- it takes exposure to

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.500
and seeing an
example of to adopt.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.020
So I think that's--
you mentioned in Israel

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.600
as an ecosystem, but I think
Israel has done a phenomenal

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.630
job with building the
entrepreneur ecosystem.

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:24.120
That a lot of the stuff
that is existing in here

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.124
is quickly adopted over there.

00:08:27.124 --> 00:08:27.790
AMIR SHEVAT: OK.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.040
So I'm going to start with
a question to you, Aaron.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.010
And feel free to fill in.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:34.840
Do you think that--
how many of you

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.011
who are here outside of the US?

00:08:38.011 --> 00:08:38.510
OK.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.409
So do you think these
guys should come here

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:41.770
to do their startup?

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.260
Does it make sense to come,
if you have a startup,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.900
and at which stage?

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.040
If you think that's
wise, at which stage

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.850
should they come here?

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:50.600
AARON HARRIS: Yes.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.536
So in our last batch
at YC-- I don't

00:08:52.536 --> 00:08:54.410
know what the count is
for this current batch

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:55.285
that we just started.

00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:58.230
We had founders
from 23 countries.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:01.290
And we tell people
and what I tell

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.210
anyone I meet who's
from another country

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.680
and is thinking about YC
is that it's a great idea

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.890
to come here and do YC and
spend the three months here.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:09.931
Right?

00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:11.680
Companies are in
slightly different stages

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.610
for doing that, but I
think it's particularly

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.859
helpful at the very early
stage for the company

00:09:16.859 --> 00:09:18.900
and for the founders,
especially if they've never

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.870
seen how things work here.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:25.640
There's a palpable energy in
Silicon Valley around startups

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.330
that is different than
anywhere else in the world.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.817
And it's actually-- it's not
so much the fear of failure

00:09:30.817 --> 00:09:32.400
that doesn't exist
here, it's the fact

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.274
that it's normal to go
and do this incredibly

00:09:34.274 --> 00:09:35.879
crazy and potentially
stupid thing.

00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:38.295
And so you have this support
network built in and like all

00:09:38.295 --> 00:09:40.740
these you talk to-- I
remember when I left finance

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:45.340
to start my company, everyone
I talked to-- this is in 2010

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:49.130
in New York-- people
were like, eeeeh, really?

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.131
Oooh, do you need a job?

00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:51.963
I'm like, no, no, I
want to start a company.

00:09:51.963 --> 00:09:53.338
And here it's the
exact opposite.

00:09:53.338 --> 00:09:55.879
I mean it's changed a little
bit in other parts of the world.

00:09:55.879 --> 00:09:58.220
So coming here and then getting
infused with that energy

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.849
and with that philosophy
I think is critical.

00:10:00.849 --> 00:10:02.640
But then go back to
wherever you came from.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.075
Right?

00:10:04.075 --> 00:10:04.890
If you want.

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:06.530
Stay here if you
think that's best,

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.010
but if it's best
for your company

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:12.340
to go back to Israel or England
or China or wherever it is,

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.160
do that and bring the
philosophy and the energy

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:21.190
that you found here back to
the community that-- from which

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:22.470
you're from.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.366
EDEN SOCHAT: I'd be
concerned about that,

00:10:24.366 --> 00:10:25.240
just looking at this.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.300
I think that Silicon Valley
does a lot of times act

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.770
as an echo chamber
and you see people

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:35.360
working on similar problems and
not necessarily the problems

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.340
that they are the best
equipped at solving.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.500
So we talked about this over
lunch, a company in Israel

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.720
called Windward that do--
they pretty much track

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.140
every ship in the world in order
to understand where commodities

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:50.110
are flowing around.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:53.000
What's the oil supply
in Japan in six days?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.560
And you rarely see
these kind of companies

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.520
in the Silicon Valley.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:01.530
There are other problems
that outside-- that as ideas.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.820
So that's one thing that I'm
not sure being situated here

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.490
will serve them as well.

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:10.600
And the second point
is talent wise,

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:15.450
hiring here is unbelievably
hard while other countries

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:19.049
have talent pools that
can be tapped easier.

00:11:19.049 --> 00:11:19.840
AARON HARRIS: Yeah.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:24.190
And I think the diversity
of ideas that occurs in--

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:25.370
occurs all over the world.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.639
I don't think that's so
much a function of being

00:11:28.639 --> 00:11:30.055
in Silicon Valley
versus not, it's

00:11:30.055 --> 00:11:31.649
a question of who
the founding team is

00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:32.690
and where they come from.

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.272
And so when you have a largely
homogeneous pool of people,

00:11:35.272 --> 00:11:37.230
they're going to come
with similar ideas, sure.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.313
That's kind of why I think
that having people come

00:11:39.313 --> 00:11:41.770
to YC after they have their
idea, they have an idea,

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:43.070
they have their founding team.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.410
So they come with crazy
ideas from all over the place

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:50.770
and then get the-- like,
the, just the culture of YC

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:52.170
and bring that back.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.869
And as for hiring, yeah,
that's a problem everywhere.

00:11:54.869 --> 00:11:57.410
I mean, I guess it's a little
easier in some other countries.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:00.082
It's harder here but there's
also a larger talent pool here.

00:12:00.082 --> 00:12:02.540
But again, go back if you want
to go back to somewhere else

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.280
and hire there using the
credentials that you have

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.100
of being a YC company
and that helps a lot.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.450
ROY GLASBERG: It's a
difficult question.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:16.899
You see a lot of startups,
a lot of Israeli startups,

00:12:16.899 --> 00:12:19.190
asking, when is the right
time to go to Silicon Valley,

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:20.890
should they go to
Silicon Valley?

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.620
I usually try to avoid this
one size fit all answers.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.722
I think it's a very
different from startup

00:12:26.722 --> 00:12:28.930
to startup, from technology
to technology, especially

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:33.300
from where eventually the
users are going to be.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:37.510
But, as a general
rule, or as some--

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.210
I think the most startups,
at least that I work

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:42.730
with in Israel, are looking
for the American market,

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.750
are looking for American users.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.000
And that's why I think
it's crucial for them

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.192
to be here, spend some time,
interact with the people who

00:12:51.192 --> 00:12:52.900
are eventually going
to be using the apps

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.840
or using their solutions.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.670
Yes, this is a global
world, everybody's

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.350
using mostly the same
stuff, but still, it's

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.490
very different in mentality.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:04.170
Another important thing that I
take for the Israeli startups

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:06.940
is working with
VCs, learning how

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.540
to present your solution,
how to do the pitch,

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.110
how to communicate with
investors, with people that

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:13.980
are from a different mentality.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:18.620
There's a huge mentality gap
form Israelis to Americans.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.400
So spending time
here is important.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.130
I totally agree that we have a
lot of success stories coming

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:26.710
from Israel where development
remain in Israel, where

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:30.060
the talent stayed there,
and here was more of the,

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.370
I would say, the market
touch people that came

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.697
or smaller groups came here.

00:13:34.697 --> 00:13:36.280
But eventually I
think it's inevitable

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.080
that a startup that
wants to work globally,

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.480
that wants to work
in the United States,

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.885
needs to know the
channeling options here

00:13:42.885 --> 00:13:43.760
in the United States.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.310
They want to raise money.

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:48.890
And again, money is a
crucial aspect of this.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:51.970
If you stay in one ecosystem
and you try and raise money

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.990
and you don't
experiment or you don't

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:56.265
go see other options
and other areas

00:13:56.265 --> 00:13:57.640
where you can
raise money, you're

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.900
pretty limited in Israel.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.622
Money wise we're very limited
on what funds can provide.

00:14:03.622 --> 00:14:05.080
Also, there's a
different mentality

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.707
and the level of risks the
funds are willing to take.

00:14:07.707 --> 00:14:10.040
So going through an area where
they're a little bit more

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.630
open to risk-- and
Eden will correct me

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:15.942
on this in two seconds--
I think is, again, it's

00:14:15.942 --> 00:14:17.790
like going to one
bank to get an offer

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.420
rather than doing
a bank shopping

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.930
and see where you can
get the best offer.

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:25.390
FADI BISHARA: So
should you move to--

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:26.900
should you build
your company here

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.170
or should you build your
company in the home country.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:33.320
I answer-- you should build your
company in the home country.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.580
But you should also
come here, learn

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:41.350
from here, partner with
here, get the best practices.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:44.365
And there is a hack
right now, literally,

00:14:44.365 --> 00:14:45.240
to building startups.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.170
With being a global
market, definitely the US

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:51.990
is the largest market right
now for technology and changes

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:53.210
and innovation.

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.180
But what we could
do in here is we

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.590
have the expertise and
experience in Silicon Valley

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:00.070
building startups that we
could loan this experience

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:04.630
and help companies from outside
of Silicon Valley leverage--

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:06.680
turn the liability
into an asset.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.940
The fact that you're
not here-- here

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.030
it's very expensive
to hire people,

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:13.750
it's very expensive to-- you're
competing with some of the best

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:15.940
people also for funding
and everything else.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.479
But you can have
access to people

00:15:17.479 --> 00:15:19.520
that you went to college
with, people that you've

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.060
known from your network.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:25.540
The talent pool that you may
have in your local community

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:29.770
may be better or richer and
more affordable than accessing

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:31.380
on building your talent here.

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.950
So the answer is,
you need to do both.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:37.740
You need to build a company
with a global perspective.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:39.649
The hack that I'm
referring to is,

00:15:39.649 --> 00:15:41.190
what we're trying
to do at Black Box,

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:45.360
is exactly doing what the
Israeli companies have done.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.870
Set up the company
as a US entity

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:51.134
and operate as a US
company, come here as a CEO,

00:15:51.134 --> 00:15:53.050
as a founder doing your
corporate development,

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:54.883
your business development,
your fundraising,

00:15:54.883 --> 00:15:56.090
build the relationships.

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:58.180
Silicon Valley is all
based on relationships.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.660
All distribution partners,
all the investors,

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.900
they invest in you
as a person and they

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.340
want to know you and build
a relationship with you.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:13.220
So if your team in Pakistan or
in Rome and Berlin, that's fine

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.396
as long as you're building
a relationship and you're

00:16:15.396 --> 00:16:17.020
showing that you're
moving the needles,

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.470
you're doing things
in the right direction

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:20.390
and you're building the
product the right way.

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:24.170
And you could access the
resources of Silicon Valley

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:27.055
by being also in both places.

00:16:27.055 --> 00:16:28.430
AMIR SHEVAT: I
just want-- I just

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.430
want to follow up on
the relationship thing.

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:31.550
This is very important.

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:33.820
I've seen a lot of
startups do this mistake.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.370
They come for
three days and they

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.800
think that they're
going to raise funds.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.360
Please don't do that.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.230
It's like going to a
bar, talking to a person,

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:44.520
and saying, would you like
to get married with me?

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.020
OK?

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.237
You don't do that, right?

00:16:46.237 --> 00:16:47.570
You need to build relationships.

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:50.870
So when you come here, if you're
coming, come for a duration,

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:53.370
come between a few
weeks to a few months.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:54.930
Two days, you
won't get anything.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.790
You'll get a lot of nice
calls and people here

00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:58.540
are very friendly.

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:02.160
They'll say, yes, it's an
interesting idea, thank you,

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.970
this is great, you would
like to have some coffee.

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.829
But if you want to build
a stronger relationship,

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:10.599
stay here for a
meaningful duration.

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:13.400
EDEN SOCHAT: But really,
really important.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.609
The best way I've found to
date to kill your company

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:20.450
is to have multi-site
before product market fit.

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.040
It's a wonderful way to kill it.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.750
It's almost as good as replacing
with a professional CEO, which

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:28.460
is also a great way
to kill the company.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:31.740
But don't do multi-site
before product market fit.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:35.270
Meaning don't have split your
company to two locations.

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:36.704
That's my--

00:17:36.704 --> 00:17:37.370
AMIR SHEVAT: OK.

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:45.170
So if we're on giving on
tips section, how many of you

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:48.290
have a great idea or a product?

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:49.380
OK.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:53.040
How many of you have
millions of users right now?

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.140
A little bit less?

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:54.790
OK.

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:58.460
So what would be our
tip for distribution?

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.820
What is the best way, from
your experience, if you

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:04.750
have a company that you see
and they have a great product,

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.760
how can they get
the million users?

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.980
How can they become
a big company?

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.799
Aaron, do you want
to start with that?

00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:13.590
AARON HARRIS: Sure.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.290
There's no one
prescriptive thing

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:21.600
that you can do that will
get you to a million users.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.620
There's all these
really, I think,

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:27.855
funny posts online about here
is the way to growth hack

00:18:27.855 --> 00:18:30.260
or, like, here's the way
to grow your company.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.300
And the truth is, depending
on what your company is

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.019
and depending on
who your users are,

00:18:35.019 --> 00:18:37.310
every company's going to grow
a little bit differently.

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:38.720
And the thing that worked
for the guy last week

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.220
is not going to work for you.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.060
So the only exception
to that rule

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:46.789
is basically making something
that people want and like

00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:49.080
enough that they're willing
to tell their friends about

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.580
and tell other
similar people about.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.790
That's the only thing that
consistently time and again

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.590
actually grows your company.

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:56.590
Especially as a startup.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:59.470
Look, when you are
Gillette and you

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:01.710
have billions of
dollars to spend

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:04.280
on marketing over the
course of the years, fine.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.250
That stuff can work.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:05.950
But you're not.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:09.730
And as a startup,
really it's just

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:12.480
making your product so good
that it solves a problem

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.120
so well that everyone
wants it and wants

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.429
to tell their friends about it.

00:19:16.429 --> 00:19:17.220
FADI BISHARA: Yeah.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.450
So I've never build
any product that

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:19.970
had a million users or anything.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:25.480
But I've seen-- I've worked
with terrific founders locally

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:28.710
and internationally that they've
gotten that kind of traction.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.414
And I think the key to
getting this kind of users

00:19:31.414 --> 00:19:32.830
is getting to what
Aaron is saying

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:34.246
is building something
people want.

00:19:34.246 --> 00:19:36.414
But getting to that point
is, how do you get there?

00:19:36.414 --> 00:19:37.580
How do you build this thing?

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:40.120
Is by understanding, really,
who's your user base?

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.485
So if you're building
something for the US market

00:19:42.485 --> 00:19:44.610
where there are millions
of people going to be here

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:47.380
for the largest market for
you to put the product out,

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:49.380
you really need to
understand the problem

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.750
that you're solving from
this context in here.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:54.710
And you need to spend enough
time here understanding and do,

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:58.420
whatever it's called-- customer
development-- do it five times

00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:58.940
over.

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.065
And keep learning and keep
learning, keep learning,

00:20:01.065 --> 00:20:01.876
keep understanding.

00:20:01.876 --> 00:20:04.500
And validate and understand what
problem are you going to solve

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.470
and how are you going
to go about solving it.

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:09.720
So being in a
large enough market

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.940
to get that kind of traction is
understanding a market yourself

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:14.892
as a founder to start with.

00:20:14.892 --> 00:20:16.350
EDEN SOCHAT: Have
you seen the hack

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:20.260
that was going on recently--
who installed Yo here?

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.630
Who installed Yo?

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:25.020
So who is that
terrible-- anyways,

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.210
so they hacked
the system, right?

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:28.560
How did they hack the system?

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.400
They said, OK, well, what do
bloggers want to write about?

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.970
Bloggers want to
write about how stupid

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:37.110
is the ecosystem for
funding something

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.450
so stupid with a
million dollars.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:40.760
So it was brilliant.

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.260
Right?

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.260
So they actually are the
million users, to your question,

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.930
for an absolute bullshit app
because they hacked the system

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:48.174
in order to do that.

00:20:48.174 --> 00:20:49.840
So they'll not go
anywhere-- no, no, I'm

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.584
not saying-- I'm saying
that more of a antithesis,

00:20:52.584 --> 00:20:54.000
I'm not saying you
should do that.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.330
But it's incredible to see
someone playing with the system

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:00.650
because he basically provided
a story for the bloggers

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:05.080
about how stupid he is, and
that turned into number one app

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.170
in the US market.

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:08.430
They are still one of
the top five in social.

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:10.940
And it's embarrassing
as everyone in the room

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:14.330
here, to think that this
dynamic actually happened.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:17.000
So in the 30,000 feet
thing-- and that's something

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.670
that recently you saw-- even
just choose your name right.

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:21.630
Which is funny.

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.520
It's not the distribution,
it's not nothing about that.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.360
But think of
GetTaxi versus Uber.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.140
GetTaxi is a fairly
successful Israeli company.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:30.810
That-- what does it do?

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:32.380
Get you a taxi.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:33.819
So they're not
replacing the taxi,

00:21:33.819 --> 00:21:35.610
they're just helping
out the taxi business.

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:36.820
And so they're capped.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.230
So size of company-- forget
the first million users--

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.750
but what they're doing, if
you look at San Francisco,

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:46.370
the taxi market is $150 million.

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:48.480
Uber in San Francisco
is doing $400 million.

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.640
So obviously they're not
part of the taxi market.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.560
They are not a GetTaxi.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.540
And the Israeli actually
chose the wrong name.

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.160
They kind of improved
on the ecosystem

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.110
instead of trying to build
or rebuild the ecosystem.

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.449
So sometimes, just even the
name is extremely powerful.

00:22:02.449 --> 00:22:04.490
It won't get you the first
million, but it will--

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:05.865
it might determine
whether you're

00:22:05.865 --> 00:22:07.622
a billion dollar company
or a $10 billion.

00:22:07.622 --> 00:22:09.705
ROY GLASBERG: I think there
are two aspects that I

00:22:09.705 --> 00:22:11.570
can add because all of the
things that were said here

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:12.153
are brilliant.

00:22:12.153 --> 00:22:16.980
But it's consistency, and on
the other hand, flexibility.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.580
A lot of success
stories that you

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.400
here, one of them
the uncertainty

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.720
or the risk factor
or the patience

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.710
of watching it go
through, watching

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:29.537
your ecosystem and
your user base grow.

00:22:29.537 --> 00:22:31.120
I mean, if somebody
would have thought

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:34.500
of an app that can predict
in advance the adoption

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:37.010
rate of a service, that would
have an excellent startup

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:38.700
but I don't think
anybody can do it.

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:43.620
So what's left for
entrepreneurs is actually build

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.840
that relationship with your
users, get the feedback,

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.460
be open to change,
be open to adapt.

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:51.122
I think that
Feature list, as you

00:22:51.122 --> 00:22:53.080
can see with all startups
with these road maps,

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.910
they're really nice
but they will always

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:56.830
remain kind of
this road map that

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:58.500
probably won't be exercised.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.200
I think that the learning starts
once you have your first user,

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.490
you first 100 users,
your first 2,000 users.

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:07.120
If you work good we these
guys, if you listen to them,

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.310
if you learn from them
you can continue growing

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:11.950
and continue proceeding
in the right direction.

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:13.750
If you're too stuck
on what you thought

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:15.250
in the beginning
and the feature set

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:16.440
that you thought in
the beginning is what's

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.106
going to work, you're
probably not going

00:23:18.106 --> 00:23:21.859
to get too far ahead unless you
are this genius who predicted

00:23:21.859 --> 00:23:23.150
exactly what's going to happen.

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:24.340
AMIR SHEVAT: The Yo app.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:27.000
If you predicted the Yo
trends, then you're probably--

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:27.875
ROY GLASBERG: Yo, Yo.

00:23:27.875 --> 00:23:29.210
AMIR SHEVAT: Yo.

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:33.210
So I'm now opening the
stage for questions.

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:36.530
So if you have any questions--
I have more, but yep.

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:37.030
Go ahead.

00:23:41.179 --> 00:23:42.012
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:46.110
I need stages.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:47.070
Sorry.

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:50.030
You talked about
going into the biggest

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:52.420
market as something of an asset.

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:55.620
What is there to be said
about finding smaller markets

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:56.990
and starring in them?

00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:00.320
Let's say you take
the idea of Skype

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:06.640
and have it use a prepaid
in Africa or Eastern Europe

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.490
and be a star there in a
much smaller market instead

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:13.880
of fighting with all the
competitors in the US or west

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.210
Europe?

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:18.270
AARON HARRIS: So one
thing I would say,

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:20.490
I don't think the
point Eden was making

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:22.900
was that you have to
go into a giant market.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.941
I think what he was saying
is that you don't want

00:24:24.941 --> 00:24:27.850
to limit the market that
you're attacking initially.

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:30.340
In fact, what you actually
want to do a lot of the time

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:32.510
is go after market that
other people might not think

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:33.370
is so big.

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:36.190
So if we go back to the
Uber example specifically,

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:39.480
their initial thing
was black cars.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.050
Right?

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:42.250
Which is-- that's the market.

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.670
I mean, it's big,
sure, but it's a market

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:47.491
that they could
create dominance in

00:24:47.491 --> 00:24:48.990
and then they could
move from there.

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:51.560
So I think that's how
to think about it.

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:58.370
EDEN SOCHAT: And about using
a small market as an example.

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:02.480
Just be cautious that
customer development doesn't

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.080
build the product that is
not suitable for the rest

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.440
of the world just because you
attack that small segment.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.990
Otherwise, yep, a niche
is a good starting point.

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:13.720
AUDIENCE: So what do you do
when you have a company that

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:19.420
has millions of users, has
revenues, has not been invested

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:23.690
in, and is basically--
at what point

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:25.440
would you actually
talk to Silicon Valley?

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.990
And what approach would
you use to do that to grow?

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.535
FADI BISHARA: So it
depends on your needs.

00:25:33.535 --> 00:25:35.910
So you're growing but you're
not growing as fast as you'd

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:38.329
like to grow, and
what is the limit.

00:25:38.329 --> 00:25:40.620
Is it if you have more
revenues, if you have more money

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:41.896
to invest, you grow faster?

00:25:41.896 --> 00:25:43.020
AUDIENCE: Yes. [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:43.420
FADI BISHARA: OK.

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:44.586
So that's the point to talk.

00:25:44.586 --> 00:25:46.320
If you have a proven
business that's

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.000
got a good traction,
good numbers.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.220
This is a good point to
talk to Silicon Valley.

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.390
And the way you do it, you
don't come for three days

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:54.400
like Amir said no matter
how good your Excel

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.524
sheet and your hockey
stick looks like.

00:25:56.524 --> 00:25:58.440
You need to come here
and build relationships,

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.060
find the right kind of investors
that they would invest in you

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.351
and give you the kind of
guidance where you could think

00:26:03.351 --> 00:26:05.650
your company from a $10
million revenue to $100

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:08.860
million revenues with the
right amount of investments.

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:11.390
So you come to Silicon Valley
with that kind of open mind,

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:13.380
understanding that you
don't necessarily may

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:16.410
have all the answers but you
have already proven something

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:20.377
that is working, especially
if it's working in the US.

00:26:20.377 --> 00:26:22.168
It's a good time to
come to Silicon Valley.

00:26:22.168 --> 00:26:23.144
EDEN SOCHAT: Where are you from?

00:26:23.144 --> 00:26:24.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.050
AMIR SHEVAT: So there was
a hidden question there

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:32.220
which is, why do
you need the money?

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:35.860
Another mistake I see
startups do a lot is

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.530
try to get money
without knowing what

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:39.720
they'll do with that money.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.272
And no, getting money
is a full time job.

00:26:43.272 --> 00:26:45.230
I've been talking to
entrepreneurs who have not

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:48.030
been doing features, who
have not been doing customer

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:50.780
research because they're
focused on creating better

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:52.440
presentations for VCs.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.280
OK?

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.500
That's not your role
as an entrepreneur.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:57.650
If you want you
can open an agency

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:00.090
that creates
presentations for VC.

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:03.000
It might be a good business
but as entrepreneur

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.220
you need to create
good businesses.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:05.830
Right?

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:08.230
So know the time that
you need the money, know

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:11.849
why you need the
money, and that's it.

00:27:11.849 --> 00:27:12.640
FADI BISHARA: Yeah.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.630
I mean an example
is [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:15.982
Their first run was $60 million.

00:27:15.982 --> 00:27:17.440
I mean, you could
just grow as fast

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.900
as you can and on your own.

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.650
You may connect with special
expert advisers and mentors

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:25.225
and grow your board
of directors or board

00:27:25.225 --> 00:27:27.750
of advisers with
experienced people

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:32.570
in this domain who built similar
business to multiple larger

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:33.170
sites.

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:35.385
AMIR SHEVAT: We'll
take one more question.

00:27:35.385 --> 00:27:38.069
Two more questions, I
guess, if they're quick.

00:27:38.069 --> 00:27:39.430
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:40.580
I have a question.

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:46.120
Is there any program where
you can helping entrepreneurs

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.760
in Latin America?

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:52.222
Are you working every-- do
you guys in your organization?

00:27:52.222 --> 00:27:54.430
FADI BISHARA: Are you asking
if we help entrepreneurs

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:55.280
from South America?

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.196
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:01.075
AMIR SHEVAT: Black
Box for the LatAm.

00:28:01.075 --> 00:28:01.950
FADI BISHARA: No, no.

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:03.900
We have a Black Box for
international entrepreneur.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.816
One of the highest value
that we've discovered

00:28:05.816 --> 00:28:07.330
is the diversity
of entrepreneurs

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:09.910
coming from different countries
versus bringing entrepreneurs

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:14.470
only from Latin America or only
from Israel only from Sweden.

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:16.260
So it's-- you participate.

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:17.994
This is a global game.

00:28:17.994 --> 00:28:20.160
EDEN SOCHAT: Are you familiar
with Wayra Telefonica?

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.270
They actually have a lot of
programs in South America

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:24.561
so you should-- if you don't
know them, check them out.

00:28:24.561 --> 00:28:28.220
They're actually fairly active.

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.110
AUDIENCE: My question
is, why is it,

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:33.290
whether it's in Silicon Valley
or elsewhere, the focus is

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:37.350
only on consumer facing--
consumer products?

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:40.280
And on that, can
we have a couple

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:44.509
of tips for entrepreneurs who
are starting B2B businesses.

00:28:44.509 --> 00:28:46.050
EDEN SOCHAT: If
anything, by the way,

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:48.800
if look at the ecosystem right
now in the Silicon Valley,

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:52.000
Andreessen said we're not
doing any investing in consumer

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.370
until it's B round.

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:56.570
It's a sentiment and
it's a sinus wave

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:58.310
and every sometime
something else

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:00.080
is more cool than
the other things.

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.470
But today, actually
you should be

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:06.850
in a better shape raising
B2B money in Silicon Valley.

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:10.000
Israel is a bit at a shift.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.685
So there's still consumers
still available capital for it.

00:29:13.685 --> 00:29:15.560
But you should actually
be in a better shape.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:19.740
And B2B, in general, it's
not consumer traction but as

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.770
much as actual
design partnerships

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:26.120
that you work with customers
that say, I love this.

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.130
Sometimes you actually
still do manual work

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:29.740
so it's not fully
automated, but they

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:31.040
love the value proposition.

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.442
That's the most,
at least for me,

00:29:33.442 --> 00:29:34.900
seeing that customers
actually want

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.997
what you have is the
number one thing.

00:29:36.997 --> 00:29:39.080
FADI BISHARA: I kind of--
it's kind of interesting

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:42.790
when you presume that
most startups always

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:45.222
start with this kind
of consumer product,

00:29:45.222 --> 00:29:47.180
especially first time
entrepreneurs, especially

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:49.920
entrepreneurs who are
just out of college.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.460
That's probably
what's given this.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.290
The one tip that
I would give you

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:54.980
if you're starting
a B2B company is

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:58.110
to have worked at a
big company before.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:59.940
And many, many
entrepreneurs right now

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.398
they're just coming
out of college,

00:30:01.398 --> 00:30:03.810
they haven't had jobs
at big corporations.

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:06.430
To understand the real pain
or how this big elephant,

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:09.340
big giant corporations operate.

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:12.920
And so they avoid it
and they go to a Yo.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.770
And that's-- that's where-- I
think the opportunity is if you

00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:19.130
want to do B2B is
tremendous right now.

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:22.800
We, in our program, we accept
15 companies in a quarter.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.330
And this run we have
10 companies that

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:28.500
[? do ?] and they're
all B2B technologies.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.250
AMIR SHEVAT: So we're
running out of time.

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:32.480
I have just one more
comment about B2B.

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.880
Think about sales cycles.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:38.140
So sales cycles and B2B are
very different than sales cycles

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:39.140
in B2C.

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:41.840
So think about how you
structure a company in the way

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.210
that you can work with
that sales cycles.

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:47.840
So I'm sorry, we're
running out of time.

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.109
But these guys are
going to stay here

00:30:50.109 --> 00:30:51.900
and we're going to--
we'll be happy to take

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:52.830
off-line questions.

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:54.860
Thank you very much.
