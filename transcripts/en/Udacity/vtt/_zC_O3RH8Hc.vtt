00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.952
So yeah, every aetional document starts with html. &lt;&lt;

00:00:03.952 --> 00:00:06.650
Okay. &lt;&lt; Browsers are very forgiving. They will often just

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.610
like try to make something work, even if you don't

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.865
have the appropriate structure. But, it's best to follow it

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:15.017
[CROSSTALK]. So then you've got your heading. &lt;&lt; Header, heading,

00:00:15.017 --> 00:00:17.654
okay. &lt;&lt; Yeah, so this is stuff that's not really,

00:00:17.654 --> 00:00:20.690
necessarily displayed on the page. So you've got the title,

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.690
you've got some some sort of like loading of attributes.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.170
&gt;&gt; Okay, so wait.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.120
This linking style/main. That's where it gets

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.480
the CSS that we were modifying earlier?

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah. This stuff seems to be about like mobile.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.510
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.370
&gt;&gt; Stuff, so it's not super relevant to figuring

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.610
out how things work. At least on the web

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.510
page. And then we've got the beginning of the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.310
body, which is really like what's shown on the page.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.825
&gt;&gt; Okay, and so, I mean this is, every time I look at

00:00:47.825 --> 00:00:51.390
html, I just see this wave of, you know, like indent and less.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.570
More indented and less indented. How, how are you,

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.390
what do you thinking about when you're seeing this?

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So basically I want to look for two

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.930
things that are at the same indentation level. And that

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.570
tells me that, that's, so this is the beginning of

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.190
the block, and this is the end of the block.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:04.709
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:07.480
&gt;&gt; You also get this little closing guy, to say, you

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.550
know, I opened this div and now I closed this div.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.460
&gt;&gt; You know, what is a div, why is it called a div, like...

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.670
&gt;&gt; I actually don't know why it's called a div, but.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.930
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.690
&gt;&gt; Divs are sort of the basic building block

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.610
of websites. They're, they're just sort of

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.770
a thing. A a container for stuff. [LAUGH]

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:31.460
they're, they're sort of special kinds of things, like A is usually a, a link.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.670
&gt;&gt; Okay

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.010
&gt;&gt; You've got forms.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.695
&gt;&gt; What about, so, can you go back up a bit.

00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:35.980
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.760
&gt;&gt; I mean, they all have this thing, this class.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.850
Class container, class heading. So is that class just for

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.780
the, so when I'm writing the CSS file, and I want to

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.620
say everything that's a container is blue. Is that what it's for?

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.710
&gt;&gt; Pretty much, yeah. the, the JavaScript can also use these classes.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.330
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.970
&gt;&gt; It's, it's basically just a shorthand for saying

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.670
like, these are, these are similar things they should have,

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.350
they should look the same. You could have more specific

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.115
rules for like just a single one with an ID.

00:02:03.115 --> 00:02:07.040
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. But mostly yeah, it's for, it's for

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.720
the CSS. You could just have all of the styles in line, but that's...

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.190
&gt;&gt; That's messy.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.347
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:12.347 --> 00:02:13.755
&gt;&gt; So that would be like, every time I had

00:02:13.755 --> 00:02:15.890
a, what I wanted to be container, I'd have to say.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:16.980
&gt;&gt; You'd have to have all. Yeah.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.035
&gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah. I don't want to do

00:02:18.035 --> 00:02:22.390
that. Okay so, paper divs. What are these H1's?

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.140
&gt;&gt; That's a header.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.600
&gt;&gt; Okay P, what's P?

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.390
&gt;&gt; Paragraph.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.890
&gt;&gt; Okay

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.600
&gt;&gt; I just sort of mixed the spacing around it. Standardized.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.060
&gt;&gt; But it seems

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.550
like the Div is the more, like the really structural thing, and

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.770
this is the P's and the A's are just sort of like...

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.820
&gt;&gt; Things that go inside Divs usually, yeah. So, so Divs

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.320
can just be like a blob of text. They can be

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.150
a container that holds a bunch of different blobs of text.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.070
It's really, sort of like the basic building block of HTML.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.220
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.480
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.450
&gt;&gt; Let me play around a bit and see if I can, you know, make some changes.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.950
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:57.170
&gt;&gt; Thanks.
