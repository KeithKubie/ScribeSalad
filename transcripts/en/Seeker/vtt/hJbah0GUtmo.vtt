00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.610
Saturn’s rings are iconic, but up close
they’re less like thin rings and more like

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.160
perfectly ordered zones of terror.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.519
Saturn’s rings -- identified by letters
according to their date of discovery -- are

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.810
made of chunks of ice and rock with pieces
ranging in size from a grain of sand to a

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:16.810
house.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.770
Which means the rings aren’t as thin as
we make them in our grade school models of

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.090
the solar system.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.039
If you’ve ever seen Saturn through a telescope
and the rings seem to disappear, it’s just

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.510
because you’re seeing them head on from
about 746 million miles (1.2 billion kilometers)

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.510
away.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:33.719
And they’re relatively thin compared to
Saturn.

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.570
At various points the rings range from between
about 30 to 300 feet thick (9m–91m), while

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.180
Saturn’s diameter is around the order of
72,000 miles (116,500km), which is a little

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.180
more than 18 times larger than Earth’s.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.570
But if you look at a picture of Saturn from
above you can see that the rings have a massive

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.710
diameter — which makes sense since they
circle around the planet’s equator.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.079
The rings, combined, stretch 175,000 miles
(282,000 kilometers) from Saturn.

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.609
And they aren't totally solid.

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:00.229
Each ring is made of multiple rings that you
can see close up.

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:04.489
As for origin, astronomers think they’re
related to Saturn’s more than 60 moons.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.789
Asteroids and meteoroids sometimes crash into
the smaller moons, breaking them apart and

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:10.560
adding material to the rings.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.630
But some of the material might be left over
from when Saturn formed, material that never

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.320
became a moon!Some moons also play a vital
part in keeping the rings distinct.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.890
The rings aren’t static — they orbit around
Saturn like its moons do, and at least two

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.509
moons around the narrow F ring keeps it in
check.

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.180
The gravity of Pandora stops the F ring from
spreading outward while Prometheus prevents

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.950
it from spreading inward.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.659
Other shepherd moons keep other rings in check
and constrain how they spread out.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.340
They're also responsible for some odd structures.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.299
Some rings have features called propellers,
spaces caused by tiny moonlets that open gaps.

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.999
Other rings have spoke-looking things that
are caused by conglomerations of tiny ice

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:52.240
particles that rise above the ring’s surface
by electrostatic charge.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.520
So next time you’re looking at Saturn keep
in mind that the rings aren’t just pretty,

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.270
they’re also chunks of ice and rock, in
constant change, chaotically hurtling through

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.270
space.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.580
Isn’t that more fun to imagine, anyway?

And my favourite fun fact?

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.920
The rings are super cold!

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.320
They can get down to minus 333.4 degrees Fahrenheit
(minus 203 degrees Celsius) on the unlit side!
