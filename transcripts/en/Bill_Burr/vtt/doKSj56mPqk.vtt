1
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.900
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:08.820
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,
July 2nd,

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.430
2018 what's going on?
How,
why?
Yeah.
A as you can tell.
Oh,

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.860
freckles is under the,

5
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.190
yeah,
I tried to do too much when I was on the road.
Uh,

6
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.060
I'm just an old guy enough and ended up catching a cold that goes to the middle

7
00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:31.140
of fucking winter.
I flew into Minneapolis the day of the show.
I usually,

8
00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:34.220
I used to fly in the night before,
but now I got the Kiddo and I don't,
uh,

9
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.170
you know,
misses a little bit of,
you know,

10
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.450
her whatever day as possible.
So I flew out the day of,

11
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.320
then I landed and um,

12
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.600
I've learned this lesson 50 fucking times and every time I've gotten sick I

13
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:51.270
landed.
I was a little tired,
you know,

14
00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:54.210
cause I had to get up early to get there on time and I went right to the gym.

15
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.310
Stupid fucking move.

16
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.590
Then I had to do two shows and then I had hung out with Verdesian fucking
Barnick

17
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.480
but I slept in the next day and next day I woke up.
I kind of felt run down,

18
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.080
but I was like,
no man,
man,
I hit the gym again.
I hit the gym again,
fucking moron.

19
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.300
Then I take a steam,
then I go on fucking stage,
have one show,

20
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.010
CNN the night.
I absolutely love Barnet conversing a let's go out again.

21
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:22.500
So we go out again and this time we will,

22
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.030
we were at an outside bar up on this rooftop and this really cool,
you know,

23
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.920
place in,
you know,
downtown Minneapolis and a,

24
00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:35.700
I had an add on,
but it wasn't enough.
And I could tell when I was,
you know,

25
00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:38.930
when a cold just get you and I'm feeling a little bit and then it just get,

26
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.320
you're like,
ah,
fuck,
here we go.
And I didn't have any vitamins.

27
00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:46.560
That's another thing.
I forgot my vitamins,
all of that dumb shit.
So,
um,

28
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.190
I dunno.
So I apologize for being so frigging late here,

29
00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:52.200
but however I want to thank everybody.

30
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.740
It was one of the most fun weekends I've had as far as crowds.

31
00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.360
And just what I got to see in Minneapolis,
in Detroit,
um,
Minneapolis,

32
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:04.900
first of all,
did the theater there on,
on the campus of,

33
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.210
uh,
the big 10 university of Minnesota.
Now,

34
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.700
I was joking with the people there whenever I go,
you know,

35
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.120
to a great campus like that.
My first thought,

36
00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:20.940
this is for all you young kids out there.
I always think to myself,
man,

37
00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:24.540
I wish I studied in high school.
I wish I tried.

38
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.730
This is fucking amazing.

39
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.230
Did we drove by there was like a frat house and there was like 10 frat guys

40
00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:35.100
sitting in a circle playing some drinking games outside this amazing fraternity,

41
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.180
you know,

42
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.200
and I know everybody makes fun of them saying they're a bunch of date rapists

43
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:43.020
and then this and that and all this shit.
But at the end of the day,

44
00:02:43.021 --> 00:02:47.050
who's making the robots that are going to kill all of us?
Huh?
It's the nerds.

45
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.780
So he's up on the Frat boys.
Um,
they're not all rapists,
you know,

46
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.790
some of them just lear.

47
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.520
So anyways,
and I couldn't believe fucking beautiful,

48
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.290
beautiful,
the University of Minnesota's campuses.

49
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.690
And I would say it on stage.
This is what a fucking moron am.
I,
you know,

50
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:12.250
without ever seeing a campus,

51
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.270
I judge what it looks like by how your sports teams are doing.

52
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.620
If you haven't won a big 10 championship or an SCC championship and a long time,

53
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:24.190
I just figured your schools a dump and it doesn't look good.

54
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:27.730
Am I learned that with Vanderbilt Vanderbilt's never like,
you know,

55
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:30.970
I think maybe in baseball they're good,
but they never do anything in football,

56
00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.740
never do anything at home.
So I'm just like,
oh,

57
00:03:32.741 --> 00:03:35.940
that's like almost a community college.
And then Nate board,
God's,

58
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.830
he told me it was a big fan of theirs was like,
no dude,
that's like,

59
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.330
it's one of the best schools in the country.
Some of the smartest things.

60
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.840
This engineering fucking eggheads school.
Right.
Um,

61
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.530
but I went into University of Minnesota.
It's like all fucking brick.
I mean,

62
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.010
what I saw of it was a,
was incredible.
Now I always have that thought,
like,

63
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:58.930
why didn't I study?
It wasn't that hard.
I was such a fucking pussy.

64
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.280
I was such a baby coupled [inaudible] who are two subject and just,
yeah,

65
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.130
they just get through it.
You know what I mean?

66
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.810
I didn't like doing hell rooms either,
but I,

67
00:04:08.811 --> 00:04:12.040
I had to do them to get to do a fucking Gig at University of Minnesota.

68
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.170
I stuck with that.
Right.
Hang on.
Sorry.
I forget me.

69
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.323
<v 1>Sorry.</v>

70
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.960
<v 0>It's going to be a lot of that.
I'll hit pause next time.
Um,</v>

71
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.520
yeah,
look,
some of them math I get,
you know,
cause I gotta be honest with you.

72
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.430
Like I was cool right up until Algebra.

73
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.490
If I wasn't such a fucking class clown and a jerk off,

74
00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:40.030
I wouldn't had to go to summer school after Algebra because it wasn't that bad.

75
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.720
If I applied myself geometry,
I don't even know what,
I don't,

76
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.840
I don't even know what the fuck was going on.

77
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.920
Was like these conspiracy theories about shapes,
not good spirit.

78
00:04:51.921 --> 00:04:54.560
They have a proven,
um,

79
00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.640
like the NBA is fixed,
was proven when they had that mobbed up ref.

80
00:05:00.641 --> 00:05:04.150
And of course they blame it on one guy.
They always blame it on one guy.

81
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.640
I don't know how long people would sit there and watch the NBA.

82
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.350
I'm not saying all the Games of fixed,

83
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.370
I'm just saying no other sport is it finessed the way that sport is finesse to

84
00:05:15.071 --> 00:05:17.800
make sure they have these match ups that are going to get ratings.

85
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.890
And it all goes back to fucking Larry Bird and magic Johnson.

86
00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:24.490
I'm convinced of it and it's still fucking terrified because they almost went

87
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:28.420
out of business in the late seventies.
Um,
our ratings were way down,

88
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.810
you know,
but they all do it.
Like during the steroid era,

89
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.700
you think the fucking owners and baseball,

90
00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:37.000
like they didn't know what the players were doing.
Baseball was in a bad way.

91
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:38.350
They canceled the world series.

92
00:05:38.351 --> 00:05:41.500
Cal Ripkin breaking a Lou Gehrig's record was all they fucking had.

93
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.860
The chews up the ball.
They make the ballparks smaller.

94
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.130
These fucking guys are going up there looking like the dad and the Incredibles,

95
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.491
you know,

96
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:53.230
fucking skinny legs and Jane upper bodies just drive and shit over the f out of

97
00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:55.060
the frigging Ballpark,
say,
knew what was going on.

98
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.840
And then all of a sudden the shit hits the fan and not one owner got asked a

99
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:02.870
question.
They,
oh,
I didn't know.
I had no idea.

100
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.730
You're in the business.
Right.

101
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.920
I do stand up comedy.
I know who some of the up and coming funny people are.

102
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.890
I hear who's stealing jokes.

103
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.090
I hear who's going to be the next fucking whatever I hear who is maybe a fucking

104
00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:25.060
party in too much.
She a year,
you're in it,
you know,
it's what you do.

105
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.760
Fucking lumber jacks.
They know who's jerking off behind a redwood.

106
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.680
I mean they're in the fucking business.
So baseball was finessed that way,

107
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.260
I believe.
Right?
Football.

108
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.110
What they did was they just,
you know,

109
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.050
they weren't satisfied with their fan base and they just kept,

110
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.220
every fucking rule ended up being for the offense to the point.

111
00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:50.630
It was borderline illegal to uh,
you know,

112
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.730
to fucking cover a receiver.

113
00:06:52.731 --> 00:06:55.490
Now everybody's out there putting up Dan Marino numbers,

114
00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:58.520
which is fucking ridiculous.
Dan Marino,

115
00:06:58.521 --> 00:07:02.390
Dan filed those guys played back when you could borderline murder somebody,

116
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.520
stick them and all of that shit.

117
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.410
I remember one year that year drew Brees,
I can't forget what he threw four,

118
00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:10.071
but it was just like,

119
00:07:10.071 --> 00:07:13.280
there was like seven people on pace to break Dan Marino's record.

120
00:07:13.281 --> 00:07:18.020
Maybe not seven.
It's probably four
in a,
in one season.

121
00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:20.300
So it's finessed that fucking way,
right?

122
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.820
Hockey I,
it just,
I don't know what they're doing.
They just,
they,

123
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.200
they finally got it right.

124
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.300
They finally got it right with Nashville and Vegas and now they're going to

125
00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:34.430
Seattle.
I think they're finally going to take a turn.

126
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:39.470
And my only concern is that it's going to become immensely popular,

127
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.380
which is really a pipe dream.
But if it becomes immensely,

128
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:47.300
the reason why hockey's still fucking great is because it is sort of the Jan

129
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.510
Brady,
the Middle Kit,
like nobody's fucking paying attention to itself.

130
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.690
You meet the players,
they're all cool.
They're fucking down to earth.

131
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:59.030
You know what I mean?
I don't know.
Sorry.
I've even taken a cold medication.

132
00:07:59.031 --> 00:08:03.080
This is just literally my intellect,
so I can't blame anything here.
Um,

133
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.980
but basketball,
I swear to God,

134
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.970
like the Celtics are coming on right,

135
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.130
and the Lakers suck.
And I remember thinking,
as a fan,
this sucks.

136
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.200
We're going to be good and they suck.

137
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:21.740
It's like if the red sox had gotten the Yankees suck or vice versa,
it's not fun.

138
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.240
Right.

139
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.530
And all of a sudden Lebron is going to move and where does he go to the fucking

140
00:08:27.531 --> 00:08:30.860
Lakers?
And next year there's going to be a bunch of free agents

141
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.140
and the Lakers we'll stock up and I guarantee we're going to go into the finals.

142
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.780
It's going to be fucking Lakers,
Celtics.
You know,

143
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:43.280
if anybody can get past that juggernaut of,
of um,
of,
uh,

144
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:48.350
golden state.
But like,
I dunno,
I think it's all,
uh,

145
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.060
it's definitely finessed like a,

146
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.950
like a boxing promoter putting together,

147
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.830
like the fact that they let Kevin Duran go to the Golden State Warriors in the

148
00:08:58.831 --> 00:09:02.570
last two seasons have been an absolute fucking snooze fest.
It's like they,

149
00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:05.400
they knew they were going to win it the second he went there and they did,

150
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.350
you know,
they were going to go back to back and they did.

151
00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:09.663
<v 2>No.</v>

152
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.220
<v 0>What they doing and golden state is,</v>

153
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.240
is like what the fuck and Yankees did in the early two thousands and the height

154
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:21.060
of them buying championships was when they got fucking a road.

155
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.350
Anything Post 1998 cause I love that Yankee team.
I don't want the Yankees,

156
00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:30.180
but I love that team.
But 99,
2000,
the Clemens,
all of that bullshit,

157
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.680
um,
was all those pylon fucking championships.

158
00:09:34.681 --> 00:09:38.160
And then the red sox were like,
well what the fuck?
You know,

159
00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:42.300
we're in the middle of a 90 year drought,
86 year drought here.
This is,

160
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:45.180
this is the game.
We got to play this game.
And this is the thing,

161
00:09:45.181 --> 00:09:48.450
we haven't stopped playing that fucking game.
I mean,

162
00:09:48.451 --> 00:09:51.930
nobody could be as bad as the fucking Yankees.
I mean,

163
00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:56.250
remember when they had fucking GMB and a rod in cheater and they're fucking

164
00:09:56.251 --> 00:09:57.750
infield.
It was ridiculous.

165
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.200
They had to have the best shortstops in the league in there,
in filth.

166
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:05.940
One agreeing to play third base was fucking nuts.
Um,
yeah,

167
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.560
I mean,
whatever.
So anyways,
so Lebron is a Laker and uh,

168
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.230
I guess I'm going to get my wish that they're going to be in the finals,

169
00:10:13.231 --> 00:10:17.820
hopefully against us.
I mean,
that's who I want to play and beat.
Um,

170
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.790
and I like our coach better and you know,

171
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.600
I know that they're going to go out and get a zillion guys because everybody in

172
00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:27.930
the NBA wants to play in La.
Not Cause,
you know,

173
00:10:27.931 --> 00:10:29.760
partially because they love the Lakers,

174
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.430
but who doesn't want to fuck a famous broad,
right?

175
00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:36.870
Who doesn't want fucking 75 80 degree weather year round.
I've said this forever.

176
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:37.351
What do you want to,

177
00:10:37.351 --> 00:10:42.351
do you want to go to Boston Racist Boston and deal with the winter in fucking

178
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:48.070
sixes and sevens or do you want to come to racist La Bang supermodels and uh,

179
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.720
go to the beach whenever the fuck you want.
12 months of the year,

180
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:55.590
we can't compete with it.
Made the uniform literally looks like sunshine.
Hey,

181
00:10:55.591 --> 00:10:59.700
speaking of that,
when I was in Minneapolis,
I went by that,

182
00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:02.940
fuck it armory.
I look like an old fucking

183
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.273
<v 2>like</v>

184
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:06.420
<v 0>hockey stadium.</v>

185
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.630
And I would've thought it was the north star old place had I not known that it,

186
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.430
it's where the mall of America is now.
Um,

187
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.460
that wasn't a fucking red flag.
Yeah.

188
00:11:17.461 --> 00:11:20.550
We'll get rid of the hockey team and we're putting the biggest fucking mall
ever.

189
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.320
Um,
I,
I still don't understand how that fucking thing stays open,

190
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.230
you know,
how do you fucking,
you know what the mall of America is like?

191
00:11:31.231 --> 00:11:34.050
It's like having a TV show now.
It's just so many of them.

192
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:37.291
I would tell you a time,

193
00:11:37.291 --> 00:11:40.620
I was talking to another comedian and I told her how much I liked her show and

194
00:11:40.621 --> 00:11:41.640
she was saying thanks.

195
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.270
And we were talking for five minutes before she realized I was talking about

196
00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:48.690
another show that she had that just got canceled and she was talking about a

197
00:11:48.691 --> 00:11:51.270
different TV show that I didn't even know.

198
00:11:51.271 --> 00:11:55.230
She had two television shows and I had no fucking idea.
Uh,

199
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:56.943
anyways,

200
00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.910
so I went by the armory thing there and I saw Jennifer Lopez blade there during

201
00:12:00.911 --> 00:12:02.080
the Superbowl.
I guess they redid it,

202
00:12:02.081 --> 00:12:07.081
but the coolest fucking thing ever about that venue is that's where the

203
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.800
Minneapolis Lakers with George Mike and when their first four NBA Championships

204
00:12:11.801 --> 00:12:15.970
in that,
uh,
that Baa championship that the Lakers still calling NBA championship,

205
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.680
which is fucking hilarious.

206
00:12:17.681 --> 00:12:22.330
They somehow one one all right before the NBA existed.

207
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.360
But anyways,
I really wanted to go in there and take a fucking tour of it.
So,
uh,

208
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.250
so then we go,

209
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.250
I know a lot of you guys are expecting me to flip out that fucking Lebron went

210
00:12:33.251 --> 00:12:34.210
to.
I don't give a shit.

211
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:38.440
<v 2>I like who?
Uh,
I'll thank you.
How are you?
Lovely Nia.</v>

212
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:43.210
Thumbs up again.
Nothing
you feel run down.

213
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:47.490
I didn't give it to you today.
I didn't get to get you sick today.
I don't know.

214
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.960
I don't think so.
It's full rundown.
All right,

215
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.830
cool.
Okay,
thanks for taking this morning.
Okay,

216
00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:58.683
bye.

217
00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:03.320
<v 0>Uh,
yeah,
my wife was sick too.
You know,
I was also sick,
but you know,</v>

218
00:13:03.321 --> 00:13:06.170
my wife was also kind of sick,
but I was really sick.

219
00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.330
So you know what was going to happen,
right?

220
00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:10.340
She's going to sleep in it and I'm going to handle the kit.

221
00:13:10.341 --> 00:13:15.110
That's just how it works.
Tie where you want to keep peace in the house.

222
00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:19.400
That's how it works.
You just fucking,
you baby the shit out of him.
You know.

223
00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:21.170
I would love to say that.

224
00:13:21.171 --> 00:13:24.110
I'll be able to remember that for the next argument so I can be like,
whoa.

225
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.000
What about to fucking time?
I was shook up the nude I to plug in.

226
00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:29.090
What your daughter for the homeless.
I won't remember it.

227
00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.550
I don't have that ability.
You know,

228
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.620
you fucking with a woman.
They're like fucking Matlock,
you know,

229
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.430
get fucking start pulling.
I never even watched that show.
You know,

230
00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:45.920
I imagine he was pulling up fucking cases from the past.
I have no idea.

231
00:13:45.921 --> 00:13:48.200
You know what he did last night?
It was on that I couldn't get the fucking sleep.

232
00:13:48.201 --> 00:13:50.720
I was on the Internet there and um,

233
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:57.230
I was seeing watching all this shit on a Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis.

234
00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:02.330
Just how big and how famous they got everything.
And after they broke up,

235
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:03.680
uh,

236
00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:08.680
Dean Martin in about 1958 got in the restaurant business and he opened up Dino's

237
00:14:10.101 --> 00:14:10.940
lodge,

238
00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:15.740
which was basically just west of La Sierra go on sunset,
just south.

239
00:14:15.741 --> 00:14:19.220
Now this is giant fucking complex there,
but it's long gone.

240
00:14:19.221 --> 00:14:22.640
I mean they knocked it down to the 80s,
but he got involved in there.

241
00:14:22.641 --> 00:14:24.800
They put his big head there,

242
00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.890
Dino's lounge and he went down there and um,

243
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:31.010
it was a really hip place to go to at first,

244
00:14:31.011 --> 00:14:34.640
late fifties maintains dean and he would actually go down there,
you know,

245
00:14:34.641 --> 00:14:37.280
get the restaurant going,
star struck patrons.

246
00:14:37.281 --> 00:14:41.990
He signed in our graphs and all that shit.
And uh,
do you know,
like fucking two,

247
00:14:41.991 --> 00:14:46.070
three layers of Jerry Lewis opened a competing restaurant down the street.

248
00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.020
This is how bad it got.

249
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:53.270
He opened a competing one and then stole Dean Martin's business partner,

250
00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.030
um,
to open that one.

251
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:59.690
And then he had an even bigger picture of himself on the restaurant and it was

252
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:03.290
on a pole,
like a hundred feet in the air and it wasn't stationary,

253
00:15:03.291 --> 00:15:04.220
it was revolving.

254
00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.670
So I guess dean ended up saying,
hey man,
fuck this shit.

255
00:15:10.671 --> 00:15:12.350
And he got it Coz he's cool.
He said,
fuck this.

256
00:15:12.351 --> 00:15:16.070
He got out of the restaurant business and then he had to sue them to get his

257
00:15:16.071 --> 00:15:19.100
name taken off in the image and he couldn't get it taken off and they,

258
00:15:19.101 --> 00:15:22.790
his face stayed on that restaurant until like the fucking eighties.
Like I said,

259
00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:25.820
when they finally fucking took it out.
But,
um,

260
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.710
anyways,
I just can't imagine that it got that bad,

261
00:15:30.711 --> 00:15:34.700
which of course led me to the 1976 reunion that they had on the Jerry Lewis

262
00:15:34.701 --> 00:15:39.460
Telethon when Jerry had no idea dean was coming out.
Frank brought him out.
Uh,

263
00:15:39.461 --> 00:15:42.050
that was cool watching them.
I'll get all of that shit.
You know what I mean?

264
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:46.160
It's just stupid fucking falling out stuff.
Um,

265
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.680
but I just thought it was funny at the height,

266
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.380
at the fucking height of them hating each other.

267
00:15:51.381 --> 00:15:54.680
They had competing fucking restaurants.
How not to comedians.

268
00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:57.860
You know,
I just picture,

269
00:15:57.861 --> 00:16:02.240
imagine like De Niro in casino count in the fucking blueberries in the muffin.

270
00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:07.670
Freaking out doing that crazy Jerry Lewis voice saying how dino has more

271
00:16:07.671 --> 00:16:12.290
blueberries in his muffin and this is fucking unacceptable.
Um,
anyways,

272
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:16.910
plowing ahead here.
Um,
oh,
Billy is a

273
00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:22.100
fucking gonna hang around the house here and get over this shit actually feel a

274
00:16:22.101 --> 00:16:25.460
thousand times better than it felt yesterday.
Um,
I just need to walk around.

275
00:16:25.461 --> 00:16:26.241
They sound weird thing,
you know,

276
00:16:26.241 --> 00:16:30.750
when he gets sick when you're supposed to lay around and relax and you know,
eat,

277
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:34.790
you know,
is it,
why is it each soup?
You know what I mean?
You slurp it,
right?

278
00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:38.870
This one,
it was hybrid things.
It's almost a gas instead of liquid.

279
00:16:38.871 --> 00:16:42.890
It's not a solid,
you know,
it is a liquid and it's a solid,
that's what it is.

280
00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.870
It's like a supergroup of food.
Um,
no,
it is a bill.

281
00:16:47.871 --> 00:16:52.820
It's like cereal.
If you heated it up,
what do you put that?
You know,

282
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:54.530
they know.
I saw when I was on the road,

283
00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:59.090
I actually saw Pringles potato chips and they had dill flavor and I love fucking

284
00:16:59.091 --> 00:17:01.310
dill pickles and I love Pringles potato chips.

285
00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:05.690
And those two came together and I couldn't get myself to do it because it just,

286
00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:09.350
it was coming across like it was going to be like a supergroup,
you know,

287
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:15.070
like what if we took fucking Robert Plant and fucking stuck them with Keith

288
00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.030
Moon?
Remember they would do shit like that and then it's just,

289
00:17:17.031 --> 00:17:19.550
and then it just never sounded good cause the vibe wasn't there.

290
00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.230
I'm just so worried that that's what it's going to be.
You on some level like,
um,

291
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:23.750
you know,

292
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:28.750
it's gonna ruin my enjoyment of original Pringles and uh,

293
00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:34.330
and dill pickles.
You are lovable Pringles that they taste delicious and I'm a,

294
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:37.370
I'm a bit of a neat freak,
although my office is a fucking mess right now.

295
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:41.300
You know,
I hate fucking dishes in the sink the next morning.

296
00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:46.340
It like depresses me.
I fucking knock him out.
Yeah.

297
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:51.990
Basically an incredible father and husband is what I'm telling you.

298
00:17:51.991 --> 00:17:55.020
That's my version of it.
That's my version of the story.

299
00:17:55.021 --> 00:17:56.370
Eventually we'll have NIA on here.

300
00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:00.420
What she's feeling better and then she'll probably tell you the truth that I'm a

301
00:18:00.421 --> 00:18:05.370
fucking ass hole over there.
Did Anybody Watch the fucking Austrian,
um,

302
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:10.820
Formula One race?
That is my favorite fucking Formula One race that I've been,

303
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:14.940
that I've ever watched and I've only watched since Monaco 2016 and I've missed a

304
00:18:14.941 --> 00:18:16.980
few here or there.
Um,

305
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:22.430
absolutely loved that fucking race.
Um,

306
00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:24.030
I'm a huge fan of Max for,

307
00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.710
and I feel like he's the next guy came and Daniel Ricardo,
right?

308
00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:32.040
Daniel Ricardo's gonna fucking leave red bull.

309
00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.380
I don't know where he's going to go.
Ferrari.

310
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.250
I don't know if there's room in the Mercedes seem,
I have no fucking idea,

311
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:42.970
but it was just like the top two guys.
Uh,

312
00:18:42.971 --> 00:18:44.500
what's his face?
Uh,

313
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.890
Max for stappen and Kimmy Reagan and they're fucking hilarious.

314
00:18:47.891 --> 00:18:50.640
Their press conferences are hilarious.
They're after,
they just,

315
00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:55.360
they don't give a shit.
Um,
you know,
they just,

316
00:18:55.361 --> 00:18:59.860
they have like that comic's comic vibe about him.
Like,
I know when,
um,

317
00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.870
I was talking about the last time,
uh,

318
00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:05.800
Sebastian Vettel had banged into a couple of people in Max for staff and during

319
00:19:05.801 --> 00:19:09.190
the,
um,
after the press conference,
he goes,

320
00:19:09.191 --> 00:19:12.390
you guys should tell him he should change his style of driving.
You know,

321
00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.940
cause they had said that to him.
And then Tim Max early in the season,

322
00:19:15.941 --> 00:19:16.331
then he goes,

323
00:19:16.331 --> 00:19:20.050
and then fucking Sebastian should continue to drive exactly the way he's driving

324
00:19:20.051 --> 00:19:21.550
cars.
That I haven't changed anything.

325
00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.910
And now you guys aren't shitting on him because I'm winning by the way.

326
00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.480
And then the United States to hosteen came in fifth and sixth.

327
00:19:28.481 --> 00:19:32.890
That's like our highest place ever was at fourth and fifth or fifth and sixth.

328
00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.700
It might've been fourth or fifth.
I got to look it up here.
I can't remember.

329
00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:39.610
But a Mercedes though.
Oh my God,

330
00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:44.860
they had a fucking brutal day.
Abril it SOPs because I wanted,
um,

331
00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:50.380
they always want to see like a close race at the end.
Um,
but I got to be,

332
00:19:50.381 --> 00:19:52.480
I'm a little jaded with this sport where I was just,
you know,

333
00:19:52.481 --> 00:19:53.680
after the first term,
which was,

334
00:19:53.681 --> 00:19:56.770
and it was a fucking incredible start to the race.

335
00:19:57.910 --> 00:19:58.743
<v 1>MMM.</v>

336
00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:04.070
<v 0>And I remember when Louis Hamilton,
uh,</v>

337
00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.540
got into first place after the first year and I got so over,
he's gonna win.

338
00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:12.290
He's gonna win it.
Put the track was so fucking hot.
That tire started to blister.

339
00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:16.730
Some bullshit happened.
I don't know what and what's his face?
Uh,

340
00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:19.960
no,
we came in fourth and fifth,

341
00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:26.470
corrosion and Magnus in fourth and fifth.
Um,
and lastly,
um,

342
00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:28.491
I don't know what happened.

343
00:20:28.491 --> 00:20:31.530
Somebody was going to fucking slow or something that caused Lewis Hamilton.

344
00:20:31.531 --> 00:20:35.510
They have to slow down and then he got passed and then he had to go into the

345
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:39.010
fucking pits or say you had to do one extra pitstop is what happened.

346
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:42.520
And that fucked him.
But that guy is such a good driver.
Even in the end,

347
00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:45.910
the other guy's tires were starting to blister up and he was,

348
00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:49.570
she was just right there and then all the drama went out when he fucking his
car.

349
00:20:49.571 --> 00:20:52.000
Shit,
the bed and I believe,
uh,

350
00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:56.020
Valtteri Botox and some sort of gearbox failure.
But um,

351
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.630
and also what's his face?
Uh,
um,

352
00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.730
Daniel Ricardo is please fucking car shit.
The bed too.

353
00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.280
He's been having a rough go of it.
But uh,

354
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:10.390
I just liked it cause it just put different people in the lead that I haven't

355
00:21:10.391 --> 00:21:14.290
seen.
I know Max for has done well over the last few.
Um,

356
00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:18.370
but it was,
it was just fun to watch all of that shit.
Um,

357
00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.550
and then watch Louis Hamilton having like the,

358
00:21:21.551 --> 00:21:26.110
the fastest lap of the race trying to catch up like Bill Elliot back in the day

359
00:21:26.111 --> 00:21:30.490
and the stock car races.
And uh,
then unfortunately his car,
shit the bed.

360
00:21:30.491 --> 00:21:34.840
But is the big thing was he was up 14 points.

361
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:40.690
Lewis Hamilton over a Sebastian Vettel Vettel came in third and I believe you

362
00:21:40.691 --> 00:21:44.740
get 15 points and Lewis Hamilton got no points.

363
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:48.850
So now ventral is leapfrogged pass him and he's up one point.

364
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.433
Um,

365
00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:54.910
because I was hoping he wasn't going to slowly fucking pull away.

366
00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.130
I think they race again next week in Great Britain.

367
00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.020
And then they might be on their break,

368
00:21:59.021 --> 00:22:02.050
there's summer break and then there'll be neck and neck for the rest of the
year.

369
00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:06.250
So far Ferrari can fucking hang in there.
It should be exciting,

370
00:22:06.251 --> 00:22:08.980
right through a Brazil and on into November where they,

371
00:22:08.981 --> 00:22:13.450
what are they always end up,
he said Dubai,
he can't fucking remember.
Um,

372
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:19.120
so anyways,
very fucking excited about that race.
Uh,
maybe I sucked.

373
00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:23.740
You know that Mercedes got knocked down is also Daniel Ricardo.

374
00:22:23.741 --> 00:22:27.220
But it was just fun to see some new blood up there and then,
you know,

375
00:22:27.221 --> 00:22:29.890
watching Louis Hamilton putting on a fucking show as he was dealing with the

376
00:22:29.891 --> 00:22:34.810
foot,
his tires literally falling apart.
Um,
anyways,

377
00:22:34.811 --> 00:22:38.110
when I was,
uh,
when I was in also when I was in,
uh,
Minneapolis,

378
00:22:38.111 --> 00:22:41.650
if forgot to tell you I was going to try a different place to get a juicy Lucy.

379
00:22:41.651 --> 00:22:46.510
Last time I went to maths bar and I got this fucking Uber driver.
It's hilarious.

380
00:22:46.511 --> 00:22:47.440
This Indian guy

381
00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:52.420
and there's a lot of construction going on downtown in Minneapolis and it said

382
00:22:52.421 --> 00:22:54.250
he was five minutes away for 15 minutes.

383
00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:59.170
He finally pulls up and this dude was like the fucking old Indian version of me.

384
00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:03.340
Like he was like snapping on me cause he was mad about construction.

385
00:23:03.341 --> 00:23:06.070
But I understood it because like it took me a minute to figure out like,

386
00:23:06.071 --> 00:23:10.450
why is this guy yelling at me?
I go,
I want to go to whatever that fucker was.

387
00:23:10.451 --> 00:23:14.290
The five [inaudible] club was going to try that one next,
right?
And he goes,

388
00:23:14.291 --> 00:23:18.130
I need an address medially yelling at me.
And I go,
all right dude,
relax.
No,

389
00:23:18.131 --> 00:23:20.020
you can't just say the name of that place.
I need an address.

390
00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:23.170
I was like to stop yelling at me.
He goes,
I'm not yelling at you,
aren't you?
Yes.

391
00:23:23.171 --> 00:23:26.950
You argue,
yell at.
And then verse,
he gets in the car,
he's looking at me,
I'm like,

392
00:23:26.951 --> 00:23:30.910
dude,
this guy's fucking nut.
You know,
this guy's yelling at me.
And he goes,

393
00:23:30.911 --> 00:23:35.060
I need an address.
And I'm like,
well,
the name of the places is,

394
00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.420
is the five eight club putting your phone,
you fucking cunt.
Right?

395
00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:40.480
So now I went to his energy,

396
00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:44.110
but fortunately I've been really working on it and I brought it back down again

397
00:23:44.111 --> 00:23:45.800
and I was just like,
hey,
all right.
You know?

398
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.830
<v 3>Okay,</v>

399
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:51.760
<v 0>like I understand this traffic here,
right?
Let's,</v>

400
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:53.290
and then he was trying to smile his way through it,

401
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.690
realize that he went to fucking nuts.
So I think I gave the wrong address.

402
00:23:56.691 --> 00:23:59.210
He would have taken us to Matt Bar.
So now it's like really tense,
Barb.

403
00:23:59.211 --> 00:24:01.370
Nick's riding in the front seat and this fucking guy's little,

404
00:24:01.371 --> 00:24:04.940
it's like we're with our fucking angry grandfather who are all trying to be on

405
00:24:04.941 --> 00:24:08.510
our best behavior.
So Barton x tries to lighten the mood.

406
00:24:08.511 --> 00:24:10.400
We see this fat chick on a bicycle,
you know,

407
00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.550
she was at a dead stop and that she's trying to get it going.
So it's just like,

408
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:15.980
you know,
it's precarious when you start off a bike,

409
00:24:15.981 --> 00:24:17.300
if you're not pedaling fast enough,

410
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:21.590
especially when you carrying that kind of weight and Barney was a Jesus Christ.

411
00:24:21.591 --> 00:24:24.050
Look at her man.
He goes,
they don't have assets like that in India,
do they?

412
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:27.380
He's like,
maybe on an elephant.
Right.
And the guy started laughing.

413
00:24:27.381 --> 00:24:29.450
I was just like,
yeah,
that'd be a fucking sacred cow over there.

414
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:30.830
And we just fucking broke the ice.

415
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:36.050
We broke the ice by making fun of a fat chick and bringing up stereotypical shit

416
00:24:36.051 --> 00:24:39.620
from that guy's culture.
That's how we did it.
And then he pulled up,

417
00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:42.470
he ended up pulling up to Matt's bar instead of the five,
eight club.

418
00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:47.170
And I was like,
oh,
this isn't where I wanted to go.
And he kind of looked at me.

419
00:24:47.171 --> 00:24:49.690
I was just like,
forget it.
It's all right.
It's fine.
I just,

420
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.680
I don't wanna get yelled at again.

421
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:55.210
I was living like a battered wife at that point.
Like,
okay,
Bye Dad.

422
00:24:55.630 --> 00:25:00.190
I love you.
Is fucking drove off.
Um,

423
00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.000
all right,
let me read,
let me read a little bit of a,
and by the way,

424
00:25:04.001 --> 00:25:05.860
it was delicious.
And they,
they have,
uh,

425
00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.970
they get mail a half Miller high life and a bottle there.
You know,

426
00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.880
they want the dangerous thing about a Miller high life.

427
00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:17.770
Is this just something about the bottle?
It feels like it's eight ounces.

428
00:25:17.771 --> 00:25:20.320
It just doesn't feel like it's 12 ounces of beer and they just,

429
00:25:20.321 --> 00:25:24.740
they just go down so easy,
you know?
And I had a show that night,
so,
uh,

430
00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:30.820
you know,
ended up having a think we had like two and the waitress was cool,

431
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.340
you know,
she was asking us about the show.

432
00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:37.230
We ended up hooking her up and then she gave us some fucking hats and shit,
man,

433
00:25:37.231 --> 00:25:40.700
I was really just,
it was fucking up in Minneapolis is,
it's fucking awesome.

434
00:25:40.701 --> 00:25:43.640
The people up there are fucking awesome.
And then I go to Detroit,

435
00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:47.720
you know,
the fucking great.
And I actually was actually like,

436
00:25:47.721 --> 00:25:52.280
as I just literally landed,
went to the hotel and then went out and did the show.

437
00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.400
So let's do my typical Detroit material,
but are white people,
you know,

438
00:25:55.401 --> 00:25:59.690
drive a hundred miles an hour into,
uh,
the tiger's game and after that,
you know,

439
00:25:59.691 --> 00:26:02.270
and then drive back out,
cause it's so fucked up in the downtown area.

440
00:26:02.271 --> 00:26:04.280
And I knew it was making a comeback.
Every time I go there,

441
00:26:04.281 --> 00:26:07.610
it's a little bit nicer.
But dude,
it's like those jokes are over now.

442
00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:13.720
I walked out after my show at about 10 30 at night and I saw a white guy,

443
00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.770
a white kid on a bicycle with a backpack riding down the street,

444
00:26:18.771 --> 00:26:22.150
not even nervous.
And I was just like,
like,
it's,

445
00:26:22.151 --> 00:26:25.610
it's in a real estate sense,
it's too late to buy there.

446
00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:30.080
You're already going to be paying like fucking top shelf prices.

447
00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.430
If the neighborhood got to the point where a white guy will ride down the street

448
00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:39.620
late at night,
you know,
with a backpack on,
you know,
he wasn't like a fucking,

449
00:26:39.621 --> 00:26:44.400
you know,
he wasn't like eight mile m and m white guy.
He was a white guy like me,

450
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:49.080
you know,
a suburban,
a suburban night,

451
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:54.660
a non dancing suburban white kid.
Um,
so anyways,
uh,

452
00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:57.630
they had like a John Varvatos downtown.
It was fucking ridiculous.

453
00:26:57.631 --> 00:27:00.100
I remember years ago I was telling versus going through it,

454
00:27:00.101 --> 00:27:01.200
I'm going to buy some property here.

455
00:27:01.201 --> 00:27:03.420
This place is gonna fucking blow up because you're out of your mind.

456
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:08.160
I was just like too,
it's a notebook.
It's here.

457
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:11.490
It's just what I saw this happen in Pittsburgh.
I saw this happen in Cleveland.

458
00:27:11.491 --> 00:27:14.910
I just didn't have fucking money at the time was I was fucking put it in this

459
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:17.400
Goddamn,
you know,

460
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.390
fucking money pit of a house that I bought.
It's a nice house now.

461
00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:24.570
It's a nice house now,
but I,
this is literally body off restoration.

462
00:27:24.571 --> 00:27:28.850
He had to do this fucking house.
Sorry.
Anyways,

463
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:33.950
uh,
and I remember seeing on the Anthony Bourdain show,
uh,

464
00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:36.900
parts unknown,
rest his soul.
I saw a guy,

465
00:27:36.901 --> 00:27:41.510
he bought a skyscraper there for 5 million bucks and I was thinking there was

466
00:27:41.511 --> 00:27:44.720
any way you could scrape together 5 million bucks and then renovate it,

467
00:27:44.721 --> 00:27:48.540
which I don't know what that would cost another 50,
45.

468
00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:51.900
And if you could just sit on that,
I mean,

469
00:27:51.901 --> 00:27:55.250
there's still a way that it's a skyscraper that city makes a comeback.

470
00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:57.520
That thing,
you know,
say is 60 billion in it,

471
00:27:57.521 --> 00:27:59.430
it's gonna be worth a quarter of $1 billion.

472
00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:02.100
And you know who fucking did all that shit.
The,
uh,

473
00:28:02.101 --> 00:28:04.410
the owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers,
he went down there,

474
00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:06.360
he bought a bunch of fucking buildings,
redid them,

475
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:10.980
had made the office a space cheap and he filled them up with these internet

476
00:28:10.981 --> 00:28:15.360
companies and um,
made me feel good.

477
00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:18.450
Then I was going to make the same moves at a billionaire fucking owner of a

478
00:28:18.451 --> 00:28:22.440
basketball team was going to make,
I just didn't down the fucking money.
Um,

479
00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:25.680
anyways,
but,
uh,
I'm very,

480
00:28:25.681 --> 00:28:30.681
very happy for that city as I was for Cleveland as I am for Pittsburgh and all

481
00:28:30.841 --> 00:28:34.380
that shit because it's such great cities,
Buffalo,
Baltimore,

482
00:28:34.381 --> 00:28:38.580
all of those cities going right through the Dayton.

483
00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:41.440
I love all of those fucking cities and they,

484
00:28:41.441 --> 00:28:44.760
and all they need is just people to fucking invest in them.

485
00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.080
You know what I mean?
I'll tell you when we're done free in the Iraqis,

486
00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:52.230
we ought to come back here and try to help out some of these fucking cities.

487
00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:57.660
Get him going against our building.
Shit.
You know,
if I was running shit,

488
00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.540
I'd have these fucking hipsters,
right?
I would just have them like,

489
00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.830
what are you into right now?

490
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.460
What are you going to bring back from the past and do it in some artists in

491
00:29:05.461 --> 00:29:07.980
fucking way and you know,
just,
you know,

492
00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:11.430
give him a break on factories and shit and just start making stuff here again.

493
00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:14.660
You'll say what you want about hipsters.
They like a lot of cool stuff there.

494
00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:19.470
Just insufferable to talk to.
Um,
all right.
The black box both.
Sorry,

495
00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.670
the Black Tux.

496
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.560
I don't know if that was from watching too much porn or having a pilot's
license.

497
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:31.980
The Black Tux,
a wedding season is upon us.
Uh,

498
00:29:31.981 --> 00:29:35.700
you're going to be doing it big and going out to all your buddies weddings.

499
00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:39.480
When you bringing a date,
you want to look fresh.
Yeah.
You want to hook up.

500
00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:43.600
You don't have to bring a date.
You want to go there like fucking Jim Carrey.

501
00:29:43.601 --> 00:29:47.170
Dumb and dumber,
but have a cool Tuxedo.
But it has to be convenient.

502
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.510
That's where the black,
the black Tux comes in.

503
00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:54.880
The black tops has awesome suits and Tuxedos and all kinds of styles and your

504
00:29:54.881 --> 00:29:58.390
rent them online.
All right.

505
00:29:58.391 --> 00:30:01.540
I just hit pause and I blew my nose while it wasn't recording.
See,

506
00:30:01.541 --> 00:30:02.860
I learned from my mistakes.

507
00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:07.360
The black Tux offers the kind of suits and Tuxedos styles that would normally be

508
00:30:07.361 --> 00:30:08.920
wildly expensive to buy,

509
00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:14.080
and you might only wear it once like the Emerald Shawl Tuxedo.
It's Funky,

510
00:30:14.081 --> 00:30:14.914
it's cool.

511
00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:19.270
But how many times you gonna to wear an Emerald Green Tuxedo with the Black Tux?

512
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:20.163
You can,

513
00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:21.270
<v 2>yeah,</v>

514

One,
one time event.</v>

515
00:30:26.191 --> 00:30:26.730
Yeah,
you gotta,

516
00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:31.530
you gotta go with something a little bit flashy and don't bring a fucking date

517
00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:34.530
automatically before you even open your mouth.
You're going to seem interesting.

518
00:30:34.531 --> 00:30:36.840
Forget about when the ladies start drinking.
Next thing you know,

519
00:30:36.841 --> 00:30:40.740
you're out there doing the mock arena,
right?
And you're like,

520
00:30:40.741 --> 00:30:44.760
why would you ever get married?
And that's called being in your 20s all right,

521
00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:46.080
so try out a new look.

522
00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.930

525
00:30:56.131 --> 00:30:58.320

plural

526
00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:01.600
<v 2>months.
I've been doing that for fucking months,</v>

527
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:05.320

538
00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:44.840
<v 2>All right,
here we go.
Lastly,
but certainly not leastly simply safe.</v>

539
00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:50.480
Here's what I love about simply safe.
These guys obsess over details.

540
00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:55.370
It's why the alarm system is so good.
Here's an example.
A typical glass break.

541
00:31:55.371 --> 00:32:00.371
Sensors sometimes gets fooled of false positive sounds like dropping plates,

542
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:04.840
a baby crying.
Oh,
then it freaks out.
He says,

543
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:07.730
<v 0>British are coming or the sky's falling.
Simply saved in,</v>

544
00:32:07.731 --> 00:32:09.260
want to settle for a typical,

545
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:13.100
didn't want to set a for typical because really good home security should be

546
00:32:13.101 --> 00:32:14.120
really accurate.

547
00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:19.370
So they actually considered a glass break test facility.

548
00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:21.350
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

549
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:23.300
<v 0>Well they have a bunch of toddlers in there throwing glasses.</v>

550
00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:27.410
They ran over 10,000 live glass breaks,
simulations,

551
00:32:27.411 --> 00:32:31.970
refining their technology,
the detection technology,
until it was so accurate.

552
00:32:31.971 --> 00:32:36.230
It continues.
It can distinguish a broken plate from a broken window.

553
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:38.311
Jesus Christ.

554
00:32:38.311 --> 00:32:43.190
Can you believe somebody knows to like make up fucking a little piece of

555
00:32:43.191 --> 00:32:45.330
electronics?
Understand that.
Yeah.

556
00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:49.360
Even if they go not relevant,
you're going to be in 10 years.

557
00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:53.110
This is the level of details.
Simply safe puts into everything they do.

558
00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:55.300
It sets them apart from other security companies.

559
00:32:55.301 --> 00:32:58.180
Simply safe system is designed so you will never notice it.

560
00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:02.320
Never have to think about it.
It's that easy and intuitive.
There is no contract.

561
00:33:02.321 --> 00:33:04.240
They work hard to earn your business.
24,

562
00:33:04.241 --> 00:33:08.560
seven monitoring with police and fire dispatch.
It's just $15 a month.

563
00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:12.310

566
00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.490
Um,
yeah,

567
00:33:21.491 --> 00:33:25.870
but think why the people at the top are not concerned about the environment

568
00:33:25.871 --> 00:33:30.280
generally speaking and how they're content to just fucking use up all the oil,

569
00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:35.200
kill as many people as they need to kill to get the fucking oil,
you know,

570
00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:37.990
pollute the air as much as they can throw it in the fucking rivers.

571
00:33:37.991 --> 00:33:41.680
Why they don't give a shit?
You know,
how was just thinking?

572
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:44.320
I think it's because we're all going,
you know,

573
00:33:44.321 --> 00:33:48.100
all us regular people are going to get replaced by robots.
You know what I mean?

574
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:53.170
The liberal Black Comedians,
you know,
robot fucking whores,

575
00:33:53.171 --> 00:33:54.550
whatever the hell you want it,
you know,
I don't know.

576
00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:57.070
Kind of ran out of jobs there,
but you know what I mean.

577
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:58.210
And then they're still gonna,

578
00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.240
they're still gonna live and they're going to be that upper 1% and they're going

579
00:34:01.241 --> 00:34:05.020
to have like,
just like essentially,
uh,

580
00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:10.060
an entire population that never complains is totally into what the fuck they're

581
00:34:10.571 --> 00:34:14.830
doing.
I think they'll keep,
uh,
a group of people,

582
00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:19.860
human beings as slaves and their job will be to fuck and make more people so

583
00:34:22.221 --> 00:34:25.880
that these older fucking rich one percenters can harvest their organs and live

584
00:34:25.881 --> 00:34:27.320
forever.
That's what I think.

585
00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:30.590
Those are the kinds of things that I think when I'm alone,

586
00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:35.510
um,
have you got to figure the first time you kill somebody for the,

587
00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.940
your Oregon's,
you could just going to do that forever.
Cause it's like,

588
00:34:37.941 --> 00:34:39.470
well I don't if there's a higher power,

589
00:34:39.471 --> 00:34:43.380
I don't think I want them meet him or her with,
with that on the resume,

590
00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:47.880
you know,
God just sitting across to you,
well you were busy

591
00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:52.050
sitting there,
shifted in that fucking chair.

592
00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:56.010
You just fucking know exactly what the fuck he's do.

593
00:34:56.011 --> 00:34:57.960
You know exactly what he's talking about.
Like,

594
00:34:57.961 --> 00:35:01.230
that one's going to pop up and you got everybody's got probably that one thing

595
00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:04.860
except for truly good people,
which I'm not,
you know.

596
00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:06.373
<v 3>Okay.</v>

597
00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.970
<v 0>That can fire,
you know when I die,
if there is an afterlife,</v>

598
00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:14.900
I feel like God's gonna like fucks with you.

599
00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:18.710
Like you sit across the room and he just looks down at your,
your resume,
right.

600
00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:21.950
Probably has like the half glasses,
you know,

601
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:26.870
sitting on the end of his fucking all mighty knows eyebrows up and shit.

602
00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.470
And then he just kinda looks across the is probably like a,

603
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:35.620
do you want me to,
you want,
you want to tell me about this?
You know,

604
00:35:35.621 --> 00:35:40.080
and then you're sitting there going,
oh,
what's he talking about?
Is this a trick?

605
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:45.090
Uh,
Oh shit.
He can hear what I'm thinking.

606
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.840
Don't think about all the shit you did,
Bill.
He's going to know

607
00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:55.320
it's gonna be such a mind fuck.
Um,
anyways.

608
00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:57.640
<v 3>Okay.</v>

609
00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:01.330
<v 0>I don't know.
That's a weird fucking topic.
Dying.</v>

610
00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:08.580
Uh,
well the fuck around my,
but the hills,

611
00:36:08.581 --> 00:36:12.560
all my shit.
Oh,
there it is.

612
00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:16.020
Was trying to find on like my fucking shit.
I wanted to talk about,

613
00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:17.583
<v 3>okay.</v>

614
00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:23.710
<v 0>Detroit's fucking gorgeous white dude on a bicycle.
Too late to invest.</v>

615
00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:26.110
See,
that's what I do.
I just read a couple of words.
Oh yeah,

616
00:36:26.111 --> 00:36:30.250
that's what I wanted to talk about.
Um,
anyways,

617
00:36:30.251 --> 00:36:34.080
so I'm so psyched to be back out here in Los Angeles.
You know,

618
00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:38.920
when I was in Detroit,
um,
it's weird when I was in Minneapolis,

619
00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.680
I already what they were known for,
which is the juicy Lucy,

620
00:36:41.681 --> 00:36:43.870
which is a fucking incredible,
like the one it maths bar.

621
00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:45.610
They've got this nice char on it.

622
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:48.490
Then they got the cheese of course in the middle and it's molten hot,

623
00:36:48.491 --> 00:36:52.330
so you gotta be careful,
nibble,
nibble around the outside.
And um,

624
00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.940
so it was,
it was delicious.
And,
um,

625
00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.790
and the beer was ice cold.
It was fucking great.

626
00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.790
It made me wish I didn't have a show that night.
I was like,

627
00:37:03.850 --> 00:37:07.540
I think I want another one of these and I want to sit here and just fucking

628
00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:11.470
watch a game,
you know?
And,
um,

629
00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:15.770
but then I went to Detroit
and,
um,

630
00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:22.280
you know,
I ordered Tacos,
stupid fucking move.

631
00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:24.730
I mean they were good,
but they weren't,
but you know,
they're not.

632
00:37:24.731 --> 00:37:29.470
La La knows is known for Tacos.
San Francisco is known for Burritos

633
00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:35.380
and I'm known for being pasty.
Oh,
let's talk a world cup.
Shall We?

634
00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:40.810
Let's see what's going on in the FIFA World Cup.
I watched a couple of games.

635
00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:46.510
Um,
I can't even tell you who the fuck I saw.
I did see the highlights.

636
00:37:46.511 --> 00:37:50.650
So when I wanted to watch was Brazil and Mexico,
you know what I mean?

637
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:55.710
I mean that was just a fucking soccer supernova as far as I was concerned about

638
00:37:55.871 --> 00:38:00.540
Russia beaten Spain,
that,
that,

639
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:03.590
that was like the fucking lake placid moment,
you know.

640
00:38:03.591 --> 00:38:05.750
And I was sitting at immediately going like,
oh this is going to be weird.

641
00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:09.050
It's Russia keeps moving along.
You know,

642
00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:12.560
you watch America is going to be a bunch of babies about it,
you know,

643
00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:15.980
cause everybody's already saying that they kind of fucked with our election or

644
00:38:15.981 --> 00:38:20.000
whatever.
And uh,
you know,

645
00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:24.560
of course the election now,
the World Cup,
they don't like we give a shit.

646
00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:29.000
Um,
but game did I watch,

647
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:34.580
I watched the Dutch people play?

648
00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:38.500
Uh,
uh,
fuck,
I can't remember.

649
00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:44.040
But the other people want some of the best goaltending I've seen in soccer ever.

650
00:38:45.161 --> 00:38:49.570
The fucking game starts,
first of all,
uh,
the Dutch guys,

651
00:38:49.571 --> 00:38:54.220
right?
Oh,
is it Denmark?
Denmark,
right.
They fucking a a Denmark Dutch people.

652
00:38:54.221 --> 00:38:56.380
Is that the Netherlands?
I don't know.
I'm an American.

653
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:59.620
They don't talk about the rest of the world.
Okay.

654
00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:03.490
They talk about the fucking white people that started this country.

655
00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.920
That's what gets driven into your fucking skull.

656
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.863
<v 1>MMM.</v>

657
00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:12.100
<v 0>So the,
uh,
Denmark,</v>

658
00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:17.180
she scores a goal like 40 seconds in or a minute in or something like that.

659
00:39:17.411 --> 00:39:21.700
And then like 45 seconds later,
the other guy score the guys who won.

660
00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:23.460
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

661
00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:27.780
<v 0>I can't fucking remember Croatia.
So luckiest Sylvania,</v>

662
00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:29.003
Romania.

663
00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:32.590
<v 1>MMM.</v>

664
00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:35.170
<v 0>I don't know who the fuck it was.
They fucking score.
I'm like,
Oh my God,</v>

665
00:39:35.171 --> 00:39:38.530
this is finally my dream game.
Ben and a half.
And there's already been two goals.

666
00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:40.690
This is some shit American can appreciate.

667
00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:45.130
And then there wasn't another goal for like another fucking hour and a half.

668
00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:50.350
But,
uh,
I do have to say the goaltending was fucking incredible.
All right.

669
00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:55.410
And that guy with his fucking golden fucking locks there,

670
00:39:55.561 --> 00:39:57.540
go come head for fucking

671
00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:02.340
in Denmark was incredible.

672
00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:06.090
And then the other guy was just a fucking lunatic.
One of those guys,

673
00:40:06.091 --> 00:40:09.630
you could tell he can't shut it off after the game and they would just guess it,

674
00:40:09.631 --> 00:40:10.230
right?
Uh,

675
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:13.290
they dive and then the guy would shoot to the middle of the fucking get his foot

676
00:40:13.291 --> 00:40:17.100
out while he was diving the other way.
Uh,

677
00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:20.700
and whenever you miss a penalty fucking kick like is,
is the shooter,

678
00:40:20.701 --> 00:40:24.780
whatever you fuck,
you call them,
right?
They,
you know that they're fucking,

679
00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:28.320
they're just thinking like,
Oh God,
I'm going to get fucking,

680
00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:30.780
I'm never going to hear the end of this when I go back to my country.

681
00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:32.820
I'm never going to hear the fucking end of this,
you know,

682
00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:37.830
unless somebody steps up and saves my fucking ass.
So I did see that game.

683
00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:41.640
I did see the Brazil game with that Rinaldo guy.
Oh my God.

684
00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:45.810
I thought for half a second he was literally on fire.
You know,

685
00:40:45.811 --> 00:40:49.170
like when will Ferrell was running around and Ricky Bobby with the invisible

686
00:40:49.171 --> 00:40:51.720
flames,
he was tearing off all his clothes.

687
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:56.130
I thought that that's who it was.
What was happening.
Um,

688
00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:00.780
I mean,
I know the guys,
it definitely should have been a penalty.

689
00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:03.240
It was a piece of shit move.
The guy stepped on him.

690
00:41:03.241 --> 00:41:05.640
He raked is fucking cleat right across his ankle.

691
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:10.910
I imagine it's smarted but Jesus Christ that was like silent film acting.

692
00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:14.333
<v 1>MMM.</v>

693
00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:18.680
<v 0>Depending wins against Brazil.
One,
two to nothing.
And uh,</v>

694
00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:22.250
we're getting down to it.
So I imagine France or England was playing today,
right?

695
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.770
No,
France is going to play.
They were already in like a,
they're already in.

696
00:41:26.771 --> 00:41:27.680
Why don't I look it up?

697
00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:33.130
FIFA World Cup standings and then you've got to fight through all these CBS cars

698
00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:38.660
that don't fucking have it.
I want the grid and what the bracket,

699
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:43.280
give me the bracket.
World Cup bracket,
CBS sports.

700
00:41:43.281 --> 00:41:45.200
You're gonna fuck me against CBS sports.

701
00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:47.370
<v 1>Come on</v>

702
00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:49.720
<v 0>slowly opening.</v>

703
00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:56.720
This fucking website sucks.
It keeps saying brackets.
It doesn't have the bracket.

704
00:41:57.290 --> 00:42:00.300
Whereas our bracket,
there's nothing I can,

705
00:42:00.301 --> 00:42:05.010
I can click on schedule.
The standings are,
who the fuck's play in today?

706
00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:09.400
World Cup schedule.
I'm clicking.

707
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:15.590
No,
you fucking asshole.
Russia 2018 schedule.

708
00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:24.120
Oh my God.
I found the bracket.
All right.
Oh,
I watched the Erg way.
Always.

709
00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:27.850
I was Uruguay.
Earl grey,
beat Portugal.
I watched that game shot up.

710
00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:31.690
I watched uh,
Croatia be dead.

711
00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:35.700
<v 1>MMM.</v>

712
00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:39.490
<v 0>I guess Sweden beat Switzerland for the love of,
I don't know why.</v>

713
00:42:39.491 --> 00:42:43.840
The abbreviation for their country is Sui.
There's no you in Switzerland.

714
00:42:43.841 --> 00:42:46.180
Why would it be WWE?
Is that too close to Sweden?

715
00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:47.853
<v 1>MMM.</v>

716
00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:54.940
<v 0>Brazil is clean.
Belgium.
All right,
so the last person who has to get in is,</v>

717
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
is England,
is playing Columbia.

718
00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:02.320
When the fuck is that game,
I got to take that one.

719
00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.840
Then they get into the quarter finals,
then there's the semis,

720
00:43:04.841 --> 00:43:08.500
and then there's a final game.
Fucking goes by so fast.

721
00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:12.160
So it was one,
two,
this three,
basically three more rounds.

722
00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:14.333
<v 1>MMM.</v>

723
00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.380
<v 0>And I'm going to watch it for once.</v>

724
00:43:16.381 --> 00:43:19.260
I don't think I've watched the final since that guy from Italy missed that

725
00:43:19.261 --> 00:43:22.490
penalty shot.
You know,
but I,

726
00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:25.920
I remember when I was a kid way back in the 80s,
Diego,
Donna,

727
00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:29.240
the hand of God and all of that Shit.
But,
uh,

728
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:32.000
other than that I remember also was in the,

729
00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:36.680
it wasn't it in the u s and like 94 and like 30 Americans showed up,

730
00:43:36.681 --> 00:43:39.920
but it's still sold out because everybody around the world was like so excited.

731
00:43:39.921 --> 00:43:42.560
Like,
oh my God,
it's going to be so easy to get tickets.
Let's go.

732
00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:44.753
<v 1>MMM.</v>

733
00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:48.790
<v 0>All right,
let's read some,
uh,
some of the fucking questions here for the week.</v>

734
00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:53.560
Was it really,
really need to swear right there.
All right.
Um,

735
00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:57.180
where are we?
Sweden.
Oh,
speaking of that,
please come to Sweden.

736
00:43:57.190 --> 00:44:00.130
Last time you were here,
I was a little kid and it didn't know about you,

737
00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:03.360
but I really liked your podcasts and your stand up is amazing,
isn't it?

738
00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:08.020
Like how young that person is.
I haven't been there about five years,

739
00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:12.020
you know?
So what have you,
like 15?

740
00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:16.060
You'd probably still already like five,
11 super tall kids of,

741
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:19.820
I'm putting together an eastern European tour,
by the way.

742
00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:24.950
Um,
hopefully for the beginning part of next year.
I'm teasing that,

743
00:44:24.951 --> 00:44:27.680
that that's what's going to be happening when we go into a bunch of countries

744
00:44:27.681 --> 00:44:32.070
that I've never been to before.
And uh,
but I know I have to get back to Sweden.

745
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.020
I haven't been there and way too way too long,

746
00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:36.660
so I will definitely get back there.
All right.
Uh,

747
00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:39.260
thank you for the compliments of my podcast and my stand up.
Uh,

748
00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:43.710
can a comic cover a comedic bit like a musician?

749
00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:49.410
Uh,
no they can't.
They can't.
Let's he tells everybody,

750
00:44:49.411 --> 00:44:50.550
remember that Cosby bit?

751
00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:55.320
You remember that prior bit dear bill one ran away from an aneurysm birth of I

752
00:44:55.321 --> 00:44:59.320
hit how true that is,
Ken.
I want to be stand up Co.
Oh,
want to be state.

753
00:44:59.321 --> 00:45:01.140
You're not an actual standup comedian.

754
00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:04.920
Cover comedic bit like a wannabe musician would cover his son.

755
00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:09.990
I'm not talking about a paid gig.
Just an open Mike.
Nah,

756
00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:12.480
don't do that because you're already,
you're,
even though you're not a pro,

757
00:45:12.481 --> 00:45:16.470
cause you're not getting paid.
You are.
Yeah.
You don't do that.
This is,

758
00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:19.820
there's no coffee house of standup comedy set.

759
00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:22.680
If you're a professional like yourself and I'm putting on a special,

760
00:45:22.681 --> 00:45:26.310
it should be totally original content.
Um,

761
00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:28.860
the thing is not all of us are as funny as you,

762
00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:32.970
but we still want to make the world laugh and get a taste of the spotlight and

763
00:45:32.971 --> 00:45:34.840
maybe some groupie pussy to it.

764
00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:36.960
If you think that you're going to go up on an open mic,

765
00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:40.360
I don't give a fuck if you kill with original material.
When you get off stage,

766
00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:41.820
you still have to have game.

767
00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:44.970
That's the thing about being a comedian as a fucking musician.

768
00:45:44.971 --> 00:45:49.080
You go up there and you start singing a song,
it's fucking over.
I mean,
you,
you,

769
00:45:49.081 --> 00:45:49.321
you,

770
00:45:49.321 --> 00:45:53.220
you can do that at a fucking coffee house singing other people's fucking songs

771
00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:57.240
and it's just going to be rain in fucking vagina.
Uh,
comedians,

772
00:45:57.241 --> 00:45:59.340
we can go up there for an hour,

773
00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:03.620
hour and a half with their own material and you still have to work for it.

774
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:07.260
You know,
they want you to still be funny when you get off stage.

775
00:46:07.261 --> 00:46:09.840
Keep being funny keeping.
They don't want the other guy to fucking sing.

776
00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:14.460
He can sit there brooding,
you know,
smoking his cigarette.
Um,
anyways.

777
00:46:14.461 --> 00:46:17.490
Now your initial response will probably be something along the lines.
No,

778
00:46:17.491 --> 00:46:21.690
go write your own material.
You lazy piece of Shit.
Uh,

779
00:46:21.691 --> 00:46:24.420
you call me illiterate.
At least I can write my own jokes.
Oh,

780
00:46:24.421 --> 00:46:25.680
you trying out material right now?

781
00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:30.440
I did my time in the nightclubs bombing on stage and as a young,
skinny redhead.

782
00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:33.450
And you don't think I just wanted to go out there,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

783
00:46:33.451 --> 00:46:36.540
blah.
Go Fuck Yourself.
You leave these lazy cut.
Uh,

784
00:46:36.541 --> 00:46:39.530
the thing is I don't strive to be a professional comedian as,

785
00:46:39.531 --> 00:46:41.400
as engineering pays a lot better.

786
00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:44.070
And writing my own jokes seems like too much work too.

787
00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:48.120
I really don't give a shit about you right now.
You know what I mean?

788
00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:54.980
Hey Man,
like I,
you know,
I mean I just want to go fucking a play once,

789
00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:59.910
one down of professional football without getting hit.
Yeah,
go fuck yourself.

790
00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:02.910
Uh,
I just want to go on stage and give the illusion that I'm funny.

791
00:47:02.911 --> 00:47:07.140
So maybe a girl will think,
I actually have a personality.
You want to fuck me?
Oh,

792
00:47:07.141 --> 00:47:10.860
now we're getting to it.
Now we're getting to it.

793
00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:15.390
All right,
so you're an engineer.

794
00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:18.450
You probably introverted,
you're super smart,

795
00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:21.290
but you don't have anything going on with the ladies.

796
00:47:21.291 --> 00:47:24.630
So right now you think in like,
so you'll,
oh,
that's funny.

797
00:47:24.631 --> 00:47:29.230
And then you think that funny guys that comedians get a ton of ass.

798
00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:34.150
Uh,
I'm not saying there are guys out there that do,
but they work.
It's fucking,

799
00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:36.610
or unless you know,
you'd fucking ridiculously good looking,

800
00:47:36.611 --> 00:47:40.420
but like it's fucking work.

801
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:44.080
Um,
if it is out,
know if you're extended comedian,

802
00:47:44.081 --> 00:47:47.680
you kind of have like that slumber vibe,
slumber party vibe,
energy,

803
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:54.280
like all my God,
you got guys,
it's weird.
It's like a feminine,

804
00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:58.930
you know,
if you almost,
it's just a weird thing about women.

805
00:47:58.931 --> 00:48:01.060
If you give off an a feminine energy,

806
00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:04.780
you're actually going to get more fucking ass than a fucking,
uh,

807
00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:09.910
a guy
or I guess a guy vibe.

808
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:13.660
You know what I mean?
I mean,
look at David Bowie.

809
00:48:13.661 --> 00:48:15.280
The Guy was walking around wearing dresses.

810
00:48:15.281 --> 00:48:19.290
There was just women with prince was wearing high heel shoes,
his whole fucking,

811
00:48:19.291 --> 00:48:23.770
they eat,
they,
it was like a,
like the locusts,

812
00:48:23.771 --> 00:48:26.260
except it was all vaginas flying at those guys.

813
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:30.640
So maybe that's what you need to to do rather than,
uh,

814
00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:33.610
rather than steel from comedians.

815
00:48:33.611 --> 00:48:38.440
I would steal from Prince and David Bowie and I would think that you guys are

816
00:48:38.441 --> 00:48:41.950
all down there.
Everybody's wearing like the fucking white lab coat.

817
00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:47.580
If you added a little bit of Flair of feminine flare to your scientific is

818
00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:52.600
scientists coat,
who knows,
go to work,

819
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:56.220
design a bridge while wearing some fucking prince high yields.

820
00:48:56.380 --> 00:49:00.820
Fucking boots are telling you you're,
you're automatically,

821
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:06.760
you're going to be fucking interesting.
All right,
let me keep reading here.

822
00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:09.250
Uh,
I just want to go and save Blah,
blah,
blah.
He goes,

823
00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:12.520
I look at it like it's a scientific report.

824
00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:16.630
It's not plagiarism as long as you cite where you got the information from.

825
00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:20.200
So if at the beginning of the set I said something like most essays I wrote in

826
00:49:20.201 --> 00:49:24.100
college,
this set is completely plagiarized.
That's a funny joke to sir.

827
00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:27.280
Consisting of ideas from people much smarter than me.

828
00:49:27.281 --> 00:49:32.140
And the only original thing I have to say is this opening line in some assets

829
00:49:32.141 --> 00:49:34.360
somewhere else has probably already said this too.

830
00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:38.020
Or at the end of the set I say,
thanks for listening.

831
00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:39.430
If you want to see those jokes,

832
00:49:39.431 --> 00:49:43.300
they're actually supposed to be performed.

833
00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:46.000
How those jokes were actually supposed to be four and go check out bill barr.

834
00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:49.270
Dude,
you're cutting yourself short.
You're actually a funny guy.

835
00:49:50.590 --> 00:49:53.650
You're just lazy.
Um,

836
00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:59.590
you could actually use that opener and then go into one of the oldest jokes of

837
00:49:59.591 --> 00:50:00.430
all time,
you know,

838
00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:03.790
one of those fucking war environments where red suspenders and be like,

839
00:50:03.791 --> 00:50:04.624
I'm just fucking with you.

840
00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:08.650
And then to just talk about being a fucking engineer and I get no game with

841
00:50:08.651 --> 00:50:12.190
women.
You only have to be up there for five minutes.
All right?

842
00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:16.780
To that,
I actually think you want to fucking do this.

843
00:50:16.781 --> 00:50:20.950
And I also think you funny from that first line.
All right,
so there's,

844
00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:25.060
there's a year two options.
All right?

845
00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:30.110
If,
if,
yeah.
Sincerely from an unoriginal fan from the great white north.

846
00:50:30.111 --> 00:50:34.090
You're funny,
you're self deprecating.
You got enough here that it,

847
00:50:34.091 --> 00:50:38.330
it's not crazy to me that,
that you would go up and do an open mic,
but uh,

848
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:39.223
you know,

849
00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:43.490
it's the laziness factor that you just want to go up there and do other people's

850
00:50:43.491 --> 00:50:47.390
Shit.
But I understand.
I remember the first time I sat down to write like,
okay,

851
00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:50.720
I'm going to write jokes.
It's the weirdest feeling ever.
It's like,

852
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:55.340
how do you do this?
Like what do I even fucking,
what am I going to talk about?

853
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:58.220
How do I connect one idea to another?
You're not supposed to know.
All right?

854
00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:01.730
So just open with that line.
Talk about your life.
You know,

855
00:51:01.731 --> 00:51:04.400
who gives a fuck if you bail after three minutes?
That's what I did.

856
00:51:04.401 --> 00:51:06.830
I didn't even get through the five minutes.
They look at me,

857
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:11.540
tell her Dick Jokes all across the lead.
All right?
But um,

858
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:14.810
you're not going to get respect from other comics,

859
00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:18.710
other open mikes going out there and do it other people's fucking material and

860
00:51:18.711 --> 00:51:20.570
you will immediately be branded a thief.

861
00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:24.710
Watch out for this guy and there'll be a bunch of open makers who were severely

862
00:51:24.711 --> 00:51:28.100
insecure and they're going to need a target to fucking focus.

863
00:51:28.101 --> 00:51:30.950
They're awful childhoods on and that's going to be you.

864
00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:34.190
So I would open with that joke.
I would close with what the fuck he said.

865
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:37.130
I wouldn't do other people's material.
I talk about my life.

866
00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:40.320
And when you're at work,
you know,
whatever,
put a bow on assumption,

867
00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:43.280
tried to be interesting.
And a bank,

868
00:51:43.281 --> 00:51:46.550
one of the egg egg chicks she fucking work with.
You know,

869
00:51:46.551 --> 00:51:49.280
you guys can't go see star wars or something.
I Dunno.
Good luck to Ya.

870
00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:52.300
All right everybody,
I'll check it on your,
on our Thursday.
I'll,

871
00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:57.530
uh,
have a great couple of days.
You fucking suck.
Let's go.
Fuck yourselves.
