00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.510
So we were talking about
the beta distribution and

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.520
the gamma distribution separately.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.320
And I mentioned that they're connected but
we haven't seen, how is

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.440
beta connected to gamma other than being
consecutive letters of the Greek alphabet?

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.170
So there's one very, very

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.260
famous example that connects the beta and
the gamma in a very neat way.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.500
So that seemed like a natural
starting point to bring the beta and

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.940
the gamma together.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.170
Another thing we haven't done yet
is figure out the normalizing constant for

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.300
the beta distribution,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.730
except in the special cases where we
could use Bayes Billiards arguments.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.880
So we want to have the normalizing
constant in general for beta and gamma.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.960
So, here's an example, it's a story
that connects the beta and gamma.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.229
I call it a bank and post office.

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:59.420
You can call it whatever you want.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.630
I just like having a concrete
example in mind and for

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.740
some reason I call this
the bank post office example.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.220
So the idea is you have to go
to the bank and do something.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.540
You have to go to the post office and
do something.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.090
Both of them you have to wait in line for
some amount of time.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.550
And let's define some notation.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.020
So let's say first you go to the bank and
you wait for

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.613
a total of X minutes to be served and

00:01:33.613 --> 00:01:38.825
suppose that X is

00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:44.040
gamma of a lambda.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.170
If a is an integer, I didn't just
like randomly write down gamma,

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.040
there would be a natural
interpretation here.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.430
If a is an integer,
let's gamma five lambda.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.810
Remember we saw that
the gamma five lambda,

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.930
you can think of it as the sum of
five i.i.d exponential lambda.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.420
So that would be like
the assumption that everyone,

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.750
there's five people in line before you and

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.180
each of them takes an exponential
lambda amount of time to be served.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.390
And there's only one line and

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.780
we could wait in line and
then eventually your turn.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.110
Okay, and then let y be gamma
of b lambda same thing.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.270
X is how long you wait, that's your
waiting time to be served at the bank.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.240
And Y is your waiting
time at the post office.

00:02:33.321 --> 00:02:35.389
And we'll assume they're independent.

00:02:38.196 --> 00:02:41.020
X is independent of Y,
that's the assumption.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.660
So that's a statement of the set up.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.483
Now the question is, first of all,
what's the distribution,

00:02:54.525 --> 00:02:57.544
Of your total waiting time?

00:03:01.533 --> 00:03:03.710
And let's call that T, T for total.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.470
That we already actually know.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.616
At least for the integer case.

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:16.600
If a and b are integers,
this is the sum of a i.i.d exponentials.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.930
This is the sum of b i.i.d exponentials.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.850
So together they must be
a plus b i.i.d exponentials.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.106
So just from that story you immediately
say that it's gamma a plus b,

00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:29.520
lambda and
we don't have to do anything else.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.630
If it's not an integer, you could just
to the MGF, that we also did, and

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.770
just multiply the MGFs.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.268
And again, that will confirm
gamma of a plus b lambda.

00:03:38.268 --> 00:03:39.850
All right, so that was easy.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.010
We didn't need to do anything.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:48.210
But suppose, another natural thing to look
at, is the fraction of time, that's just

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:53.360
of your total waiting time, what fraction
of that was spent waiting at the bank?

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.860
That's another natural thing to look at.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.440
I'll just call this thing W
just to have a name for it.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.140
I want the distribution of
these two things, not just one.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.170
Since there's two of them, actually
what we want is the joint distribution.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.760
We already know that the marginal
of this is gamma a plus b lambda.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.770
We don't yet know the distribution of W,
and we don't yet

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:15.940
know the joint distribution.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.900
So you might think to yourself
a little bit, if you had to guess,

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.830
do you think that the total time
spent waiting is independent or

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.680
dependent of the fraction of
time spent waiting at the bank?

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.080
Do you wanna guess?

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.580
How many of you think
that they're independent?

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.480
Okay, just guessing.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.800
And how many of you
think they're dependent?

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.240
Okay, pretty close.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.210
It's not obvious.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.820
At least I don't think it's obvious.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.460
So we have little calculation to find out
cuz I don't think it's intuitively obvious

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.430
one way or the other whether
they're independent or not.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.060
They don't look independent cause you have
the X plus Y here, but on the other hand

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.110
just knowing how long you waited, what
does that tell you about the fraction?

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:07.060
So, you can make an argument either way,
it's not going to resolve the question.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.580
So let's actually let lambda equal
1 just to simplify notation.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.352
It's not really any harder
with general lambda,

00:05:15.352 --> 00:05:17.470
just more notation floating around.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.462
For the general case, anyway,
we talked about the fact that you

00:05:24.462 --> 00:05:29.820
could go from gamma a1 to gamma a lambda,
just by dividing by lambda.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.180
So at the end of the day,
if we want to put lambdas back,

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.800
we could put lambdas everywhere.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.080
It's not gonna affect W, because you're
kind of scaling everything by the same

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.340
factor, it's gonna cancel out anyway.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.930
And then this one would be gamma a plus
b lambda instead of gamma a plus b1.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.740
It's just a scaling thing, so
this doesn't really lose any generality.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:51.610
All right.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.270
So now we just find the joint PDF.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.535
Okay, so here's the joint PDF.

00:06:01.133 --> 00:06:06.520
F sub TW of t,w equals.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.730
So we're gonna start with
the joint PDF of x and y.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.400
And then we need to adjust it by
multiplying by this Jacobian, so

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.810
we're gonna have to do a Jacobian.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.870
Probably this is the last
Jacobian I'll ever do in

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.830
lecture, but we do need one here.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.825
So there's gonna be this Jacobian thing,
d x,y

00:06:30.542 --> 00:06:35.584
d tw.

00:06:35.584 --> 00:06:38.066
Se we just need to compute
these things and then simplify.

00:06:38.066 --> 00:06:43.168
So, first of all the joint,

00:06:43.168 --> 00:06:48.980
because I assumed x and
y are independent the joint PDF of x and

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.660
y will just multiply the PDF
of x times the PDF of y.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.360
That's very straightforward.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.160
Just a gamma 1 over gamma of a.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.130
I'll just put the two normalizing
constants here those are both gammas.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:10.618
Remember the gamma PDF is x
to the a e to the minus x.

00:07:10.618 --> 00:07:15.930
And then we have the one for y,
y to the b, e to the minus y.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.730
And then there was an extra one over xy.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:21.180
Just in the gamma PDF.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.760
Times this Jacobian thing.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.910
Which we'll fill in.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.606
All right.
Let's do the Jacobian.

00:07:33.575 --> 00:07:36.738
Here are the transformations
written with capital letters but

00:07:36.738 --> 00:07:39.980
let's write the corresponding
thing with lowercase letters.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.210
That is we have x plus y equals t.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.780
And we have x over x plus y equals w.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:51.650
I think it's a little bit
easier if we invert this and

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:57.040
solve for t, solve for x and y in terms
of t and w, and that's not hard to do.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.220
Because, notice from this second equation,
that's just x over t.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.160
To the denominators t.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.574
So x over t = w, so x = w.

00:08:08.574 --> 00:08:11.320
So that's just easy algebra.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.491
And let's solve for y.

00:08:15.087 --> 00:08:23.070
If we take one minus this, we get,
take one minus on both sides.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.490
So I'll just write that separately.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.650
y over x + y = 1- w.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.355
I just took one minus on both sides.

00:08:31.355 --> 00:08:33.050
But that's just y over t.

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.780
So y = t 1- w.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:41.220
So that's what the transformation is,
it is in the other direction, right?

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:45.834
So, okay,
now we just need to do a 2x2 determinant.

00:08:49.286 --> 00:08:52.208
We take this notation means
take the derivatives of x and

00:08:52.208 --> 00:08:53.630
y with respect to t and w.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:58.150
So let's start with the x,
take the derivative with respect to t and

00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:59.115
we'll get w.

00:08:59.115 --> 00:09:01.915
Take the derivative with respect to w and
we'll get t.

00:09:04.152 --> 00:09:11.016
Now, go tot he y, take the derivative
with respect to t, that's 1- w.

00:09:11.016 --> 00:09:14.742
And then the derivative with respect to w,

00:09:14.742 --> 00:09:19.711
that's really just t- tw
derivative with respect to w,

00:09:19.711 --> 00:09:23.010
let's write that down, t- tw.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:24.870
Now we're taking the derivative
with respect to w, so

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.080
we're treating that part as a constant.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.865
And so then we would just have- t.

00:09:33.657 --> 00:09:38.510
Okay, and then we do the determinant,
that times that minus that times that.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:45.154
So that's- tw, and then- t times 1- w.

00:09:47.258 --> 00:09:54.070
So it's- tw, and it's-- tw, tw's cancel.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.230
The only thing that's left is this -t.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:10:01.948
So the Jacobian simplifies really nicely,
it's just- t.

00:10:01.948 --> 00:10:06.708
All right, and then in the Jacobian
formula, we're actually doing

00:10:06.708 --> 00:10:11.480
these absolute value bars here
are kind of serving a double purpose.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.540
That means, take the determinant and
then take the absolute value.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:18.330
Sometimes you might see it written with
like double or little bars like that,

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:19.290
which looks kind of ugly.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.770
But just to remind you, to take
the determinant, take the absolute value,

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.270
we don't want a negative PDF.

00:10:26.197 --> 00:10:31.170
Also, so that's just t here, so I don't
need to write the absolute value signs.

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:34.425
T is positive, so we're using t, not -t.

00:10:36.171 --> 00:10:38.493
All right, so now we have the joint PDF.

00:10:38.493 --> 00:10:44.352
The only thing we have to do that that's
left is to write this in terms of t and

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:47.150
w, cuz we still have xs and ys here.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:56.674
So I'm just gonna plug in, Plug in the
definition of x and y in terms of t and w.

00:10:58.328 --> 00:11:01.689
So x is tw, so that's,

00:11:01.689 --> 00:11:07.260
let's just write the w stuff first.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:14.100
So that's w to the a, and this one, y, I'm
just plugging in what I wrote for y there.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.560
That's 1- w to the b.

00:11:20.404 --> 00:11:24.385
Then, we also had, because it was tx,

00:11:24.385 --> 00:11:29.824
we have t to the a, t to the b,
so that's t to the a + b.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.288
Exponential is e to the- of x + y.

00:11:37.288 --> 00:11:41.710
But x + y is just t,
so that's e to the -t.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:45.672
So this is starting to
look like a gamma PDF.

00:11:45.672 --> 00:11:51.358
And then this stuff at the end, x,

00:11:51.358 --> 00:11:56.328
well let's see, x is tw,
so we're gonna have and y,

00:11:56.328 --> 00:12:02.090
this has a t, so we have 1 over
t cuz it's t over t squared.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:06.280
And then we also have an extra w and
an extra 1- w.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:12.004
So we'll just write that, a- 1 and b- 1.

00:12:13.623 --> 00:12:15.377
And is that everything?

00:12:15.377 --> 00:12:16.129
We can put a 1 here.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:23.666
So I was just trying to write is as
a function of w times a function of t.

00:12:23.666 --> 00:12:25.590
I was trying to do that.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:28.609
Well, actually, I did do that.

00:12:28.609 --> 00:12:33.270
So that's a function of w times a function
of t, therefore, they're independent.

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:39.660
Not at all obvious, but now we just
proved that they're independent.

00:12:41.348 --> 00:12:45.785
Okay, well,
the next question is what's the PDF?

00:12:45.785 --> 00:12:50.030
Well, we already knew this was a gamma
a + b lambda, and this confirms that.

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:53.621
The only thing that's kind of weird about
this is we don't have the normalizing

00:12:53.621 --> 00:12:54.166
constant.

00:12:54.166 --> 00:12:59.879
And I was discussing this in office hours
Wednesday night with a couple people like,

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:02.465
where's the normalizing constant?

00:13:02.465 --> 00:13:06.127
And my answer is,
if you don't see the normalizing constant,

00:13:06.127 --> 00:13:08.795
you can always just multiply by 1, right?

00:13:08.795 --> 00:13:11.396
So I'll just put it there, gamma a + b.

00:13:14.886 --> 00:13:19.242
Well, of course, I can only do that if I
multiply and divide by the same thing,

00:13:19.242 --> 00:13:21.291
so I'll put back gamma of a+b here.

00:13:23.072 --> 00:13:25.889
Writing it this way,

00:13:25.889 --> 00:13:31.685
now this is exactly the gamma of a+b1 PDF.

00:13:38.131 --> 00:13:40.441
All right, so some conclusions from this.

00:13:40.441 --> 00:13:43.070
First of all, they're independent.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:47.976
Secondly, let's find the marginal PDFs.

00:13:47.976 --> 00:13:56.570
If we integrate this thing,
Let's get the marginal PDF of w.

00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:01.269
So remember to get the marginal PDF,
we just integrate the joint PDF.

00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:03.114
And that's actually an easy integral.

00:14:04.165 --> 00:14:10.770
[COUGH] So we're just gonna
integrate this joint PDF dt, right?

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:13.390
Integrate out the t,
then we'll get the marginal of w.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:20.468
[COUGH] But that's an integral
you can do in your head, so

00:14:20.468 --> 00:14:22.650
I'm not gonna rewrite this whole thing.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:26.472
Because imagine sticking
an integral sign here,

00:14:26.472 --> 00:14:31.852
we're integrating dt, so this whole thing,
this is a function of w.

00:14:33.692 --> 00:14:38.235
So since this integral is dt,
you just take out this entire function,

00:14:38.235 --> 00:14:40.470
it's just serving as a constant.

00:14:42.167 --> 00:14:45.745
All we're left with then in
the integral is the integral of this,

00:14:45.745 --> 00:14:47.060
that's the gamma PDF.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.470
We already know it integrates to 1.

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:56.750
So the integral is just gamma of
a + b over gamma of a gamma of b,

00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:01.402
w to the a- 1, 1- w of the b- 1.

00:15:05.716 --> 00:15:10.122
As a consequence of that, we've actually
just derived the normalizing constant of

00:15:10.122 --> 00:15:11.619
the beta, it has to be this.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:16.390
Notice that this is a beta
ab up to a constant.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:18.460
We didn't know what the constant was yet.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:22.592
Now we know what the constant is,
because if this were the wrong constant,

00:15:22.592 --> 00:15:25.032
then this would not be
a valid marginal PDF.

00:15:25.032 --> 00:15:28.470
But we just proved that
this is the marginal PDF.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:33.448
If it's the marginal PDF,
it has to integrate to 1.

00:15:33.448 --> 00:15:35.797
So that's the normalizing
constant of the beta.

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:42.269
Okay, so in particular this tells us,
first of all,

00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:45.266
now we know the normalizing
constant of the beta.

00:15:50.871 --> 00:15:55.190
It didn't look like we set out to, a lot
of times in math you kind of just discover

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:57.520
something that you're not trying to do.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.870
You can't solve a problem, so
you try to solve some other problem and

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:02.685
then you can't solve it, but
you learn something else.

00:16:02.685 --> 00:16:05.676
So like that here, like We were just like,

00:16:05.676 --> 00:16:07.863
this is a pretty natural
problem with gammas.

00:16:07.863 --> 00:16:10.604
If you just try directly to find
the normalizing constant, the beta,

00:16:10.604 --> 00:16:12.889
you're faced with a very
different difficult integral.

00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:18.247
In this case, we just happen to
notice that the marginal was beta.

00:16:18.247 --> 00:16:19.973
And we got this normalizing constant for
free essentially.

00:16:23.287 --> 00:16:30.071
And we also know that T is Gamma(a+b1).

00:16:34.553 --> 00:16:40.261
And W that is Beta(a,b) and

00:16:40.261 --> 00:16:45.062
they're independent.

00:16:48.893 --> 00:16:52.912
So that's a very special
property of the gamma and beta,

00:16:52.912 --> 00:16:55.350
how they fit together in that way.

00:16:57.027 --> 00:17:01.831
Actually, there's a theorem that
essentially says, if you replace this

00:17:01.831 --> 00:17:06.650
gamma by any other distribution,
these will not be independent anymore.

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:08.609
That's hard to prove.

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:10.784
But that happens to be true.

00:17:10.784 --> 00:17:14.430
This is a very, very special
property of the gamma and the beta.

00:17:17.196 --> 00:17:22.312
Okay, so just as an example
of how you might use this,

00:17:22.312 --> 00:17:26.760
which actually relates
to the next homework.

00:17:28.872 --> 00:17:35.352
In general, so suppose we want
to find the expected value of W,

00:17:35.352 --> 00:17:41.117
where W, using the same notation,
W is Beta(a, b).

00:17:44.491 --> 00:17:45.450
There's two ways to do it.

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:49.780
One would be to use LOTUS.

00:17:54.602 --> 00:17:57.364
And, I'm not gonna write
out the LOTUS right now,

00:17:57.364 --> 00:18:00.460
because that should be automatic,
unconscious by now.

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:03.438
Hopefully, you could all write
down the LOTUS really easily and

00:18:03.438 --> 00:18:06.230
you can visualize what
would the LOTUS look like.

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:08.430
Well, it just means you're integrating,
well,

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:10.570
it's not even LOTUS,
it's just the definition.

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:13.540
But in fact,
if you wanted e of w to the 12th or

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:17.410
something, that's gonna be
just as easy just using LOTUS.

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:20.249
But just for the mean,
you'd write down the PDF times w, right?

00:18:20.249 --> 00:18:23.000
So that would just become w to the a.

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:26.170
But that still looks like a beta, right?

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:30.370
So once you're comfortable with
the pattern of the beta distribution,

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:31.820
you can just write down the answer.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.350
As long as w power, 1-w a power,
it's still gonna look the same.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:42.142
From the expected value of w to the 100th
power, it's not anymore difficult,

00:18:42.142 --> 00:18:45.760
cuz then you're just adding 100 up here,
but it still looks the same.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:51.012
So once you understand what
the beta distribution looks like,

00:18:51.012 --> 00:18:53.301
then you can do it that way.

00:18:53.301 --> 00:18:58.840
As I said, that's one way to do it,

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:05.319
I'll also just say LOTUS/definition.

00:19:05.319 --> 00:19:11.483
But there's a cooler way to do it.

00:19:11.483 --> 00:19:13.969
I drew a line here which means
that that problem was over and

00:19:13.969 --> 00:19:15.460
we're starting a new here thing.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.539
And we just have W as Beta(a, b), and

00:19:17.539 --> 00:19:20.060
we've forgotten all
the stuff above the line.

00:19:22.383 --> 00:19:25.030
But we can remember the stuff
that was above the line.

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:27.870
That's okay, right?

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:33.630
Because the expected value, that's what
I mean, a distribution has to have, if

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:37.865
it has an expected value at all, it has to
be some well- determined expected value.

00:19:37.865 --> 00:19:41.630
It's not like you do this with one
particular beta random variable and

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:44.830
you get one thing, and you do with another
one and you get another thing, right?

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:49.170
If you have a beta random variable,
there is a well-defined thing, so

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:54.690
I can choose my favorite way
to generate a beta, all right?

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:57.930
I can choose any way I want
as long as it's beta(a,b).

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:01.120
Well this right here is my favorite
way to generate a beta(a,b).

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.100
So I may as well choose that one.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:07.720
So now, even though this w
didn't necessarily have to have

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:11.850
that interpretation, we can choose
to give it that interpretation.

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.520
Because that won't affect
the expected value.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.250
So if we interpret it that way,
we have E (x / x + y).

00:20:19.999 --> 00:20:25.854
= E (x) / E (x + y), not by linearity,

00:20:25.854 --> 00:20:29.190
that's not linearity.

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:34.430
This is actually one of the most
common mistakes in probability,

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:37.720
is to write this kind of
thing without justification.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.770
So you have a homework
question about this.

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:44.150
Usually, if I write E of something over
something is E of the numerator over

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:47.480
E of the denominator, usually,
that's completely wrong.

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:58.410
So I'll just say be very careful, I'll
show you why this is true in this case.

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:00.270
I'm using the same notation as up there.

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:02.500
So I'm not gonna rewrite
all the all the notation.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:07.300
That's gamma A1, and
that's gamma B1, same notation.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.400
Usually, this will be a horrible,
horrible blunder.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.190
In this case, this is true.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:19.404
The reason that that is true is that,
so why is that true here?

00:21:19.404 --> 00:21:24.059
Why is E(x/x+y),
let's write it the other way,

00:21:24.059 --> 00:21:28.616
put the E(x+y) on the other
side of the equation.

00:21:28.616 --> 00:21:32.297
E(X) in this special problem,

00:21:32.297 --> 00:21:36.375
I'm not saying this is always true.

00:21:37.611 --> 00:21:42.557
In the special problem of gammas, and
I'll just call it the Gamma-Beta or

00:21:42.557 --> 00:21:44.058
the bank post office.

00:21:49.152 --> 00:21:52.710
Well, usually this is wrong.

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:57.300
However, we have a very important factor
which is that T was independent of W.

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.902
So we know that X / X + Y for
this particular problem

00:22:03.902 --> 00:22:07.697
is independent of X + W, X + Y, right?

00:22:07.697 --> 00:22:12.451
The fraction is independent
of the denominator,

00:22:12.451 --> 00:22:16.100
and independent of the total.

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:20.039
Therefore they're uncorrelated,
independent implies uncorrelated.

00:22:23.005 --> 00:22:27.666
Definition of uncorrelated for
two random variables X and

00:22:27.666 --> 00:22:30.360
Y is equals E of X, E of Y.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.590
So that says uncorrelated.

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:38.390
This being uncorrelated of this just
says that this times this is E of

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:44.040
this times this, but when you multiply
X over X + Y by X + Y, you get X.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.770
So it's true because they're uncorrelated.

00:22:50.338 --> 00:22:54.939
By the way, I mean,
that tells us the answer is just a/a+b.

00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:03.130
Because we already know that
the mean of the gamma a1 is a.

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:05.311
And you could use linearity
in the denominator, or

00:23:05.311 --> 00:23:07.146
use the fact that that's gamma of a+b1.

00:23:07.146 --> 00:23:12.200
Okay, so the expected value of
beta is a over a plus b, a to ab.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:17.510
Similarly, you can get the variance, or
various other functions of the beta.

00:23:21.022 --> 00:23:26.140
Okay, so those are the main
things about gamma and beta.

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:33.761
So let's go on to our next big topic,
which is order statistics.

00:23:33.761 --> 00:23:40.280
I tried thinking of a good segue
from beta to order statistics.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:43.040
But it's kind of, it's closely connected.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:47.460
But you won't see why until we get
to the end of order statistics,

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:49.370
not the beginning of order statistics.

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:52.477
The beta will come up again,
though, so don't worry.

00:23:52.477 --> 00:23:56.080
You haven't said goodbye
to the beta forever.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.760
All right, so
let me tell you what order statistics are.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.450
We've already seen some order statistics.

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:06.870
You had a difficult homework problem
about the maximum and the minimum.

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:11.294
Meant to be difficult, but
meant to make you think, right?

00:24:11.294 --> 00:24:15.207
One key insight from that is that
the covariance of the max and

00:24:15.207 --> 00:24:17.751
the min is not the covariance of x and y.

00:24:17.751 --> 00:24:22.748
You can't make the argument that one of
them's the x, and the other one's the y,

00:24:22.748 --> 00:24:23.420
and so on.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:28.554
So that was meant to get you to start
thinking about order statistics.

00:24:28.554 --> 00:24:33.620
This is gonna be the more generalization
of that kind of thing with the max and

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:34.840
the min.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:41.000
So if we have random variables,
X1 through Xn,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.804
and let's assume that they're i.i.d.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.350
And this is just the definition right now.

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:51.529
Order statistics means we
put them in order, and

00:24:51.529 --> 00:24:54.019
then those are the order statistics.

00:24:57.379 --> 00:24:58.882
Which sounds pretty simple but

00:24:58.882 --> 00:25:02.530
you really have to think carefully at
what does it actually mean to do that.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.930
That is hopefully for the homework and

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:09.590
other stuff with the maximum and
the minimum.

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:12.600
You started thinking that what is it
actually mean to think as the max x,y

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.130
as a random variable, right?

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:18.200
Anyone can take the maximum of two
numbers just take the bigger number.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.120
What's the maximum of two random
variables that surround variable and

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.005
hopefully you've thought by
now what actually that means.

00:25:24.005 --> 00:25:27.170
Well, I'll talk about the more
general version here.

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:33.186
So order of statistics are X(1),
this is just notation, X(1) less than or

00:25:33.186 --> 00:25:39.747
equal to X(2) less than or equal to blah,
blah, blah, less than or equal to X(n).

00:25:39.747 --> 00:25:43.664
So we put this is the standard notation,

00:25:43.664 --> 00:25:48.851
where you subscript them
with parentheses where this

00:25:48.851 --> 00:25:58.380
notation means that X1 is the minimum,
Right?

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:02.050
And then X2 is the second smallest,

00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:06.340
X3 is the third smallest and
so on, all the way up to Xn.

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:13.184
Let's put Xn, yeah,
all the way up to Xn is the maximum.

00:26:13.184 --> 00:26:16.540
So those are the two extreme
order statistics, the max and

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:21.630
the min, but then we have everything in
between is also of great interest, right?

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:23.857
For example, the median, right?

00:26:23.857 --> 00:26:26.250
Median is a familiar concept.

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:32.464
That's just so you don't take all these
values, take the one in the middle.

00:26:32.464 --> 00:26:37.517
So there's some ambiguity about
how to define median if n is even,

00:26:37.517 --> 00:26:42.190
which is not really relevant for
our purposes here.

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:45.901
But if n is odd and let's say you had five
numbers and you asked for the median,

00:26:45.901 --> 00:26:47.403
it's just the middle number.

00:26:47.403 --> 00:26:50.560
That would be the third one, right?

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.021
So the median is,

00:26:56.957 --> 00:27:03.160
X sub n+1/2,
that will be the middle number.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.940
If there's an even number, different
people use different conventions.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:10.571
The most common thing would be to take the
two middle numbers and then average those.

00:27:10.571 --> 00:27:14.610
But anyway, point is,
we can get the median.

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:23.290
We can get other percentiles,
let's call it a quantile and so on.

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:29.612
Quantile, just think of percentiles.

00:27:29.612 --> 00:27:33.961
You can find the one that 75% of
the observations are below that

00:27:33.961 --> 00:27:35.714
point that kind of thing.

00:27:35.714 --> 00:27:39.905
Median's right at the middle
at the 50 percentile, right?

00:27:39.905 --> 00:27:43.765
So, okay, so
those are the order statistics.

00:27:43.765 --> 00:27:48.148
And there's a huge literature on
order statistics, a huge amount of

00:27:48.148 --> 00:27:53.212
applications of order statistics in
statistics, because it's just a natural

00:27:53.212 --> 00:27:58.142
thing that a lot of times you have data
and you don't necessarily care about.

00:27:58.142 --> 00:28:02.354
The data might have come to you
independently in this particular order,

00:28:02.354 --> 00:28:04.229
but you may not care about that.

00:28:04.229 --> 00:28:06.845
I mean, and
often you want to rank things, right?

00:28:06.845 --> 00:28:10.790
And look at the largest, the smallest,
the middle value, things like that.

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:13.576
Interquartile range is a famous
concept in statistics.

00:28:13.576 --> 00:28:17.757
That just means take the 75th
percentile minus the 25th percentile.

00:28:17.757 --> 00:28:19.070
Things like that.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:22.790
All kinds of statistical quantities are
defined in terms of order statistics, so

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:25.080
we wanna be able to say something
about their distribution.

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.414
That's actually a pretty hard problem,
though.

00:28:30.414 --> 00:28:34.506
The main reason that they're
difficult to work with,

00:28:38.922 --> 00:28:42.470
Since they are dependent.

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:49.285
Even though that's the one key insight
about order statistics in fact,

00:28:49.285 --> 00:28:53.428
they're gonna be positively correlated.

00:28:53.428 --> 00:29:00.870
Even though we started with i.i.d.,
there still dependent.

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:01.610
Why?
Well,

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:06.030
it's like you saw in the homework, the
maximum is always bigger then the minimum.

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:07.980
So if you know that
the minimum is really big,

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.580
that forces the maximum to be even bigger.

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:15.092
And that same argument extends to any,
if I tell you X the third-order statistic,

00:29:15.092 --> 00:29:18.457
well the seventh-order statistic
is even bigger than that.

00:29:18.457 --> 00:29:20.610
So they give you information
about each other.

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:24.152
So we have to be very careful
about that dependence.

00:29:24.152 --> 00:29:27.331
And also they're tricky
in the discreet case, so

00:29:27.331 --> 00:29:31.120
we're mostly gonna assume
the continuous case.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:36.950
Discreet case we have to worry about ties,
that is two random

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:41.280
variables being exactly equal, that's
a serious issue in the discrete case.

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:45.920
In the continuous case which we're
gonna talk about for the rest of today.

00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:51.210
Then we don't have to worry about that
issue cuz the probability is zero that

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:55.350
two continuous random variables will
be exactly equal to infinitely many

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:56.170
decimal places.

00:29:57.450 --> 00:29:59.970
Okay, so
now let's assume that they're continuous.

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:05.591
And let's derive the distribution
of one of the order statistics.

00:30:09.308 --> 00:30:15.973
So let's let X1 through Xn be i.i.d.,

00:30:15.973 --> 00:30:20.974
continuous let's say they have

00:30:20.974 --> 00:30:25.986
a PDF little f and CDF capital F.

00:30:29.443 --> 00:30:33.961
And we wanna find the CDF and
the PDF of the kth order statistic

00:30:39.486 --> 00:30:45.939
CDF and PDF, Of X(j)

00:30:45.939 --> 00:30:50.250
with parenthesis, okay?

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:53.480
So just for getting the maximum and
the minimum is not too difficult.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:56.900
And you've already done similar
sorts of problems before.

00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:00.780
Like if you want, if you say that
the maximum is less than some number,

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:04.670
say ten that's the same thing as saying
that they are all less than ten and

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:05.760
then use independence.

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:11.990
But we wanna get all and
any of them, right, any extra.

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:14.501
This is gonna be the marginal, right now.

00:31:14.501 --> 00:31:19.080
So another, since they're dependent,
we would also like to know

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:23.848
the joint distributions, but
let's focus on the marginal for now.

00:31:23.848 --> 00:31:25.680
All right, so let's do the CDF.

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:31.900
So we wanna know what's the probability
that X( j )is less than or

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.620
equal to some number X,
i t's the definition of CDF.

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:38.256
And I find, for
working with order statistics,

00:31:38.256 --> 00:31:40.129
it really helps to draw a picture.

00:31:42.341 --> 00:31:47.447
So we just have a number line,
we have some number X, and

00:31:47.447 --> 00:31:52.571
let's just interpret this
event in terms of a picture.

00:31:52.571 --> 00:31:56.010
This says that the jth order
statistic is to the left.

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:57.990
Maybe it's over here somewhere.

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:04.040
Of course the other order statistics
like X( j )- 1 are even smaller.

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:07.940
Maybe X(1) is over here, right?

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:13.570
So the first j order statistics
All have to be to the left.

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:17.080
Now it could be that xj
plus 1 is over here, and

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:21.944
it could be that it's over there,
we didn't specify, right?

00:32:21.944 --> 00:32:24.638
So I'll say here that there may be more.

00:32:26.917 --> 00:32:31.095
We could draw two pictures, one where
actually xj plus one, and xj plus two, and

00:32:31.095 --> 00:32:32.581
xj plus three are over here.

00:32:32.581 --> 00:32:36.620
And finally, xj plus four crosses over x.

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:40.851
Or we could draw another picture where xj
plus one is already to the right of x.

00:32:40.851 --> 00:32:43.448
Either way, this event has occurred.

00:32:43.448 --> 00:32:47.005
So in words,
Just by looking at pictures like this and

00:32:47.005 --> 00:32:49.148
then interpreting it in words.

00:32:49.148 --> 00:32:52.655
Notice that the saying the jth order
statistic is less than or equal to x,

00:32:52.655 --> 00:32:55.085
is exactly the same thing
as saying that at least,

00:32:58.295 --> 00:33:04.074
j of the let's say Xi's are less than or

00:33:04.074 --> 00:33:07.060
equal to x, right?

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:11.805
Cuz we need to have j of them to the left,
maybe more than j, that's okay,

00:33:11.805 --> 00:33:13.351
right, but at least j.

00:33:13.351 --> 00:33:16.189
So that's exactly the same event.

00:33:16.189 --> 00:33:19.594
Now we can actually just write
down a formula directly.

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:26.652
If there's at least j of them,
let's actually specify it more and

00:33:26.652 --> 00:33:28.356
say how many are there?

00:33:28.356 --> 00:33:31.816
Well let's suppose there are k of them,
so k goes from j to n.

00:33:34.534 --> 00:33:37.640
So I'm just gonna break this
up into disjoint cases.

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:40.340
Where the cases are counting how

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:44.842
many of these X's are to
the left of little x, right?

00:33:44.842 --> 00:33:47.599
Just breaking it up into cases.

00:33:47.599 --> 00:33:51.617
Okay, so assume there are exactly k.

00:33:51.617 --> 00:33:52.918
What's the probability of that happening?

00:34:03.623 --> 00:34:05.162
Let's say it a different way.

00:34:05.162 --> 00:34:07.435
What's the distribution?

00:34:07.435 --> 00:34:11.331
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; It's a binomial distribution.

00:34:11.331 --> 00:34:12.953
How are you defining your success?

00:34:12.953 --> 00:34:18.215
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Success means to the left of X,

00:34:18.215 --> 00:34:21.113
failure means to the right of X.

00:34:21.113 --> 00:34:25.843
So this says, this is at least
j successes where we're gonna

00:34:25.843 --> 00:34:30.226
sum that up over exactly k successes,
k goes from j to n.

00:34:30.226 --> 00:34:32.256
So it's just a binomial.

00:34:32.256 --> 00:34:36.876
n choose k, the probability
of success is the probability

00:34:36.876 --> 00:34:41.793
of being to the left of X,
by definition that's just the CDF.

00:34:41.793 --> 00:34:45.722
So this is F(x) to the k (1- F(x)),

00:34:45.722 --> 00:34:50.430
that's the probability of failure,
to the n- k.

00:34:56.345 --> 00:34:58.440
So that's the CDF.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.655
Now of course, once we have the CDF,

00:35:00.655 --> 00:35:03.732
we can get the PDF by taking
the derivative of this.

00:35:03.732 --> 00:35:09.344
But that's gonna be this big ugly sum and
I'm too lazy to try to simplify that sum.

00:35:09.344 --> 00:35:12.907
So let's do the PDF a different way.

00:35:15.662 --> 00:35:18.428
You get the same answer.

00:35:18.428 --> 00:35:22.571
It just takes some work
to deal with that sum.

00:35:22.571 --> 00:35:25.816
So I'd rather think more directly.

00:35:25.816 --> 00:35:27.810
All right, so here's the PDF.

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:30.855
How do we get the PDF?

00:35:30.855 --> 00:35:33.788
Well I'm just gonna draw a picture and
think about what it means.

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:38.863
So, all right, here's the picture.

00:35:38.863 --> 00:35:45.391
PDF of xj, let's call it fx(j) PDF (x) =,

00:35:45.391 --> 00:35:50.779
and let's just write down the answer,

00:35:50.779 --> 00:35:55.200
cuz that's a nicer way to do it.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.846
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So, here's x.

00:35:58.846 --> 00:36:00.954
We want the PDF at x.

00:36:02.578 --> 00:36:07.962
Now, we have to be a little bit careful
that, Density is not probability,

00:36:07.962 --> 00:36:10.748
like the density could be
greater than one and all that.

00:36:10.748 --> 00:36:14.622
But we talked about the fact
before that if you take a PDF and

00:36:14.622 --> 00:36:18.814
multiply it by some tiny increment,
then that's essentially

00:36:18.814 --> 00:36:24.054
the probability that the random variable
is in a tiny interval of that length.

00:36:24.054 --> 00:36:28.060
That is, imagine this tiny,
I'm drawing the interval big enough so

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:29.245
that you can see it.

00:36:29.245 --> 00:36:35.738
But imagine this is a tiny,
tiny interval of length dx.

00:36:35.738 --> 00:36:39.510
So it's infinitesimally small, okay?

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:41.971
And so
we're actually gonna look at F(x) dx.

00:36:41.971 --> 00:36:45.525
As we're just multiplying by
the width of that interval and

00:36:45.525 --> 00:36:47.595
then we're letting it go to zero.

00:36:47.595 --> 00:36:51.865
We're letting it taking
a limit essentially.

00:36:51.865 --> 00:36:56.664
Now we can interpret this as saying
the probability that the j order

00:36:56.664 --> 00:36:59.845
statistic is in this tiny interval, okay?

00:36:59.845 --> 00:37:03.410
Now let's just think about
how could that happen.

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:08.481
Well, first of all it
means that one of these

00:37:08.481 --> 00:37:12.709
observations must lie
in this tiny interval.

00:37:12.709 --> 00:37:18.146
So we'll take n there're n choice for
which one?

00:37:18.146 --> 00:37:21.772
That is this could've been,
one of them has to be here, right?

00:37:23.486 --> 00:37:26.003
Good chance to use the pink chalk again.

00:37:26.003 --> 00:37:30.480
One of them has to be like right here,
somewhere in this tiny little interval.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.076
There're n choices for
which one goes there.

00:37:33.076 --> 00:37:40.122
Now assume that that, and that has
probability f(x)dx of actually happening.

00:37:42.593 --> 00:37:45.955
Okay, then let's look at the rest.

00:37:45.955 --> 00:37:48.556
There're n- 1 observations left.

00:37:48.556 --> 00:37:51.882
This is supposed to be
the jth order statistic.

00:37:51.882 --> 00:37:58.940
So that means there must be j- 1 of them,
To the left.

00:38:00.885 --> 00:38:01.460
Right?

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:04.980
j- 1 of them are anywhere to the left
of this tiny, tiny interval.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:09.580
One of them is in this interval and
then the rest of them are to the right.

00:38:13.822 --> 00:38:15.868
So that's n- j of them.

00:38:17.493 --> 00:38:20.836
Now we chose one of them
that went right there,

00:38:20.836 --> 00:38:24.025
we need to choose which
ones are to the left.

00:38:24.025 --> 00:38:28.534
So, there're n- 1 left to choose from and
we can choose any j- 1 of them.

00:38:30.839 --> 00:38:35.718
Then we just need to know well what's
the probability that those specific j,

00:38:35.718 --> 00:38:40.915
now you can imagine that we chose specific
set of j minus 1 of these observations.

00:38:40.915 --> 00:38:42.690
They all need to go to the left.

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:49.294
So just F(x), that's the probably
of being to the left of

00:38:49.294 --> 00:38:52.496
X to the j- 1 times (1- F(x)),

00:38:56.428 --> 00:39:00.120
To the n- j, because this n
minus j need to be to the right.

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:05.549
So just to simplify this a little bit,

00:39:05.549 --> 00:39:10.782
the PDF is n(n- 1, choose j- 1) F(x).

00:39:10.782 --> 00:39:14.607
It's kind of a neat looking formula,
because it involves both the CDF and

00:39:14.607 --> 00:39:15.111
the PDF.

00:39:18.356 --> 00:39:22.611
So the CDF to a power,
1 minus the CDF to a power, and the PDF.

00:39:25.698 --> 00:39:30.474
So you can also take the derivative
of this and you'll still have a sum,

00:39:30.474 --> 00:39:35.344
but if you do some algebra on the sum
it'll simplify to this eventually.

00:39:35.344 --> 00:39:43.083
Okay, so that is the marginal PDF.

00:39:43.083 --> 00:39:48.025
I was tempted to put on on the homework
a similar problem with the joint PDF

00:39:48.025 --> 00:39:49.817
of two order statistics.

00:39:49.817 --> 00:39:53.585
I didn't put it on the homework but
I still think it's good practice.

00:39:56.015 --> 00:39:57.797
Maybe I'll put it on
the strategic practice.

00:39:57.797 --> 00:40:00.818
I haven't posted the next
strategic practice yet, but

00:40:00.818 --> 00:40:02.625
I'll do that sometime tonight.

00:40:02.625 --> 00:40:04.613
Maybe I'll put this on it, maybe I won't.

00:40:04.613 --> 00:40:09.359
But what I'm trying to say is what
if you wanted the joint PDF of

00:40:09.359 --> 00:40:15.230
like the third order statistic and
the seventh order statistic?

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:20.382
You could draw a picture Like this except
that then you have to say you kind of

00:40:20.382 --> 00:40:25.194
have two of these infinitesimal intervals
and you do an analogous argument.

00:40:25.194 --> 00:40:27.934
You can get joint PDF that way,

00:40:27.934 --> 00:40:32.900
there's other ways to do
the joint distributions too.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:37.657
In stat 110, we're mainly concerned with
the marginal ones as long as you keep in

00:40:37.657 --> 00:40:39.405
mind that they are dependent.

00:40:39.405 --> 00:40:41.870
Okay, so let's do a quick example.

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:48.878
The easiest example to think about, but
it's also a very useful example just to

00:40:48.878 --> 00:40:51.655
have in mind is the uniform
order of statistics.

00:40:51.655 --> 00:40:56.643
So, let's select U1 through Un

00:40:56.643 --> 00:41:01.819
the iid uniform between 0 and 1,

00:41:03.653 --> 00:41:07.401
And we wanna find the distribution
of the J order statistic.

00:41:10.445 --> 00:41:17.400
So F sub u, j of x.

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:20.787
The PDF of the j order statistic.

00:41:20.787 --> 00:41:27.472
I'm just gonna apply this result.

00:41:27.472 --> 00:41:34.368
So, okay, well,
that just says n times n- 1 choose j- 1.

00:41:34.368 --> 00:41:38.150
F(x), remember that the CDF for

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:42.940
the uniform just increases linearly,
cuz the PDF is a constant.

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:50.411
So that's just x to the j- 1,
1- x to the n- j.

00:41:50.411 --> 00:41:55.703
And the PDF is just one,
at least this is for x between 0 and

00:41:55.703 --> 00:42:03.160
1, 0 otherwise, Well,
that should look kind of familiar, right?

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.104
x to the power, 1 minus x to a power.

00:42:05.104 --> 00:42:08.944
I don't even care about, the constant
is just whatever it has to be,

00:42:08.944 --> 00:42:10.480
to make it integrate to 1.

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:15.573
And you can check that this is consistent
with the constant we derived earlier,

00:42:15.573 --> 00:42:18.549
but the key part of this is this,
it's a beta.

00:42:18.549 --> 00:42:24.345
So we know that u sub parenthesis j,

00:42:24.345 --> 00:42:31.504
the jth order statistic
is beta j n- j + 1.

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:37.848
Which relates back to something
we did a while ago with

00:42:37.848 --> 00:42:41.776
the expected difference
between two uniforms.

00:42:41.776 --> 00:42:45.556
So we did this calculation
when we were doing 2D Lotus.

00:42:45.556 --> 00:42:52.020
The expected value of u1- u2, right,
and I drew this little picture here.

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:56.433
And I said, okay, one of them could
be there, one of them could be there.

00:42:56.433 --> 00:43:03.299
One-third, two-thirds, so on average,
the difference would be one-third.

00:43:03.299 --> 00:43:05.280
So, okay, so what was I really doing?

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.270
Well, another way to say this
is that the expected value.

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:10.980
The absolute difference
is the max minus the min,

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:12.860
as you were thinking
about on the homework.

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:19.223
So that's the expected max of u1,
u2- the expected min of u1,

00:43:19.223 --> 00:43:26.279
u2, but according to this the maximum
is distributed as beta of 2,1.

00:43:26.279 --> 00:43:29.552
And the minimum is
distributed as beta of 1, 2.

00:43:31.703 --> 00:43:37.436
So this has mean two-thirds, and
this has mean one-third equals one-third.

00:43:37.436 --> 00:43:41.279
So that just confirms
the earlier result that,

00:43:41.279 --> 00:43:46.179
instead of having to do with
a 2D LOTUS and things like that,

00:43:46.179 --> 00:43:51.080
we just say, we recognize this
as a difference of two betas,

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:56.972
the max is not independent of the minimum,
but linearity always holds.

00:43:59.123 --> 00:44:01.135
So that's nice.

00:44:01.135 --> 00:44:03.804
All right, one last thing,
just to give you something

00:44:03.804 --> 00:44:07.470
to think about over the weekend,
if you don't have enough to think about.

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.735
So our next big topic is
conditional expectation.

00:44:16.321 --> 00:44:20.914
In a sense, you already know what
conditional expectation is if you

00:44:20.914 --> 00:44:26.486
understand conditional probability,
because it just means take expectation,

00:44:28.714 --> 00:44:32.961
Using conditional distribution
rather than using the distribution.

00:44:32.961 --> 00:44:37.862
So for example,
we're gonna use this notation,

00:44:37.862 --> 00:44:41.137
E(x|A), where A is an event.

00:44:41.137 --> 00:44:44.750
On Monday I will talk more
about what this means.

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:48.000
But I claim that this is something that
should already understand, cuz it just

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.640
says use the conditional distribution,
given A, right, so it's basically saying

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:55.880
we're already familiar with, but I will go
into a lot of detail about its properties.

00:44:55.880 --> 00:45:01.050
For example,
we can say that E(x) = E(x|A)P(A),

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:07.594
where A is any event,
+ E(x|A complement) given P(A complement),

00:45:07.594 --> 00:45:12.872
which looks completely like
the law of total probability,

00:45:12.872 --> 00:45:18.381
except they were using expectation
instead of probability.

00:45:18.381 --> 00:45:23.905
And in the discrete case, just to quickly
see how would you prove something

00:45:23.905 --> 00:45:29.516
like this, in the discrete case,
we'd have the expected value is the sum of

00:45:29.516 --> 00:45:35.501
values times their probabilities, all we
would have to do is expand this using,

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:41.555
The law of total probability.

00:45:41.555 --> 00:45:45.476
That is,
we would break this up into two terms, and

00:45:45.476 --> 00:45:49.410
then just break it into two sums and
you get to this.

00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:53.750
So this is a pretty intuitive formula I
think, we'll go into more detail about it.

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:57.459
It's just the expectation version
of the log total probability.

00:45:57.459 --> 00:46:01.473
All right so one quick little puzzle for
you to think about, and

00:46:01.473 --> 00:46:03.840
is called the Two Envelope Paradox.

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:09.568
I think this paradox
is much more deserving

00:46:09.568 --> 00:46:13.364
of the name Paradox than like, Monty Hall.

00:46:13.364 --> 00:46:17.341
Luckily, people don't usually say
the Monty Hall Paradox, but if they did,

00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:20.240
this one is more deserving
of the name Paradox.

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.720
Here's the problem.

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:24.675
I'll just tell you the problem quickly,
we wont' try to solve it today since

00:46:24.675 --> 00:46:26.871
there's not time, but
anyway it's fun to think about.

00:46:30.801 --> 00:46:32.990
You're given two envelopes.

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:37.120
Each envelope contains a check for
some amount of money.

00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:41.746
You're given that one envelope
contains exactly twice as much

00:46:41.746 --> 00:46:43.499
money as the other one.

00:46:48.603 --> 00:46:52.120
Twice as much money as the other,
but it's symmetrical.

00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:56.107
The envelopes look the same,
you can't judge the thickness or anything.

00:46:56.107 --> 00:46:59.580
They look completely identical to you,
it's symmetric.

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:03.302
All that you know is that one of them
has double of the other one, okay.

00:47:03.302 --> 00:47:07.038
They both have some positive
amounts of money, okay.

00:47:07.038 --> 00:47:09.110
So you get to pick one.

00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:13.428
Well, so far there's not, pick either
one you want, it's symmetrical.

00:47:13.428 --> 00:47:16.530
Let's just say you pick that one, okay.

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:19.610
Now, first assume you get to, there
are variations where you get to open it,

00:47:19.610 --> 00:47:20.575
variations where you don't.

00:47:20.575 --> 00:47:25.250
First assume you get to open it,
let's assume there's $100 there.

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:28.820
Then you're given the question like
in Monty Hall, do you wanna switch?

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:32.521
So you might reason, while the other one,
you know this ones 100 now.

00:47:32.521 --> 00:47:36.344
The other one, it could be 50,
it could be 200.

00:47:38.781 --> 00:47:42.075
Seemingly, those are equally likely.

00:47:42.075 --> 00:47:46.855
So if your average 50 and 200, you get
$125, which means you should switch.

00:47:48.235 --> 00:47:51.161
Now, that argument did not depend
on this being a $100, though.

00:47:51.161 --> 00:47:55.972
So let's just call this one x,
the other one is either half x or 2x.

00:47:55.972 --> 00:47:59.752
The average of half x and 2x is greater
than x, so you should switch, but

00:47:59.752 --> 00:48:02.532
in that case,
why bother even opening the envelope.

00:48:02.532 --> 00:48:06.888
That's gonna be some value x, the other
one, on average, is greater than x,

00:48:06.888 --> 00:48:08.736
so you should switch to that one.

00:48:08.736 --> 00:48:10.316
But then you should switch back, right?

00:48:10.316 --> 00:48:13.732
And then you switch forever and
that's not good, all right.

00:48:13.732 --> 00:48:14.762
So have a good weekend.
