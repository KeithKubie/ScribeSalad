00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.560
LOUIS GRAY: Welcome back to
Google Developers Live.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.860
Louis Gray here from Mountain
View Google headquarters here

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.790
in California with my good
friend, Brian Fitzpatrick,

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.750
who's come down from Chicago
for the third in a set of

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.330
three shows that we're calling,
"Fitz Week." Today--

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.390
you laugh.

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.020
I like Fitz Week.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.830
Today we're talking about
something that's actually near

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.480
and dear to all of our users
and everyone who wants to

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.580
understand what's happening
in the world of data.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.010
We're talking about the
Transparency Report.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.530
So let's just start from the
very beginning, Fitz, and talk

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.076
about the Google Transparency
Report, which anybody can find

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:11.370
at
google.com/transparencyreport.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.370
What is this all about?

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.620
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So the
Transparency Report

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.945
started as a way to--

00:06:16.945 --> 00:06:19.080
you know, it's called
Transparency Report, but it's

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.000
almost like an accountability
report.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.780
The original goal of it is to
show how powerful entities are

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.400
affecting the free flow of
information on the internet.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.730
And it has continued
to expand to cover

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:31.780
more interesting things.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.040
And initially it was just
governments, and now it's

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.980
starting to show how things
like a civil request like

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.230
copyright takedowns are
affecting the free flow of

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.950
information, as well as things
like malware and

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.070
that kind of thing.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.000
LOUIS GRAY: And you mentioned
copyright takedowns.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.190
The traffic report, I think,
is the one that's the most

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.010
visible in terms of possibly
services being impacted.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.910
What are the specific pieces
within the Transparency Report

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.680
that are displayed?

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.770
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So starting
with traffic, which is very,

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:02.930
as you say, is the
most visible.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.090
It's interesting, because
you get these graphs.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:10.490
And what they are basically is
graphs of traffic in near-real

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:16.500
time, only a two minute delay
of traffic from our products

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.050
to various countries around the
world, over 100 countries.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.320
So there's an aggregate
all-products traffic which

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.220
shows basically all the traffic
we're seeing from any

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.620
given country.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.740
And then there's-- we
divide up by several

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.030
of our bigger products--

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.950
YouTube, Blogger, Google Search,
that sort of thing.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:36.790
And if you look at one of these
graphs, let's say for

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.970
the past couple weeks, it looks
a little bit like a

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:41.475
heart rate monitor,
like an EKG.

00:07:41.475 --> 00:07:45.110
There's this sort of bump,
a peak where peak

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:46.050
traffic for the day.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.070
And then it goes down, and
there's a smaller peak.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.220
And then there's a trough at
night when people are--

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.940
late at night, or early in the
morning when people are

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.260
sleeping in that country.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.410
And so that's a normal
pattern you see.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.390
We call it the heartbeat.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:02.230
And there are cases where
internet service is

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:05.070
interrupted, and that's
when it goes flat.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:07.930
And we initially watched this
to show when countries were

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.740
cutting access to
Google products.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.670
The popular thing was some
countries cut off access to

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.845
Blogger, because people were
saying things on blogs they

00:08:16.845 --> 00:08:17.380
didn't like.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.710
Other countries were cutting
access to YouTube, because

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:21.560
they didn't like some
of the things

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.760
that YouTube was showing.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.340
And it wasn't until the Arab
Spring happened in Egypt that

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.550
a country completely cut
off the internet.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:35.360
And suddenly, we realized that
we were showing, basically,

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.010
internet traffic to a country.

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:40.460
And so we became a
reporter on that.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.880
And at the time when that
happened, initially we were

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.200
delaying our graphs 35 hours,
because it takes us about that

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.850
long to verify and make
sure that all

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.430
of our data is correct.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:53.540
We actually did a lot of work,
our team did a lot of work to

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.740
get that down to under
two minutes now.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.390
So we're sort of part
of the story.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:03.950
So when somebody cuts their
internet traffic, we show it

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:05.840
rather quickly, in under
a couple of minutes.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.940
LOUIS GRAY: And the Transparency
Report shows not

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.800
just government interruptions,
but you mentioned like network

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.530
interruptions via a cut cable
somewhere, a data center

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.673
that's been hit by a meteor,
multiple data centers that

00:09:16.673 --> 00:09:19.750
were hit by meteors, or other
things that impact the uptime

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:20.550
of our own products.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.350
And that's also displayed
there.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:22.750
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:27.100
I mean, so the point around this
is that this tends to be,

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.030
when the internet's cut off,
an extra-legal event.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.170
So it's done outside
of typical law.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:34.920
It's sort of if somebody pulls
the plug on the internet.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.450
Like the way Egypt worked is
they literally shut down the

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:40.230
breakers in the Ramses
international telephone

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.100
exchange in Cairo.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.880
But there are other-- cable
cut is an example.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.260
We saw 50% decrease in traffic
to Armenia, I believe it was,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.850
on a Sunday for five hours.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:52.670
And then it came back
just like normal.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:53.910
And there was no unrest.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:54.930
There was nothing
weird happening.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.680
We were completely confused
until the next day.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:03.490
We saw that there was
a woman had been

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.270
stealing copper cables.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.240
And she cut through a fiber
cable and looked at it and

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.380
said, oh, this isn't copper,
and then walked away.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.180
There's actually a picture of
this woman holding a saw.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.450
It's pretty amazing.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.980
But what that means is that,
despite the fact that the

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.500
internet routes around failures,
you've only got one

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.430
or two ingress or egress points
for your internet

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:22.280
connection.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.780
That's a bad thing, basically.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.275
LOUIS GRAY: You know, you
mentioned Arab Spring.

00:10:26.275 --> 00:10:28.680
You know, this is in,
I think, 2011.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.660
There's a big explosion of
activity in that area.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.850
And one of the weapons that
the government had was to

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:39.130
discontinue the information
coming in and the

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:40.760
communication going out.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.310
And I think it's really
remarkable to think about

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:44.480
being part of that story.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.250
Not just covering it, but
actually legitimately having

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:51.330
information being used as a
weapon by a government against

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.710
or for its own people.

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.610
And so, as you start to take
a look at that Transparency

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:59.390
Report, it almost becomes a
living history on its own.

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:03.810
You see specific countries
that have taken action--

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.190
be it China, be it Egypt,
be it Syria--

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:09.420
and it starts to really tell
a very interesting story.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:13.100
At what point did it become, for
your team, something that

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.110
evolved from just an
informational perspective to

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:19.280
recognizing it's like a living
history that we can publish?

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.860
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: I think it
was after the Arab Spring hit

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:22.630
that we realized--

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.000
because when we switched from a
35-hour delay to two minute

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.060
delay, we were no longer
reporting in the news.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.580
We were participating in the
event, which is a really

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.580
interesting place to be.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.240
But then, as we started to see
these piling up, we thought,

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.300
hey, we need a better way to
show this, which led to what

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.970
we call our disruption view.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:41.010
So you can sort of see
disruptions that are ongoing,

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:42.940
disruptions that happened
last year, or the

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:44.010
year before, et cetera.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.830
It gives you a feel for
where outages are

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:47.760
happening around the world.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.390
LOUIS GRAY: Well, we talked a
little bit about the what, but

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.730
I want to go back to the why.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.290
Like, why is this
thing even here?

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:57.450
There's really no legal guidance
telling Google that

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:58.520
we have to show this
information.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.100
Is that right?

00:11:59.100 --> 00:11:59.440
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: No.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.690
LOUIS GRAY: So we
don't have to.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:04.060
So why are we doing this
in the first place?

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.960
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, it
comes back to its in our

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.920
business interest to show when
access to our products are

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.980
restricted, because if people
can't get to Google products,

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.570
we can't not only service
people, but

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:14.280
we don't make money.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.800
LOUIS GRAY: Are we turning the
tables around a little bit,

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.250
saying, hey, it's not
our fault that you

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:18.804
can't get to this.

00:12:18.804 --> 00:12:20.310
It's your government's fault.

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:22.050
Or is this just something where
we need to have people

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:25.260
understand why they can't get
something, or why we want

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.430
other people to understand
why a specific

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:28.380
country can't get something.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.070
Is it kind of a comment
on the world view?

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:31.930
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, It's
not about really comprehension

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:33.050
and understanding.

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:35.740
We leave that to the press
to describe what's

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:36.850
going on and why.

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:40.130
It's more about, hey, this is a
simple, factual change that

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:42.720
we've seen, and this is
what's happening.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.090
I can't reach-- for example,
Pakistan shut off YouTube last

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.360
year, and it's an
ongoing outage.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.070
And so--

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:50.440
LOUIS GRAY: You're saying
Pakistan can't be watching

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.210
this right now.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:51.500
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.710
There's probably--

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:54.250
LOUIS GRAY: Maybe if they get
that resolved, then in a

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:55.410
couple years, they'll
watch this and

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:56.360
understand why it happened.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.440
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Exactly.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.180
So there's that.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.560
And it's important, I think,
for people to know

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:04.380
what's going on.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:07.560
That's, I think, the core issue
around transparency, is

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.990
showing people what's
going on.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:11.566
And then either research their
own conclusions, draw their

00:13:11.566 --> 00:13:14.090
own conclusions, or in the case
of the press, reporters

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:17.110
writing up articles using other
sources to verify what's

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:19.295
going on and showing more
information about the context

00:13:19.295 --> 00:13:20.550
of the outage.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:21.920
LOUIS GRAY: And I think you and
I have talked about this

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.130
before, the transparency,
we call it a core

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:25.430
value here at Google.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:27.080
It's part of who we are.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.380
And sometimes I get pushback
from people

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.770
don't believe that.

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:32.970
You know, hey, you guys are just
in it for the money or

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:34.120
for the data.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.470
So why should users believe that
transparency is part of

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:37.990
what we do?

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:40.210
Isn't it like a used car
salesman saying, trust me,

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:41.680
this is the best deal.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.790
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, I'm
kind of a believer in trust,

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.450
but verify.

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:50.430
I think the real issue is that
it's not-- again, transparency

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.600
is almost a little bit
of a misnomer.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.720
It's about accountability.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.460
It's about showing this is the
information that we have.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.220
Only we have all the information
about access to

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.210
our products.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.370
So I think it's in our benefit
to show what's going on,

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:07.170
because it makes it more obvious
when something happens

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:08.740
and this changes.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.995
LOUIS GRAY: You gave a couple
of examples of products that

00:14:10.995 --> 00:14:11.320
are impacted.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.880
You started with Blogger.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.340
You mentioned YouTube as
being two specific

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.040
services that are impacted.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.830
Are there other services which
are popular blocks?

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:24.450
Are there things that
Google sees most

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:25.770
likely to be taken down?

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.940
And why is it that those
specific ones are targeted

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:32.590
versus something like Google
Search or Gmail?

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:35.380
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well,
I think that

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:36.810
they're publishing platforms.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:37.380
I think that's why.

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:38.670
I think that's why YouTube
and Blogger are

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:39.730
probably the biggest.

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:42.360
In some places, photos
are blocked as well.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.740
But it's platforms that people
can use to publish.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:47.170
And if you're in a country
that doesn't have a free

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:50.070
press, or you have a press
that's very much

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.960
government-controlled, then you
don't want this sort of

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.170
free distribution platform
out there.

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:58.810
And I think it's perceived as
a danger by a lot of people.

00:14:58.810 --> 00:14:59.310
LOUIS GRAY: Sure.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:02.650
And now, moving a little bit
away from the traffic report,

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:05.220
we do have a lot of transparency
in terms of

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.340
governments that are getting
in the way of our services.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.340
There's also a lot of requests
that come from

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.200
governments on user data.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:11.660
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Correct.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.440
LOUIS GRAY: Can you take me
through that and help us

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.070
understand what it is that
we can share via the

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:16.890
Transparency Report?

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:18.780
Obviously, it's been
very hot recently.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:19.120
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.430
So there's data that
we can share.

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:24.100
So we get court orders.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.620
We get warrants for information,
typically for

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.030
criminal cases.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.290
Someone's done something bad.

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:32.370
The government's looking for
evidence in a case against

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:34.350
them, and they send
us a request.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.330
And there's a process that
it goes through.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.450
Someone doesn't just call us up
and say, hey, send us all

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:40.130
the data on Louis Gray.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:41.730
And if they do that,
we say come back

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:43.060
with a warrant, basically.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:45.260
They come back with a warrant,
and they say, send us, you

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.280
know, everyone in the world
who's searched for this thing.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.410
We would say, well, that's
overly broad.

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:51.630
Can you be more specific?

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:53.390
And then they rewrite the
warrant to say, we just want

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:54.780
information on Louis Gray.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.675
Typically, it's something like
subscriber information.

00:15:56.675 --> 00:15:59.420
They're going to want your name,
your address, and IP

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.310
addresses you've
logged in from.

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:07.510
And again, we're interested in
helping with criminal cases.

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:10.120
We want to help catch
the bad guys.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.710
We just want to make sure that
the requests are legal, that

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:17.340
they're not overly broad, and
that we are actually helping

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.160
catch the bad guys and
not just giving a

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.730
bunch of data away.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.620
LOUIS GRAY: And there's a lot
of requests that we actually

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:23.550
can't talk about.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.200
I think that those have flared
up in the press of late, and

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.620
some things have
been disclosed.

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.840
To the best of our ability, what
are we doing about that?

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:34.480
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, with
NSL, National Security

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.620
Letters, is a good one.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.000
If you look at the government
request site, you'll see that

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.860
we talked about-- we received
so many requests from a

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:48.230
government for information that
affected this many users,

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:51.050
and we complied with this
percentage of the request, in

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.670
full or part.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:56.330
And there's some things like
the NSLs, National Security

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.540
Letters, that up until May, we
couldn't even acknowledged we

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.510
got, because they came
with a gag order.

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:03.620
And that was a legal requirement
that we couldn't

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.180
acknowledge that we
got these things.

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.079
And we went back and forth with
the government to say,

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:10.619
hey, we think it's important
to publicly

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:12.140
state that we got these.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.210
LOUIS GRAY: And you're speaking
specifically about

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:14.109
the US government.

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:15.140
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: US
government, right, because

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.829
we're a US company.

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:19.470
So these national security
letters, we finally got the

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:22.450
ability to talk about the
fact that we get them in

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:24.230
magnitudes of 1,000.

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:26.780
So last year, we had
1,000 of these

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:27.790
National Security Letters.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.490
They affected, I think it
was 0 to 1,000 users.

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:33.675
So we get 0 to 1,000 letters
affecting 0 to 1,000 or 1,000

00:17:33.675 --> 00:17:36.070
or 2,000 or something
like that.

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:39.920
And so people say, we
want more specifics.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:44.690
And again, we don't want to
endanger any ongoing criminal

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:48.300
investigations, but
it would be great

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.350
to have more specifics.

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.260
But I think that the fact that
we can admit we got these at

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.570
all is a huge step forward.

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:55.020
And I'm really happy
about that.

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.860
Now the thing that's
come this summer is

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.780
the FISA court, right?

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:04.800
And we have filed, I believe, a
suit against the FISA court

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.370
to be able to disclose this
information, if, in fact,

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:11.660
we've gotten any requests
from this court.

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.529
We can't acknowledge
if we have or if we

00:18:13.529 --> 00:18:14.370
haven't at this point.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:15.040
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.720
And that's something, obviously,
you kind of have to

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.790
wait and see.

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:20.420
The courts aren't the fastest
things in the world by

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:20.960
definition.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.290
I think when you talk about
this, we are fighting for this

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:26.870
with the expectation that we
can deliver information for

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:29.830
our users so they better
understand that when they use

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:32.400
our services that their data
is in a safe place and that

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.860
we're not going to do anything
with malfeasance.

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.130
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: The other
thing that we're interested in

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:42.620
is that this information shows
government requests for user's

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.990
data, a lot of this, in the
United States at least, falls

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:47.090
under the Electronic
Communication

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:49.920
Protection Act of 1986.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.410
Now this was a law written about
technical issues back in

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:56.550
1986, when the world wide web
didn't exist and there weren't

00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:00.420
things like web-based email,
or that sort of thing.

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:04.390
So some of this is that we want
to show all the data so

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:06.140
you can see what's going on.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:10.830
And then maybe the next law
that affects this type of

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.740
information might be a little
different, might be a little

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.890
more appropriate given the
current state of affairs,

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:16.760
where you're not keeping
all your mail on a

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:17.790
machine at your house.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:18.190
LOUIS GRAY: Sure.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:20.390
And I think, going back to that
a little bit, that was a

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:24.630
law that was written 25-plus
years ago at this point.

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:27.936
So Google can almost play a
role in shaping the law or

00:19:27.936 --> 00:19:31.215
giving direction to knowing how
much companies can share

00:19:31.215 --> 00:19:35.240
and should share, but possibly
recommend how we have a new

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.010
approach to user data or
transparency as well.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.270
It sounds like we could
possibly-- you know, lobbying

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:41.760
goes on or do something
about that.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.400
Is that right?

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:42.710
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:44.980
I mean, we've seen a lot of
other companies putting this

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.690
information out there, but I'd
like to see the government

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:50.860
themselves providing
this information.

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.540
LOUIS GRAY: Now, stepping
to another tab.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.385
We've got a lot going on in
the Transparency Report.

00:19:54.385 --> 00:19:55.030
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Sure.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:57.840
LOUIS GRAY: One thing that often
comes up is requests for

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.740
removal, you know, be it
individuals or legal agencies,

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.760
they ask for data
that's in Google

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.590
Search index to be removed.

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:08.980
Like, hey, stop showing
sites from URL X.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:09.220
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.400
LOUIS GRAY: Can you take
us through that?

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.710
I think there's really two
parts, first of which is

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:13.840
removing it from the index.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.230
And the second is someone
saying, there's something on a

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:18.620
Google service that I would
like to have taken down.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:18.810
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:20.210
It could be a blog post.

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:21.720
It could be a YouTube video.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.690
It could be a photo.

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:25.810
It could be a link in
the search index.

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:28.250
We get a lot of these removal
requests, and there's two

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:29.810
types of removal requests
we get.

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:33.310
The first one is like, as you
said, government requests.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:36.750
And most of these are
defamation, and then beyond

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:40.000
that it's privacy and security
issues that we were required

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.720
to remove to basically
conform to the law.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.390
And some of these are like,
clearly, like public safety.

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:49.820
Not public safety issues, but
it might endanger something.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.260
For example, someone posts a
picture and some information

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:53.180
about a child.

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:55.870
Like, clearly, this isn't
information that should be

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.300
publicly accessible.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.910
So that we have a process
for requesting that that

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:02.940
information be removed, and
they have a process

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.100
for taking it down.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.330
LOUIS GRAY: And in this case,
when you get that kind of

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:09.080
request, it's not Google who's
making a decision whether it's

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.170
defamation or not.

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:12.110
You're basically taking
an order from a court

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:13.230
that says, do this.

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:16.650
And we comply if it's legal and
within the right scope.

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:16.980
Is that--

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:17.925
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
That's correct.

00:21:17.925 --> 00:21:18.390
LOUIS GRAY: OK.

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:19.680
So--

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.860
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We don't want
to be in the business of

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:21.740
making these decisions.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.720
We think a court should be
making these decision.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:24.450
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:25.580
Absolutely.

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:29.160
Now, one thing-- if I take a
look at this report, if I go

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.550
specifically to removal
requests, the dramatic rise in

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:35.110
the URLs expected to be removed
from Search, it seems

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:39.180
like it's up about 300% in the
last year, year and a half.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.360
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, you're
talking about copyright

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.160
requests now.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.890
So another kind of removal
requests are DNC takedowns.

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:45.870
And we publish all
of our takedowns

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.970
we get for web search.

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:51.690
And we launched this product
in May of 2012.

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:54.740
And at the time we were getting
about 1.5 million

00:21:54.740 --> 00:22:01.050
requests a month to remove URLs,
1.5 million URLs removed

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:02.910
from our index every month.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:05.380
And as I checked this morning,
I think we're up to

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:06.730
18 million a month.

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:09.750
LOUIS GRAY: 18,047,340.

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:11.720
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah,
that's a lot.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.110
And we update that every day.

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:16.040
But this is, again, to show--

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.105
so when you search for something
on Google and don't

00:22:18.105 --> 00:22:21.400
find it, many people assume it
doesn't exist on the internet.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.560
And our point is that
it may be out there.

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.840
We just have been required
to remove a link to it.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:32.450
And we're not out to help
people find potentially

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:36.450
infringing information
on the internet.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:38.275
But we do want to show that
there's a sort of what we call

00:22:38.275 --> 00:22:39.780
a negative search space.

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:42.890
And so this is a way of
showing, here are the

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:44.920
rights-holders sending
us takedown requests.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.390
Here are the agencies
representing them sending us

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:48.940
the takedowns, in some cases.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:53.180
And lastly, the websites who are
receiving the potentially

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:55.190
infringing requests as well.

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:57.210
So it's a way of showing
these things because--

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:00.860
the reason I think it's
important so this is websites,

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:03.760
unlike someone who posts a
YouTube video or writes a

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.830
blog, we don't always have a way
to contact these people.

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:09.520
So we have no way of
definitively letting you know,

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.425
if you have a website on the
internet, that we've received

00:23:11.425 --> 00:23:14.870
a takedown to pull you out of
our index so that you can do a

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.640
counter takedown request.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.710
LOUIS GRAY: This is something
that's interesting.

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:21.400
One of the things that I
always assumed prior to

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.030
working here is that Google
has access to just about

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:24.540
everything.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.320
Like, don't you have enough
resources to do X or Y?

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.940
But now that we're here, you
take a look at something like

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:33.080
18 million URLs that have been
requested to be removed.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.060
That's got to be an incredible
processing process.

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:36.640
How do you go ahead
and do that?

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.390
How do you set up that thing?

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:41.420
But in addition to that, you
take a look at this page, and

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.350
we even have a list of recently
submitted URLs where

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:44.905
we did nothing.

00:23:44.905 --> 00:23:45.850
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:47.440
LOUIS GRAY: And there's probably
a reason for that,

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:48.310
which you can take me through.

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:51.760
But I assume that basically
shows, here's our process.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.310
We don't accept every single
one that was requested.

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:55.080
That some get through.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:55.810
Some don't.

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:57.330
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We comply
with a very large percentage.

00:23:57.330 --> 00:24:00.640
I don't know the exact number,
but I would say we comply with

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.400
most of them.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.680
But sometimes we get takedown
requests that are invalid.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.290
Or sometimes they're mistaken.

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:09.490
We get requests from a
rights-holder to take down

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:10.980
links to their own website
in some cases.

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:11.780
LOUIS GRAY: I've seen that.

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:15.000
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We get
requests from individuals who

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.180
have had, let's say, for
example, some press on the web

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:20.330
that they don't like.

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:22.290
They send us takedown requests,
which are invalid,

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.870
because they don't own the
copyright on that information.

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:28.020
So this is just a way of showing
a little bit, some of

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:31.570
the things that are happening,
because, while most of them

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:33.340
are correct, there is always
an opportunity,

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:34.180
I think, for abuse.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.770
But there really isn't
very much of it.

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:41.660
LOUIS GRAY: So we talked
about the vast number

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:42.710
of copyright requests.

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:45.670
We talked about governments who
make specific requests to

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:46.990
make these changes.

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:49.560
We talked about which common
Google services there are that

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.470
have these interruptions.

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:54.800
So if you have a product that
actually is disrupted--

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.610
let's take a look at a specific
geographic region.

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:58.550
Does that mean absolutely
nobody in that

00:24:58.550 --> 00:24:59.490
region can use it?

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:02.480
Or is it like really slow
dial-up speeds, and they might

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.830
be able to get it, but it's not
going to be a lot of fun?

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:06.000
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
It means that--

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.470
it depends on what the
disruption shows.

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:10.370
Like because the graph can show
a partial disruption or a

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:11.170
full disruption.

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:12.390
LOUIS GRAY: What's
partial mean?

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:15.790
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Partial means
that, like let's say a

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:20.450
country has 10 ISPs, and they
cut off six of them.

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:23.680
So four ISPs in the country may
still be serving traffic

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.930
to their users.

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:27.840
So it may be that a certain
percentage of the country

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.070
can't access their services.

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:32.070
When it's all the way down to
zero, that means that almost

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.780
everyone can't.

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:37.150
And there may be the odd person
who's got a satellite

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:40.090
connection or something, which
are illegal in some places.

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:41.890
Or they may be getting
information

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:43.440
through their cell phone.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:43.860
You don't know.

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:47.480
There's always a few people
that may be getting the

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:47.755
information.

00:25:47.755 --> 00:25:52.330
It also may mean that our IP
to Geo mapping is off.

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:54.420
So there may be a corner
case, somewhere

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:55.200
that's getting something.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.110
There's no way to know
for certain.

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:58.520
LOUIS GRAY: There's one thing
that you-- you actually

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.240
introduced it this summer
about safe browsing.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.680
I think most of us have used the
internet, whether we use

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.040
Chrome or Firefox or other
browsers, sometimes you run

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.600
into something on Google search
where it says, hey,

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.320
this website might be harmful
to your computer.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.030
So let's talk about this.

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.740
We looked at the numbers.

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:17.110
And I'm really curious about the
way that we would be able

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:18.835
to handle 18 million
URL requests.

00:26:18.835 --> 00:26:23.680
But I assume that the vast
spidering and taking a look at

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.070
all these URLs to find out,
not only what content they

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:28.340
have for search results, but to
know that they're safe for

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:32.240
you computer, it's got to
be incredibly intensive.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.510
What do we display?

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:35.420
How do we warn people about
what's there and

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.080
provide safe browsing?

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.090
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, first
of all, we don't let them go

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:39.950
straight to the website.

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:42.210
So if you're in Google Search
and you click on a site that

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:45.280
has malware on it, we take you
to an interstitial page that

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:48.160
says, hey, this site may
harm your computer.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.170
We don't make it easy
for you to go there.

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:52.780
But let me back up to what
actually happens in a lot of

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:53.340
these cases.

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:57.040
Because a lot of times, these
sites with harmful information

00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.640
aren't a scary site.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.500
It might be some new site
you visit all the time.

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.690
It might be someone's
blog or something.

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:04.510
What happens is that
there are malware

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:06.640
providers on the internet.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.590
They're hosting malware.

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:08.850
They're trying to
do bad things.

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:11.360
They're trying to get control of
your computer to send spam

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.970
email, or do something
not cool.

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:15.020
LOUIS GRAY: Known bad actors.

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:15.950
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
Known bad actors.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:17.010
Thank you.

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:20.340
And so what they do in a lot
of cases is they'll go and

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:23.530
they will break into a website
that's popular, and they will

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:25.770
put malware on that website so
that when you go to that

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:29.010
website, your computer will
download that malware.

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:30.860
And then your computer suddenly
is going to be

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:31.530
controlled by them.

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:33.640
LOUIS GRAY: In that case, you
basically have a victim that

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.550
is passing it on.

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:35.710
They've been infected,
and they want to

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:36.610
infect you as well.

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:37.100
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.150
LOUIS GRAY: And they might
not have done anything

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:39.555
intentionally.

00:27:39.555 --> 00:27:41.740
But their site is definitely
infected.

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:42.570
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And
many times, they

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:44.110
don't even know it.

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:47.790
So that's another scary thing,
is that if you're not paying

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:51.490
attention going to your website,
it might have been

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:52.250
broken into.

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:53.010
Malware may be hosted.

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:54.330
You just don't know it.

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:55.920
LOUIS GRAY: I think sometimes
those people who run in the

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.545
internet, you'll see a search
result for a well-known blog

00:27:58.545 --> 00:28:00.850
or tech site you
regularly read.

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:03.000
And then the description of
the site will be all about

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.910
selling pharmaceutical
drugs at low cost.

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:05.320
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.360
LOUIS GRAY: Which is one
example of that.

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:10.810
So first of all, let's talk
about that, like-- not the

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:11.700
pharmaceutical drugs.

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:12.960
That's a different show.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:16.700
But to talk about making the web
safer, first again, why is

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.330
Google doing this?

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:21.930
What is it that we're doing to
accurately find out if a site

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:23.420
is hosting malware or not?

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.350
And then, what can we do to
either protect the users or

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:27.060
the site hosts themselves?

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.460
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, the
reason we're doing this is

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:32.250
because we do well if more
people use the web.

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:34.560
And if more people are using
the web and having terrible

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.960
things happen to them and their
computers, fewer people

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.050
are going to use the web.

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:39.810
And so it's in our best interest
to make sure that

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:42.450
people are safe on the web
using our products.

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:45.120
If you know that you can go to
Google Search and that we're

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:48.490
going to protect you from
malware wherever we can, I

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:51.480
think that encourages you to
come use us more often.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.840
If you came to Google and used
Google Search to find a

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.310
website and you clicked
through-- even if it was a

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:56.780
popular tech blog--

00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:00.260
and then it gave you malware,
I don't know that you'd

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.410
necessarily-- you may
blame Google.

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:01.940
You may not.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.055
But still, I don't think
you'd be happy.

00:29:03.055 --> 00:29:05.080
It's a bad experience for
you overall, and we

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.530
helped you get there.

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:09.670
So I think it's in our best
interest to do that.

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:13.680
And we'll also try and notify
webmasters through our

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.750
Webmaster Tools, if you signed
up with that, that your site

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:18.040
is infected.

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.270
So that's why it's a great--
if you have a website,

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:21.980
Webmaster Tools is
a great resource.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:22.690
It's free.

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:24.910
It tells you a ton of
information about your site,

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:26.460
and it will keep you up
to date if we find

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:27.790
anything wrong with it.

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:29.790
LOUIS GRAY: Now taking a look at
these graphs in the Making

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:33.040
the Web Safer category in the
Transparency Report, again we

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.550
see another rise in
the total numbers.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:38.700
When you look at this, it says,
"Upwards of 300 million

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:42.240
users see browser warnings every
single week." And that's

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:42.740
significant.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:44.470
That's practically the entire
population of the United

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:46.490
States alone.

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:49.320
And so I assume some of those
are individuals seeing

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.240
multiple warnings per week.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.550
Or is that one per?

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:53.070
I don't know how it's done.

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:58.290
But that's about triple where
it was just 12 months ago.

00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:00.020
What do we think is
causing that?

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:02.530
Do we have any idea to
understand why you have that

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:04.510
kind of rise in malware
tripping?

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:05.985
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: I think
there's an ebb

00:30:05.985 --> 00:30:06.940
and a flow to it.

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:10.630
And we see people finding new
vulnerabilities in websites

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:13.250
that they can exploit and
upload their malware.

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:15.770
And so, we've had peaks
in the past that have

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:18.370
gone down as well.

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:21.930
I'm not sure what the rise in
that is attributable to, but

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:27.540
what we've done in the malware
report is we've divided up

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:30.380
where the malware is hosted, in
many cases by what we call

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:33.860
autonomous network, so that
you can see sort of like

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:36.400
people who are responsible for
a particular block of IP

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.320
addresses on the web.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.570
So that you can see--

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:41.780
in some cases, if you look
at the dashboard--

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:43.250
where some of this is hosted.

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:45.940
And some places have more
things than others.

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.000
We're hoping that people will
look at that as an opportunity

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.280
to clean up their garden,
so to speak, and

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.960
keep their yard clean.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:53.125
LOUIS GRAY: Sure.

00:30:53.125 --> 00:30:54.754
So when we look at the
Transparency Report, we've got

00:30:54.754 --> 00:30:55.420
multiple tabs here.

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:58.310
We've got the Traffic report,
Removal Requests report, User

00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:00.160
Data Requests, and
Safe Browsing.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.300
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: A
lot of stuff now.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:04.180
LOUIS GRAY: We talked a little
bit about why we do it.

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:05.400
Let's go back to the
very beginning of

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.140
launching this thing.

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:08.725
How did you get that
to happen?

00:31:08.725 --> 00:31:10.300
You know, I think--

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.430
interesting discussions that
we've had in the last two

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:14.710
days, talking about the
Liberation Front, organization

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:15.700
manipulation.

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.680
It seems like you probably had
to manipulate the organization

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:21.590
a little bit to enable them
to make this information

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:23.400
available to our users.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.970
How did you go about championing
that for Google?

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:27.120
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, the
interesting thing about the

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.190
Transparency Report, I didn't.

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:32.180
The Transparency Report was
started by a bunch of 20%

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:33.890
people from the legal side--

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:34.770
LOUIS GRAY: What is 20%?

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:38.290
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: The 20% is
the ability to sometimes take

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:41.240
up to 20% of your time to work
on something else other than

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:44.180
your main project that's
in Google's interest.

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:48.320
So don't go off and, like,
practice your painting skills.

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.970
But go off and work on another
piece of software or another

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:51.720
project that's--

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.680
LOUIS GRAY: So it's like a
part-time project in addition

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.500
to their full-time job?

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:54.710
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:56.280
It's like something you think's
important or something

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.090
you'd like to check out,
that kind of thing.

00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:00.160
And so we had a lot of--

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.530
we had legal.

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:02.300
We had PR.

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:05.080
We had Policy and Engineering
working on this and they

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:08.930
initially launched the traffic
in the government requests

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:11.360
thing, and it was being
maintained and run out of just

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.270
a sort of ragtag band
of 20% folks.

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:19.420
And I talked to my friend, Matt,
who's currently the tech

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:21.280
lead for the Transparency
Report.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.260
And when he sort of briefed me
on what they were doing, I was

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.780
floored that this wasn't
a full-time team.

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:28.440
And it seemed incredibly
important.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.300
So I went and talked to a couple
of our execs, and I

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:31.760
said, look, this seems
really important.

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:35.230
I'd love to build a real,
full-time engineering team to

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:38.900
not only maintain this, but to
improve it and continue to

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:42.760
find more interesting data sets
and interesting products

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:46.700
that we can build to show people
what's going on and how

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:49.860
freedom of expression is being
affected on the internet.

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:53.130
And their response was,
that sounds awesome.

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:54.490
Go for it.

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:55.850
And so then I basically--

00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:59.310
I pulled Matt in as the tech
lead, and hired a few more

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:01.956
people, and we've got a
fantastic team, just like Data

00:33:01.956 --> 00:33:02.100
Liberation.

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:05.470
It's a small team of dedicated
engineers who are really at

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:06.750
the top of their game.

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:10.470
And we poke around Google and
see what kind of things we

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:15.420
can't dig up and publish to not
only show what's going on,

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:18.530
but we often have a goal that we
want to sort of make things

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:19.590
a little better, right?

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:21.570
We're publishing the
traffic graphs.

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:24.110
We hope that people realize that
they're not going to get

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:24.800
away with it.

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.685
People are going to know very
clearly that they're shutting

00:33:26.685 --> 00:33:28.970
out traffic.

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:30.976
So maybe they'll think
twice about it.

00:33:30.976 --> 00:33:31.400
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.180
And I think one thing that
people often talk about is the

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:37.030
percentage of web
traffic that's

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:38.910
through Google's services.

00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:41.990
And as we start to be a
significant portion of that,

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:44.830
when you cut access to the web,
we're going to see it.

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:46.610
And since we have the
Transparency Report, your

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:47.490
users are going to see it.

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:49.220
The press is going to see it.

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:52.210
I think one of the adages that
we've always learned from Eric

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:56.010
Schmidt and Larry Page is, you
don't fight against the web.

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:57.300
The web always wins.

00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:59.710
I think this has been a very
cool discussion, talking about

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:02.930
the Transparency Report, and
really how the web and its

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:07.900
services are being used to
push change, be it with

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:10.699
governments that want to keep
things a certain way and the

00:34:10.699 --> 00:34:11.199
status quo.

00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:13.510
But they are affecting the
people on the ground who want

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:16.570
to have that information,
have that communication.

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:19.380
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: My closing
thought I'll give you is that,

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:23.770
never before in the history of
mankind has-- or humankind--

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:26.400
has there been a global
distribution system that costs

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:27.530
almost nothing.

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:30.090
And that is what makes the
internet so amazing.

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:31.760
And I'm a big fan.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.020
LOUIS GRAY: I'm glad you're
looking out for us, and

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:35.139
looking out for users.

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:36.800
So thanks again for coming
in for all three

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:37.920
parts of Fitz Week--

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:38.469
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
My pleasure.

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:38.760
LOUIS GRAY: --Brian.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.100
It's been a lot of fun.

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:42.940
For those of you watching,
definitely take a look at

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:45.530
google.com/transparencyreport.
