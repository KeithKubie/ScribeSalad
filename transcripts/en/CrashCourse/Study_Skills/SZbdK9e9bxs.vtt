00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.600
Hi, I’m Thomas Frank, this is
Crash Course Study Skills,

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.140
and if you happen to be watching this at whatever
point in the future that we all get neural implants to
let us store our memories on servers in space,

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.620
what I’m about to tell you is
woefully inaccurate.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.260
Also, do we have flying cars yet?

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.900
For those of you who still rely on that
mushy gray stuff in your cranium to remember
things, though, listen up.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.780
Today we’re digging into how your memory
works and how you can make it work better.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.960
At least, I think we are.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.660
Nick, we’re not filming those makeup tutorials
today, are we?

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:36.240
[Theme Music]

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.920
The science of how memory works is
complicated, to say the least.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.000
After all, how do we explain how a bunch of
nerve cells, chemicals, and electrical jolts

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.100
somehow let you remember algebra, where you
left your car keys, and all the lines to The Dark Knight?

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.240
Well, it’s simple. We, uh…. rely on Hank
from 3 years ago to do it for us.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.240
Seriously, there are two whole episodes of Crash Course Psychology that go through the entire process of how memories are formed and retrieved.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.080
But just like Xzibit left to his own devices
in a car dealership, I can’t resist putting
crash courses in your Crash Course.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.820
Plus, understanding how your memory works
will help you to optimize the way you study.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.020
So let’s do a quick review.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.740
Your brain turns information into memories
by putting it through a few different stages.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.340
The first is sensory memory, which
processes pretty much everything your senses
detect or experience in the real world.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.460
That sensory memory has the attention span
of a five-year-old at the DMV, though, so most of
what it takes in is lost almost immediately.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.360
But what does stick moves into your short-term
or working memory.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.980
This type of memory is sort of like the
RAM in your computer – the memories don’t
stick around permanently.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:38.220
In fact, unless you continuously rehearse
what’s floating around in working memory, it’ll pull
a disappearing act after about 15-30 seconds.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.970
This can also happen if you try to cram too much in at once, because your working memory can really only handle 4-7 bits or items of information at a time.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.480
Now you can somewhat increase this limit
by grouping bits into chunks –

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.940
like splitting “FBIKGBCIA” into
FBI, KGB, CIA, but there’s still a limit.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.120
Now, all this happens primarily in your
brain’s prefrontal cortex,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.260
but eventually the information has to
make its way to other areas of the brain if it’s
going to be encoded in long-term memory.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.940
To greatly simplify things, it’ll first
head to the hippocampus, which augments it
with chemicals called neurotransmitters.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.800
Along with many other functions, these transmit
details about the information – metadata, if you will.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.680
Eventually, this leads to the formation of new synapses, which are essentially connections between neurons – though the neurons don’t actually touch.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.240
Instead, they prefer to keep a small gap between
each other and let more of those neurotransmitters
move information between them.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.280
The whole process of memory formation
causes physical changes within your brain:

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.600
neurotransmitters shuttle all over the place,
neural pathways are forged,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.930
and neurons themselves undergo structural improvements using proteins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.460
And, just like the process of strengthening your
muscles through exercise, this all takes time –

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.560
which is why cramming for a test doesn’t
work, and why you can’t instantly just
download jujitsu into your brain like Neo.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.800
As Pierce J. Howard noted in his book The
Owner’s Manual for the Brain:

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:01.140
“Work involving higher mental functions, such
as analysis and synthesis, needs to be spaced out
to allow new neural connections to solidify.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.780
New learning drives out old learning when
insufficient time intervenes.”

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.500
Now that you have a bit of an understanding
of how your memory works, one crucial tip
should be clear:

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.980
you have to space your
learning out over time.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:19.060
But we’re not going to just leave it at that, because – as cognitive scientists have known for a long time – the way you do that spacing matters quite a bit.

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.199
To explain this, let’s start with why we
forget things in the first place.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.340
Part of the reason is that your brain doesn’t
encode all memories equally.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:33.340
During the long-term encoding process, the hippocampus will use different levels of neurotransmitters based on, among other things, how important the information is.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.880
And this plays a big role in how strongly it’s embedded in long-term memory.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.840
This filtering mechanism is great for survival, as it
allows your brain to safely disregard unimportant things,

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.120
like what you had for breakfast two weeks ago,
while paying special attention to what’s important,
like that fact that there are ninjas behind you right now.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.000
Unfortunately, you can’t always consciously
decide what’s important and what’s not,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.100
which is why it can be hard to remember all
the details from that history chapter you just read.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:03.840
At a primal level, your brain just doesn’t think the
details of Genghis Khan’s war with the Quarismian Shah
in 1219 are as important as a bear attacking you.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.880
However, there are a few tricks you can pull
to make it care a bit more.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.500
First, understand that your brain latches more readily onto things that are tangible, visual, and uncommon than it does with the abstract or the mundane.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.080
Because of this, it can be helpful to develop mnemonics, which are mental devices that help you associate pieces of information in ways that are easier to remember.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.140
And mnemonics can take many forms.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:28.480
You can create sayings to remember sequences of
letters – such as “Ernie Ate Dynamite, GoodBye Ernie”
to remember the names of the strings on a guitar.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.220
Or you can make up weird stories in your
head that includes cues to the information
you’re trying to associate.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:40.920
Like, the way I remember that Helsinki is the capital of Finland is by imagining a giant flaming sinkhole in the ground opening up with a bunch of sharks jumping out of it.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:48.120
Since it’s weird, it’s easy to remember, and
it helps me associate the words Hell, Fin, and Sink,
which in turn connect Finland and Helsinki.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.500
Additionally, the more connections that lead
to a memory, the stronger it’ll be – especially
if they’re learned in different contexts.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.800
When I first learned about caravels, which were
those small ships that Portuguese explorers used
to travel down the African coast in the 15th century,

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.740
I had a hard time remembering
that name – caravels.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.940
But once I started using them in Civilization
V to build my empire –

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.880
and to make sure Ghandi never got far enough
to nuke me, the memory became a lot more solid,
since I was interacting with it in a new context.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.940
Of course, you still have to repeatedly
access your new memories once they’re
encoded if you want them to stick around.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.240
This is pretty much the iron law of memorization:

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:25.980
Except in cases where they’re attached to a
particularly intense emotional experience, memories
fade away unless you repeatedly recall them.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.060
Well, sort of.
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.860
In the 1880’s, a German psychologist named
Herman Ebbinghaus wanted to understand how
memories decayed over time,

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.760
and he especially wanted to know how
long the process took.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:44.500
He began by running countless tests on his own memory, forcing himself to recall long lists of meaningless letters until eventually, he came up with the Forgetting Curve.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:51.980
While largely hypothetical and simplistic in its details, this model demonstrated how memories decay quickly unless accessed again and again.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.380
Since Ebbinghaus’s days, our understanding
of how memory decays has come a long way.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:02.400
According to the Forget-to-Learn theory, which is presented in Benedict Carey’s book How We Learn, memories actually have two different strengths:

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.680
storage strength and retrieval strength.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.060
Picture your brain as a library where none
of the books ever get stolen or damaged.

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:11.270
When a new book is put on a shelf, it’s
there for good.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.220
This represents storage strength, which, according
to the theory, doesn’t weaken.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.720
Once a memory is encoded, the neural pattern
can only get stronger.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:24.880
Now, unfortunately this library has a particularly lazy librarian who doesn’t do a very good job of keeping
the library’s catalog organized.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.160
This represents retrieval strength, which
does fade with time.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.200
Unless you go in and organize the catalog
– or recall the memory – you’ll eventually
lose track of it.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.860
Thanks, Thought Bubble.
Now here’s where it gets good.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:42.440
The more a memory’s retrieval strength has
faded, and the greater the difficulty of recalling it,
the greater the increase in learning will be.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.110
This is called the Spacing Effect.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.600
It’s essentially the “No pain, no gain,”
of the mental realm;

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.520
the harder you have to work to recall something,
the greater the reward for doing so.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:57.500
There’s an obvious catch, though – if you wait too
long, the retrieval strength diminishes so much that
you won’t be able to recall the memory at all.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.719
This where the Principle of Desirable Difficulty
comes in.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.840
To maximize the efficiency of your studying,
you want to the find the point right before
you’re about to forget something.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.600
And you can do this by using spaced repetition
techniques.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:15.640
The general idea behind spaced repetition is to
steadily increase the amount of time in between
each study session for any piece of information.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.600
So instead of reviewing a fact or concept
once every few days,

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:24.540
you’d use a schedule like this where you’d wait a day between the first and second sessions, three days between the second and third, and so on.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:30.920
To do this precisely, you need a system that tracks your progress in memorizing each piece of information you need to study – since it never happens evenly.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.660
If you’ve got 100 Japanese kanji to learn,
it’s inevitable that you’ll remember some
easier than others.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:42.340
If you use the exact same time delays for
every kanji, you’ll spend too much time studying
some, and others won’t ever be learned at all.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.760
To solve this problem, you can use the Leitner
System.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:49.040
In it, you’ve got five boxes, each of which
represents a specific study interval.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.160
Box 1 gets studied every day, Box 2 every
three days, Box 3 once a week, and so on.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.140
Every fact or term gets its own flash card,
and all cards start off in Box 1.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.560
Once you get a card right, move it to the
next box.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:05.340
And if you get a card wrong – no matter
what box it’s in – send it back to Box 1.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:11.140
If you play by these rules, you’ll ensure that you
maximize your efficiency by spending more time
studying the cards you have the weakest grasp on.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:17.029
The increasing time intervals of the boxes
also help you leverage the spacing effect and
get to close to that point of desirable difficulty.

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:23.150
There are also a ton of spaced repetition
apps for both computers and smartphones that
will let you make this whole process digital.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:29.560
The best known one is probably Anki, which
is free on most platforms, but there’s also
TinyCards, Quizlet, and many, many others.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:37.460
Now when it comes to subjects that aren’t easily
studied through flash cards – like math or even a sport like skateboarding – it’s harder to use a rigid spaced repetition algorithm.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:42.380
However, the spacing effect applies here as well,
so be sure to space out your practice over time.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.260
During any given day’s practice, you’ll eventually
hit a wall where you stop making progress

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.500
whether it’s learning derivatives in calculus
or kickflips in skateboarding

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.800
– but if you come back to it a few days later,
everything will be more likely to click into place.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:58.740
In each of these study sessions, make sure
you’re putting the focus on recalling information
from your own memory.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:03.500
As we talked about in our video on reading
assignments, there are two main kinds of
memory – recognition and recall.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:08.420
Recognition is what happens when you’re
exposed to information you’ve already seen
before and remember it.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:13.300
But recall involves dredging the information up from
the depths of your memory banks without seeing it,

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.400
which is exactly what you’ll have to do in both
your exams and in many real-world situations.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.440
So when you study, make sure you’re focusing
on active recall.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.880
Don’t just passively read over your notes or
slides – use them to create quizzes for yourself,

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.580
or challenge yourself to sit down and write out
a summary of what you’ve learned from memory.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:36.280
If you’re studying a subject like math or physics, put a huge emphasis on practicing with real problems and actually use the concepts and formulas you’ve learned.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:40.320
In short, studying should feel like work,
and it should challenge your brain.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.280
When it does, you’ll remember more while
spending fewer hours at your desk.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.100
Thanks for watching, and I’ll see you next
week.
