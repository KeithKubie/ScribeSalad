ISSUE IS BOY SCOUT EXPERT,

00:00:03.736 --> 00:00:07.907 align:start position:0% line:91%
MATTEO LANE. MATTEO, THANKS FOR

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.844 line:91%
&gt;&gt; SO WHAT IS IT LIKE BEING IN
THE BOY SCOUTS IN THIS DAY AND

00:00:11.877 --> 00:00:12.478 align:start position:0% line:85%
AGE?

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:15.281 size:88% position:44% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OH, I AM NOT A BOY SCOUT.

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:16.582 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OH.

00:00:16.615 --> 00:00:17.316 align:start position:0% line:85%
I AM SORRY.

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:18.084 align:start position:0% line:91%
BECAUSE YOU ARE DRESSED LIKE
ONE.

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:19.252 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OH, SURE.

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:22.588 line:91%
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE I AM GOING
OUT TO A BUNCH OF GAY CLUBS

00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:28.861 align:start position:0% line:91%
LATER AND THIS OUTFIT GETS ME A
TON OF PEEN.

00:00:28.894 --> 00:00:31.397 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.132 align:start position:0% line:85%
A TON OF PEEN.

00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:34.200 line:85%
&gt;&gt; PEEN. IT'S PRONOUNCED "PEEN."

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:36.069 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OH, I AM SORRY.

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:36.636 align:start position:0% line:85%
PEEN.

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:37.937 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT, LARRY.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.642 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THERE IS NOTHING GAYER THAN
THE BOY SCOUTS.

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:47.113 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?  THE BOY SCOUTS ONLY JUST

00:00:47.146 --> 00:00:49.348 align:start position:0% line:91%
STARTING ALLOWING GAY SCOUT
LEADERS.

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:52.552 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; LARRY, THIS IS AN ORGANIZTION
THAT HAS MEN GO OUT INTO THE

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:58.024 size:88% position:44% line:91%
WOODS TO CAMP, SWIM AND COOK
TOGETHER, ALL WHILE WEARING

00:00:58.057 --> 00:01:01.527 size:81% position:41% line:85%
NECKERCHIEFS UNIRONICALLY.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.596 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: SURE.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.033 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE A LADY GAGA VIDEO,
ONLY GAYER.

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.868 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WOW.

00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:12.438 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND THIS IS NOT ABOUT
ALLOWING GAY SCOUT LEADERS.

00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:15.208 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA
ORGANIZATION ITSELF NEEDS TO

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:17.810 align:start position:0% line:85%
COME OUT OF THE CLOSET.

00:01:17.843 --> 00:01:20.980 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WAIT, HOLD ON, JUST
BECAUSE AN ORGANIZATION PROMOTES

00:01:21.013 --> 00:01:23.850 line:91%
THOSE ACTIVITIES WITH MEN, IT
DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN IT'S

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:25.084 align:start position:0% line:85%
GAY.

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:29.856 line:91%
&gt;&gt; LARRY, WAKE UP AND SMELL THE
RICHLY BREWED COFFEE CAREFULLY

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:33.259 align:start position:0% line:91%
PREPARED BY AN OVERLY FUSSY
SCOUT LEADER THAT'S WAY BETTER

00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:37.430 size:88% position:44% line:85%
THAN IT HAS ANY RIGHT TO BE.

00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:40.433 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT SOUNDS LIKE SOME VERY GOOD
COFFEE.

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:43.569 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; MARVELOUS. AND THERE ARE TONS
OF SIGNS THAT SHOULD MAKE IT

00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:44.737 align:start position:0% line:85%
SUPER OBVIOUS.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.906 line:91%
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE HIGHEST
LEVEL OF BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.075 align:start position:0% line:91%
ADULT LEADERSHIP TRAINING BADGE

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:51.277 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: NO.  WHAT IS IT?

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.913 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THE WOOD BADGE, LARRY.

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:55.815 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: REALLY?  IS THAT
TRUE?

00:01:55.848 --> 00:01:56.883 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OH, YES.

00:01:56.916 --> 00:02:01.154 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW, WOOD IS
A SYNONYM FOR BONER.

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:05.658 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: ACTUALLY, I DID KNOW
THAT. IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE YOU

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:07.460 align:start position:0% line:91%
ARE GENERALIZING THE THINGS THAT
GAY GUYS LIKE.

00:02:07.493 --> 00:02:09.095 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OH, I'M GENERALIZING.

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:09.796 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: YEAH.

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.330 line:85%
&gt;&gt; KIND OF LIKE THE MORMONS DO.

00:02:11.363 --> 00:02:11.864 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY.

00:02:11.897 --> 00:02:13.098 align:start position:0% line:85%
FAIR ENOUGH.

00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:17.303 line:91%
I GET IT, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BOY
SCOUT OATH, WHICH CALLS ON ALL

00:02:17.336 --> 00:02:20.373 line:91%
SCOUTS TO, QUOTE, KEEP MYSELF
PHYSICALLY STRONG, MENTALLY

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:21.407 size:84% position:42% line:85%
AWAKE AND MORALLY STRAIGHT.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.412 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; LARRY, THAT IS THE GAYEST
PART OF THE SCOUTS.

00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:28.514 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: HOW IS THAT
POSSIBLE?

00:02:28.547 --> 00:02:31.617 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; OH, STRAIGHT? IT IS THE
CLASSIC GAY MISDIRECT.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.054 line:91%
YOU KNOW, IT IS LIKE THE MORE A
POLITICIAN GOES OFF AGAINST GAY

00:02:35.087 --> 00:02:40.359 size:88% position:44% line:91%
RIGHTS, THE MORE YOU KNOW HE
GETS OFF TO LIAM HEMSWORTH.

00:02:40.392 --> 00:02:43.262 align:start position:0% line:85%
HA, HA, HA.

00:02:43.295 --> 00:02:48.834 align:start position:0% line:91%
OH, GOD!
ZIIIIIIING!

00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:51.604 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT IS AN AMAZING
ZING, BY THE WAY.

00:02:51.637 --> 00:02:52.438 align:start position:0% line:85%
VERY GOOD.

00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:55.341 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; ZING!

00:02:55.374 --> 00:02:56.409 align:start position:0% line:91%
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY.

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:57.610 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL RIGHT.

00:02:57.643 --> 00:03:01.547 line:91%
BUT ISN'T IT POSSIBLE THAT THEY
JUST REALLY DON'T LIKE GAYS?

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.984 line:85%
&gt;&gt; OH, I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT.

00:03:05.017 --> 00:03:08.020 align:start position:0% line:91%
I MEAN, I GUESS IT IS POSSIBLE,
LARRY.

00:03:08.053 --> 00:03:11.853 line:91%
BUT WHEN YOU REALLY BREAK IT
DOWN, NECKERCHIEFS DON'T LIE.
