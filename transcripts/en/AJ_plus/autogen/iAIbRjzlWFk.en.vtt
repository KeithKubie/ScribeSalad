00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.829
 all 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.090
 what are we doing with 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:18.289
 this bicycle is a call from 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:20.539
 citizens for citizens to be 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.240
 encourage to use the bicycle and put 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.789
 to celebrate it, to celebrate it as a bicycle 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.009
 a recreational tool like a 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.869
 tool that generates health with a 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.869
 tool that favors the economy 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.640
 no no no no 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.920
 and here we have 5 million vehicles 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.830
 circulating five and a half then obviously 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.500
 we have a high risk factor and if 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:56.370
 we got to have days like 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.300
 previous ones where there is a scarce one 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.840
 scarce presence of high winds 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.000
 concentration of ultraviolet rays and 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.490
 this generates as a consequence a 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.220
 high concentration of ozone so let's 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.220
 keep having these conditions 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.210
 of pollution is affecting 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.430
 too much not only in the physical aspect 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.430
 but also in the emotional because this 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.390
 it causes a lot of stress a problem 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.390
 Very strong 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.950
 No it's not
