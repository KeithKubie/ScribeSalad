it isn't rating them as worthwhile it's
 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.620
it isn't rating them as worthwhile it's
rating them as postmodern neo-marxist or

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630
rating them as postmodern neo-marxist or
 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.749
rating them as postmodern neo-marxist or
not and it's actually fully developed I

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759
not and it's actually fully developed I

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619
didn't design it uh somebody volunteered
 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.950
didn't design it uh somebody volunteered
to design it and presented it to me and

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960
to design it and presented it to me and
 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.529
to design it and presented it to me and
it seems to work very well I was going

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539
it seems to work very well I was going
 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.509
it seems to work very well I was going
to launch it at the end of August so

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519
to launch it at the end of August so
 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.279
to launch it at the end of August so
that this year's university students

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289
that this year's university students
 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.230
that this year's university students
could benefit from it but there was the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240
could benefit from it but there was the
 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.630
could benefit from it but there was the
Charlottesville event and then I got

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640
Charlottesville event and then I got
 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.850
Charlottesville event and then I got
busy and I also wasn't feeling great and

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860
busy and I also wasn't feeling great and
 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.100
busy and I also wasn't feeling great and
so I just didn't hit the window of time

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110
so I just didn't hit the window of time
 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.310
so I just didn't hit the window of time
properly but I hope to be able to launch

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320
properly but I hope to be able to launch
 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.549
properly but I hope to be able to launch
it for the January incoming class to do

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559
it for the January incoming class to do
 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.110
it for the January incoming class to do
a video about what's wrong with the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120
a video about what's wrong with the
 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.180
a video about what's wrong with the
university system the many things that

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190
university system the many things that
 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.709
university system the many things that
are wrong with the university system and

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719
are wrong with the university system and
 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.690
are wrong with the university system and
to launch the website at the same time I

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700
to launch the website at the same time I
 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.790
to launch the website at the same time I
also had people suggest to me that maybe

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800
also had people suggest to me that maybe
 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.319
also had people suggest to me that maybe
it wasn't a good idea that it would

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329
it wasn't a good idea that it would
 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.110
it wasn't a good idea that it would
increase polarization but I've thought

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120
increase polarization but I've thought
 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.910
increase polarization but I've thought
about that for about a month and a half

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920
about that for about a month and a half
 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.860
about that for about a month and a half
and I think that the benefit to the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870
and I think that the benefit to the
 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.720
and I think that the benefit to the
consumer so that would be the informed

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730
consumer so that would be the informed
 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.670
consumer so that would be the informed
student outweighs any danger of

student outweighs any danger of
 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.840
student outweighs any danger of
polarization

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850
polarization
 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.550
polarization
besides that something has to be done

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560
besides that something has to be done
 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.840
besides that something has to be done
because the situation in the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850
because the situation in the
 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.550
because the situation in the
universities is really ridiculous so all

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560
universities is really ridiculous so all
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.960
universities is really ridiculous so all
right so let's see what else we've got

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970
right so let's see what else we've got
 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:23.499
right so let's see what else we've got

that's quite a mouthful says I'm

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920
that's quite a mouthful says I'm
 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.590
that's quite a mouthful says I'm
studying to be a teacher but I'm also an

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600
studying to be a teacher but I'm also an
 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.840
studying to be a teacher but I'm also an
introvert could this be a big problem

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850
introvert could this be a big problem
 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.520
introvert could this be a big problem
can I still be a successful teacher

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530
can I still be a successful teacher
 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.760
can I still be a successful teacher
actually what seems to predict success

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770
actually what seems to predict success
 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.700
actually what seems to predict success
of teaching best is intelligence and

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710
of teaching best is intelligence and
 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.069
of teaching best is intelligence and
conscientiousness that's the data so far

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079
conscientiousness that's the data so far
 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.950
conscientiousness that's the data so far
so if you're conscientious then you'll

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960
so if you're conscientious then you'll
 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.800
so if you're conscientious then you'll
probably be fine I mean extra introverts

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.990
probably be fine I mean extra introverts
have a harder time speaking in front of

have a harder time speaking in front of
 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.789
have a harder time speaking in front of
groups but you can learn to do that you

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799
groups but you can learn to do that you
 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.410
groups but you can learn to do that you
know an introvert can become a very

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420
know an introvert can become a very
 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.929

successful public speaker may not enjoy

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939
successful public speaker may not enjoy
 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.789
successful public speaker may not enjoy
it the same way that an extrovert might

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799
it the same way that an extrovert might
 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.350
it the same way that an extrovert might
but that doesn't mean that you can't

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360
but that doesn't mean that you can't
 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.179
but that doesn't mean that you can't
learn those skills and what I would

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189
learn those skills and what I would
 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.520
learn those skills and what I would
recommend for an introvert is the same

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530
recommend for an introvert is the same
 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.230
recommend for an introvert is the same
thing that I do when I'm lecturing is I

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240
thing that I do when I'm lecturing is I
 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.830
thing that I do when I'm lecturing is I
never talked to the whole group

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840
never talked to the whole group
 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.330
never talked to the whole group
you know doesn't matter how big the

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340
you know doesn't matter how big the
 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.649
you know doesn't matter how big the
crowd is I'm always picking out

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659
crowd is I'm always picking out
 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.690
crowd is I'm always picking out
individuals in the group and it's

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700
individuals in the group and it's
 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.490
individuals in the group and it's
talking specifically to them so I'll

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500
talking specifically to them so I'll
 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.080
talking specifically to them so I'll
make a point to an individual and I

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090
make a point to an individual and I
 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.970
make a point to an individual and I
watch their face and see if they're

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980
watch their face and see if they're
 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.890
watch their face and see if they're
nodding and understanding right because

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900
nodding and understanding right because
 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.600
nodding and understanding right because
that way you make contact with the

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610
that way you make contact with the
 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.610
that way you make contact with the
entire audience and then you know I'll

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620
entire audience and then you know I'll
 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.800
entire audience and then you know I'll
talk to someone for about 15 seconds or

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810
talk to someone for about 15 seconds or
 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.210
talk to someone for about 15 seconds or
so I don't want to put them on the spot

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220
so I don't want to put them on the spot
 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.860
so I don't want to put them on the spot
too much and then I shift my attention

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870
too much and then I shift my attention
 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.229
too much and then I shift my attention
to someone else and I sort of pinpoint

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239
to someone else and I sort of pinpoint
 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.930
to someone else and I sort of pinpoint
around the room that keeps everybody in

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940
around the room that keeps everybody in
 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.460
around the room that keeps everybody in
the room focused on what I'm saying

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470
the room focused on what I'm saying
 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.100
the room focused on what I'm saying
because each person reflects the entire

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110
because each person reflects the entire
 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.050
because each person reflects the entire
crowd back to you and so I would say if

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060
crowd back to you and so I would say if
 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.430
crowd back to you and so I would say if
you're an introvert or if you want to

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440
you're an introvert or if you want to
 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.680
you're an introvert or if you want to
speak in public in general forget about

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690
speak in public in general forget about
 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.080
speak in public in general forget about
the damn crowd it doesn't exist

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090
the damn crowd it doesn't exist
 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.870
the damn crowd it doesn't exist
speak to people one at one at a time and

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880
speak to people one at one at a time and
 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.759
speak to people one at one at a time and
an introvert can do that just fine

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769
an introvert can do that just fine
 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.000
an introvert can do that just fine
so you know that's where your strengths

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010
so you know that's where your strengths
 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.160
so you know that's where your strengths
would be and I would say you're much

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170
would be and I would say you're much
 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.160
would be and I would say you're much
more likely to be unsuccessful as a

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170
more likely to be unsuccessful as a
 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.990
more likely to be unsuccessful as a
teacher if you don't work hard at it and

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000
teacher if you don't work hard at it and
 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.789
teacher if you don't work hard at it and
if you're not interested in and so if

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799
if you're not interested in and so if
 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.020
if you're not interested in and so if
you're an introvert I wouldn't worry

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030
you're an introvert I wouldn't worry
 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.539
you're an introvert I wouldn't worry
about that I don't think that that'll be

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549
about that I don't think that that'll be
 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.610
about that I don't think that that'll be
the biggest problem that you'll face so
