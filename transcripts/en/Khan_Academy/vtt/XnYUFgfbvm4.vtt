00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.600
- [Instructor] A significance
test is going to be performed

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.350
using a significance level of 5/100.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.950
Suppose that the null
hypothesis is actually false.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.160
If the significance level
was lowered to 1/100,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.850
which of the following would be true?

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:16.930
So pause this video

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.450
and see if you can answer it on your own.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.160
Okay, now let's do this together.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.390
Let's see, they're talking
how the probability

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.050
of a type II error and/or
the power would change.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.490
So before I even look at the choices,

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.800
let's think about this.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.920
We have talked about in previous videos

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.550
that if we increase our
level of significance,

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.170
that will increase our power.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.610
And power is the probability
of not making a type II error,

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.960
so that would decrease the probability

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.030
of making a type II error.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.160
But in this question
we're going the other way.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.640
We're decreasing the
level of significance,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.370
which would lower the probability
of making a type I error,

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.920
but this would decrease the power.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.850
It actually would increase.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.590
It actually would increase the probability

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.590
of making a type II error.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.330
Which of these choices
are consistent with that?

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.360
Well, choice A says that
both the type II error

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.730
and the power would decrease.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.900
Well, these two things
don't move together.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.020
If one increases, the other decreases.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.570
So we rule that one out.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.100
Choice B also has these
two things moving together,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.960
which can't be true.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.010
If one increases, the other decreases.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.310
Choice C, the probability of a
type II error would increase.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.400
That's consistent with what we have here.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.770
And the power of the test would decrease.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.730
Yep, that's consistent
with what we have here,

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.890
so that looks good.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.410
And choice D is the opposite of that.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.840
The probability of a type
II error would decrease.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.500
They're talking about
this scenario over here,

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.333
and that would have happened

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:51.110
if they increased our significance
level, not decreased it,

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.110
so we could rule that one out as well.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.380
Let's do another example.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.720
Asha owns a car wash
and is trying to decide

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.660
whether or not to
purchase a vending machine

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.570
so that customers can buy
coffee while they wait.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.320
She'll get the machine if she's
convinced that more than 30%

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.570
of her customers would buy coffee.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.560
She plans on taking a
random sample of n customers

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.020
and asking them whether or
not they would buy coffee

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.470
from the machine, and she'll
then do a significance test

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.660
using alpha equals 0.05 to
see if the sample proportion

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.820
who say "yes" is significantly
greater than 30%.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.510
Which situation below would result

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.490
in the highest power for her test?

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.300
So, again, pause this
video and try to answer it.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.050
Well, before I even look at the choices,

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.700
we could think about what
her hypotheses would be.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.880
Her null hypothesis is,

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.400
you can kind of view it as the status quo.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.840
No news here.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.340
And that would be that the
true population proportion

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.970
of people who want to buy coffee is 30%

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.200
and that her alternative
hypothesis is that no,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.860
the true population proportion,

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.950
the true population parameter
there is greater than

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.810
is greater than 30%.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.420
If we're talking about what would result

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.700
in the highest power for her test.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.660
So, a high power.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.640
A high power means the lowest probability

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.150
of making a type II error.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.660
And in other videos we've talked about it.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.210
It looks like she's dealing
with the sample size.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.740
And what is the true proportion

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.280
of customers that would buy coffee?

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.430
And the sample size is under her control.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.930
The true proportion isn't.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.500
Don't wanna make it seem

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.040
like somehow you can
change the true proportion

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.680
in order to get a higher power.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.950
You can change the sample size.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.730
But the general principle is,

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.190
the higher the sample
size, the higher the power.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.410
So you want the highest
possible sample size.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.690
And you're going to have a higher power

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.130
if the true proportion is further

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.120
from your null hypothesis proportion.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.480
We want the highest possible n,

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.040
and that looks like an n of
200, which is there and there.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.370
And we want a true proportion of customers

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.630
that would actually buy coffee

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.040
as far away as possible
from our null hypothesis,

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.540
which, once again, would
not be under Asha's control.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.230
But you can clearly see
that 50% is further from 30

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.340
than 32 is, so this one,

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.250
choice D is the one that looks good.
