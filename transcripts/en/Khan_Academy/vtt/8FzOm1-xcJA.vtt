00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.110
- [Instructor] So we are
posed with the question,

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.570
All else equal, which of the
following would likely cause

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.570
aggregate production to go up?

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.580
Pause this video,

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.760
and see which of these
you think would do that.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.870
All right, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:15.720
This first one says,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.970
More people enter the labor force

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.100
while the unemployment
rate stays constant.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.160
Well, labor is an important
factor of production.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.420
And if more people enter the labor force,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.120
and the unemployment rate stays the same,

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.690
that means that the absolute number

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.590
of people who are working goes up.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.850
And if everything else stays constant,

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.770
the level of technology, the capital,

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.520
the productivity per person,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.620
well, then you would expect
to be able to produce more.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.820
So aggregate production
should go up in this scenario.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.120
So I'll put a check right over there.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.090
The second one,

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.870
Velocity of money goes up.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:51.970
This one is tempting,

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.860
because you might associate
a high velocity of money,

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.750
there's a lot of transactions going on,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.950
you might associate that
with a very positive economy,

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.230
but remember, we're saying all else equal.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.490
There might be a scenario where,

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.800
people are transacting more, there's more,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.820
the money is circulating faster,

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.220
but the total amount of
output hasn't changed at all.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.530
There's the same number of people

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.730
producing the same amount of goods,

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.050
using the same technology
and the same capital.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.480
And so this does not have a direct linkage

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.420
to the output going up, all else equal.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.320
So I'll rule this out.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.070
Inflation goes up.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.770
Well this, again, is tempting,

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.270
because many times, when we
are producing at a high rate,

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.650
when the economy is strong,

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.400
that's associated with higher inflation.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.250
But there's many cases in history

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.170
where you might even have hyper-inflation

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.890
when the economy is
actually even shrinking.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.860
And remember, we're saying all else equal.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.870
So there's a situation
where the price level,

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.070
and the rate of the price
level going up, is going up,

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.680
but we're producing the same
amount of goods and services.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.050
And so I will rule this out.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.110
A new method of producing more goods

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.230
with the same resources is developed.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.020
Well just imagine a very simple scenario.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.430
If the whole economy consists
of me, and I produce pencils,

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.650
and let's say I can
produce 10 pencils a day,

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.830
but I just have a new method
of producing 20 pencils a day,

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.770
with the same resources, with just me,

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.980
and the same access to
wood, and the same tools,

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.610
well that's gonna dramatically increase

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.120
my aggregate production.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.890
So one way to think
about it is this is our,

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.749
our level of technology has gone up,

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:28.430
which is an important
factor of production.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.120
So I like that one.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.630
Ten new farms are constructed.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.430
Well, if the farms are constructed,

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.810
and I will assume that they are used,

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:37.880
well we're going to have more output.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.660
They're gonna grow more things.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.580
Our level of capital has gone up.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.220
Once again, another important
factor of production.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.840
So I like that.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.820
Imports go up.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.850
Well imports are us taking advantage,

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.020
or using someone else's output.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.720
It doesn't say what it's
going to do to our output.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.780
So I will rule that out.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.250
And so this is quite intuitive.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.030
We've talked about factors of production,

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.160
like labor, and capital, and technology.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.280
And economists often tie this together,

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.960
taking these factors of production,

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.520
and showing how they lead
to our aggregate output

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.890
by using something known as

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.890
the Aggregate Production Function.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.140
Aggregate, Aggregate

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.973
Production,

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.630
Function.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.340
And it's a fancy set of words.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.060
And what I'm about to write
seems like fancy math,

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.980
but as we'll hopefully see,
it's reasonably intuitive.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.690
The Aggregate Production Function

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.800
is that our output is equal to A,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.890
which, you could use a
measure of our technology.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.350
It's often known as Total
Factor Productivity,

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.680
another fancy word,

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.970
times a function of,

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.190
that's why it's fancy, it's
using the function notation,

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.790
of our capital, and I know
capital does not start with K

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.560
in the English language, but
K for capital, and our labor.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.270
And this is all very abstract.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.910
If we wanted to make it a
little bit more tangible,

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.220
especially 'cause we just have
function notation in here,

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.600
we could say something like,

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.430
our aggregate output,
our aggregate production,

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.530
is equal to our Total Factor Productivity,

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.930
and then I'll make up a version of this.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.270
Let's say, times the
square root of our capital,

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.420
times the square root of our labor.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.010
But in general, and as
you see in this example,

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.000
you're going to see Aggregate
Production Functions

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.650
that look something like this.

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.960
The radicals, or the square
roots on capital and labor

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.590
might be a little bit different,

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.310
but they tell the same story,

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.420
that if you increase
your level of technology,

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.280
you're going to increase
your aggregate output.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.900
If you increase your capital,

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.680
you're going to increase
your aggregate output.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.030
And if you increase your labor,

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.790
you're going to increase
your aggregate output.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.770
The reason why you might see square roots,

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.890
or fractional exponents
on capital or labor

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.900
is this idea of diminishing
marginal returns.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.350
That first farm might really
add a lot to your output,

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.130
but maybe that millionth farm

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.700
might still add to your output,

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.220
but maybe at a less
level, at a lower level.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.720
Same thing, that first,
those first 10 people

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.560
might add a lot of output to your labor,

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.260
but after you already
have 100 million people,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.000
the next 10 will still add to
your output, but maybe less.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.660
At least that's what these
mathematical models are saying.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.210
So big picture, it's pretty intuitive

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.020
that if you hold everything else equal,

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.110
and if you increase the factors
of production, well then,

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.360
that would likely cause your
aggregate production to go up.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.900
But economists like to
describe things mathematically,

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.650
and that's what's going on in something

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.090
like an Aggregate Production Function.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.630
Now last but not least, a related idea

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.610
to an Aggregate Production Function

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.410
is this idea of productivity.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.000
Pro-duc-tivity.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.207
We already viewed A as
Total Factor Productivity,

00:05:43.207 --> 00:05:46.360
but it's really a measure of
the technology in an economy.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.530
Typically, when people talk
just about regular productivity,

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.280
they're talking about output
per capita, output per person.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.560
So really, what they're doing is,

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.190
they're thinking about
aggregate production, so Y,

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.670
and then they're dividing it by labor.

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.840
So then they would divide it by labor.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.570
So this would be output per person.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.660
And so you could imagine,
if technology improves,

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.160
holding labor constant,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.540
well then your output per
person is going to improve.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.250
If your capital goes up, which
would improve your output,

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.640
holding labor constant,

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.610
then once again, your
productivity would improve.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.953
Per person, you're able to
produce more in your economy.
