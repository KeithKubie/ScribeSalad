00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480
 If the question is: 

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:08.820
 How do we differentiate between the use of behavioral therapy / psychotherapy and drug therapy in depression? 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.900
 Well, first let's not underestimate the benefit of medical intervention (drug) 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.660
 Depression is catastrophic. He is responsible for very high suicide rates. 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:28.440
 It also exhausts people and their families and is therefore very destructive as physical 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.100
 Therefore, if you are in severe depression 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.820
 You can try antidepressants, you will know within a month if they benefit you 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.700
 If they help you maybe they will help you to not cut your life 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.500
 For example, we can say that you are depressed because your life is distracted 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.660
 Sometimes people are depressed even though their lives are only ... 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.920
 Not so good, because no one has a perfect life, everyone has his own suffering 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.400
 However, sometimes the lives of some people go as well as you might expect from anyone 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.160
 Have friends, have intimate relationships ... 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.900
 ... they have a job they love, they are competitive, able to work ... 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.580
 ... work hard in their business 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.260
 Do not fool themselves 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.520
 Yet they are terribly depressed! 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.700
 Sometimes antidepressants can fix it. So, Merry! 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.360
 In the end, you are a living being, if there is something that will help you become stronger 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.240
 To continue in life is great! 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.000
 Did you know ... they say "everyone is taking antidepressants" 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.800
 But in fact, no one takes these things without thinking 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:41.600
 Half the time I spend with my depressed clients usually takes two years to convince them to try antidepressants. 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.640
 Because they feel guilty about relying on external extortion to continue their lives, 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.940
 That is what they can not afford! 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.720
 But I say to them: "Well, if I had diabetes, would you refuse to take insulin?" 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.660
 You were under pressure and exploded from the weakest point 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.680
 This is what happens when you are under pressure, if there is something that can help you, 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.700
 Try it, God's right! You will know within a month! 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.360
 Or just stop if it does not work! 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.800
 To mention this, you want to analyze it in several ways 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.580
 do you have friends? 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.120
 Do you have an intimate relationship or are seeking one? 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.140
 Do you have a reasonable job? Have you received education suited to your level of intelligence? 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.260
 Do you have something useful to make it out of business? 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.300
 Do you have problems with drug or alcohol addiction? 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.940
 Are there other behavioral problems such as irregular sleep or eating, which is a problem? 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.660
 You want to differentiate all this and try to intervene to change behavior as much as possible 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.860
 But sometimes they deal with people whose lives are so shattered that they do not know where to start! 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.360
 They are different from those who regularly walk their lives 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.920
 "Well, try this, maybe you will not commit suicide next month!" 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.160
 Because if you die, it's hard to work with you! 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:58.560
 Therefore, medical intervention or other ... When you are sick, do anything that makes you improve. 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.380
 Leave your pride behind your back if necessary. 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.960
 All this has nothing to do with behavioral intervention. 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.240
 You want to face the problem by all available means. 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:17.240
 But some antidepressants, especially for people whose lives go well but are depressed, 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.280
 Antidepressants can make miracles! 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.580
 Therefore, when the medical evidence in your favor is not specified 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.680
 This is partly because the diagnosis of depression itself does not have a well-defined definition 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.400
 They are two very different things that a person's life is exhilarating and that the person is depressed! 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.540
 Antidepressants can not help much if a person's life is ominous. 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.720
 If ... yes!
