the term artificial is easy enough
 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.100
the term artificial is easy enough
meaning something man-made or unnatural

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110
meaning something man-made or unnatural

but how do we decide when a machine is

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479
but how do we decide when a machine is
 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.320
but how do we decide when a machine is
considered to be intelligent if we

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330
considered to be intelligent if we
 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.850
considered to be intelligent if we
consider human beings to be the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860
consider human beings to be the
 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.350

benchmark of what we think of as
 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.420
benchmark of what we think of as
intelligent then we'd say that AI is

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430
intelligent then we'd say that AI is
 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.810
