00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.370
 
 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.420
 
with our satellites today we can pick up

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:12.430
with our satellites today we can pick up
 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.920
with our satellites today we can pick up
radiation actually from the Big Bang

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:14.930
radiation actually from the Big Bang
 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.710
radiation actually from the Big Bang
itself a few hundred thousand years

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720
itself a few hundred thousand years
 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.140
itself a few hundred thousand years
after the Big Bang radiation was

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150
after the Big Bang radiation was
 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.510
after the Big Bang radiation was
released about the universe that is now

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520
released about the universe that is now
 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.120
released about the universe that is now
in the microwave range believe it or not

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130
in the microwave range believe it or not
 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.220
in the microwave range believe it or not
when he turned on the TV and you pick up

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230
when he turned on the TV and you pick up
 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.140
when he turned on the TV and you pick up
static when you turn on the radio and

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150
static when you turn on the radio and
 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.290
static when you turn on the radio and
you pick up static some of that static

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300
you pick up static some of that static
 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.890
you pick up static some of that static
comes from creation itself you can

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900
comes from creation itself you can
 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.950
comes from creation itself you can
actually listen to some degree to the

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960
actually listen to some degree to the
 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.320
actually listen to some degree to the
actual explosion that created the

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330
actual explosion that created the
 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.930
actual explosion that created the
universe however this explosion dates

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940
universe however this explosion dates
 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.610
universe however this explosion dates
from a few hundred thousand years after

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620
from a few hundred thousand years after
 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.430
from a few hundred thousand years after
the instant of creation we're not

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440
the instant of creation we're not
 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.830
the instant of creation we're not
satisfied we physicists want to go to

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840
satisfied we physicists want to go to
 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.680
satisfied we physicists want to go to
the instant of the Big Bang itself and

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690
the instant of the Big Bang itself and
 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.770
the instant of the Big Bang itself and
that's what the Hadron Collider will do

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780
that's what the Hadron Collider will do
 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.980
that's what the Hadron Collider will do
it'll recreate conditions not seen since

00:00:59.980 --> 00:00:59.990
it'll recreate conditions not seen since
 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.190
it'll recreate conditions not seen since
perhaps a trillionth of a second after

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200
perhaps a trillionth of a second after
 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.049
perhaps a trillionth of a second after
creation itself and we hope the Large

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059
creation itself and we hope the Large
 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.820
creation itself and we hope the Large
Hadron Collider will unlock some of the

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830
Hadron Collider will unlock some of the
 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.910
Hadron Collider will unlock some of the
deepest secrets of space and time matter

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920
deepest secrets of space and time matter
 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.980
deepest secrets of space and time matter
and energy

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990
 
 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.729
