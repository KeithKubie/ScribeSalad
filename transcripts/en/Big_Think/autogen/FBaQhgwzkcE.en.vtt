00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970
this state is that is there are no ego
 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.729
this state is that is there are no ego
boundaries so there would be a sense

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739
boundaries so there would be a sense
 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:13.930
boundaries so there would be a sense
that there's literally nothing between

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940
that there's literally nothing between
 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.779
that there's literally nothing between
us that we are in fact one being one

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789
us that we are in fact one being one
 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.360
us that we are in fact one being one
consciousness while at the same time and

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370
consciousness while at the same time and
 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.039
consciousness while at the same time and
in the same space recognizing and

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049
in the same space recognizing and
 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.810
in the same space recognizing and
appreciating the fact that we are

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820
appreciating the fact that we are
 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.240
appreciating the fact that we are
actually two different people and it's a

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250
actually two different people and it's a
 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.490
actually two different people and it's a
paradox and it's a contradiction but in

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500
paradox and it's a contradiction but in
 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.560
paradox and it's a contradiction but in
the experience we experience both at the

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570
the experience we experience both at the
 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.990
the experience we experience both at the
same time and and in the experience

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000
same time and and in the experience
 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.760
same time and and in the experience
there there isn't any contradiction it's

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770
there there isn't any contradiction it's
 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:34.870
there there isn't any contradiction it's
simply true that we are

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880
simply true that we are
 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.210
simply true that we are
absolutely one and the same time we are

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220
absolutely one and the same time we are
 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.610
absolutely one and the same time we are
different and this makes it possible for

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620
different and this makes it possible for
 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.610
different and this makes it possible for
us to to share a sense of intimacy and

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620
us to to share a sense of intimacy and
 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.930
us to to share a sense of intimacy and
communion and Trust and also creative

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940
communion and Trust and also creative
 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.730
communion and Trust and also creative
engagement that's absolutely impossible

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740
engagement that's absolutely impossible
 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.270
engagement that's absolutely impossible
in any other kind of circumstance
