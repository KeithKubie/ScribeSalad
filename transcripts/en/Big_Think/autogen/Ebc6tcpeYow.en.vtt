so it's this ironic thing that most of

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420
so it's this ironic thing that most of
 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.459
so it's this ironic thing that most of
the people that need to learn a language

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469
the people that need to learn a language
 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.039
the people that need to learn a language
are poor people that are doing it so

are poor people that are doing it so
 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.230

that they can get money but it requires

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240
that they can get money but it requires
 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.719
that they can get money but it requires
quite a bit of money to do so which is

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729
quite a bit of money to do so which is
 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.640
quite a bit of money to do so which is
why with duolingo we decided to make a

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650
why with duolingo we decided to make a
 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.230
why with duolingo we decided to make a
completely free way to learn a language

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240
completely free way to learn a language
 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.289
completely free way to learn a language
and that's that's the whole premise of

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299
and that's that's the whole premise of
 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.179
and that's that's the whole premise of
duolingo when we started we thought we

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189
duolingo when we started we thought we
 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.230
duolingo when we started we thought we
have to make a way to learn a language

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240
have to make a way to learn a language
 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.170
have to make a way to learn a language
but it has to be 100% free when when we

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180
but it has to be 100% free when when we
 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.520
but it has to be 100% free when when we
started to a lingual was not just me it

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530
started to a lingual was not just me it
 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.050
started to a lingual was not just me it
was me and my co-founder whose name is

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060
was me and my co-founder whose name is
 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.880
was me and my co-founder whose name is
Severin hacker who is very funny because

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890
Severin hacker who is very funny because
 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.100
Severin hacker who is very funny because
his last name is hacker when we started

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110
his last name is hacker when we started
 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.490
his last name is hacker when we started
we we knew we wanted to do a free way to

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500
we we knew we wanted to do a free way to
 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.560
we we knew we wanted to do a free way to
learn languages this is what we wanted

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570
learn languages this is what we wanted
 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.240
learn languages this is what we wanted
to do but I mean it's easy to say that

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250
to do but I mean it's easy to say that
 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.980
to do but I mean it's easy to say that
it's free the problem is when something

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990
it's free the problem is when something
 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.240
it's free the problem is when something
is free you got to find a way to finance

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250
is free you got to find a way to finance
 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.270
is free you got to find a way to finance
it and to make it sustainable so the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280
it and to make it sustainable so the
 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.980
it and to make it sustainable so the
question really became is how do we

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990
question really became is how do we
 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.429
question really became is how do we
teach languages for free but such that

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439
teach languages for free but such that
 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.800
teach languages for free but such that
we can actually finance the whole thing

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810
we can actually finance the whole thing
 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.190
we can actually finance the whole thing
the the solution to this came from many

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200
the the solution to this came from many
 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.380
the the solution to this came from many
of my previous projects have had this a

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390
of my previous projects have had this a
 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.389
of my previous projects have had this a
very similar idea and it's an idea that

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399
very similar idea and it's an idea that
 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.580
very similar idea and it's an idea that
can be traced back to an idea that I had

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590
can be traced back to an idea that I had
 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.800
can be traced back to an idea that I had
when I was a kid it was a terrible idea

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810
when I was a kid it was a terrible idea
 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.120
when I was a kid it was a terrible idea
but at the time I thought it was an

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
but at the time I thought it was an
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.770
but at the time I thought it was an
amazing idea and it was that I wanted to

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780
amazing idea and it was that I wanted to
 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.200
amazing idea and it was that I wanted to
have a gym where it was free to go to

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210
have a gym where it was free to go to
 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.800
have a gym where it was free to go to
the gym it was a free gym but all the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810
the gym it was a free gym but all the
 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.930
the gym it was a free gym but all the
exercise equipment was connected to the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940
exercise equipment was connected to the
 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.860
exercise equipment was connected to the
power grid and people when they went

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870
power grid and people when they went
 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.660
power grid and people when they went
there they would as they exercise they

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670
there they would as they exercise they
 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.130
there they would as they exercise they
would generate electricity that the gym

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140
would generate electricity that the gym
 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.960
would generate electricity that the gym
would sell to the power grid so that's

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970
would sell to the power grid so that's
 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.280
would sell to the power grid so that's
why it was free we wouldn't charge

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290
why it was free we wouldn't charge
 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.039
why it was free we wouldn't charge
people but we would make money by by

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049
people but we would make money by by
 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.470
people but we would make money by by
selling electricity to the to the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480
selling electricity to the to the
 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.509
selling electricity to the to the
electric company turns out this is a bad

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519
electric company turns out this is a bad
 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.039
electric company turns out this is a bad
idea because it turns out humans are

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049
idea because it turns out humans are
 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.119
idea because it turns out humans are
actually not very good at making

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129
actually not very good at making
 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.240
actually not very good at making
electricity but I thought it was a good

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250
electricity but I thought it was a good
 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.619
electricity but I thought it was a good
idea at the time also there's another

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629
idea at the time also there's another
 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:35.910
idea at the time also there's another
reason why it's a bad idea it turns out

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920
reason why it's a bad idea it turns out
 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.399
reason why it's a bad idea it turns out
with Jim Economics actually most of the

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409
with Jim Economics actually most of the
 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.819
with Jim Economics actually most of the
money is made from people not showing up

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829
money is made from people not showing up
 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.229
money is made from people not showing up
whereas in this case we really needed

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239
whereas in this case we really needed
 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.059
whereas in this case we really needed
people to show up because we needed to

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069
people to show up because we needed to
 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.160
people to show up because we needed to
generate the electricity but it's not a

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170
generate the electricity but it's not a
 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.569
generate the electricity but it's not a
good idea but it's a very similar idea

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579
good idea but it's a very similar idea
 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.880
good idea but it's a very similar idea
what we ended up doing with with

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890
what we ended up doing with with
 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.500
what we ended up doing with with
duolingo and what I have used in my

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510
duolingo and what I have used in my
 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.660
duolingo and what I have used in my
previous projects where the idea is can

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670
previous projects where the idea is can
 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.170
previous projects where the idea is can
we offer a service for free but as we're

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180
we offer a service for free but as we're
 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.210
we offer a service for free but as we're
offering it for free can we extract some

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220
offering it for free can we extract some
 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.339
offering it for free can we extract some
value out of people doing the thing

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349
value out of people doing the thing
 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.680
value out of people doing the thing
anyways so in the case of the Jim it was

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690
anyways so in the case of the Jim it was
 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.710
anyways so in the case of the Jim it was
extracting electricity the question is
