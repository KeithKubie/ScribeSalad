00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:07.680
France has this very distinct notion about
what it means to create an inclusionary society

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.679
that really comes out of the ideals of the
French Revolution, which is that anyone can

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.820
become French, but they need to accept that
what it means to be a French citizen is to

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.779
be kind of unencumbered in the public sphere.
And what could be a hindrance in the public

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.539
sphere includes things like loyalty to the
country from which you came if you're an immigrant,

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.140
loyalty to an ethno-religious group. So, that
means that a certain level of integration

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.789
can only be achieved if you are sort of looking
French, speaking French, seeming French like

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:44.699
everybody else in public. Now one of the things
I do try to argue in the book is that this

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:50.899
was always more rhetoric and myth at a certain
level than reality. Particularly during the

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:58.070
imperial period, France is sort of of necessity
a multi-ethnic empire, given how vast its

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.910
geographical reach is and how diverse it's
becoming already in the twenties and thirties.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.040
In the case of Jews, in particular, Jews have
been thought about as sort of by far the most

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.790
important ethno-religious minority in modern
French history, this kind of "test case" for

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.970
French democracy, this way of measuring how
inclusive France is at different historical moments.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.280
In the case of Muslims, Muslims have
largely been located outside of mainland France

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.509
in what's been written about Muslims in relation
to France, until thinking about them, you

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.780
know, toward the end of the twentieth century,
beginning of the twenty-first century. And

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.220
they've been thought about really as colonized
subjects, as resistors against colonialism,

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.969
rather than as people who lived in relatively
significant numbers already a series of different

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:50.180
kinds of lives in the mainland from the teens
and twenties onward. And, so, when we put

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.810
Jews and Muslims together we get some comparative
perspective, but we also see how their relationships

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.899
with various people in French society--particularly
with each other--were really mediated through

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.520
their understandings of what it meant to be
French, who was French, who was not French.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.090
For some Jews and Muslims there was a sense
of a religious proximity, because of the fact

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.730
that both faiths are Abrahamic, they share
certain rituals, they had certain common histories

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:22.020
in North Africa. For other Jews and Muslims,
being religious was--by definition almost--connected

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.060
to opposing loyalties in the context of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But there are

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.360
many contexts in which that only did not produce
tremendous mutual hostility.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.500
Consciousness of multi-ethnicity does not by definition
mean conflict, does not by definition mean

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.310
that Jews and Muslims will be unable to coexist.
What's taken place most recently in France

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.620
is not the only case of encounters between
Muslims and Jews in France that are happening

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.700
at this very moment. It's the one that's in
the headlines, it's the one that's violent,

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.760
and it troubles us, and it should trouble us.
But it's important to have a longer context

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.150
partly simply to realize that a sense of crisis,
a sense of deep questions about whether the

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.000
Republic can adapt, is not altogether new.
