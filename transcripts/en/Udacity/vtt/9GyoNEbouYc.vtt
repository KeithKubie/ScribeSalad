00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.980
So our current widget focuses on
one thing, today's weather, and

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.510
I'm kind of okay with that.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.310
However, there are certainly times when
quick access to the entire forecast

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:10.380
would be helpful.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.080
For that case,
we can build a collection widget.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.340
These widgets control full list, grid,
or stack of elements, perfect for

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.570
showing off the upcoming forecast.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.190
Good starting point for
this is a simple list view widget.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.810
The top banner can open Sunshine itself,
while below the list offers

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.940
direct access to the forecast
of each upcoming day.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.320
Clicking on one of these will
go directly to the detail

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.200
page for that day.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.590
So, I'll layout style and header click
behavior the same as our today widget.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.650
Filling in the data on our list
here is a different story.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.110
For that,
we'll use a remote view service.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.860
The remote view service is responsible
for creating a RemoteViewsFactory.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.600
Think of it as the equivalent to
a cursor adapter, that's specifically

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.610
designed for returning remote views,
suitable for widgets.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.560
Note the special permission,
BIND_REMOTEVIEWS.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.300
This is what let's the system
bind your service to

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.060
create your remote views for each row.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.900
To tell our remote views to
connect to our RemoteViewsFactory,

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.060
you'll use
the setRemoteViewsAdaptors method.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.650
This method kicks of
the RemoteViewsFactory's life cycle,

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.900
causing our data to reload and
remote views created for each row.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.527
To update our widget based on new data,
we can still use the same

00:01:25.527 --> 00:01:29.846
technique as our Today widget,
in receiving the data updated broadcast.

00:01:29.846 --> 00:01:34.115
But instead of calling an Intent Service
to update the whole widget,

00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:37.944
we can just call the
NotifyAppWidgetViewDataChanged method

00:01:37.944 --> 00:01:41.780
to trigger the onDataSetChanged
three queries for new data.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.560
So if that's all it takes to
get data into our widget, and

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.050
get out list populated,
we're done right?

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.731
In some cases, sure.

00:01:49.731 --> 00:01:52.436
But we're trying to make
this production ready.

00:01:52.436 --> 00:01:56.348
What we really want is to be able
to tap on a particular day and

00:01:56.348 --> 00:01:59.027
go directly to the details of that date.

00:01:59.027 --> 00:02:02.758
If your mind is already spinning on
where to add the set on click pending

00:02:02.758 --> 00:02:04.656
intent method to get this working,

00:02:04.656 --> 00:02:09.190
you'll be happy to know that there's
some tools which make this easier.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.240
The idea is that each element
shares some common template for

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.560
the click action.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.020
That means our app widget provider can
also call setPendingIntentTemplate

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.960
with the pending intent that
has all the common attributes.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.600
Say, what activity to start.

00:02:25.832 --> 00:02:30.290
Our RemoteViewsFactory get you at
method then handles the unique part for

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.950
each element calling set
on click fill in intent

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.935
to fill in our template appropriately.

00:02:35.935 --> 00:02:38.295
Now of course, for Sunshine,

00:02:38.295 --> 00:02:41.165
we have to consider how about tablet's,
which have the master and

00:02:41.165 --> 00:02:45.565
detail view together and phones, which
have them as separate activities, work.

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:47.925
That complicates things a bit here.

00:02:47.925 --> 00:02:49.505
Let's just see how it
all falls together.
