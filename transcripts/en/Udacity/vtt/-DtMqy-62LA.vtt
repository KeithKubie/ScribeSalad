00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.990
Of course, this was a bit of a simple inter quiz here. Yeah, probably that's not a good idea.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.770
Making anybody take this course is a very good idea, but of course, actually you're

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.640
the computer scientist so you're supposed to be the one knowing about NP completeness

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.390
especially after taken this course.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.180
You'll probably shouldn't say it's impossible.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.430
A better answer would be to say, "It's been proven to be impossible,"

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.070
but I think that after this unit, you will agree that the best possible answer is actually to say,

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.380
"Well, it's been proven difficult or extremely difficult," but we can actually try

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.100
to solve this problem even though it is NP complete and I will show you how to approach that.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.750
The thing is this--there's so many NP complete problems that are practically relevant

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.390
that over the past years extremely clever algorithms have been developed for these problems.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.810
They have been developed for vertex cover, for clique, for independent set,

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.380
for the shortest tour problem, for SAT, and so on.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.670
Knowing about these problems can really make you standout as a problem solver

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.070
because many people, as I said, will give up once they know their problem to be NP complete.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.870
You should respect NP completeness, so maybe not be all smiling when you encounter

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.650
NP complete problems, although it's nice to know that they are happy but I don't know.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.770
When they're solving their problem, be respectful but there's no need

00:01:16.770 --> 99:59:59.000
to be unhappy or scared of NP completeness.
