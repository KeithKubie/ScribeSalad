00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300
different faiths so Jesus says those who
 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.420
different faiths so Jesus says those who
are not against us are for us and so I

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430
are not against us are for us and so I
 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.220
are not against us are for us and so I
argue that if I see a Muslim walking

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230
argue that if I see a Muslim walking
 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.750
argue that if I see a Muslim walking
down the street and I don't know that

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760
down the street and I don't know that
 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.240
down the street and I don't know that
he's a Muslim or she's a Muslim and the

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250
he's a Muslim or she's a Muslim and the
 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.160
he's a Muslim or she's a Muslim and the
Muslim sees me as a Christian walking

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170
Muslim sees me as a Christian walking
 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.630
Muslim sees me as a Christian walking
down the street and does not know my

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640
down the street and does not know my
 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.110
down the street and does not know my
faith if we are truly practices of our

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120
faith if we are truly practices of our
 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.150
faith if we are truly practices of our
faith we won't be able to tell the

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160
faith we won't be able to tell the
 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.950
faith we won't be able to tell the
difference

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960
difference
 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.700
difference
and I would argue that for a number of

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710
and I would argue that for a number of
 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.600
and I would argue that for a number of
religions and so therefore I go back to

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610
religions and so therefore I go back to
 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.879
religions and so therefore I go back to
the initial answer you take the Bible

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889
the initial answer you take the Bible
 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.730
the initial answer you take the Bible
and all religions best with a little

and all religions best with a little
 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.550
and all religions best with a little
