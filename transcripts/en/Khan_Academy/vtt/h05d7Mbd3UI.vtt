00:00:00.023 --> 00:00:01.776
Voiceover: So where we had left off,

00:00:01.776 --> 00:00:04.000
Benjamin Franklin had pretty
much established himself

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.400
as a successful printer and, I guess,

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.472
content producer, writer if you will.

00:00:09.472 --> 00:00:10.584
Voiceover: Media mogul.

00:00:10.584 --> 00:00:12.248
Voiceover: Media mogul in Philadelphia.

00:00:12.248 --> 00:00:14.103
We're in the 1730s,
we're starting to enter

00:00:14.103 --> 00:00:15.839
the kind of the late 1730s now.

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.928
At what point does he
make the transition from,

00:00:17.928 --> 00:00:20.728
I guess, media mogul
to statesman or leader?

00:00:20.728 --> 00:00:22.937
Voiceover: Well it starts off when he was

00:00:22.937 --> 00:00:24.776
just a young assistant printer.

00:00:24.776 --> 00:00:27.312
When he was only 21,
he starts little club,

00:00:27.312 --> 00:00:28.936
sort of a civic club,

00:00:28.936 --> 00:00:31.033
almost like a Rotary or Kiwanis club,

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:33.608
for middle-class tradesmen and artisans

00:00:33.608 --> 00:00:35.657
and the shopkeepers of Philadelphia.

00:00:35.657 --> 00:00:37.585
He calls it the Leather Apron Club,

00:00:37.585 --> 00:00:39.569
sometimes known as the Junto.

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:41.983
The Leather Apron Club because it was not

00:00:41.983 --> 00:00:45.316
for the rich or elite or
he famous business owners,

00:00:45.316 --> 00:00:47.243
nor for the poor working man.

00:00:47.243 --> 00:00:48.859
It was for the people
who put on leather aprons

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:50.555
every morning and opened up a shop

00:00:50.555 --> 00:00:52.476
and stood there behind the counter.

00:00:52.476 --> 00:00:56.356
That Leather Apron Club
becomes a foundation,

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:58.406
as he becomes a successful businessman,

00:00:58.406 --> 00:01:00.742
for all of his civic endeavors.

00:01:00.742 --> 00:01:04.696
He was sort of, the club trained people

00:01:04.696 --> 00:01:07.462
in a way, to be civic leaders.

00:01:07.462 --> 00:01:10.180
They made a list of the virtues you needed

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.076
to have to be a good civic leader,

00:01:12.076 --> 00:01:15.092
such as industry and
honesty and frugality.

00:01:15.092 --> 00:01:17.996
Franklin was so geeky he put it on a chart

00:01:17.996 --> 00:01:20.837
and every week he would
mark how well he did

00:01:20.837 --> 00:01:22.605
on each of those virtues.

00:01:22.605 --> 00:01:25.220
At one point he had mastered
all 12 of the virtues.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.508
He showed it to the other
people in the Leather Apron Club

00:01:27.508 --> 00:01:28.520
and one of them said,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.136
"Hey Franklin, you're missing a virtue

00:01:30.136 --> 00:01:31.528
"you might want to try."

00:01:31.528 --> 00:01:32.928
Franklin says, "What's that?"

00:01:32.928 --> 00:01:35.447
and the friend says, "Humility,

00:01:35.447 --> 00:01:37.553
"you might want to try
that one for a change."

00:01:37.553 --> 00:01:39.092
Franklin said, "I was never very good

00:01:39.092 --> 00:01:40.296
"at the virtue of humility,

00:01:40.296 --> 00:01:42.208
"but I was good at the pretense of it.

00:01:42.208 --> 00:01:44.144
"I could fake it very well."

00:01:44.144 --> 00:01:46.353
Here is the important thing by Franklin.

00:01:46.353 --> 00:01:48.529
This is what he writes, he says,

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:50.727
"I learned that the pretense of humility

00:01:50.727 --> 00:01:53.551
"was just as useful as the reality of it

00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:57.297
"because it made you listen
to the person next to you,

00:01:57.297 --> 00:01:59.384
"try to find the common ground,

00:01:59.384 --> 00:02:02.744
"and that was the essence of
the middle-class democracy

00:02:02.744 --> 00:02:04.557
"we were trying to create."

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:08.095
Voiceover: Fascinating. So
how does this gravitate into,

00:02:08.095 --> 00:02:09.563
I mean I'm sure they're meeting,

00:02:09.563 --> 00:02:11.221
they're making lists of traits

00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:14.098
Voiceover: Yeah, sort of
every Friday they meet,

00:02:14.098 --> 00:02:17.162
and besides making traits
they make a list of things

00:02:17.162 --> 00:02:18.954
that can improve the community

00:02:18.954 --> 00:02:20.579
until they come up with plans.

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.644
There's the first library, the first,

00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:25.724
sort of, lending library of Philadelphia.

00:02:25.724 --> 00:02:28.491
I think that was like in 1731.

00:02:28.491 --> 00:02:30.642
He does a lending library.

00:02:30.642 --> 00:02:32.667
That's even before the
first Poor Richard's.

00:02:32.667 --> 00:02:34.386
So that was the first thing they'd do,

00:02:34.386 --> 00:02:36.946
because he believed that
the young tradesmen,

00:02:36.946 --> 00:02:39.523
the rich people had their
own private libraries,

00:02:39.523 --> 00:02:43.044
but there should be a free library,

00:02:43.044 --> 00:02:45.011
one that people could borrow the books.

00:02:45.011 --> 00:02:47.164
Then they'd do a street sweeping corps

00:02:47.164 --> 00:02:48.691
and they'd do a militia.

00:02:48.691 --> 00:02:51.266
They'd do an academy for
the education of youth

00:02:51.266 --> 00:02:53.627
that becomes the
University of Pennsylvania.

00:02:53.627 --> 00:02:57.595
They'd do an insurance company
for widows and orphans.

00:02:57.595 --> 00:03:00.485
You know his mother is somewhat baffled

00:03:00.485 --> 00:03:02.690
because she's an old-fashioned
Puritan and says,

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.714
"You can only get to heaven
through God's grace alone,

00:03:05.714 --> 00:03:06.948
"not through good works."

00:03:06.948 --> 00:03:10.263
and Franklin says, "Well I'd
rather have it said of me

00:03:10.263 --> 00:03:13.569
"that he lived usefully
than that he died rich,

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.928
"and I believe that the
best way to be in favor

00:03:15.928 --> 00:03:18.006
"of the good Lord is to do things

00:03:18.006 --> 00:03:20.759
"for all of his fellow
creatures that he created."

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:22.935
So that was Franklin's credo,

00:03:22.935 --> 00:03:25.207
which is "Lets do good civic works,"

00:03:25.207 --> 00:03:27.568
they created a hospital even,

00:03:27.568 --> 00:03:29.815
"in order to help our fellow man,

00:03:29.815 --> 00:03:32.759
because that's what the
good Lord wanted us to do."

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:35.227
Voiceover: Fascinating.
