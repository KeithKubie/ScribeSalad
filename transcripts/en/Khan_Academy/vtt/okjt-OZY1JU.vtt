00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:03.259
Voiceover: It took 20
minutes before Jughead

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:06.114
noticed that his hot
tub had sprung a leak.

00:00:06.147 --> 00:00:09.566
Once he realized it, he
opened the hot tub's drain

00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:12.511
and the rest of the water
rushed out in 40 minutes.

00:00:12.924 --> 00:00:15.631
The rate at which the water
drained from the hot tub

00:00:15.631 --> 00:00:18.602
in gallons per minute is shown.

00:00:18.897 --> 00:00:21.867
How many gallons of
water were in the hot tub

00:00:21.867 --> 00:00:24.408
before it started to leak?

00:00:25.115 --> 00:00:26.880
So let's see what they have over here.

00:00:26.897 --> 00:00:29.480
So they've plotted gallons per minute

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.902
versus time in minutes.

00:00:32.251 --> 00:00:34.240
So we see here, this blue line,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.408
this is the rate at which
water drained from the hot tub.

00:00:39.422 --> 00:00:41.797
So at minute zero, the
water wasn't really draining

00:00:41.797 --> 00:00:45.164
from the hot tub and then
not just more drained

00:00:45.164 --> 00:00:48.623
but the rate at which the
water was draining increased.

00:00:48.826 --> 00:00:53.766
So 10 minutes into his
bath, the water was draining

00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:57.186
at a gallon per minute and
then 20 minutes into his bath

00:00:57.186 --> 00:01:01.080
water was draining at
two gallons per minute.

00:01:01.443 --> 00:01:03.974
Then he noticed it and he opens the drain.

00:01:04.014 --> 00:01:06.249
I guess he wants to accelerate
the end of his bath.

00:01:06.491 --> 00:01:08.244
So he opens the drain
and then all of a sudden

00:01:08.244 --> 00:01:10.503
water starts draining out
at a much higher rate,

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:13.808
at 20 gallons per minute,
but then that decreases.

00:01:14.068 --> 00:01:17.171
So we could think about physically
why that might decrease.

00:01:17.171 --> 00:01:20.527
Maybe there was just less
pressure or whatever.

00:01:20.527 --> 00:01:22.056
We're not going to go
into the physics of it,

00:01:22.056 --> 00:01:24.311
but we're just going to
take this chart as fact.

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.933
The rate at which the
water drains decreases

00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.822
all the way to the 60th minute,

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:31.499
which is 40 minutes after
he opened the drain.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.636
At the 60th minute, all of the water

00:01:33.636 --> 00:01:36.925
was actually drained out.

00:01:37.506 --> 00:01:39.036
So given that, how do we think about

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:41.699
how many gallons of
water were in the hot tub

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:43.313
before it started to leak?

00:01:43.483 --> 00:01:45.018
And I encourage you to pause the video

00:01:45.018 --> 00:01:46.990
and try to see if you could
figure it out yourself

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.776
before I work through it.

00:01:49.414 --> 00:01:50.779
Well, to answer this question:

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:52.417
How many gallons of
water were in the hot tub

00:01:52.417 --> 00:01:54.010
before it started to leak?

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.547
That is answering the same question as

00:01:55.547 --> 00:01:58.098
How much total hot water drained out?

00:01:58.842 --> 00:02:07.150
So how much drained out?

00:02:07.686 --> 00:02:09.615
And to think about that,
we can just kind of go back

00:02:09.615 --> 00:02:12.947
to what we knew before we
learned about calculus.

00:02:13.563 --> 00:02:16.048
If I have something
happening at a fixed rate,

00:02:16.048 --> 00:02:18.677
so let's say that this
is gallons per minute.

00:02:19.251 --> 00:02:23.544
So this is still the same
context, I guess you could say.

00:02:23.544 --> 00:02:24.984
This is time in minutes.

00:02:24.984 --> 00:02:28.154
Let's say things are draining
out at a constant rate.

00:02:28.817 --> 00:02:30.815
If you wanted to figure
out how much drains out

00:02:30.815 --> 00:02:32.468
over a certain interval of time,

00:02:32.468 --> 00:02:34.682
let's say this interval
of time right over here,

00:02:34.682 --> 00:02:37.771
let's call that delta t,

00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:44.674
you would just multiply the
rate over that interval of time,

00:02:45.597 --> 00:02:48.927
which we could represent by

00:02:48.927 --> 00:02:51.644
this orange height right over here,

00:02:51.644 --> 00:02:55.011
times the amount of time that passed by,

00:02:55.011 --> 00:02:57.875
which would give you the area

00:02:57.875 --> 00:03:00.425
under the curve over that interval.

00:03:00.425 --> 00:03:02.616
the area under the curve
over that interval.

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:05.672
This area would tell you the gallons

00:03:05.672 --> 00:03:08.815
that drained over that delta t.

00:03:09.327 --> 00:03:13.487
And this doesn't just apply
when you have a constant rate.

00:03:13.971 --> 00:03:16.145
If your rate looked something like this,

00:03:16.145 --> 00:03:20.043
as we've seen in other videos,

00:03:20.043 --> 00:03:27.162
you could figure out the
amount that has drained

00:03:27.162 --> 00:03:28.547
in a specific interval, let's say

00:03:28.547 --> 00:03:30.258
this interval right over here,

00:03:30.258 --> 00:03:33.990
by essentially figuring out
the area under the curve

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.485
over that interval,
and the units work out.

00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:43.101
If you multiply gallons
per minute times minute,

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:52.422
this area is going to
be in terms of gallons.

00:03:52.422 --> 00:03:53.902
Another way you could think about it,

00:03:53.902 --> 00:03:55.465
and this goes back to,
well, how do you figure out

00:03:55.465 --> 00:03:57.581
the area of a trapezoid right over here.

00:03:57.581 --> 00:03:58.751
Well, the area of a trapezoid,

00:03:58.751 --> 00:04:01.835
you could find the average
height of the trapezoid,

00:04:01.835 --> 00:04:02.941
which would be the average

00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:05.543
of the beginning and the end period,

00:04:05.543 --> 00:04:07.712
you take that average over there,

00:04:07.712 --> 00:04:10.278
and this would work for a line like this,

00:04:10.278 --> 00:04:11.527
if you take that average height

00:04:11.527 --> 00:04:16.675
and multiply by the change in time,

00:04:16.675 --> 00:04:21.489
you are going to figure out that area.

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.842
And that is another way
of thinking about it.

00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:26.464
You are taking the average
rate over that interval

00:04:26.464 --> 00:04:28.967
times the interval, and
that is going to give you

00:04:28.967 --> 00:04:30.518
the total number of gallons.

00:04:30.558 --> 00:04:32.385
And so we just have to
apply that idea over here.

00:04:32.385 --> 00:04:33.915
We just have to literally figure out

00:04:33.915 --> 00:04:36.023
the area under the curve
over the entire interval

00:04:36.023 --> 00:04:38.418
when the water was actually
leaking or draining.

00:04:38.477 --> 00:04:40.034
So essentially the area under the curve

00:04:40.034 --> 00:04:42.134
between zero minutes and 60 minutes.

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:48.680
And so it is going to be this area plus

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.633
all of this area under this part as well.

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:56.023
To help us think about that,

00:04:56.023 --> 00:04:58.110
I'm going to just split
that up into some sections.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.624
So I'll have this
triangular section up here.

00:05:02.798 --> 00:05:04.365
I could just think about
this as a trapezoid,

00:05:04.365 --> 00:05:05.615
but I'm just going to split it up

00:05:05.615 --> 00:05:07.185
into a triangle and a rectangle.

00:05:07.622 --> 00:05:12.683
And then I have this section
right over here in green.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.778
So what is the area of this entire thing?

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:17.306
Well, the area right over here,

00:05:17.306 --> 00:05:33.771
we have 20 minutes times two
gallons per minute times 1/2.

00:05:33.771 --> 00:05:35.878
This gives us the area
under this triangle.

00:05:35.878 --> 00:05:42.852
So that's going to be 20 gallons.

00:05:42.852 --> 00:05:45.355
We see that the units work out nicely.

00:05:46.181 --> 00:05:48.214
So that is essentially
how much has drained out

00:05:48.214 --> 00:05:49.882
in the first 20 minutes.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:55.404
And then this green area
is going to be 40 minutes

00:05:55.404 --> 00:06:00.605
times 10 gallons per minute.

00:06:00.605 --> 00:06:01.728
And actually maybe you know the units,

00:06:01.728 --> 00:06:03.299
since I'm breaking it
up in this strange way,

00:06:03.299 --> 00:06:06.541
I'll just figure out this
area in a unit-less way.

00:06:06.541 --> 00:06:10.573
So 40 times 10, which is equal to 400.

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:15.033
And then, finally, in blue,
I have 40 times this height

00:06:15.033 --> 00:06:18.354
right over here between
10 and 20 is another 10

00:06:18.354 --> 00:06:20.315
but then I'm going to
multiply that times 1/2.

00:06:20.315 --> 00:06:24.185
So it's going to be 40 times 10 times 1/2,

00:06:24.185 --> 00:06:26.877
which is going to be 200.

00:06:26.903 --> 00:06:30.326
And so when you add all
of these areas together,

00:06:30.357 --> 00:06:33.575
you are going to get 400
plus 200 is 600 plus 20.

00:06:33.761 --> 00:06:35.887
You are going to have 620 gallons.

00:06:36.473 --> 00:06:43.802
620 gallons is how much
water in total drained out

00:06:43.802 --> 00:06:47.763
or how much water was in the
tub before it started to leak,

00:06:47.763 --> 00:06:50.289
or the hot tub, yeah this is
quite big for a regular tub,

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:53.038
bu this could be like a Jacuzzi
or a hot tub or something.
