1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.390
Yeah.
It looked like you tension and fucking Floyd was fixed.

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.430
What do you think is real?
100% Oh Joe,
you want to watch again?
Should we can,

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.910
why do you think it was fixed at you?
Come on.
Do you watch it?
Yeah,

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.570
I just think of some bullshit.
No,
it was a,
a guy who's legitimate,

5
00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:17.990
hundred and 55 pound man who is fighting.

6
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.510
You see techy crying and rolling around on the ground due to fights at one 26 it

7
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.960
doesn't make any sense.
Never had a professional boxing match.

8
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.770
How crazy is this fighting against the greatest boxer?

9
00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:32.480
Listening to what you're saying.
So small and fixed intentions.

10
00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:36.120
They're fucking poster boy.
Yeah.
And they're like,
yeah,
here's Floyd Mayweather,

11
00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:37.740
dude.
I don't think they thought he was going to knock them out.

12
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.850
Really tensions a beast,
man.
I mean easily seen them,
but when it comes to,
I have,

13
00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:43.750
but when it comes to boxing,
I understand that.

14
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.770
But they were really thinking he could hit him.

15
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.340
This was the thought was that tension is really a striking genius.

16
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.890
Have you never seen him?
So it's Conor McGregor.
Well,
but no,
no,

17
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.790
but it's different.
Tension is faster.
It's smaller.

18
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.160
I mean he moves like a lightning bolt and in Japan,
the,

19
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.330
the fact that this kid's only like 18 or 19 years old,

20
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.310
crazy and been fucking people up,

21
00:01:05.311 --> 00:01:07.740
including knocking out world boy Thai champions.

22
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.280
So they threw him to the wolves real early on.
Okay,

23
00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:14.400
let's watch this and tell me,
tell me why you think this is fake.

24
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.130
I see a dude who is so much smaller than Floyd.

25
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:21.840
Look how little he is way smaller.
He's way smaller.

26
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.580
Floyd is not even mess around.
He's not remotely nervous.

27
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.260
This kid is,
uh,
I mean,

28
00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:32.140
I remember if he was deployed laughing no matter he'd even do this to Connor,

29
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.980
but this a cookbook.
Of course Connor can knock him out this Katana,

30
00:01:35.981 --> 00:01:38.010
check him out.
He's supposed to be the next big thing too.

31
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:42.150
He's a great kick boxer,
but he's not kickboxing.
He's boxing.

32
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.480
You're not gonna out box Floyd Mayweather when you've never had a professional

33
00:01:45.481 --> 00:01:49.410
boxing match.
At least I don't think he has.
He's had a lot of kickboxing though.

34
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.780
And in kickboxing he's fucking amazing.

35
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.170
But he's also amazing against guys that are 126 pounds,

36
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.430
so 18 to look how small he is compared to Floyd.
Floyd is tiny and Floyd.

37
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:03.000
Look how easily Floyd blocks those punches and he's not feeling any danger,

38
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:05.970
so he's just ties to put it on this kid.
He's walking him down.

39
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.610
He's walking him down looking for an opening.
This is the first round.

40
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.610
Just weights.
Boom.
He cracks him.
Why would you ask him that?

41
00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:18.450
He just got was a crack.
You don't think back it up.
Bag of that shit up.

42
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.240
Jack it up.
Let's watch it again dude.
He cracked him.

43
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.900
Watch this right there.
Here it goes.
Let it roll from here.

44
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.830
You get some in his corner.
He hit him with a left hook to the temple.

45
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.370
You don't see that left hook to the temple.
Watch one or time pink right there.

46
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.210
Thank you.

47
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.500
He fucking cracked a dude who's a legit 30 pounds lighter than him here on the

48
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:42.470
temple and drop to how you watched the crack.
You just watched it to doubt.

49
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.400
It's a,
that is a fear flying back.
That is a full on left took.

50
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.370
First of all,
there was a stumble in there as well,
but he hit him,

51
00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:54.570
see the stumble after he got robbed.
That's a tough one.
No,
I don't see that.

52
00:02:54.571 --> 00:02:57.750
It's not tough at all.
The kid gets up,
he got wobbled,

53
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.190
they give him a standing count.
He looks nervous as fuck.
He looks over,

54
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.060
they see sticking to the smash.

55
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.240
Your fucking crazy and now Floyd moves in and the kids even trying to fire back.

56
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.010
He's just not good enough.
Man.

57
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.160
Floyd standard right in front of him with his fucking hands up.

58
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.740
The kid's got no chance.
He's much smaller.

59
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.550
No experience against the guy as good as Floyd and Floyd's walking him down with

60
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:24.610
his head.
This is real,
man.
This is real.
That kid's trying to hurt him.

61
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.410
He just can't do it.
He's fighting the best ever and then boom,
Cod Zion was,

62
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.290
that was real,
that fuck.
All of it's really the first one.

63
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:34.390
They look you as you should know.

64
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:37.240
We've all seen guys get hit with shit that didn't look like much and they go

65
00:03:37.241 --> 00:03:38.470
down.
We've all seen it.

66
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.890
We've all seen guys get touched on the Chin and they fall down.

67
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.070
Let you don't Floyd,
look at this.

68
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.940
Do you remember Travis Luder versus Marvin Eastman?
You remember that?

69
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.640
A lot of people said that was fixed.
They like,
that's fake.

70
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.320
No one gets hit with a punch like that.
No,
no.

71
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.930
Sometimes you come into a fight compromised.
Look,

72
00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.280
this is 100% legit one,
two right on the fucking head,

73
00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:03.700
and he falls down.
Dude,
this is 100% legit fight.

74
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.950
This kid got fucked up by the best boxer of all chassis.
They might say 126 tiny.

75
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.280
None of this made any sense in the first place,
but narrow sense,

76
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.010
but you gotta admit that's a real fight.
Delek pretty legit.
Like it's real.

77
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.800
That's a real God.
That first one,
that first one is questionable.

78
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:19.540
The next two were great.
It was a questionable lump.

79
00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:23.020
Just same for the [inaudible].
For my first one,
it looked questionable to me.

80
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.810
If you watch the whole thing play out in slow motion,

81
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.960
what happens is you see a left hook and then you see a stumble and Floyd moves

82
00:04:31.661 --> 00:04:34.000
in and their legs tangled up a little bit,

83
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.450
and then Floyd hits him with a right hand when he's on his way down.
Floyd,

84
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:38.380
fuck that dude.
Up.
