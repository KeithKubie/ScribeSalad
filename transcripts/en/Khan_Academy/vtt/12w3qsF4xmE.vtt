00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.750
We're asked: Do the points
on the graph

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.470
below represent a function?

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.020
Now, before even attempting to
do this problem, let's just

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.190
remind ourselves what they
mean by a function.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.490
A function literally just takes
some input, and it's

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.980
usually considered x,
some number x, but

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.010
it takes some input.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.530
Let me do it in a
darker color.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.450
So it takes some input, let's
call it x, and then it does

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.080
something on it or it maps
it to another value.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.990
So you take your function, your
function takes x as an

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.440
input and then it outputs a
unique value or it says I

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.660
don't know what to do with x.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.500
If it outputs a unique value,
that value is f of x.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.680
Or another way to think about
it, maybe we could say that

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.440
value is y, and you could
say that y is equal to

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.180
a function of x.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.820
You give me an x and then the
function does what it needs to

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.150
do on the x and then
it outputs a y.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.730
Either way to visualize it.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.290
This function either has to say
let me give you a y and

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.660
one unique y, or it'll
say I'm undefined.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.129
I don't know what to
do with that x.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.860
A function cannot give you two
different y's for the same x.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.130
That would just make it hard to
specify what to map x to.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.950
So when they ask us do the
points on the graph below

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.370
represent a function, we just
really have to make sure that

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.470
for every x-value, there's only
one y-value that it is

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.290
being mapped to, or for any
x-value, that it's undefined.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.370
For example, at 6, they have not
defined-- and let me label

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.260
the axes just to be careful.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.710
This is the x-axis.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.170
This is the y or the y is
equal to f of x axis.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.270
So if you tried to put
6 into this proposed

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.470
function, it's undefined.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.720
They haven't told us what
y would be equal here.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.410
That's completely cool.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.520
Over here, if you put negative
1 in this proposed function,

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.250
it produces 3.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.150
That's cool.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.790
So far, this looks like it could
represent a function.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.090
If it did, just based on this
point, you would say that f of

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.380
negative 1, because the input is
negative 1, is equal to 3.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.750
Cool so far.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.040
Now, when x is equal to 2-- so
for our proposed function,

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.450
when you input a 2, it will
output a negative 2.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.960
Seems reasonable so far.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.590
You input a 3, it'll
output a 2.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.150
Still reasonable.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.540
Now, when x is equal to 4, if we
want this to be a function,

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.095
what this graph is implying is
if you input x is equal to 4,

00:02:31.095 --> 00:02:33.840
that the value of the function,
or the proposed

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.890
function, is both negative
1 and 5.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.660
So this is saying that if you
take 4 into our function, into

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.440
our proposed function-- we
can't really call it a

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.890
function yet.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.720
We're trying to see if we
can call it a function.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.930
So if you put into our proposed
function that it

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.400
could get to negative 1 and/or
it could get to 5, this is

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.230
just not allowed.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.610
It is mapping the value
4 to two values.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.190
That is not allowed
for a function.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.470
A function has to map from a
value to only one other value.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.890
So the points on the graph
below do not represent a

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.090
function, so I'll
just write a no.
