00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.850
A line goes through
the following points,

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.890
and the equation of that line
is written in y equals mx plus b

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:07.390
form.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.890
Also known as
slope-intercept form.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.880
What is the equation
of the line?

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.630
So the first thing we
want to think about,

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.990
what is the slope of this line?

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.530
What is m here?

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.020
So what is our change in
y for given change in x?

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.915
So this is an
interesting example here.

00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:24.540
And I encourage you to pause the
video and try it out yourself.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.150
Because no matter how much we
change x, y is not changing.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.350
y is a constant, 2.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.476
So your change in y between any
two points is going to be 0.

00:00:33.476 --> 00:00:35.100
It doesn't matter
what your change in x

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.690
is, your change in x could be
1, your change in x could be 4,

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.740
your change in y is always 0.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.690
So y is not changing
as you change x.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.660
So your slope for this
relationship is actually 0.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.700
Y is equal to 0x
plus-- and then, you

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.740
could just realize that
the equation of this

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.030
is just that y is
always equal to 2.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.730
So it's 0x plus 2, which is the
same thing as y is equal to 2.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.120
You could substitute back in.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.130
You could say OK, well, if
y is equal to 0x plus b,

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.100
that means that y is equal to b.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.000
Well, y is always equal to 2,
no matter what thing you pick,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.660
so b is equal to 2.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.400
So either way, this
just boils down to y

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.340
is equal to 0x plus 2,
or y is just equal to 2.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.980
Let's do another one of these.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.890
Maybe one where the y
is actually changing.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.180
So here, the y is clearly
actually changing.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.745
So let me copy and paste this.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.440
I want to put on my scratch pad.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.340
We can work it out.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.400
So we'll stick it
right over here.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.460
And then we are told a line
goes through the-- OK, so

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.004
same thing.

00:01:51.004 --> 00:01:52.420
The line goes
through these points

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.984
with the equation of a line.

00:01:53.984 --> 00:01:55.400
So the main idea
here is, you only

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.360
need 2 points for
an equation of line.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.110
They've given us
more than necessary.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.000
So I'd like to pick
the two points that

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.080
make things a
little bit simpler.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.179
So I'll pick the
point 4, 2 and 7, 0.

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.970
I just picked those
two points because they

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.970
have nice, clean numbers
associated with it.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.310
So what is our change in x here?

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.950
So our change in x here, if we
go from 4 to 7, our change in x

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:19.575
is equal to 3.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.510
And what's our change in y here?

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.620
So we went up from 4 to 7.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.100
We increased by 3.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.470
Our y decreased by 2.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.800
Change in y is
equal to negative 2.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.580
So our slope, which is equal to
change in y over change in x,

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.851
is equal to negative 2/3.

00:02:40.851 --> 00:02:42.850
And if you wanted to
relate that to the formulas

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.260
that you normally
see for slope, you're

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.551
just looking at your end point.

00:02:45.551 --> 00:02:49.370
So this is y2 minus
y1, which is negative 2

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.780
over x2 minus x1,
which is 7 minus 4.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.520
But that just boils
down to negative 2/3.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.540
And so our equation is going
to be y is equal to negative

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.920
2/3 x plus b.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.210
So let's substitute one
of these points in here,

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.630
to figure out what
our b must be.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.030
And once again, I
want to figure out

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.900
something where this is going
to become nice and clean.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.520
But this isn't going to
be really clean for any

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.240
of these numbers
right over here.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.022
If we had a 3 for x, or a
6 for x, or a 0 for x, then

00:03:23.022 --> 00:03:24.230
things would work out nicely.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.460
But they don't give
us any of those.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.510
So let's just try
the 7 and the 0.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.450
So when x is equal to 0--
sorry, when x is equal to 7-- y

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.000
is equal to 0.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.130
So when x is equal to 7, I'll
just do it in the same color,

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.070
y is equal to 0.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:47.360
So 0 is equal to negative
2/3 times 7 plus b, or 0

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.590
is equal to negative
14/3 plus b.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.790
Add 14/3 to both sides,
you get 14/3 is equal to b.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.930
So this is going to be
y is equal to negative--

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.670
I'm going to go back
to the other screen--

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.690
so y is equal to
negative 2/3 x plus 14/3.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:09.850
So let me do that.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:19.170
So y is equal to
negative 2/3 x plus 14/3.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.530
Let's check our answer.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.500
We got it right.
