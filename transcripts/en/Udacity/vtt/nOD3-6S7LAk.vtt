00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.100
I'm going to change the world just a little bit Michael. Okay,

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.200
that last one was really easy, and it was easy for

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.980
a bunch of reasons, but one of the reasons it was

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.960
easy is that every time it took an action it did

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.700
exactly what you expected it to do. Now I want to introduce

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.580
a little bit of uncertainty, or stochasticity into the world. So,

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.680
let me tell you exactly what that means. When you execute

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.830
an action, it executes correctly, with probability of 0.8. So 80% of

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.350
the time, if you go up, it goes up. Assuming you can go up. If it goes, if you

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.390
say down, it goes down, assuming you can. Left,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.684
it goes left; right, it goes right. Got it? Yeah!

00:00:34.684 --> 00:00:39.580
&gt;&gt; Now, 20% of the time, the action you take actually causes you to

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.560
move at a right angle. Now, of course, there are two different right angles you

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.500
could go to, if you go up, you could go either left or right at

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.230
a right angle. And so that 20%

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.660
gets distributed uniformally. Okay? Does that make sense?

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.610
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so. And so if you, if you're in the start state and you try

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.730
to go up, then there a 10% chance that you tend to bump into the wall.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.430
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.524
&gt;&gt; And then you just stay where you are I guess.

00:01:06.524 --> 00:01:08.871
&gt;&gt; Right. So if you, if you decide that you'd have x

00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:11.575
here, you have a 80% chance of moving up, you have a 10%

00:01:11.575 --> 00:01:14.251
chance of moving to the right. And you have a 10% chance

00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:16.901
of moving to the left but, of course, you'd bump a wall and

00:01:16.901 --> 00:01:21.420
you would end up right back where you started. Got it?

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.640
&gt;&gt; Okay, good.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.630
&gt;&gt; So, here is my quiz question for you Michael. You recall, we came up

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.160
with two sequences and the one that I decided to keep was up, up, right, right,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.360
right. My question to you, is, what is the reliability of the sequence, up up,

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.480
right right, actually getting you from the start

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.420
to the goal, given these probabilities, this uncertainty?

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.960
&gt;&gt; And so,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.850
we're just going to try that sequence, and ask whether

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.220
or not it actually got us to the goal.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.170
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And when I say, reliability, I really

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.780
mean, what's the probability of it actually succeeding? Interesting. Okay.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.710
&gt;&gt; Alright. So let's see if we can figure out the answer. You're ready?

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.790
&gt;&gt; I'm ready.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.070
&gt;&gt; Alright. Go!
