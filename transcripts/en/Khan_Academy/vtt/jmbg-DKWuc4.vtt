00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.820
Let's see if we can
factor the expression

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.920
45x squared minus 125.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.560
So whenever I see
something like this--

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.590
I have a second-degree
term here,

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.274
I have a subtraction
sign-- my temptation

00:00:17.274 --> 00:00:19.190
is to look at this as a
difference of squares.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.815
We've already seen
this multiple times.

00:00:20.815 --> 00:00:24.850
We've already seen that if
we have something of the form

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.290
a squared minus b squared, that
this can be factored as a plus

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.170
b times a minus b.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.330
So let's look over here.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.250
Well, over here,
it's not obvious

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.630
that this right over
here is a perfect square.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.110
Neither is it obvious
that this right over here

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.950
is a perfect square.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.324
So it's not clear
to me that this

00:00:44.324 --> 00:00:46.080
is a difference of squares.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.240
But what is interesting
is that both 45 and 125

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.210
have some factors in common.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.650
And the one that
jumps out at me is 5.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.220
So let's see if we can factor
out a 5, and by doing that,

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.511
whether we can get something
that's a little bit closer

00:00:59.511 --> 00:01:01.150
to this pattern right over here.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.870
So if we factor out a 5,
this becomes 5 times-- well,

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.320
45x squared divided by 5
is going to be 9x squared.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.570
And then 125 divided by 5 is 25.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.980
Now, this is interesting.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.580
9x squared-- that's
a perfect square.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.490
If we call this a
squared, then that

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.100
tells us that a
would be equal to 3x.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.630
3x-- the whole thing
squared is 9x squared.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.660
Similarly-- I can never say
similarly correctly-- 25

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.290
is clearly just 5 squared.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.380
So in this case, if we're
looking at this template,

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.270
b would be equal to 5.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.160
So now this is a
difference of squares,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.340
and we can factor it completely.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.850
So we can't forget our 5 out
front that we factored out.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.535
So it's going to be
5 times a plus b.

00:01:56.535 --> 00:01:57.410
So let me write this.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.610
So it's going to be 5 times
a plus b times a minus b.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.180
So let me write the b's
down, plus b and minus b.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.920
And we're done.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.100
5 times 3x plus 5
times 3x minus 5

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.200
is 45x squared minus
125 factored out.
