00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:03.423
Great.

2
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.220
<v 1>You're listening to radio,</v>

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.780
the podcast from New York public radio and public radio, several

4
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.470
U. C. N. N. P. R. Hello, I'm Jad Abumrad hand.

5
00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:20.280
I'm Robert Krulwich and this is not the regular radio lab new.

6
00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:24.360
Now this is radio lab. The podcast meaning you'd like to explain? Yes,

7
00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:27.770
it's radio lab, even between our regular season shows.

8
00:00:27.771 --> 00:00:31.140
So this is going to be a little shorter probably than the regular shows and a

9
00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:34.080
little less produced, but a lot of fun because it's birthday time.

10
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.940
I'm Hanna to say happy birthday of course to Charles.

11
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.900
Do I want to chuck down when is sometimes like that more air Charles Darwin

12
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.720
Brown. Just be quiet and listen to me for just a second.

13
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.160
I want to say that a lot of people, when they think about Charles Darwin,

14
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.690
think about a brilliant, brilliant man who 150 or so years ago,

15
00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:56.970
woke up some morning and thought, wow,

16
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.640
I have a wonderful deep insight into the nature of how life changed. Well,

17
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.230
it was wonderful. It was deep. It's one of the deep whatever. Yes.

18
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:05.670
But it wasn't instant.

19
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.420
And that's the first thing we ought to say about Charles Darwin is that he did

20
00:01:09.421 --> 00:01:11.400
not have an Excelsior idea.

21
00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:15.360
He had a notion which gradually formed into an idea,

22
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.260
which then required an enormous amount of hard,

23
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.380
hard work. And to begin,

24
00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:25.770
I'd like to play you a story I did a number of years ago with David Coleman,

25
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:28.770
who was one of the best scholars about Darwin that I know,

26
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.650
he's actually a professional journalist, but we call him a scholar

27
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.950
and you're suddenly living in a world where our scholars and journalists are on

28
00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:41.880
par by not, you know, cause cause, cause David works very hard,

29
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.240
but he doesn't even work as close to hard as chuck doe.

30
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.130
And as I like to call him. So let's listen to this story,

31
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:50.460
which is Darwin working out of theory.

32
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.560
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

33
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.650
<v 0>150 years ago when people asked,</v>

34
00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:58.860
how come you can go to Australia and there are kangaroos hopping,

35
00:01:58.861 --> 00:01:59.970
hopping around everywhere.

36
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.560
But you go to places that look almost exactly the same, say, um,

37
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.540
grasslands in Africa and there are no kangaroos. Now, why is that?

38
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:14.070
Why not the same kinds of places have the same kinds of animals? Well,

39
00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:18.180
150 years ago there was an answer was a simple one. So the science writer,

40
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.250
David Coleman, God has made Kangaroos and put them in Australia. So God did it.

41
00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:25.770
He decided that was what God wanted to do.

42
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.130
God created every species individually and put them down wherever they are.

43
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.970
I actually, I call that special creation plus special delivery.

44
00:02:34.971 --> 00:02:39.840
So that was the explanation even among some of the most learned people around,

45
00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:43.530
but then says Kwaman Darwin came along and said, wait a minute.

46
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.330
I don't think that's the explanation.

47
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.220
I think these things all evolved from common ancestors.

48
00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:54.600
So the reason you find Kangaroos only in Australia and New Guinea, he said,

49
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.310
it's not God's doing.

50
00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.520
It's because the earliest kangaroo ancestors evolve there and then they spread

51
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:04.000
out by, they couldn't get across the water that surrounds Australia.

52
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.240
They went 'em out as far as they could go. Every plant,

53
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.450
every animal that you see Darwin proposed got where it is today on its own.

54
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.760
Animals and plants must disperse.

55
00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:20.761
They must be capable of dispersing in order to explain what we see on the planet

56
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.510
by way of evolution.

57
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.430
So it was critical to Darwin's theory to show how living things got to where

58
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:31.870
they are today. And this can get kind of tricky. For example, a cabbages.

59
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.890
You can find cabbage plants on islands near Antarctica.

60
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.380
Now how would a cabbage get there? Well,

61
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.140
either God put it there or it got there on its own. Yeah,

62
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.870
but how does a cabbage seed cross an ocean on its own? Yeah. Cow. Well,

63
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.320
it turns out the Darwin obsessed about this question,

64
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.080
vegetable voyaging for years,

65
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:56.350
he concocted experiments and experiments that were so delightful.

66
00:03:56.351 --> 00:03:59.410
And so unlike what you'd imagined. Exactly, exactly.

67
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.940
You remember the old TV show watch Mr Wizard? That was Darwin.

68
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.110
That was Charles Darwin. Here's a perfect example. Darwin wondered,

69
00:04:08.111 --> 00:04:09.580
how might a radish

70
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.410
<v 3>travel? Well,</v>

71
00:04:12.411 --> 00:04:16.730
he imagined that a radish might accidentally get swept to see on a windy day.

72
00:04:16.731 --> 00:04:21.590
But now the questions do radishes float. Well, Darwin had his bucked,

73
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:26.420
Mr Parsippany for salt water and like oceans into a tub

74
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.440
<v 0>and into that tub they flopped radishes and carrots.</v>

75
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.160
And Rhubarb and celery and Mr Parslow was,

76
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.370
he was one of these proper English butlers. Absolutely. Yeah.

77
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.220
I guess there weren't too many other butlers in the vicinity who have come to do

78
00:04:40.221 --> 00:04:44.870
this sort of thing. Probably not know Bob. Mr Postel also dropped in seeds.

79
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.570
He tried cabbage seeds, radish seeds, pepper, um,

80
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.500
cress as in watercress.

81
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.460
And then they watched to see what floated for how long.

82
00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:59.030
Then they'd removed the wet seeds and they plant them to see if they would still

83
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.750
grow. Some do better than others. With radish seeds,

84
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.730
he got 42 days worth of floating and with Cres, uh,

85
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.560
42 days plus a wonderful quantity of mucus, Darwin said,

86
00:05:12.561 --> 00:05:15.470
if I recall correctly. So it's stinky, but it's sly,

87
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.450
a slimy mess that still travels the ocean. And that's typical of Darwin,

88
00:05:20.451 --> 00:05:24.710
that he would not say a, you know, a disgusting or a gross quantity of mucus.

89
00:05:24.711 --> 00:05:28.640
He would say a wonderful quantity of mucous because everything about the natural

90
00:05:28.641 --> 00:05:33.110
world was wondrous to this guy. Okay. So that's 42 days for the radish,

91
00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.490
42 days for the crest. How much now for dried asparagus seed,

92
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.080
85 days,

93
00:05:39.081 --> 00:05:44.081
they stayed afloat 85 days and then he took him out and planted the seeds and

94
00:05:44.961 --> 00:05:47.810
they germinated. So let's do the math. I winded.

95
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.320
If an asparagus seed can float for eating five continuous days and an ocean

96
00:05:53.781 --> 00:05:58.310
current moves roughly 38 miles a day, let's 85

97
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.310
<v 3>times 38 that means an asparagus can sale 3,230 miles across the sea.</v>

98
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:07.280
That's,

99
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.280
that's like Magella asparagus is key at least among those Darwin with them.

100
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.960
Yeah. So yes, ocean crossing vegetables are possible,

101
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.920
but Darwin didn't stop there.

102
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.450
<v 0>One day his eight year old son Francis said to him, you know,</v>

103
00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:30.100
dad did birds float, Kinda like ships. And his father said, yeah,

104
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.640
he seems to have been a terrific father. So Francis said, well,

105
00:06:33.641 --> 00:06:38.641
why don't we feed a birds some seeds so the seeds get inside the bird and then

106
00:06:39.131 --> 00:06:42.250
you know, shoot the bird and then a lot, but in a tub,

107
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.240
the corpse and let it float for awhile. So he suggested that and Darwin said,

108
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.750
you Bet Francis, that's a great idea. Then after a month or whatever,

109
00:06:49.751 --> 00:06:54.010
they open up the dead carcass and they pulled out the seeds inside and they

110
00:06:54.011 --> 00:06:57.250
planted them and found that those seeds also germinated,

111
00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.960
thereby establishing the principle that seeds can either float on their own or

112
00:07:01.961 --> 00:07:06.730
they can hitch a ride as passengers inside a bird as passengers attached to the

113
00:07:06.731 --> 00:07:09.940
foot of a bird, which then led Darwin back to animals.

114
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.030
And to the last science article he ever published,

115
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.560
in which he proposed the possibility of flying clams.

116
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.260
Now at this point, Darwin wasn't so well,

117
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.650
he's suffering from degenerative heart disease, but he's still working.

118
00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:25.330
He's still very much alive mentally.

119
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.730
And one day he gets a letter from a shoe salesman,

120
00:07:27.731 --> 00:07:30.670
a young guy named Walter Crick. And the way the story goes,

121
00:07:30.671 --> 00:07:33.430
you imagine crick out in the woods collecting beef.

122
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.220
Look what he just happened to see. It was a water beetle.

123
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.710
And when he got down and you look close and attached to one of the legs was a

124
00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:44.760
little clam, a little freshwater clam, and very,

125
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.270
very little small enough that the beetles scarcely noticed it and quick truck.

126
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:53.050
That's kind of curious. So he wrote down and he said, you know,

127
00:07:53.051 --> 00:07:55.510
I think you might be interested in this, and sure enough,

128
00:07:55.511 --> 00:07:58.510
Darwin wrote right back and he asked him all kinds of questions that crick

129
00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:01.060
couldn't answer because after all he was, he was in the shoe business,

130
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.850
so he did something better than you know, fake it.

131
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.820
He sent the beetle with the shell attached to Darwin.

132
00:08:06.821 --> 00:08:08.440
He mailed it and he just popped it into an envelope.

133
00:08:08.441 --> 00:08:10.140
He popped it into an envelope. Was the,

134
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.750
was the clam still attached to the needle? It was. It was. So he said, okay,

135
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.420
well you take a look for yourself. Yeah. So a day or two later,

136
00:08:16.421 --> 00:08:19.780
the beetle and the clam did arrive at Darwin's house in an envelope,

137
00:08:19.781 --> 00:08:21.700
but they were separated now and the beetle,

138
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.510
the beetle was dying by the time that he got clean.

139
00:08:25.511 --> 00:08:26.800
Very wasn't feeling very well,

140
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:31.180
but right away Darwin could see a possibility here. This is very interesting.

141
00:08:31.181 --> 00:08:35.710
This goes back to the whole subject of dispersal of how creatures can travel

142
00:08:35.711 --> 00:08:39.980
from one place to another. Maybe this little clamp can fly from a hot place,

143
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:44.260
right? Because this beetle is a swimming beetle, but it can also fly.

144
00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:48.190
So maybe clams can fly from pond to pond hitchhiking on a beetle.

145
00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:52.390
Darwin couldn't prove this because he felt kind of badly watching that little

146
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:53.800
beetle he had suffer.

147
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.450
So this is why I mentioned it at the end of my book because it's such a

148
00:08:57.451 --> 00:09:02.190
wonderful example of the kind of fellow this Guy Charles Darwin was,

149
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:06.060
he writes back to wd crick and says, dear Mr Crick,

150
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.420
as the wretched beetle is still feebly alive, he wrote,

151
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.900
I put it in a bottle with chopped Laurel leaves.

152
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.980
Now he knew that those leaves give off a gas that would very gently help this

153
00:09:16.981 --> 00:09:20.670
beetle die. And one of the very last acts of his life,

154
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.740
he decided that he needed to put this beetle out of its misery.

155
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.660
And then a few weeks after that, uh, Darwin died himself.

156
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:35.190
There is a postscript to this story. It turns out that years and years later,

157
00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:36.660
the shoe salesman, Walter Crick,

158
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:41.990
had some grandchildren and one of Walter's grandsons just happens to be Francis

159
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.150
Crick. The code is the Francis,

160
00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:49.800
the Francis Crick co-discoverer of the structure of DNA with James Watson.

161
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:54.950
So perhaps the greatest champion of evolution in the 20th century who deciphered

162
00:09:55.081 --> 00:09:59.790
the structure and the code of DNA. Both that guy's Grandpa,

163
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.680
his grandpa was a pen Powell sharing beetle specimens with Darwin.

164
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.260
And how strange and wonderful is that

165
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:12.260
<v 1>and it is kind of strange [inaudible] you ended the piece with how strange ended</v>

166
00:10:12.261 --> 00:10:13.210
the piece that way, but the,

167
00:10:13.211 --> 00:10:18.110
that it's very strange you who always sweat the ending and torture me on the

168
00:10:18.111 --> 00:10:20.990
endings you ended with. How strange is that? Well, here's why.

169
00:10:20.991 --> 00:10:25.230
Because think about science the way it's done today. Yeah.

170
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:29.570
You have to finish high school, you have to get good grades,

171
00:10:29.571 --> 00:10:32.390
you have to take the sats, you have to get into college,

172
00:10:32.391 --> 00:10:34.040
you have to be a major in science.

173
00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.330
Then you should go to the and get the cherries or the public as a white.

174
00:10:38.331 --> 00:10:41.840
But then the very specialized now and look at that, look at their science.

175
00:10:41.841 --> 00:10:45.590
This is Charles Darwin with the Butler and the tubs.

176
00:10:45.591 --> 00:10:49.490
I like that part of it's very optimistic in a way, and very homespun, you know,

177
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.290
here's what I don't get. Um,

178
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:55.770
he comes up with this idea in like 1830 something, right? Yes. He's,

179
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.680
he's a young man. When he, when he,

180
00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.690
when he figures out maybe species evolve in this peculiar, right?

181
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.820
So he's got the idea in 1838 and he's a young dude,

182
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:09.080
and then it's only like 20 something years later when he finally 21,

183
00:11:09.081 --> 00:11:12.470
one 21 years later that he finally actually comes out with it and publishes it

184
00:11:12.471 --> 00:11:14.960
in here. What happened in the gap was he testing? That's one of the,

185
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:19.700
that's one of the great questions is why did Charles Darwin wait so long to

186
00:11:19.701 --> 00:11:21.150
announce the idea?

187
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:26.350
One version of that is that he just wanted to do what you just heard him do.

188
00:11:26.421 --> 00:11:30.230
He wanted to be sure you had a test and evidence, evidence story.

189
00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:35.300
The other reason is actually a more romantic and interesting and also sad reason

190
00:11:35.301 --> 00:11:40.100
because it tells you that from the beginning,

191
00:11:40.101 --> 00:11:44.810
this idea had deep problems with its audience. In this case,

192
00:11:44.811 --> 00:11:47.360
Charles Darwin's audience was a precious audience.

193
00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:50.900
It was the woman he fell in love with. Um, what's her name?

194
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.310
I don't think I should tell you because think you're going to learn it from

195
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:58.180
Deborah Highly Gwinn who is an author of a new book called Charles and

196
00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:02.410
[inaudible] Emma. Anyway,

197
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.570
Deborah wish that that was be, we were talking [inaudible] and she tells me, uh,

198
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.480
let's see. Let's go back to when Charles was in his mid twenties. Here we go.

199
00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.230
<v 4>Okay, I'm 28. I've got this promising career, this,</v>

200
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.810
this great theory I'm thinking about now. He goes today,

201
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.510
cause next big decision, should he get married or not right to what does he do?

202
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.510
Well, he makes a list of pros and cons.

203
00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:27.290
Is it called pro marriage or con? Met with,

204
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:31.670
it's called marry. Not Marry. This is the question.

205
00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.120
Let's hear the, let's hear the knock Mary things. Uh,

206
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:40.880
fighting with her like that would, that would, that would could be a problem.

207
00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:45.950
Yes. Um, and he, he did, he, you know,

208
00:12:45.951 --> 00:12:49.400
he loved children and so he really thought about having children but,

209
00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:54.380
but he also worried about again the time it would take to raise children and the

210
00:12:54.381 --> 00:12:57.140
expense and also the anxiety.

211
00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.750
Meanwhile what was on the pro side if I do Mary, what did you get?

212
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:05.760
He was looking for somebody who would sit on the sofa with him and you know,

213
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.400
make nice and you know, whatever. Um,

214
00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:14.400
but I think when he made that a of game,

215
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.740
yes. Right. Cause they did pay but did they play? They played,

216
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.900
Charles and Emma played backgammon and now we gave away that it was Emma.

217
00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.250
So there they are. We're wondering which way to glide.

218
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:28.470
There's one big question that he did not put on his list. God,

219
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:29.663
why God,

220
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:34.940
he really was beginning to think that he was having problems with God and with

221
00:13:34.951 --> 00:13:35.970
religion in general.

222
00:13:35.971 --> 00:13:40.971
And he knew very often that if the man was a skeptic or religious skeptic and

223
00:13:41.491 --> 00:13:45.870
the woman was a believer, things went along fine until there was some problem.

224
00:13:45.871 --> 00:13:48.060
Somebody got sick, somebody died,

225
00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:52.170
and then the woman was miserable because the husband wasn't a believer.

226
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.860
<v 1>And if the husband is in the believer Jad,</v>

227
00:13:54.861 --> 00:13:59.120
then that person's probably going to go to hell for not having faith in God.

228
00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:02.000
So when you go onto your returnal arrest,

229
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.010
you're in hell and your life is in heaven.

230
00:14:04.011 --> 00:14:05.920
And so that's a long time to be apart.

231
00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.540
So you want to stay with them here and there. Yeah.

232
00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:13.070
Darwin falls in love as it happens with one of these religious girls.

233
00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:18.440
Emma April's really in love with her, but she says to him, Oh, I don't know,

234
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:23.060
I want to live with you forever in heaven. And she's a believer. Yeah.

235
00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:24.800
So during their courtship, they talk about this,

236
00:14:24.801 --> 00:14:27.860
he shares his doubts about the existence of God.

237
00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.800
She says her hope that he will come out, come to faith,

238
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.600
but she does agree to marry him in spite of that.

239
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.050
<v 4>And um, she, you know, when he's there,</v>

240
00:14:38.051 --> 00:14:41.950
she's all happy cause he's so Charles and she loves him and he's great.

241
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:45.130
And then he goes away. I can still relate to this.

242
00:14:45.131 --> 00:14:48.550
And then she starts to worry because he's not there to sort of distract her with

243
00:14:48.551 --> 00:14:52.160
his wonderfulness. She worries about his not having faith,

244
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:55.010
um, or losing his faith. I mean,

245
00:14:55.011 --> 00:14:59.360
to me it's never clear exactly what he's thinking exactly. I mean,

246
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.520
I don't think it was clear to him he was struggling with it,

247
00:15:01.521 --> 00:15:02.650
let's put it that way. Right.

248
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.660
She probably knew she wasn't going to really change his mind,

249
00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:10.690
but she just knew that prayer was really helpful to her and she saw him in pain

250
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:15.800
and emotional pain and, and she thought if he would just pray,

251
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.220
maybe he would feel better, but she didn't want to really say that to him.

252
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.120
So she wrote it down and said, sometimes it's easier to write something down.

253
00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:28.320
And she wrote him I think a three letters during their time together maybe for,

254
00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:33.020
um, he kept those letters with him all the time. Um,

255
00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:34.440
and he, and he wrote,

256
00:15:34.441 --> 00:15:38.550
he knew he just had a feeling he would die first and he wanted her to know after

257
00:15:38.551 --> 00:15:41.550
he was gone that he really took our concerns seriously.

258
00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.160
<v 1>He also on the,</v>

259
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:48.140
on the letter itself wrote some later point right when I'm dead,

260
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.490
no, that many times I have kissed and cried over this

261
00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.110
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

262
00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:01.500
<v 1>so they were, they were, they had an arrangement? No,</v>

263
00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:05.630
he grieved for her. She grieved for him. And they were,

264
00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:10.720
they had very different ideas about what death meant until something happened in

265
00:16:11.091 --> 00:16:12.860
their lives. That I, it's, it's,

266
00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:16.160
it has a kind of a feeling of real deep tragedy about it.

267
00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:22.230
<v 4>What, um, whose Annie Annie was,</v>

268
00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:27.000
I'm their second child, their oldest daughter, and, um,

269
00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:31.860
really the apple of their eye. She was, uh, a wonderful little girl. And,

270
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:35.970
um, Charles Darwin later said she was his favorite,

271
00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.790
which I always have mixed feelings about because I don't think a parent should

272
00:16:38.791 --> 00:16:42.630
have favorites, but there you go. Do you know why she was his favorite? Um,

273
00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:46.980
she was spirited. She was kind, she was musical like Emma,

274
00:16:46.981 --> 00:16:48.540
but she was orderly. Like Charles.

275
00:16:48.541 --> 00:16:53.541
Emma was a slob and he was very attentive and connected to both of her parents.

276
00:16:55.710 --> 00:17:00.330
But some scarlet fever had run through the household. It seemed in retrospect,

277
00:17:00.331 --> 00:17:03.660
like Annie never got quite better

278
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:06.793
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

279
00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:10.860
<v 4>after about a week of that right around Easter by the way. Um,</v>

280
00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:14.400
and it just got worse and worse and she finally died.

281
00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:22.020
He and Emma said to each other and letters, right then we just have to be,

282
00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:25.950
stay close to each other. Emma wrote to him, you are my prime treasurer.

283
00:17:25.951 --> 00:17:26.784
And always have,

284
00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:29.010
<v 1>cause this was one of those moments where for a lot of couples you,</v>

285
00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:31.550
you can kind of go [inaudible]

286
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:36.560
<v 4>considering what death meant to each of them and how different it is,</v>

287
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.150
you know, the different meanings I took.

288
00:17:38.151 --> 00:17:42.510
It's pretty amazing to me that I think it brought them even even closer.

289
00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:47.110
<v 1>[inaudible] the sense of along the way is that the reason that Charles Darwin</v>

290
00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:48.820
hung onto his idea and didn't,

291
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:54.290
one of the reasons is that he was worried that Emma would have been upset and

292
00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:56.610
there's a reason right.

293
00:17:56.611 --> 00:17:59.430
For him to feel that way because she's so much more or less intimated that

294
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:04.140
<v 4>well, the thing that's great about Emma was that, um, you asked me before,</v>

295
00:18:04.141 --> 00:18:07.080
I think what, how they changed after Annie Staff.

296
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.690
I think they became a little bit more,

297
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.610
I think s they saw each other's point of view just a little bit more. I think.

298
00:18:14.611 --> 00:18:16.080
I think Charles saw, oh,

299
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.320
would be probably really nice if I believed in it after life.

300
00:18:19.321 --> 00:18:21.930
Cause then I could see Annie again and that would be lovely. And,

301
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:26.280
and I think probably as Emma Watch Charles working and, and, and probably, uh,

302
00:18:26.281 --> 00:18:29.670
she struggled with what was the sense of Annie's staff? You know,

303
00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:33.210
maybe there was no sense. Maybe it was just one of those things that happens.

304
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:37.080
I believe that they actually started to come together more than go apart in the

305
00:18:37.081 --> 00:18:40.350
way they were thinking. Neither surrendered their poor, neither surrendered.

306
00:18:40.351 --> 00:18:43.650
But I think that they were really able to see the other person's point of view,

307
00:18:43.651 --> 00:18:46.410
which is really what all we need. Right. And so Emma,

308
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.350
who was never much interested in science by the way. Um,

309
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:52.140
but she was always his first reader and his best reader.

310
00:18:52.141 --> 00:18:54.270
So whenever he was sending something out for publication,

311
00:18:54.271 --> 00:18:57.960
she always read it back in, um, 1842,

312
00:18:57.961 --> 00:19:01.670
he had first shown her and her alone this, um,

313
00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.800
this sketch of his species theories just in case he should die.

314
00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.470
And he said he wrote her a letter saying, in case I should die,

315
00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:12.090
I'm trusting you to publish this. Well, you know,

316
00:19:12.091 --> 00:19:16.500
she was the one who was so worried he was killing God and yet he trusted her and

317
00:19:16.501 --> 00:19:17.670
he knew he could trust her.

318
00:19:17.671 --> 00:19:22.140
And so Emma read it and manuscript and she didn't object to anything.

319
00:19:22.141 --> 00:19:25.380
She didn't object to anything that would, um, you know,

320
00:19:25.381 --> 00:19:28.390
maybe have sort of personally offended her about God. In fact,

321
00:19:28.391 --> 00:19:29.250
she cleaned it up.

322
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.030
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

323
00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:34.690
<v 4>cleaned up his language because he wasn't good with commas and you know,</v>

324
00:19:34.691 --> 00:19:37.600
and he had spelling mistakes and so she cleaned it up and made his arguments

325
00:19:37.601 --> 00:19:38.860
stronger for him.

326
00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:47.440
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

327
00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.160
<v 6>so, wow. So emotionally she traveled a great distance. We did.</v>

328
00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:51.600
But here's my question.

329
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:57.690
If he can do so much work to convince the scientists, his colleagues,

330
00:19:57.691 --> 00:19:59.370
that this is a theory that is true.

331
00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:01.090
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

332
00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:02.670
<v 6>and if he can, you know,</v>

333
00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:06.910
through a sort of personal loss and time and understanding,

334
00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:10.840
convinced his wife through love really did. It's true.

335
00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.420
Why can't he convince the rest of us?

336
00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:17.740
I mean Ike [inaudible] our producer here too, I write just handed me paper,

337
00:20:17.741 --> 00:20:22.741
which says that there was a Gallup poll of 1,018 Americans less than four out of

338
00:20:23.921 --> 00:20:28.420
10 say they quote believe in the theory of, of evolution. That's less than 40%.

339
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:29.620
Yeah,

340
00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.860
<v 1>it's been that way by the way. For, for decades. You know, for decades he,</v>

341
00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:37.470
Darwin has never had a majority. No. So why? Well,

342
00:20:37.471 --> 00:20:39.210
there are probably two simple reasons.

343
00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:43.890
One is that people don't like thinking of themselves as beasts or animals.

344
00:20:43.891 --> 00:20:46.950
And Darwin insisted. He always insisted.

345
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:51.220
<v 7>We are not closer to the angels. We are not separate. We are not different.</v>

346
00:20:51.221 --> 00:20:56.110
We are beasts. We couldn't, you at least say to sort of counter that argument,

347
00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:59.530
okay, we're beasts, but we're turbocharged beasts were like special beasts.

348
00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:03.490
Say that. But that's not the only problem. There's what's number two?

349
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:08.350
The second one I think has to do with everybody's desire for, well,

350
00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:14.220
let me just introduce you to Adam Gopnik who written another book about Charles

351
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:16.270
Town. He's, he's written more than no,

352
00:21:16.271 --> 00:21:18.820
another one in our series of mini books that you're visiting here,

353
00:21:18.821 --> 00:21:19.810
who you have the common book.

354
00:21:19.811 --> 00:21:21.730
We have the Hollywood book and we know of the Gopnik book,

355
00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.070
but I sat down with Adam and I,

356
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:28.870
we talked about what is the problem really with Darwin's theory.

357
00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.800
Nope. Nobody understood and the 19th century better than Charles Darwin,

358
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.620
that death is the great reaper out of life.

359
00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.890
He didn't believe in mortality and he believed in what he called the wedge of

360
00:21:38.891 --> 00:21:41.920
death. He understood that that's how species proceed.

361
00:21:41.921 --> 00:21:44.720
That's the nature of life is to involve a great deal of death.

362
00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:49.740
But that realization of course provided him absolutely no comfort for the loss

363
00:21:50.021 --> 00:21:50.681
of his own child.

364
00:21:50.681 --> 00:21:55.420
Knowledge about the common experience gave him no ease in his core experience.

365
00:21:55.660 --> 00:22:00.340
And that I think Robert is the deepest reason why we have trouble with Darwin in

366
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:05.500
some because we look to big ideas to take common experience and give us comfort

367
00:22:05.501 --> 00:22:09.100
about our core experience. And no matter how we try and pull it apart,

368
00:22:09.101 --> 00:22:12.250
no matter how we try and search it, Darwin is a mote do that for us.

369
00:22:12.251 --> 00:22:13.670
We can't say, um,

370
00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:17.680
I read Darwin and now I feel better about my own life.

371
00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:22.330
Cause actually it makes you feel kind of worse because if you ask how did I get

372
00:22:22.331 --> 00:22:25.810
here, there's a explanation in Darwin's rating for that.

373
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:31.060
But if you asked the one, everybody asked if he goes, why, what's it for?

374
00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:33.880
How does it end? What's the point?

375
00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:37.360
Then the answers are very unsatisfying.

376
00:22:37.361 --> 00:22:42.070
One is don't know or don't speak to that or there is none or,

377
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.820
and this is not, that's hard. There is none. It's very hard for people to take.

378
00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:49.430
I think too that it's, uh, you know, I,

379
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:53.410
I do think that there is a tragic grand jury in Darwin's view of life.

380
00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:55.150
But it doesn't make me feel sad.

381
00:22:55.420 --> 00:23:00.280
It makes me feel there is meaning there to be had. Darwin's love.

382
00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.310
Charles, his love for Emma, Charles, his love for it,

383
00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:07.460
and he still speak to us a hundred years later, we're moved by them. We're,

384
00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:08.351
we're stirred by them.

385
00:23:08.351 --> 00:23:11.710
We see pictures of our own life and our own loves in them.

386
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:15.250
Human life isn't meaningless because it ends.

387
00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:20.550
And one of the great changes in human spirit that Darwin ushers in Darwin,

388
00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:26.890
Harold's is a belief that the future is as important as our past and that our

389
00:23:26.891 --> 00:23:31.891
real afterlife lies in our children and in the afterlife of our ideas and values

390
00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:37.080
more than it lies in the inheritance of our ancestors and then now as part of a

391
00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:40.300
river. Hmm. Yes.

392
00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:44.800
That we're in a long river of time along wherever of life. And after, you know,

393
00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.880
it's one of the things we try and teach our children. Like what?

394
00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:50.600
When we talk about giving our kids a moral education, that's all we mean.

395
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:54.740
We mean, we want them to be aware that they are not unique consciousnesses,

396
00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:57.230
which are little dictators of reality.

397
00:23:57.231 --> 00:24:02.180
We want them to be aware that they are fishermen and Fisher women standing along

398
00:24:02.181 --> 00:24:04.340
the long stream of life where many, many,

399
00:24:04.341 --> 00:24:09.341
many have stood before where their place is unique but not specially privileged.

400
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:11.190
That's what we do.

401
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:15.840
<v 1>And even if they look down at the grass and at the fish that those are cousins</v>

402
00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:19.470
did, those are cousins that those are distant. Great, great, great grandparents.

403
00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:24.890
That I think has the virtue of being a genuinely and profoundly inspiring view

404
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:27.390
of how we got here and what we're doing here.

405
00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:30.120
And also has the not small advantage of being true

406
00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:38.430
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

407
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:42.270
<v 1>well, not everybody would agree with that. This is true. Whether that's alums,</v>

408
00:24:42.271 --> 00:24:46.950
you, Adam Gopnik wrote angels and ages.

409
00:24:46.951 --> 00:24:50.230
It's a short book about Darwin Lincoln and Modern Life. Oh,

410
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:54.420
he put them together. Yes. He put, cause they were born on the exact same day.

411
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:56.670
Same Birthday. Okay. Uh, Deb Heilig,

412
00:24:56.671 --> 00:25:01.530
when she wrote Charles and Emma and David Coleman wrote the reluctant, Mr

413
00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:18.680
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

414
00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.800
<v 1>radio lab is funded in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation,</v>

415
00:25:21.801 --> 00:25:25.430
the corporation for public broadcasting and the National Science Foundation.

416
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.800
I'm right. I'm not asked what Sam, Robert Krulwich,

417
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:31.970
but I'm not rubbing the thank goodness I'm a blue Rod, and I remember Colin,

418
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.440
we'll see you in two weeks.
