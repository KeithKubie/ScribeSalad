1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,360
Hey Robert. Yes.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,320
Woken from a long desperate slumber.

3
00:00:06,321 --> 00:00:09,730
Robert Krulwich opens his left eye
then his right alerted to the presence.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,370
Hey Robert. Oh, right here. Okay.
That's you. I have a thing I want,

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,900
I would like to share with you and then,
um, by extension the people out there.

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,840
What would you like to share?
Something you've been mulling. Yeah,

7
00:00:22,841 --> 00:00:26,670
so I recently completed a,
a sort of a mini series,

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,230
a in conjunction with a film that's now
out in the world called boy erased for a

9
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,980
project that we called unraced.
If people can hear it like yeah,

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,500
put it out for episodes. It's out there
in the world, in the wild on iTunes,

11
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:40,800
Spotify, all the places and uh, uh,

12
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:43,920
I want to play one of the
four today cause I think it's,

13
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:44,790
it's just I think [inaudible]

14
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,490
I think in all honesty, I should probably
say I've heard them as it happens.

15
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,170
Yes. Here's the things that
sort of like that sort of,

16
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,860
I found sort of just about the third
one at this. That's our first one.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,500
Here's a really important
moment in American history,

18
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:03,960
I guess you'd have to say in American
cultural history. Yeah. And uh,

19
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,750
it almost feels like a single individual
walks into one room and says something

20
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:17,531
startling to a group of very important
people because of an accidental moment

21
00:01:17,591 --> 00:01:20,950
that he just happened to be over here
talking a scholarly conversation.

22
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:25,930
So by a crazy quilt of
serendipity, enormous changes.

23
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:26,340
Now,

24
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,190
now this may be oversimplifying it and
I'm sure there's a lot else going on.

25
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:32,470
Deeper and shallow. We're rhythms,

26
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:37,471
but the changes come almost by accident
because someone misses a train.

27
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,170
Yeah, yeah. That's a, that's a pretty
good, you go, there you go. Okay. Uh,

28
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,300
so can we play it? Yeah, let's play it.

29
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,920
This is unraced a new podcast that
reveals the hidden history of conversion

30
00:01:50,921 --> 00:01:53,800
therapy in America. I'm Jad
Abumrad. This is episode three.

31
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:58,180
Let's start this episode by talking
about one of the great successes in

32
00:01:58,181 --> 00:01:59,014
psychology.

33
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,880
If you are living with
a mental health problem,

34
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,720
it can be hard to know which way to
turn or what to do to feel better.

35
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,050
It's called CBT cognitive
behavioral therapy.

36
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:15,030
You hear about it sometimes in the news,
uh, around, uh, treatments for PTSD.

37
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,320
Like suppose a soldier is
triggered by a loud sound. Well,

38
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:22,440
what the therapists will sometimes
do is take that same sound,

39
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:24,270
play it for the person over and over,

40
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:29,271
but under less and less
stressful circumstances
until gradually over time the

41
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:30,990
sound gets less stressful.

42
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:37,190
CVT focuses on goals and focuses mostly
on the present day and things that are

43
00:02:37,921 --> 00:02:39,030
affecting you and your life.

44
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:42,360
Now these kind of techniques can
help people with gambling addiction,

45
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:45,210
stop gambling. People
who smoke, stop smoking.

46
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,600
It is a hugely important
wave in psychotherapy.

47
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,410
It's often called the second wave.
Freud was the first. This is the second.

48
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,200
What follows is a story about one of
the Grand Poobah because of this second

49
00:02:58,201 --> 00:03:01,780
wave in a grand awakening that he had,

50
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,640
it kind of blew up the world

51
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,130
too.

52
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:11,450
Okay. Maybe that's overstating
it, but no, no, no. I don't know.

53
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,390
Start, start from all you know
about Jerry. So Jerry is a god. So

54
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,930
case in point, this guy,
this is David Tesler,

55
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,050
we bumped into him digging through
some archives at the association for

56
00:03:21,051 --> 00:03:24,250
behavior. And cognitive therapy,
central office. My colleague Shima Oli,

57
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:26,990
I and him were hunting around
for some tapes while they were,

58
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:30,770
you sort of offhandedly mentioned
that like yeah, Jerry. Oh, he's,

59
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,230
he's trained practically
everybody in the field.

60
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,390
We, we have this thing called, um,

61
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:41,380
there's this river tree and it basically
plots the several different people from

62
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:49,090
whom almost every single
contemporary psychologist came from.

63
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:55,130
Cherry is one of the six because how
many people own their careers to him?

64
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,040
You might call him one of the six cardinal
bishops of contemporary psychology.

65
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,750
Hi. And My name is Sigmund Freud. Yeah.

66
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,400
Yes. Gerald G. E R A.
L D middle initial C,

67
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,490
last name Davidson d a V.

68
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:19,330
I s o n Professor of psychology at
the University of Southern California.

69
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,000
[inaudible]. Jerry grew up in the 1940s,

70
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,890
Orthodox Jewish household playing stick
ball in the streets of Boston at a time

71
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:33,910
when the streets were pretty empty because
of the war that was a good little boy

72
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,470
and didn't get into trouble. And um,
since he was kind of a quiet kid,

73
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,360
wasn't a particularly cheerful
child, I would say analytical,

74
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,890
watchful. Anyhow,

75
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,400
Jerry eventually finds himself
one day working in a ham factory.

76
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:49,823
Pardon me?

77
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,990
Yeah. And a ham. They say like
Hammon like ham and eggs. Wow, okay.

78
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,510
Kind of a weird place for a Jewish
kid to be. But there he was.

79
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,110
So I had a job in the
graveyard shift at the start,

80
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:07,111
like at midnight and go until 8:00 AM
one day he is at the ham factory or maybe

81
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:11,680
on his way to the ham factory board.
What was there to do? So I always,

82
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,543
I was reading,

83
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:17,470
somehow I settled on Freud's introductory
lectures at Clark University,

84
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,660
well that he gave and
the early 20th century.

85
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,700
So he's reading Freud and the ham factory
reading Freud's lectures and something

86
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,910
about it hooks him, but also

87
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,230
horrifies it. This book made
a profound impact on me.

88
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:38,320
I stopped at [inaudible], we moved to

89
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,230
[inaudible]. [inaudible] [inaudible]

90
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,710
okay, so this is Freud that
you're hearing right now. Uh,

91
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,820
don't know what the hell he's saying.

92
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,490
Apparently this is the only
recording of him that exists.

93
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,240
Well, um, concert.

94
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,970
He's talking about unconscious
and kind of make that word out.

95
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,630
And Jerry says, uh,

96
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,950
the whole idea that you can like peel
back the layers of a human psyche.

97
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,360
It was absolutely

98
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,990
almost voyeuristically fascinating.

99
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,030
The same time he says, I felt like
some of the things Freud was saying,

100
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,870
which is kind of weird. How can
foist say, if you dream of a

101
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:25,640
[inaudible]

102
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,590
train going into a tunnel

103
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:31,570
[inaudible]

104
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,910
you're really dreaming of
having sex with your mother.

105
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:37,521
Anyhow,

106
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:42,521
something about the book both intrigued
and enraged him enough that he goes to

107
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:47,150
Stanford and then Stonybrook and to make
a long story short ends up standing at

108
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,540
exactly the right place where many streams
converge to create the first real up

109
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,060
ending of Freud, the behavioral therapy

110
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,453
revolution.

111
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,790
Previously it had been all about
dreams and the subconscious.

112
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:08,530
Now it was scientific that was
about experiments. And you know,

113
00:07:08,531 --> 00:07:10,330
the basic question,

114
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,960
how do you sit with a suffering
human being and help them?

115
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,720
How do you make someone happier,
less anxious, less suppressed?

116
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,450
Do you remember the first
patients you started seeing?

117
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,260
Yeah, the so called [inaudible],

118
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,650
you know the Avis y. A. V. I. S.

119
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:33,300
It's another acronym called young, young.

120
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,220
I went the ace stand
for able or attractive,

121
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,590
but they gave this
patient, it's the patient.

122
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,120
We're living it up for
you. Oh, it is. Okay.

123
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,770
It is a term psychotherapies
that described the
[inaudible] young, attractive,

124
00:07:49,771 --> 00:07:53,490
verbal, intelligent and successful.
That's it. You got it. So you know,

125
00:07:53,491 --> 00:07:56,130
early on he says he saw a
lot of people who were um,

126
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,470
your classic art variety neurotics,

127
00:07:58,471 --> 00:08:01,350
which is not a very complimentary term,

128
00:08:01,351 --> 00:08:03,030
but he says that is what
they used to call them.

129
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,630
But the whole reason we're telling you
this story is that in that initial batch

130
00:08:06,631 --> 00:08:08,160
of patients, Jerry says,

131
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:13,380
he began to see like fairly
frequently these young men walk in.

132
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:18,330
They were mostly young men who complained
that they were sexually attracted to

133
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,170
other men and they really wish
they weren't. That's right.

134
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,320
He says he can't remember
how many exactly walked in.

135
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:27,120
Maybe somewhere between four and a dozen.

136
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,840
I'm trying to think of there
were, they all came and,

137
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,290
and I supervise some cases in
the training clinic at Brook.

138
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:39,670
They all came because they weren't
happy and they wanted to change.

139
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,250
They wanted you to turn them
from gay to straight. Yeah. Yeah.

140
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,800
And not wanting to, you know,

141
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:48,790
impose my heterosexual values on them.

142
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,410
Some would say my heterosexist values
on them. I would check it out with them.

143
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,900
Can you tell me a little bit about what

144
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,310
living situation is like your
social life and whatnot and brands?

145
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,580
Nancy got an apartment off
campus I live with by myself

146
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:10,320
and in fact the film myself last
year where I really played myself,

147
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:11,190
I wasn't acting,

148
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:16,250
but we did have a graduate student play
the role of a troubled homosexual young

149
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:17,820
man who wanted to change.

150
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:22,200
You'll see in that film a
pretty reasonable rendition.

151
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,110
Have you ever previously been to
any therapists? No. In a thought.

152
00:09:26,111 --> 00:09:28,450
I'm going to you. Yeah.

153
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,440
Gary says that the film that he made,

154
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,270
which you're hearing is sort
of a composite of all the
cases that he saw of this

155
00:09:35,271 --> 00:09:37,730
kind. And what you see in
the film is hymns in a suit.

156
00:09:37,731 --> 00:09:41,330
Sitting in one chair a couple of feet
away from him as a young man with big

157
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,164
seventies hair,

158
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,570
not the same age kind of having trouble.
And the guy explains that. He did.

159
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,300
He did. He's having trouble concentrating.

160
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:54,290
Yeah. I, uh, I'm having a
trouble getting down to work.

161
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:59,780
It turned out that he was recently
frightened by an intensification of his

162
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:02,700
lungs, standing attraction to men.

163
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,920
Gary says initially he had no
idea what to do with these cases.

164
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:13,270
They were anxious, very
depressed. These were folks who,

165
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,930
the kind of people who could,
you know, commit suicide.

166
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,570
He says he felt like you just had
to help. That's what I was taught.

167
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,860
That's what I was taught.
And so in the film,

168
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,360
can't get into it. You don't, after
maybe, I don't know, 15 minutes.

169
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,390
Well, I'd like to outline for
you. Wait, I can procedure.

170
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,373
Okay.

171
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,920
Now before we actually get
into that procedure, uh,

172
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,100
just a little bit of
context isn't necessarily,

173
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,830
oh, I know that inside now
I am sick. I'm not sick.

174
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:51,320
Just sexually I'm sick in a lot of ways.

175
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,550
It's time. Jerry was not the
only therapist in the situation.

176
00:10:54,551 --> 00:10:57,530
There were a lot of therapists all
around the country trying to quote,

177
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,540
help their gay patients

178
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,210
say, [inaudible] isn't back health.

179
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:07,490
Anything that we can do to prevent
future generation wrong suffering.

180
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,150
This reflection must be

181
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,090
the overall approach. Certainly
did not start with me.

182
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:18,470
There were other people who were doing
what was called behavior therapy with

183
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,010
gaze. Most of it was a version.

184
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,790
Terrible change comes from
poverty. The ordinance so strong,

185
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:31,791
which was applying electric shocks
when they saw pictures of same sex,

186
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,773
you know, people,

187
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,130
um, or making them nauseated

188
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,740
with objections. You vomit again
and again, all over everything.

189
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,140
Jerry, your members,

190
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,930
one of the leading aversion therapists
coming to Stoneybrook where he was

191
00:11:48,931 --> 00:11:53,931
training at the time to give a lecture
and the Guy Shows 16 films of how it was

192
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:55,414
done.

193
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,640
[inaudible] the screen,

194
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,930
the film showed researchers
hooking up gay men,

195
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,890
two electrodes to their fingers or their
forearms. Show them pictures of men.

196
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,090
Naked Man.

197
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,940
Okay, did you get your shot?

198
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,010
And then they would shock them, hurting
them and flicking physical pain.

199
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,360
They then show them another slide
of a naked gay man. Do it again.

200
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,713
[inaudible] Hey,

201
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:24,050
this bothered me. Uh, just
personally, this hat does this.

202
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:29,240
It bought the idea of an, of
intentionally inflicting physical pain.

203
00:12:29,241 --> 00:12:34,160
On other people. I just worried
about it. It was cringeworthy.

204
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,900
Interestingly, Jerry doesn't fall.

205
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:42,080
The researchers who administered those
shocks picture that they were like

206
00:12:42,081 --> 00:12:46,160
dentists before novacane
in a pulling a tooth.

207
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:51,200
I am old enough to remember what going
to the dentist was like to get a filling

208
00:12:51,201 --> 00:12:53,710
or getting a tooth pulled, uh,

209
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:57,380
before there was novacane find
the right analogy though. I mean,

210
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,910
if your tooth hurts, you
need to have it pulled out.

211
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,980
You don't need to have homosexuality
pulled out if you may not think so.

212
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,600
But if, if you're gay and the 1960

213
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:11,000
ultra Americans, I repelled by
the mere notion of homosexuality,

214
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,930
your being haunted and
discriminated against.

215
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:18,290
The CBS News survey shows that two out
of three Americans look upon homosexuals.

216
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,810
We've discussed discomfort or fear

217
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,720
being told that you're an evil
person and you're disgusting.

218
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,290
These people need help.

219
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,660
And so what Feldman was trying to do
Belvin was leading a version therapist.

220
00:13:30,661 --> 00:13:32,010
He was the guy that showed that film.

221
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,390
He was doing the best that he could
given what was available knowledge.

222
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,040
You didn't, they were just
trying to help the patient.

223
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:39,560
Yeah,

224
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,470
yeah, yeah. That's why
I don't demonize him

225
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:44,730
in any case,

226
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:48,350
as Jerry is sitting there in the back
of the room watching this guy film and

227
00:13:48,351 --> 00:13:50,400
show this film of people being tortured.

228
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,110
Okay?

229
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:56,740
He says he just kept thinking cheese.

230
00:13:56,741 --> 00:14:00,700
Do we have to do it this way? But
people were saying, well, but it works.

231
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,990
And that's what the literature was
telling us. But I was thinking, well,

232
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:06,280
are there other ways to do it?

233
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,700
And so what Jerry decided to do was take
the basic idea of aversion therapy and

234
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:12,640
flip it.

235
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,300
So what am I supposed to do now?
And I'm supposed to argue. Well, um,

236
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,400
I'd like you to follow me if you
can. I don't want to say now,

237
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,100
and this is what you see in the film.
He basically tells the patient, um,

238
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,400
here's what I want you to do.
Grab a copy of Playboy magazine.

239
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:32,720
Okay? A, you can probably get hold of a
copy of playboy. Don't too much trouble.

240
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,050
The new standards. Yeah,

241
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,340
go to the newsstand, get a copy.

242
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:40,370
Playboy was what I thought of as a
source of material of attractive women.

243
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,120
Then he says, when you get back home,

244
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,640
get yourself aroused or
whatever you're accustomed to,

245
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,590
think about a man thinking about his body,

246
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:51,500
you start masturbating with you, a
homosexual image. Now there comes a point,

247
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,090
you know, the inevitable point
at that point of inevitability,

248
00:14:56,091 --> 00:15:00,860
switch over to the female picture.
Have you had your climax? Okay.

249
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,630
And, uh, you know,

250
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,460
misca idea was instead of shocking
people in to hating their gay thoughts,

251
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:14,810
he would gently encourage them to take
their positive gay thoughts and map them

252
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,740
onto a different [inaudible]

253
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,700
body. I fact,

254
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,680
I think the technical term
was orgasmic reorientation.

255
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:26,910
And in the video, apparently
it seems to work in the video.

256
00:15:26,911 --> 00:15:30,580
A Jerry checks in with him about
10 times and the guy tells him,

257
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:34,870
at first it was really hard for him to
finish the deed while looking at female

258
00:15:34,871 --> 00:15:38,770
pictures. But then it got
easier and easier until finally,

259
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,300
after about 10 of these sessions,

260
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:45,170
I really feel like I'm really getting
into it now. Uh, but happened was,

261
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,720
um, every time I masturbated,

262
00:15:47,721 --> 00:15:52,310
I found now that I could go straight
through without any trouble, you know,

263
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:55,160
with uh, do you like, do
you like what's happening?

264
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,490
I think the thing I like most
is I now see some direction,

265
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:03,491
I feel myself moving towards something
as opposed to not knowing which way I was

266
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,830
going to go. And I
think that's a good too.

267
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,380
Okay. Setting aside for a moment,

268
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,080
the question of whether this
therapy actually worked. Uh,

269
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:16,070
I think you can guess the answer to that
and it is not the point of the story.

270
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:21,440
What happens next is that this therapy
takes on an entirely surprising and

271
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:25,520
consequential life of its own.
And that's after the break.

272
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,980
I'm Jen. I'm Rod unraced on radio

Hey, this is pat Walters. I'm an
editor and producer here at the show.

278
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,150
And I have a quick announcement to make.

279
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,400
We have an email newsletter. Now
you may be thinking, so what?

280
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,840
Everybody has an email newsletter,

281
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:08,050
but the thing that I like about ours
is Radiolab is put together by this

282
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,400
eclectic bunch of Weirdos who I
feel super lucky to work with.

283
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:18,730
And every week we put out this newsletter
that is filled with stuff that they

284
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:23,480
have noticed out in the world and found
interesting or surprising or weird in

285
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:27,860
some way and want to tell you
about movies, TV shows, books,

286
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:31,310
magazine articles, photo
essays, strange music,

287
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,470
things that they've heard on the Internet.

288
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,480
And it's a cool way to get a peek
behind the scenes into the brains of the

289
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:43,400
people who put the show together every
week. So please sign up. It's free,

Hello Radio lab listeners. Are you hungry
for an extra helping of science? Oh,

295
00:18:10,781 --> 00:18:11,614
of course you are.

296

Have we got a podcast for you from wny c
studios and the team behind the popular

297
00:18:16,441 --> 00:18:19,020
youtube series sideshow.
It's sideshow Tangency,

298
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,830
a new podcast where four friends,
Sarah Riley, Sam Schultz, Stephan Chin,

299
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,370
and me. Hank Green tried to
outsmart and outwit each other,

300
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,250
but usually we just get excited and
talk about all the awesome science we're

301
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:31,920
learning about. We also compete for
who has found the coolest, weirdest,

302
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:34,110
funniest scientific research
on our weekly topic,

303
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:38,910
which could be eggs or mucus or flight
or the science of snow, ice and dragons.

304
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,110
But one more thing. We also
go on a lot of tangents,

305
00:18:43,111 --> 00:18:46,650
like if we've got something fun and kind
of related to say about death metal or

306
00:18:46,651 --> 00:18:49,620
cartoons or the smell of space.
It's size. Show tangents,

307
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,630
subscribe wherever you get your podcasts.

308
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,110
Um, dad, I have him. Ron. Hi, I'm Robert
Krulwich. This is radio lab. Yeah.

309
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:07,620
And were listening to a story, a from
a theory that I produced called erased.

310
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:10,110
And let's get back now to the story of

311
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:12,661
Dr. Jerry Davidson and the gay cure.

312
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:17,661
It is in 1966 67 Jerry has pioneered this
new kind of conversion therapy called

313
00:19:18,631 --> 00:19:21,330
orgasmic reorientation.
He's made a video about it.

314
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,310
Shortly after making this video,

315
00:19:23,311 --> 00:19:28,090
Jerry found himself reading the very
magazine implicated in his therapy,

316
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:32,200
naturally reading it just for the
articles as they say, as they say.

317
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,360
And I was reading the playboy forum,

318
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,090
that's the section in the magazine
where readers write letters,

319
00:19:37,091 --> 00:19:39,970
talk about stuff, voice
concerns. And in the forum,

320
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:45,130
this would have been around 1966 or 67.

321
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:50,020
Um, there were people writing in
trouble by their homosexuality.

322
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,840
Here's when we found, when
I was in the hospital,

323
00:19:52,841 --> 00:19:56,680
the doctor told me they were very few
cures for cases like mine and I should try

324
00:19:56,681 --> 00:20:01,450
to adjust my condition. Well being
a card carrying behavior therapist,

325
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,613
I wrote a letter

326
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,940
[inaudible] playboy, crazy,
isn't it? And I said,

327
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:14,420
actually there are new procedures
for helping gay men become less gay.

328
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:20,460
It comes from behavior therapy and I
don't know what else are about. Well they,

329
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:21,563
they, they printed it.

330
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,580
What ensued in the playboy forum
over the course of many issues,

331
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,450
many years in fact was a
vigorous back and forth.

332
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,470
Jerry's letter prompts a series of other
letters, some positive, some negative,

333
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,450
uh, one in particular, which calls out
a version therapy as this cruel thing,

334
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,110
which then causes one of the
world's leading aversion therapists.

335
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,860
The guy by the name of David Bartalow to
jump in and defend himself. He writes,

336
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,720
our procedures are not torturous,

337
00:20:52,721 --> 00:20:56,830
are the inquisition rather methods
derived from experimental laboratories and

338
00:20:56,831 --> 00:21:00,670
carefully applied to consenting human
beings to relieve some suffering.

339
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,480
That letter prompts a famous
gay activist, Frank Caminie,

340
00:21:04,481 --> 00:21:07,000
to jump in with his own
response. He writes,

341
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,570
I find the August playboy
forum letter if David H.

342
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:14,560
Barlow offensive and illustrative not
only of the failures of psychology and

343
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:16,570
psychiatry and their
approach to homosexuality,

344
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:21,360
but also of the dangers of human
engineering. Here's the weird fact,

345
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:25,500
Kim and his letter was titled, Gay
is good, and just a few years later,

346
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:25,970
post stone.

347
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,140
Well, Yay. Good.

348
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,900
That phrase, Yay is proud.

349
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,590
The slogan of the entire
gay rights movement,

350
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,550
and this was maybe the first
time that that phrase was used

351
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,020
in the pages of playboy.

352
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,560
Everyone raves about how
interactive the Internet is.

353
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,900
People forget how Interactive
Playboy magazine was.

354
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,730
Okay, so this is a little
bit of a digression,

355
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,810
but I think it's one so worth
taking. That's James Peterson.

356
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,940
I was senior staff writer slash
senior editor for Playboy magazine.

357
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:15,120
He worked at playboy from 1973 to 2003
he's sort of the institutional memory of

358
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:18,490
the old playboy last man
standing kind of there. Right.

359
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:22,060
James reminded me actually, truth is,
I never even knew this to begin with,

360
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:26,920
a that Hugh Hefner's intent with playboy
wasn't just to show naked ladies.

361
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:32,100
He had a whole philosophy did he
actually spelled out in great detail?

362
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:36,120
I call it the term paper
that changed America

363
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:43,190
[inaudible] when, uh,
Hefner was an undergraduate,

364
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,830
the first Kinsey report on male sexuality,

365
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,310
it came out less. The research
had been cops in [inaudible],

366
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,660
10 of the people have go off at random

367
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,560
and it was a bolt from the blue.

368
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:00,960
It's changed Hefner's life. It came out,

369
00:23:00,961 --> 00:23:05,961
I think 1948 and it described
the range of male sexuality

370
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,620
without judgment.

371
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:16,610
Kinsey described males on a range of one
to five from strictly heterosexual to

372
00:23:17,851 --> 00:23:19,470
strictly homosexual,

373
00:23:19,471 --> 00:23:24,471
but in the middle where something like
35% of American men had had a homosexual

374
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:28,560
experience in their
adolescence or early adulthood.

375
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,840
So the straight jacket was released

376
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:34,420
[inaudible]

377
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,190
and what struck Hefner,

378
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,950
this to me is the value of a of Kenzie.
The indicated for the first time,

379
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:44,930
statistically the great disparity was
this dissonance that existed between our

380
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,630
beliefs and the, uh,

381
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:52,690
the actual actions of society between
sex laws versus what people were actually

382
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:58,730
do. This is one good reason for
questioning some of the old morality.

383
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,980
And so, uh, when Hefner started playboy
along with the magazine and, uh,

384
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:07,830
the playmates and along
with all of the, uh,

385
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,560
televised parties from the playboy
mansion, we're glad you're here too.

386
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:16,070
Along with all that James says, he
wrote this constant stream of essays,

387
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:20,360
monthly installments, one
essay a month for two years,

388
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:24,560
like really long essays
on capitalism, religion,

389
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,990
essays on the history of sex.

390
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:30,080
Collectively it became known
as the playboy philosophy. Uh,

391
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:34,070
the philosophy really I think,
uh, is an anti puritanism

392
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,240
and James says behind
the scenes, through the

393
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:42,240
playboy foundation, we were funding
court cases in advanced gay rights,

394
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,750
abortion rights, birth control rights.

395
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:48,500
And James says the playboy forum
was part of that whole initiative.

396
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,810
Right after he finished that two
years sort of chain of essays,

397
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,020
Hefner then created that space
in the front of the magazine

398
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,580
for uh, people who had nowhere else to go

399
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,453
turn.

400
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:07,730
And it was in that space where you had
some of the first open discussions of

401
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:10,530
homosexuality in America ever.

402
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,810
And I said, you know, it's, you look back,

403
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,900
the sexual revolution
happened on the news stand

404
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:22,150
testing. One, two, three, four,

405
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:25,140
five, six, seven, eight.
Okay. Back to Jerry's story

406
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:29,200
recording of a workshop by General
and see Davison. October six,

407
00:25:29,201 --> 00:25:31,960
1972, New York Hilton,

408
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:35,050
a playboy letter, episode aside,

409
00:25:35,051 --> 00:25:37,480
Jerry continued to push his
playboy therapy and in fact,

410
00:25:37,481 --> 00:25:39,130
he says among therapists,

411
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:43,630
technique kind of started
to blow up and a, in 72,

412
00:25:43,631 --> 00:25:45,850
he ends up getting invited
to give a workshop.

413
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:51,120
I want to you really convention present
to you some ideas and data and whatnot.

414
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:57,430
From our point of view as we have
been working with homosexuals,

415
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,440
we're going to skip over the actual
specifics of that workshop. Well,

416
00:26:01,441 --> 00:26:06,300
I think it's clear that we have solved
all the problems that field has because

417
00:26:06,301 --> 00:26:07,740
what's more consequential? Thank you.

418
00:26:07,741 --> 00:26:11,580
This was enjoyable for me is
what happens after the panel.

419
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,910
Jerry is a hanging out waiting for
the room to clear. And this young, uh,

420
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:21,650
young man walks up to him chubby. He
was a little Chubby, bought my age.

421
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:26,060
Jerry was 33 at the time. Very
pleasant, very friendly, lot of smiles.

422
00:26:26,061 --> 00:26:27,920
I don't recall if he had any, a beard.

423
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:33,130
He came up to me and introduced himself
as a graduate student at Rutgers and he

424
00:26:33,861 --> 00:26:38,840
said, you know, I heard your talk.
I thought it was interesting. Uh,

425
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,150
I'm actually giving a talk
myself the next day. Uh,

426
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,770
you mind if I hand out some
flyers for it? And I said,

427
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,810
I don't mind at all. Of course,

428
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:50,900
the decision was made to attack what
we call the gatekeepers of American

429
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,190
attitudes.

430
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,300
This is Charles Silverstein.

431
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:01,380
He was that young therapist to training
with the flyer. Unbeknownst to Jerry,

432
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,500
he was gay and was part of a growing
movement of activists that were targeting

433
00:27:06,781 --> 00:27:10,830
people like Jerry [inaudible] on this
thing that the behaviors had a different

434
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,070
point of view, unlike the Friday
and Weirdos. They were scientists,

435
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:17,700
I would say [inaudible] them up and he
says the public trusted the behavior

436
00:27:17,701 --> 00:27:21,330
therapists. They had a lot
of sway over public opinion.

437
00:27:21,331 --> 00:27:25,950
So if they could convince Jerry and his
colleagues that homosexuality was not

438
00:27:25,951 --> 00:27:29,040
something that needs to be cured,
maybe the public would go along.

439
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,660
But the question was, how do you
do that? How do you make the case

440
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:38,730
[inaudible]

441
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:42,570
this was around the time
when gay activists would
start zapping meetings where

442
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:46,830
they'd basically go to a conference
where therapists are meeting storm, uh,

443
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,690
an event, grab the mic and

444
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,730
we want to deal with people.

445
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:57,560
[inaudible]

446
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:02,090
Charlie's sense was that this Gonzo
approach was not going to convince the

447
00:28:02,091 --> 00:28:04,130
people that needed convincing like Jerry.

448
00:28:04,131 --> 00:28:06,110
And so when he approached
Jerry after that,

449
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,980
did a workshop, very polite and friendly,
simply handed him a flyer, said,

450
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:14,160
hey man, a few folks are doing
a thing. Come by. Tracy has,

451
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:18,270
he just had a sense whose heart was
in the right place. And so he thought,

452
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:20,480
maybe I'll take a different approach
with this guy. And I looked,

453
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:24,360
I remember looking at
the Flyer and seeing, oh,

454
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:28,080
it's those radical gay activists,
all of these troublemakers. I mean,

455
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:32,100
I've been called in my career,
been called a Nazi and a fascist.

456
00:28:32,101 --> 00:28:36,120
And so I remember looking at the
flyer saying to myself, well,

457
00:28:36,121 --> 00:28:39,600
there's no way I'm going to go to this.
So he shoved the flyer in his pocket.

458
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,380
Yeah, I wasn't interested in it.

459
00:28:41,381 --> 00:28:44,100
Went off to the next panel [inaudible]
some stuff the following day,

460
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:45,240
final day of the conference,

461
00:28:45,241 --> 00:28:50,040
Sunday morning checked out of the hotel
and I was on my way to leave for Penn

462
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:53,670
station to go back out to Stonybrook.
And he says, on his way out,

463
00:28:53,671 --> 00:28:56,460
he kept bumping into colleagues
who were like, Hey, great workshop,

464
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:01,410
love your playboy therapy thing. And
so he'd stop and he'd chat. And um,

465
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,340
at one point I looked at my
watch and you realized, dammit,

466
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,250
I could not make it down to Penn
station, is going to miss the train.

467
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,760
And I thought, oh, the next
train doesn't leave. You know,

468
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,900
three hours later suddenly had some
time to kill and for whatever reason the

469
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:19,830
thought pops into his head, oh,
the kid from Rutgers with a flyer,

470
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:23,940
maybe I'll go that I pulled
out the, the flyer he gave me,

471
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,560
I hadn't thrown it away

472
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:32,150
and I found the room and I went
to the room and it was a madhouse.

473
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:39,540
So the room was electric in the
sense that it was absolutely packed.

474
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,250
Charlie and two other gay
therapists were on stage.

475
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,680
There were maybe a few hundred
people in the audience,

476
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:48,520
although it may seem incredible to you
if they had never heard a gay person

477
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,050
speak as convention,

478
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:52,450
I mean they'd maybe seen gay
people interrupt the convention,

479
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:56,800
but never take part. So in my
Hollywood imagination of this moment,

480
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:00,010
people are shouting, they're
waving. No, no, no, no, no.

481
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,540
Charlie says this time he worked very
hard to keep it professional, respectful.

482
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,780
Okay, so it's so it's,
it's cordial but fierce.

483
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,800
I was at the top of my form when
it came time for him to speak.

484
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,230
Charlie says he took aim at that idea.

485
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:17,980
He'd heard people like Jerry
repeat over and over again.

486
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,790
I only work with people who
want to change. So what's
the, what's the big deal?

487
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:26,260
That idea? Here's what he said that
day we asked him to read the remarks.

488
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:29,130
It's a discussion of male homosexual

489
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:36,670
to suggest that a person comes voluntarily
to change for sexual orientation is

490
00:30:37,431 --> 00:30:41,780
to ignore the powerful
environmental stress oppression,

491
00:30:41,781 --> 00:30:42,441
if you will,

492
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:47,180
that has been telling him for years
that he should change to grow up in the

493
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:52,181
family where the word homosexual was
whispered to play in the playground and he

494
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,040
had the words Faggot and queer.

495
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:00,700
Did you go to church and hear of sin and
then to college and here of illness and

496
00:31:01,191 --> 00:31:06,191
finally to the Counseling Center that
promises to cure is hardly to create an

497
00:31:07,221 --> 00:31:10,460
environment of freedom
and voluntary choice.

498
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,450
What brings them into the
counseling center is guilt.

499
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:17,780
Shame and the loneliness
that comes from their secret.

500
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,260
If you really wish to
help them freely choose,

501
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:26,420
I suggest you first desensitize
them to their guilt after that.

502
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,580
Listen truth, but not before.

503
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,660
I don't know anymore than
you what would happen,

504
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:38,230
but I think that choice would be
more voluntary and free than it is at

505
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,490
precedent. Yes, those are my words.

506
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:51,080
Do you remember how those were to
you all? It affected me very deeply.

507
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,510
Affected me very deeply.

508
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,350
Jerry says he went to Penn station.

509
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,270
Was Charlie's speech into the
counseling sentence? It is guilt.

510
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,920
Shame echoing in his mind.

511
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:13,070
Five 25 lead modeling like seven Tang
says he got on the train back to stony

512
00:32:13,071 --> 00:32:17,900
brook sat there staring out the
window at the scenery thinking,

513
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,500
thank you. Sorry.

514
00:32:21,501 --> 00:32:26,501
I was running through the whole talk
action in my head and to feel comfortable

515
00:32:26,721 --> 00:32:31,721
with this sexual violence after
the event with him and he says,

516
00:32:32,121 --> 00:32:35,750
by the time he got to Stoneybrook,
he felt something changed in him.

517
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:40,280
I went to school the following day.

518
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:45,610
I know I began to talk to people about
what I had just heard at the convention

519
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,560
and how it's gotten me to thinking.

520
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,790
He says he was teaching a series of
undergraduate classes at that time and he

521
00:32:51,791 --> 00:32:54,610
would get up in front of those
classes and for the first time think,

522
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,020
what if some of these
students are in the closet

523
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,250
talking to people, mulling
things over, talking to students.

524
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,830
I began to think what I've been
doing was absolutely wrong.

525
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:10,511
Meanwhile,

526
00:33:10,511 --> 00:33:14,530
his film on the playboy therapy was
still making the rounds still gaining

527
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,150
convert.

528
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,590
Oh yeah. People love the film.

529
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,030
Okay.

530
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:22,800
The film had been out for a year already
and by the time the film began to be

531
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:23,634
shown,

532
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:28,860
I was already wishing that it wasn't
being shown that I had no control over it.

533
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:32,740
1973 a couple of months
after that convention,

534
00:33:32,741 --> 00:33:37,741
Jerry gets nominated as the president
of the a B t the gigantic organization

535
00:33:37,991 --> 00:33:40,690
that had thrown the
conference. He just attended.

536
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,200
He becomes one of the youngest presidents
ever and the following year he was due

537
00:33:46,421 --> 00:33:50,260
to give the presidential address.
This is where things come to a head.

538
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,480
The conference that year
was held in Chicago.

539
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:56,590
It came at a time of
great fervor and foment.

540
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,380
He says in the days and months
leading up to the conference,

541
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:04,460
people on the radical left were calling
us fascist and Nattiez and they were

542
00:34:05,971 --> 00:34:10,440
publishing circulars where their home
addresses someone publish your home

543
00:34:10,441 --> 00:34:15,120
address. Absolutely. We had to, I was
president of the Association at the time.

544
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,600
I remember we all had walkie-talkies
and we hired plain clothes people in

545
00:34:20,761 --> 00:34:25,050
Chicago police because we were
that afraid of, um, violence.

546
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,120
Set the scene when you give the speech.
How big is the room? Big, big run.

547
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:34,640
Big Ballroom. Couple hundred people.
Thousand. These are all therapists? Yeah.

548
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,720
And how are you feeling before the
speech? Very nervous. Terrifying.

549
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,730
But he says before the talk,

550
00:34:41,731 --> 00:34:44,700
he'd actually met Charlie at a diner
and told them about the speech he was to

551
00:34:44,701 --> 00:34:48,840
make. I remember him saying, do you
know that your reputation may suffer?

552
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,690
Because you have to
remember that in those days,

553
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:56,850
if you said something positive about
homosexual, people would suspect you.

554
00:34:56,851 --> 00:35:01,350
People may think that you're gay. Oh,
he must be gay. That's what he's saying.

555
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,850
He warned me. He warned me.

556
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,540
[inaudible]

557
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:14,260
colleagues and my friends.
I want to make plain,

558
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:19,350
if not perfectly clear that I am speaking
only for myself on an ethical issue

559
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:23,830
that impinges importantly
on our therapy enterprise.

560
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,950
Jerry began the talk by
telling the audience,

561
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:29,910
I wish today to voice some concerns I
have been wrestling with for over three

562
00:35:29,911 --> 00:35:30,600
years.

563
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,980
That he's troubled surrounding the way
behavior therapists and for that matter,

564
00:35:34,981 --> 00:35:38,730
all other therapists have
approaching homosexuality

565
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:39,651
that he,

566
00:35:39,651 --> 00:35:42,830
like a lot of the therapists in the
audience have been approached by clients,

567
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:46,880
gay men mostly who want their
help, our up to be made straight.

568
00:35:46,881 --> 00:35:51,881
People who relate to us that they are
troubled by their homosexual behavior or

569
00:35:51,891 --> 00:35:55,490
feelings with any asks.
Uh, Silverstein's question,

570
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:00,800
what does it actually mean to help these
people as Silverstein put it at the a B

571
00:36:00,801 --> 00:36:01,070
t

572
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:04,830
convention two years ago in a
discussion of male homosexuality.

573
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:10,500
And let me court again to suggest that
a person comes voluntarily to change his

574
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,350
sexual orientation is to,

575
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:16,590
is to ignore the powerful environmental
stress oppression, if you will,

576
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,730
oppression. If you will,

577
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:22,710
that has been telling him for years that
he should change to grow up in a family

578
00:36:22,711 --> 00:36:27,270
where the word homosexual was wisdom
play and he quoted you in that speech.

579
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,460
Yeah. What was Ellie? I was quite pleased.

580
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,380
Continuing the quote from Silverstein.

581
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,260
What brings them into the
counseling center is guilt,

582
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,370
shame and the loneliness that comes
from their secret. In other words,

583
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:42,630
Silverstein suggests that we miss go
back in the causal network and ask

584
00:36:42,631 --> 00:36:47,460
ourselves as determinists what are they
determinants of the client asserting to

585
00:36:47,461 --> 00:36:49,920
you that he or she wants to change.

586
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,160
Jerry then delivers the simple point,

587
00:36:52,161 --> 00:36:55,400
which is that the problem that
these people are asking us to solve

588
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:58,643
[inaudible]

589
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,320
it's a problem we created

590
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,620
that we labeled as a problem

591
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,800
and so even if we could
effect certain changes,

592
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,730
there is still the more important
question of whether we should,

593
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:17,490
I believe we should not

594
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,000
to us now or to many of us.

595
00:37:25,001 --> 00:37:28,240
Now that may sound like
kind of as simple, easy,

596
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,910
obvious thing to say,

597
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:34,430
but that was an extraordinary
statement. You see,

598
00:37:34,431 --> 00:37:39,431
everybody else was arguing
that the attempts to change
sexual orientation ended

599
00:37:42,831 --> 00:37:47,300
in failure. That was not what he did.
He did something quite different.

600
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,690
He said in that speech,

601
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:54,800
it makes no difference how
successful the treatment is.

602
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,990
It is immoral.

603
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,760
Charlie says he was the
first person to say that

604
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:06,810
to ever say that trying to change sexual
orientation was an immoral thing to do.

605
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:10,970
[inaudible]

606
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:13,640
and that's not a trivial thing.
I mean you could see this moment

607
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:16,080
in a way as one of them

608
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,700
early tremors in a tectonic shift

609
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,830
in not just therapy but all of science

610
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,140
[inaudible]

611
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,580
like science to that point. It
concerns itself with objectivity.

612
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:28,750
That was all that mattered.

613
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:33,780
We stand apart from the world and
we examine it as it is objectively,

614
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:35,104
but that

615
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:39,370
from this moment forward would start
to be questioned all over the place.

616
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,020
Even in places like mental illness,
you know, you look at history,

617
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:48,620
you see that some diseases come and
go. Why would that be what people would

618
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:54,040
begin to argue that even mental illnesses
or social constructs created by the

619
00:38:54,751 --> 00:38:59,700
society, by the people who study
them. What Jerry was doing here.

620
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:01,540
Um,

621
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:05,200
he was shifting the
language. He was saying,

622
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:09,100
forget objectivity, forget
bullshit. Empiricism.

623
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:13,570
Let's talk about ethics.
Let's talk about morality.

624
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,310
We shouldn't do this. Not because
it doesn't work, which it doesn't,

625
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,290
but because it's wrong.

626
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,560
I hope and I recommend that we continue
to devote the necessary energy to the

627
00:39:27,561 --> 00:39:29,840
important challenges. Thank you.

628
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:39,420
You right about that moment.

629
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:43,640
Like as you were talking about how
like the air felt in that moment. You,

630
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:46,290
you right. Friends commented afterwards.

631
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:50,520
That one gets that kind of silence when
everyone in a room full of a thousand

632
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:51,210
people stops

633
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:55,140
breathing at the same time.
Yeah, yeah, exactly right.

634
00:39:55,890 --> 00:40:00,720
I remember that. I just remember that,
you know, like what are they going to do?

635
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,980
What I say this?

636
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,880
And it turned out that what they
were doing was holding their breath.

637
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:12,870
[inaudible] they do eventually [inaudible]

638
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:18,400
but afterwards Jerry says,
ah, at the reception, uh,

639
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:22,750
he walked in and it was like parting the
Red seas. Nobody wanted to talk to him.

640
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:27,420
They're all looking at me
and I remember one person,

641
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:31,890
I will not name him, he came
over to me and shook my hand.

642
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:35,120
Then he bent over and gave
me a kiss on the cheek. Well,

643
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,720
it didn't you like that? Oh,

644
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:39,780
like he's making a point to say you must
be gay because he said those things.

645
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,980
Yeah. Yeah. And I said, I said screw you.

646
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:47,320
So it took awhile to
get the peeps onboard,

647
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:54,220
but they did start to come around
and get on the right side of history.

648
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:57,040
And it's not a straight line by any means,

649
00:40:57,041 --> 00:41:01,120
but there is a line that you can draw
between Charlie's words coming out of

650
00:41:01,121 --> 00:41:05,290
Jerry's mouth and the epically
huge decision that these
psychiatric community as

651
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:10,240
a whole would make to remove homosexuality
as a mental illness from the DSM.

652
00:41:10,241 --> 00:41:12,910
That big Bible of mental illnesses.

653
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,170
Jerry speech happened right at that
beginning point when science was just

654
00:41:17,171 --> 00:41:20,140
starting to wash its hands of
the whole idea of a gay cure.

655
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:27,790
And what's interesting, I find
just as one final thought,

656
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:31,150
you could read this entire story
as a, as a sort of prelude,

657
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,070
psychotherapists were
basically ready to say that

658
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:39,070
homosexuality was not an illness by about
1986 that is precisely the time when

659
00:41:41,361 --> 00:41:45,260
the Christian community walked
in and grabbed the baton,

660
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:49,730
the scientific communities were accepting
homosexuality and they were saying

661
00:41:49,731 --> 00:41:51,410
that it's not a disorder anymore.

662
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:55,210
They were removing it from the DSM three
which is why we need to do what we're

663
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,920
doing because Christians
have to fight the battle.

664
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:02,080
Christians have to fight this battle of
homosexual sin because the professional

665
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,920
counseling community won't do it anymore.

666
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:07,580
So it was very explicit in
your mindset. Oh yeah. To that.

667
00:42:07,581 --> 00:42:12,170
That story is a story that we eat here
in the next episode of Honor Arrays,

668
00:42:12,171 --> 00:42:14,620
which I think we might also
play on radio lab. Well,

669
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:19,630
I hope so because all of a sudden
instead of talking to data and instead of

670
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,940
talking to jeans or instead
of talking to chemicals,

671
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:27,970
now you're talking to either God or
your parents or your teachers or your

672
00:42:28,491 --> 00:42:32,210
society or depressors
that are all around you,

673
00:42:32,211 --> 00:42:36,170
and it gets really,
really lonely and really,

674
00:42:36,171 --> 00:42:37,900
really tough. Yeah.

675
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:41,900
This episode of radio lab
was drawn from unraced,

676
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,660
the untold history of
conversion therapy in America.

677
00:42:44,661 --> 00:42:46,700
It's a series I worked
on with folks, features,

678
00:42:46,701 --> 00:42:50,330
stitcher and limited house in conjunction
with a feature film boy erased.

679
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:54,740
