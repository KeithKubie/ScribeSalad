00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:06.000
Marvel has taken the world by storm with their
ever-expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.290
The movies, for the most part, have been great
and it is clear that countless hours of work

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.080
have gone into the creation of each one.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.800
But all work and no play is no fun and it
seems like the people behind the scenes of

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.930
these blockbuster hits feel the same way as
bloopers and gag reels have shown the world

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.090
just how fun shooting these movies can be.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.110
For this video we are taking a look at some
of the best for our list of 10 Marvel Superhero

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.689
Movie Bloopers That Show Popular Actors Having
Fun! Enjoy this video and be sure to hit that

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.190
Captain America Civil War
Captain America: Civil War was one of the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.940
biggest blockbuster movies that the world
has ever seen.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.880
With such an enormous and amazing cast, we
can guarantee that being on set for the making

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.000
of this film must have been seriously fun.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.309
The gag reel from Civil War definitely backs
this up as it shows members of the cast constantly

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.930
cracking up or dancing around between takes.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.080
One particularly funny moment comes when Vision,
played by Paul Bettany, is trying to deliver

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.210
a somewhat serious line but unfortunately
he keeps jumbling up the words.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:11.380
He takes a second try at the line, but the
result is no better.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.360
He and everyone around him start to laugh
showing off how well this star-studded cast

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.770
really got along.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.800
X-Men – Days Of Future Past
We aren’t quite sure why, but it seems like

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.280
playing a Marvel movie character makes actors
always want to dance around as the X-Men Days

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.500
Of Future Past gag reel showcases a lot of
the casts best moves.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.470
From Magneto to Quicksilver, everyone seems
to be getting down between takes and it definitely

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.310
looks like they are having a good a lot of
fun.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.020
While the dancing could have probably ruined
some of the more serious and intense scenes,

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.270
we think that some of it could have been placed
strategically to add some funny quirks to

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.270
some of the characters.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.560
At this point, we aren’t really sure what
direction the franchise is heading, but one

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:58.069
thing is for sure, wherever it goes – there
will be dancing!

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.890
Guardians Of The Galaxy
With media buzz starting to pick up for 2017’s

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.030
hotly anticipated Guardians Of The Galaxy
2, we thought it was only appropriate to reflect

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.420
on a great blooper from the original movie
that shows how fun it really was to be a part

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.420
of this movie.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.160
Fans of Parks and Recreation already know
that Chris Pratt is a hilarious dude and a

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.440
lot of his funny quirks and lines made it
into the final cut of Guardians.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.850
One blooper that was left out came when Pratt
was flying his ship and started laughing maniacally.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.680
While it was funny, it was a bit too over
the top for this film but it is definitely

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.280
worth checking out on the gag reel.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.200
Chris Pratt is amazing in the franchise and
is one of main reasons that Marvel’s Guardians

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.350
Of The Galaxy was such a cosmic hit!

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.390
Iron Man 3
Iron Man is the hero that really sent the

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.280
world into the superhero movie craze that
it’s in today.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.470
Robert Downey Jr. is amazing in the titular
role and he totally redefined what it meant

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.670
to be a superhero.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.750
Over the years we have seen many clips of
how fun and ridiculous RDJ is to work with

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.090
on set, but what about a funny blooper from
his Iron Man costars.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.740
During the filming of Iron Man 3, there was
a scene where RDJ and Don Cheadle were making

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.440
Ben Kingsley make some undercover phone calls.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.550
Kingsley needed to disguise his voice and
this led to a great gag reel moment that had

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.220
Cheadle throwing out different dialects for
Kingsley to try to do.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.400
The moment is genuine and hilarious and does
a great job of showing off how fun it was

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.670
to be a part of this blockbuster hit.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.540
Daredevil
2003’s Daredevil is probably one of the

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.980
worst Marvel movie adaptations of all time
and we are thankful that Netflix has now done

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.390
the great comic book character justice in
their online series.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.280
As bad as the movie was, it still looks like
it was fun to be on set for its creation as

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.290
there are numerous gag reel moments that show
off Ben Affleck and his co-stars having a

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.290
good time.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.830
One particularly funny blooper comes when
Colin Farrell, who plays Bullseye in the film,

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.450
swoops into the shot on a harness.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.490
For some reason, he totally breaks character
and shows a big goofy smile.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.480
Not stopping there, Farrell then begins to
recite and act out the Lion’s lines from

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.480
The Wizard Of Oz.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.849
It’s probably not a good sign when your
blooper reel is more entertaining than your

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:12.460
actual movie, but at least it looks like the
actors behind Daredevil had fun.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.180
Deadpool
Deadpool was one of the biggest surprise hits

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.941
of 2016 and many movie critics are placing
it high on their lists for best films of the

00:04:18.941 --> 00:04:19.941
year.

00:04:19.941 --> 00:04:23.930
The action was great and the story was a lot
of fun but it was really the sly R rated comedy

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.320
that sets this movie apart.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.630
While Ryan Reynolds delivered most of the
most memorable lines, the outtakes to the

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.150
movie showcase just how funny long time comedian
TJ Miller really is.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.530
The gag reel shows Miller delivering line
after line of hilarious descriptions of what

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:46.400
Deadpool looks like after the surgery.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.120
The final cut of the film only included one
of these lines, which is unfortunate because

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:56.990
TJ Miller came up with some absolute zingers.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.650
Ant-Man
When you take a ridiculous comedian and brilliant

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.270
improviser like Paul Rudd and make him a superhero,
you are bound to have some hilarious behind

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.270
the scenes moments.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.639
This was definitely the case when it came
to filming 2015’s Ant-Man.

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:12.030
As with a lot of other Marvel movies, the
gag reel showcases the stars dancing around

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.710
a lot and really having a good time between
takes.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.470
There is on blooper from Ant Man that takes
the cake though and that comes when Paul Rudd

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.960
realizes that he has just sworn with child
actor Abby Ryder Fortson in his arms.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.580
The best part is that the scene totally breaks
down when Abby calls out Rudd for saying a

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.900
bad word and the whole crew starts laughing.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.400
It is a genuinely hilarious moment and we
can understand why Marvel has started casted

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.430
gifted comedians as leads in their films.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.220
Thor The Dark World

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.800
Thor is probably one of the most ridiculous
characters in The Avengers and we wouldn’t

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.080
be surprised if Chris Hemsworth’s career
veered towards comedy once he is done playing

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.080
the Asgardian.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.360
We have already showcased how much trouble
Thor’s hammer caused the cast and crew during

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.419
filming but it turns out that his iconic red
cape was a real troublemaker as well.

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:59.460
Some hilarious bloopers from the gag reel
for Thor The Dark World show Hemsworth’s

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.610
cape getting in the way by covering the face
of his scene mates and sometimes even his

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:04.610
own.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.050
Each time, this wardrobe malfunction causes
everyone in the scene to start laughing and

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.470
totally break character.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.470
This movie may not have ended up being super
fun, but it looks like the production of it

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.210
totally was!

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.020
Spiderman: Homecoming

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.300
While the world won’t get to see Spiderman
Homecoming until summer 2017, there have already

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.110
been a lot of leaked behind the scenes moments
that have assured us that being on set for

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.370
this movie must have been a blast.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.320
Holland has already shown off his serious
acrobatic skills from his time as a gymnast

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.639
but the world went a little crazy when an
Instagram video was posted showing him break

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:40.330
dancing while in his Spiderman motion capture
suit.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.170
Holland has also posted some fun pictures
of himself as Spiderman that really make it

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.800
seem like they were having a good time working
on this movie.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.660
The first trailer for Spiderman Homecoming
set the Internet a blaze and it is definitely

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:57.930
one of the most anticipated movies of 2017.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.100
The Avengers
Back in 2012, The Avengers really introduced

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.199
the world to how awesome shared movie universes
can be with their epic group film.

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:08.580
While this movie must have taken a tremendous
amount of work, it looks like it was also

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.759
a lot of fun to make.

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:13.460
After looking at the gag reel, it seems like
this star-studded cast was always in the mood

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:18.570
to shake it on set and the camera captured
the actors dancing around on numerous occasions.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:22.100
There is footage of Chris Evans wiggling around
in his Captain America suit and even some

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.930
hilarious clips of Jeremy Renner fist pumping
with his Hawkeye attire on.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.889
The Avengers cast has always been admired
for its on screen chemistry and it looks like

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:36.150
all these super powered stars get along between
takes as well!

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.950
So there’s our list of 10 Marvel movies
that show their stars having a lot of fun

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:40.950
on set.
