00:00:00.272 --> 00:00:01.377
- [Voiceover] So, I'm gonna give

00:00:01.377 --> 00:00:04.644
another quick overview of photosynthesis.

00:00:04.644 --> 00:00:08.811
And this time I'm gonna break
it down into two big stages.

00:00:09.864 --> 00:00:11.710
So, as you are probably familiar,

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.872
just looking at the word, photosynthesis.

00:00:13.872 --> 00:00:14.888
It essentially has two parts,

00:00:14.888 --> 00:00:16.526
it has photo and it has synthesis.

00:00:16.526 --> 00:00:18.747
The photo is referring to

00:00:18.747 --> 00:00:20.829
that it's going to use light somehow.

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:22.993
And what's it going to do
with that light energy?

00:00:22.993 --> 00:00:24.987
Well, it's going to synthesize something.

00:00:24.987 --> 00:00:27.816
And, in particular, what
it's going to synthesize,

00:00:27.816 --> 00:00:29.322
as we'll see, is sugar.

00:00:29.322 --> 00:00:33.266
So, we are going to go
from energy in light,

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:36.888
let me just write light, light energy,

00:00:36.888 --> 00:00:41.151
and we're going to use that
light energy to synthesize,

00:00:41.151 --> 00:00:42.901
to synthesize, sugar,

00:00:44.734 --> 00:00:45.858
very broadly speaking.

00:00:45.858 --> 00:00:48.750
Obviously this is a very,
very high-level overview.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.623
The light energy isn't
the only input here.

00:00:51.623 --> 00:00:54.751
We're also going to need some water

00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:55.886
and as we go into future videos,

00:00:55.886 --> 00:00:57.297
we'll see what that water's used for.

00:00:57.297 --> 00:00:59.428
It's actually a source of electrons.

00:00:59.428 --> 00:01:00.563
To do this,

00:01:00.563 --> 00:01:03.711
to make use of that light energy, frankly.

00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:08.330
And we're also going to
need some carbon dioxide,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.034
really as a source of carbons,

00:01:11.034 --> 00:01:14.113
because there's a lot of
carbon in those sugars.

00:01:14.113 --> 00:01:15.879
We're essentially going to fix the carbon.

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:18.790
We're gonna take it from
this carbon dioxide gas,

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.524
and we're going to incorporate
it into organic molecules

00:01:21.524 --> 00:01:24.535
and eventually into the sugar.

00:01:24.535 --> 00:01:26.232
And sugar isn't the only output.

00:01:26.232 --> 00:01:31.078
Another bi-product of this
process is molecular oxygen.

00:01:31.078 --> 00:01:35.726
Once you strip a couple of
electrons from the water,

00:01:35.726 --> 00:01:38.983
and the hydrogen ions are
stripped away from it as well,

00:01:38.983 --> 00:01:41.566
all you're left with is oxygen.

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:44.085
And you do that twice,

00:01:44.085 --> 00:01:46.582
then you have o two and
you have molecular oxygen.

00:01:46.582 --> 00:01:49.029
And this is a bi-product
of photosynthesis,

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:50.806
but you can imagine this is very important

00:01:50.806 --> 00:01:52.760
to life on earth as we know it,

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.004
in particular for us.

00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:55.208
We would have trouble breathing

00:01:55.208 --> 00:01:59.520
if this was not a bi-product
of photosynthesis.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.346
Now what I'm gonna do
now is break this out

00:02:01.346 --> 00:02:02.925
into two stages.

00:02:02.925 --> 00:02:03.892
And these two stages,

00:02:03.892 --> 00:02:07.392
we can call the light-dependent reactions.

00:02:08.501 --> 00:02:10.668
Light-dependent reactions,

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.192
and then the second stage,

00:02:18.192 --> 00:02:21.034
I will call the Calvin cycle.

00:02:21.034 --> 00:02:22.867
Calvin, Calvin, cycle.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.669
And as the name implies,

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:30.094
the light-dependent reactions
are dependent on light.

00:02:30.094 --> 00:02:31.722
So, what's happening here is,

00:02:31.722 --> 00:02:34.307
we're gonna take light energy.

00:02:34.307 --> 00:02:35.363
Light energy.

00:02:35.363 --> 00:02:39.530
Plus we're gonna take the
water as a source of electrons,

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.067
and we're going to use these two things.

00:02:44.067 --> 00:02:47.651
We're going to use these
two things to produce,

00:02:47.651 --> 00:02:50.099
to produce, let me write
this in another color,

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.099
to produce ATP from ADP,

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.149
so we're gonna produce ATP,

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:57.799
which is a store of energy,

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.966
and we're also going to
reduce NADP plus into NADPH,

00:03:07.107 --> 00:03:11.010
which has energy as a
strong reducing agent.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.221
So this is what is
happening, broadly speaking,

00:03:13.221 --> 00:03:14.632
in the light reactions.

00:03:14.632 --> 00:03:16.872
And then in the Calvin
cycle, what we're gonna do

00:03:16.872 --> 00:03:19.003
is we're gonna take these products

00:03:19.003 --> 00:03:22.142
of the light-dependent reactions,

00:03:22.142 --> 00:03:25.642
so we're gonna take our ATP and our NADPH,

00:03:28.981 --> 00:03:31.776
and we can use their energy in conjunction

00:03:31.776 --> 00:03:34.194
with some carbon dioxide,

00:03:34.194 --> 00:03:37.068
with some carbon dioxide,

00:03:37.068 --> 00:03:38.804
in order to produce,

00:03:38.804 --> 00:03:41.538
in order to produce, sugar.

00:03:41.538 --> 00:03:43.705
In order to produce sugar.

00:03:45.132 --> 00:03:47.658
And, let me see, have
I got everything here?

00:03:47.658 --> 00:03:50.145
Oh, of course, I'm missing
one of the bi-products

00:03:50.145 --> 00:03:51.448
of the light-dependent reactions.

00:03:51.448 --> 00:03:53.156
A very important one.

00:03:53.156 --> 00:03:57.133
I'm missing the molecular,
the molecular oxygen.

00:03:57.133 --> 00:04:00.547
So, once again, this is what
makes up photosynthesis,

00:04:00.547 --> 00:04:02.906
but you can break it up
into these two segments.

00:04:02.906 --> 00:04:05.353
Light-dependent reaction
is using the energy

00:04:05.353 --> 00:04:09.884
from photons in light along
with electrons from the water

00:04:09.884 --> 00:04:13.717
to produce, to store
energy, as ATP and NADPH,

00:04:14.848 --> 00:04:18.538
and has oxygen, molecular
oxygen, as a bi-product.

00:04:18.538 --> 00:04:20.424
In order for it to get
one molecular oxygen,

00:04:20.424 --> 00:04:23.138
you're gonna have to need
two of these water molecules.

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:25.950
And then, as we go into the Calvin cycle,

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.990
we can take these, the ATP and the NADPH,

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.526
along with some carbon dioxide,

00:04:31.526 --> 00:04:35.276
and we can use that to
actually store energy

00:04:35.276 --> 00:04:36.609
as actual sugar.

00:04:38.187 --> 00:04:39.460
And as we'll do in future videos,

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.059
we'll go into more depth and see

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:43.062
what exactly happens in these
light-dependent reactions,

00:04:43.062 --> 00:04:46.879
and what exactly happens
in the Calvin cycle.
