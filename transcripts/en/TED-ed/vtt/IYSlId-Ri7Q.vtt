00:00:15.326 --> 00:00:18.803
I like to think of life science as one big pyramid.

00:00:18.803 --> 00:00:22.765
Let's call the pyramid, "biological organization".

00:00:22.765 --> 00:00:25.768
Let's work our way from very small and specific concepts

00:00:25.768 --> 00:00:29.084
to very large and complex topics.

00:00:29.084 --> 00:00:31.031
So let's start at the tip of the pyramid,

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:34.620
with something so small, it can't be seen by the human eye,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.416
a single cell.

00:00:36.416 --> 00:00:39.540
A cell by itself is the most basic component of life.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.700
A single cell, which is capable of living on its own,

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.287
is called a unicellular organism,

00:00:45.287 --> 00:00:48.076
organisms like bacteria or protists.

00:00:48.076 --> 00:00:51.042
These organisms are everywhere you look,

00:00:51.042 --> 00:00:52.388
you just can't see them.

00:00:52.388 --> 00:00:54.002
But, when cells join together,

00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:56.004
with more than one cell like itself

00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:57.843
to perform a similar function,

00:00:57.843 --> 00:01:00.893
it's no longer a unicellular organism.

00:01:00.893 --> 00:01:02.430
It's then called a tissue.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.765
No, not that kind of tissue.

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:07.641
There are four types of tissues found in the human body:

00:01:07.641 --> 00:01:08.557
connective,

00:01:08.557 --> 00:01:09.165
muscle,

00:01:09.165 --> 00:01:09.770
nervous,

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.067
and epithelial.

00:01:11.067 --> 00:01:13.352
Bone tissue is a type of connective tissue

00:01:13.352 --> 00:01:15.828
and it's not flimsy like a Kleenex at all.

00:01:15.828 --> 00:01:17.778
Blood is also an example

00:01:17.778 --> 00:01:21.366
of the same cells working together to perform the same job,

00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.422
but it's a liquid,

00:01:22.422 --> 00:01:24.755
again, not like a Kleenex at all.

00:01:24.755 --> 00:01:26.741
No matter what the consistency is,

00:01:26.741 --> 00:01:29.291
a tissue is a group of the same cells,

00:01:29.291 --> 00:01:32.581
working together to perform a similar function.

00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:35.288
Any time there are different tissues working together,

00:01:35.288 --> 00:01:37.263
we then call it an organ.

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:39.884
That's the next level of the pyramid.

00:01:39.884 --> 00:01:42.260
Animals aren't the only ones with organs;

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.528
plants have organs too.

00:01:44.528 --> 00:01:46.724
When we find multiple different organs

00:01:46.724 --> 00:01:49.311
working together to perform the same job,

00:01:49.311 --> 00:01:52.146
we then call it an organ system.

00:01:52.146 --> 00:01:54.693
Take the digestive system, for example.

00:01:54.693 --> 00:01:56.110
It's made up of a mouth,

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.733
esophagus,

00:01:56.733 --> 00:01:57.401
stomach,

00:01:57.401 --> 00:01:58.194
pancreas,

00:01:58.194 --> 00:01:58.736
liver,

00:01:58.736 --> 00:01:59.452
gall bladder,

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:00.451
small intestine,

00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:01.911
and large intestine,

00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:03.658
also known as your colon.

00:02:03.658 --> 00:02:06.366
Although each individual organ in this organ system

00:02:06.366 --> 00:02:08.453
does a very different job,

00:02:08.453 --> 00:02:11.672
together, these organs work to achieve the one goal

00:02:11.672 --> 00:02:14.627
of taking all the nutrients out of the food we eat

00:02:14.627 --> 00:02:17.109
and getting rid of what we don't need.

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:18.963
An organ system, by definition,

00:02:18.963 --> 00:02:20.589
can only do one job,

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:22.445
like get the nutrients from our food,

00:02:22.445 --> 00:02:24.693
send and receive electrical signals,

00:02:24.693 --> 00:02:27.930
or exchange oxygen for carbon dioxide.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.441
Regardless of their individual function,

00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:32.850
all organ systems rely on one another

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.906
to do the vital jobs which they can't do themselves.

00:02:35.906 --> 00:02:37.940
If one organ system doesn't work,

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.975
the others will shut down, too.

00:02:39.975 --> 00:02:43.216
An organism is a complicated, living thing,

00:02:43.216 --> 00:02:45.223
which requires the proper functioning

00:02:45.223 --> 00:02:48.723
of multiple organ systems to maintain stability.

00:02:48.723 --> 00:02:52.165
This stability is called homeostasis.

00:02:52.165 --> 00:02:54.996
When all organ systems are working together

00:02:54.996 --> 00:02:57.203
and maintaining homeostasis,

00:02:57.203 --> 00:03:00.847
then it results in a happy, living organism.

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:03.512
Organisms are incredibly diverse

00:03:03.512 --> 00:03:05.620
and can be as simple as a bacteria

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.972
or as complex as you.

00:03:07.972 --> 00:03:09.723
When a group of the same organisms,

00:03:09.723 --> 00:03:11.504
also known as a species,

00:03:11.504 --> 00:03:13.557
live together in the same environment,

00:03:13.557 --> 00:03:16.273
we then call it a population.

00:03:16.273 --> 00:03:18.648
Often there are several populations

00:03:18.648 --> 00:03:20.797
all living in one environment.

00:03:20.797 --> 00:03:23.410
That is what we call a community.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.238
Each time you look out the window,

00:03:25.238 --> 00:03:27.407
you're seeing a community.

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:29.743
When we look at multiple communities,

00:03:29.743 --> 00:03:32.052
along with how all of the organisms

00:03:32.052 --> 00:03:34.288
interact with the physical environment,

00:03:34.288 --> 00:03:37.668
then we refer to it as an ecosystem.

00:03:37.668 --> 00:03:40.525
When you look at all the ecosystems of Earth together,

00:03:40.525 --> 00:03:41.826
you're looking at

00:03:41.826 --> 00:03:43.028
the Earth.

00:03:43.028 --> 00:03:45.246
The Earth is a big, round circle of life.

00:03:45.246 --> 00:03:47.408
That's why we call it a biosphere -

00:03:47.408 --> 00:03:48.866
bio, meaning life

00:03:48.866 --> 00:03:50.573
and sphere, meaning circle.

00:03:50.573 --> 00:03:52.052
And there you go!

00:03:52.052 --> 00:03:53.561
When you break it down to each level,

00:03:53.561 --> 00:03:55.957
a very complex concept and phrase

00:03:55.957 --> 00:03:58.148
becomes easy to understand.

00:03:58.148 --> 00:04:00.407
All life starts with a single cell.

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:01.943
When cells join together,

00:04:01.943 --> 00:04:03.404
they are called a tissue.

00:04:03.404 --> 00:04:06.281
A group of different tissues are called an organ,

00:04:06.281 --> 00:04:10.156
and a group of different organs are an organ system.

00:04:10.156 --> 00:04:12.694
A group of organ systems working together

00:04:12.694 --> 00:04:14.171
make up an organism,

00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:17.710
and a group of the same organisms are a population.

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.383
Combining several different populations together

00:04:20.383 --> 00:04:21.715
give us a community.

00:04:21.715 --> 00:04:24.662
And several different communities in a large area

00:04:24.662 --> 00:04:26.460
is an ecosystem.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.602
And every ecosystem together

00:04:28.602 --> 00:04:30.638
makes up our biosphere.

00:04:30.638 --> 00:04:33.881
And that, my friends, is biological organization,

00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:36.762
the pyramid of life.
