00:00:06.857 --> 00:00:10.397
Is there a disease 
that makes us love cats,

00:00:10.397 --> 00:00:12.450
and do you have it?

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.570
Maybe,

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.011
and it's more likely than you'd think.

00:00:16.011 --> 00:00:18.486
We're talking about toxoplasmosis,

00:00:18.486 --> 00:00:22.608
a disease caused by toxoplasma gondii.

00:00:22.608 --> 00:00:27.450
Like all parasites, toxoplasma lives
at the expense of its host,

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.451
and needs its host to produce offspring.

00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:35.042
To do that, toxo orchestrates a brain
manipulation scheme

00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:36.354
involving cats,

00:00:36.354 --> 00:00:37.666
their rodent prey,

00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:40.978
and virtually all other birds and mammals,

00:00:40.978 --> 00:00:43.083
including humans.

00:00:43.083 --> 00:00:47.856
Documented human infections go as far back
as ancient Egypt.

00:00:47.856 --> 00:00:50.605
We found samples in mummies.

00:00:50.605 --> 00:00:54.478
Today, about a third of the world's
population is infected,

00:00:54.478 --> 00:00:57.260
and most of them never even know it.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.760
In healthy people, symptoms often
don't show up at all.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.197
When they do, they're mild and flu-like.

00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:06.833
But those are just the physical symptoms.

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:10.477
Toxoplasma also nestles into our brains

00:01:10.477 --> 00:01:14.149
and meddles with our behavior
behind the scenes.

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.928
To understand why, let's take a look
at the parasite's life cycle.

00:01:18.928 --> 00:01:22.677
While the parasite can multiply
in practically any host,

00:01:22.677 --> 00:01:27.298
it can only reproduce sexually
in the intestines of cats.

00:01:27.298 --> 00:01:31.678
The offspring, called oocysts,
are shed in the cat's feces.

00:01:31.678 --> 00:01:36.270
A single cat can shed up to 
a hundred million oocysts.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.728
If another animal, like a mouse,
accidentally ingests them,

00:01:40.728 --> 00:01:45.486
they'll invade the mouse's tissues
and mature to form tissue cysts.

00:01:45.486 --> 00:01:47.792
If the mouse gets eaten by a cat,

00:01:47.792 --> 00:01:51.198
the tissue cysts become active
and release offspring

00:01:51.198 --> 00:01:54.076
that mate to form new oocysts,

00:01:54.076 --> 00:01:55.698
completing the cycle.

00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:56.865
But there's a problem.

00:01:56.865 --> 00:02:01.476
A mouse's natural desire to avoid
a cat makes it tough to close this loop.

00:02:01.476 --> 00:02:04.762
Toxoplasma has a solution for that.

00:02:04.762 --> 00:02:10.230
The parasites invade white blood cells
to hitch a ride to the brain

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:14.260
where they seem to override the innate
fear of predators.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.178
Infected rodents are more reckless
and have slower reaction times.

00:02:19.178 --> 00:02:24.479
Strangest of all, they're actually
attracted to feline urine,

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:28.263
which probably makes them more likely
to cross paths with a cat

00:02:28.263 --> 00:02:31.363
and help the parasite 
complete its life cycle.

00:02:31.363 --> 00:02:33.791
How does the parasite pull this off?

00:02:33.791 --> 00:02:38.837
Although the exact mechanism isn't known,
toxo appears to increase dopamine,

00:02:38.837 --> 00:02:44.013
a brain neurotransmitter that is involved
in novelty-seeking behavior.

00:02:44.013 --> 00:02:48.859
Thus, one idea is that toxo tinkers
with neurotransmitters,

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:52.226
the chemical signals 
that modulate emotions.

00:02:52.226 --> 00:02:53.332
The result?

00:02:53.332 --> 00:02:55.041
Fatal attraction.

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:58.704
But mice aren't the only animals
that end up with these parasites,

00:02:58.704 --> 00:03:03.791
and that's where humans,
and all of toxo's other hosts, come in.

00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:08.984
We can accidentally ingest oocysts
in contaminated water,

00:03:08.984 --> 00:03:10.855
or unwashed produce,

00:03:10.855 --> 00:03:12.892
or from playing in sandboxes,

00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:15.362
or cleaning out litter boxes.

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:20.825
This is behind the common recommendation
that pregnant women not change cat litter.

00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:23.709
Toxo can cause serious birth defects.

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.679
We can also get toxo 
from eating undercooked meat

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:30.512
from other animals that picked up
some oocysts.

00:03:30.512 --> 00:03:34.060
And it turns out that toxo can mess with
our brains, too.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.292
Studies have found connections between
toxo and schizophrenia,

00:03:38.292 --> 00:03:39.768
biopolar disorder,

00:03:39.768 --> 00:03:41.643
obsessive compulsive disorder,

00:03:41.643 --> 00:03:43.638
and aggression.

00:03:43.638 --> 00:03:47.326
It also slows reactions 
and decreases concentration,

00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:51.727
which may be why one study found
that people involved in traffic accidents

00:03:51.727 --> 00:03:56.846
were almost three times more likely
to have toxoplasma.

00:03:56.846 --> 00:04:01.919
So is toxo manipulating our brains
as an evolutionary strategy

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:05.792
to get predatory cats to eat us?

00:04:05.792 --> 00:04:09.367
Or are our brains just similar enough
to a rodent's

00:04:09.367 --> 00:04:15.140
that the same neurological tricks that
lure them in catch us in the net, too?

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.196
And is toxo the reason so many people
love cats and keep them as pets?

00:04:21.196 --> 00:04:23.888
Well, the jury's still out on that one.

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:26.697
Some recent studies 
even contradict the idea.

00:04:26.697 --> 00:04:31.358
Regardless, toxoplasma has definitely
benefited from humans

00:04:31.358 --> 00:04:34.422
to become one of the world's 
most successful parasites.

00:04:34.422 --> 00:04:38.355
It's not just our willingness to let
cats on our dining room tables

00:04:38.355 --> 00:04:39.793
or in our beds.

00:04:39.793 --> 00:04:42.865
Raising livestock 
and building cities which attract rodents

00:04:42.865 --> 00:04:45.452
has provided billions of new hosts,

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:49.636
and you and your cat may be two of them.
