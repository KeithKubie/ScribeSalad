00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So because we're going to be writing an interpreter for JavaScript in HTML,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
we're only really going to be able to interpret good programs successfully.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
That means we want to recognize and rule out bad programs.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So here you can conceptually imagine some sort of border patrol or

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
gateway crossing where our diligent customs agent is going to keep out bad programs,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
like this "1"+2, while allowing in super-happy-fun programs like 1+2.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The process of looking at a program's source code, looking at its text,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
looking at the letters that make it up, and trying to see if it's going to be well-behaved or not

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
is known as type checking or semantic analysis.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And as you may already guess, it's not going to be perfect

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but it's going to be pretty good.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Type checking and semantic analysis.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Semantic means "meaning."

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We're going to break a program down into its meaning.

00:00:46.000 --> 09:59:59.000
And I'm going to explain types in just a minute.
