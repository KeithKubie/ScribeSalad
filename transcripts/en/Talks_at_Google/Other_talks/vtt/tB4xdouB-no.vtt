INTERVIEWER: Hi.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.530
I'm here today with
Rob Sheffield.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.000
Rob is a music critic,
an author.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.260
He's written three books at
this point, "Love is a Mix

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.570
Tape," "Talking With Girls About
Duran Duran," and "Turn

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.090
Around Bright Eyes," which
just was issued.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.930
ROB SHEFFIELD: Yeah.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.220
INTERVIEWER: Ostensibly, the
book's about karaoke.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.280
But it also kind of looks at how
and why we love and how we

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.600
kind of process and absorb loss,
and specifically the

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.060
loss of your wife.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.310
And as well, it also kind of
looks at how we rebuild.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.700
And it tracks the blossoming of
your relationship with your

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.580
current wife.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.320
And it does all this through
the lens of karaoke.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.370
ROB SHEFFIELD: Karaoke explains

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.360
everything in my worldview.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.450
INTERVIEWER: So for most of us,
karaoke is something we do

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.010
maybe after a few
drinks at a bar.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.370
And it's fun, but that's kind
of the significance it has.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.390
But obviously, it plays a
greater role in your life.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.260
And you use the book
to track that.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.600
But how could you sum that up
for the audience here, in

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.200
terms of the importance
of karaoke?

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.070
ROB SHEFFIELD: Karaoke, it's a
beautiful thing because it

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.870
lets anybody participate in
music, even those of us with

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.240
no skill whatsoever.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.440
Are there actual
musicians here?

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.000
Musicians?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.120
Someone?

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.720
All right.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.400
Some musical talent is
represented in the room.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.840
That is not where I come in.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.090
I have none at all.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.460
Always wanted to sing.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.130
Always dreamed of it.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.280
Always been someone
who loves music.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.650
Grew up obsessive about it.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.660
My parents, they were like '50s
rock and rollers, and I

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.250
grew up in the '70s, '80s.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.890
I was always obsessed with
music, and yet all my attempts

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.620
to sing or play an instrument
were just disastrous because I

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.980
just do not have that thing
that is required.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.530
I still have a guitar next to
my desk that I've had there

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.720
for 20 years that I always
think, this is going to be the

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.360
year that I learn
to play guitar.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.840
I'm going to finally
learn some chords.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.970
The closest I ever got was the
summer of '86, I learned the

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.330
chords to "Wild Thing." And I
made a tape because I knew

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.110
that it was going to wear
off after a few hours.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.060
And I still have this tape
of me playing "Wild

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.420
Thing" for 20 minutes.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.980
And even the chord changes, so
it's like [HUMMING], and I

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.130
never got any better
than that.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.780
That was my peak
as a musician.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.780
I'm glad I documented it.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.390
So karaoke actually
allows me to

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.640
participate in making music.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.820
As far as I'm concerned,
miraculous.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:37.620
Greatest thing ever.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.020
INTERVIEWER: I was trying to
track whether you were talking

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.280
about the old-school "Wild
Thing" or the Tone Loc one.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.710
ROB SHEFFIELD: Yes.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.190
That one I can rap.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.060
That one's a lot easier.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.450
But it's fun because karaoke
is something that, once it

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.400
arrived in this country,
people started

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.510
to realize it existed.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.720
And people instantly
wanted more of it.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.500
It's amazing how fast it spread,
and that 20 years ago,

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.840
it was pretty much unknown
in the US.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.630
But that it's just this amazing
way of sharing music

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.370
and way of participating in
music that lets anybody in.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.750
All the barbarians
at the musical

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.630
gates are welcome inside.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.090
INTERVIEWER: And this book, as
well as your first one, is

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.430
almost structured like a mix
tape, where you use certain

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.930
songs as points of departure.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.220
How do you pick these songs?

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.080
ROB SHEFFIELD: I guess for the
things that I wanted to write

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.400
about, sometimes the songs
suggested themselves.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.360
Like I have a chapter
about my dad.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.050
And my dad really likes
to sing Elvis songs.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.460
And my dad, his voice is every
bit as bad as mine.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.920
And as a little kid, hearing
my dad sing along with the

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.420
radio, I always thought, wow.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.260
I hope I inherit all the awesome
things about my dad,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.060
but not the voice.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.970
Yeah, yeah.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.110
That, of course, I got, as well
as, fortunately, many of

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.370
his other wonderful qualities.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.200
But so that chapter, the song
that set me off, and the song

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.140
I listened to while
writing it, was

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.820
"Heartbreak Hotel," by Elvis.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.640
Because that song has like
three notes in it.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.485
My dad can't even do that one.

00:04:15.485 --> 00:04:15.980
[SINGING]

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.829
Since my baby left me, I found
a new place to dwell.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.730
And it's not a hard
song to sing.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.030
That's why it was the song that
Bill Clinton played on

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.950
saxophone on "The Arsenio Hall
Show." Super easy song.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.230
But for me, I don't really
talk about Elvis

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.580
or the song so much.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.370
Just that song is a way into
the topic of my dad and my

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.310
life as his son.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.960
Because all the different sort
of emotional relationships in

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.730
my life, because for me, music
is just the way that I

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.450
translate all the other
aspects of my life.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.000
So read about all these
different relationships, my

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.930
life as a son, my life as a
brother, my life as a husband,

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.360
my life as a friend.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.140
And yet music is always the tool
that I think is going to

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.590
unlock these mysteries for me.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.100
INTERVIEWER: Sure.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.570
I guess for people such as
yourself, it provides a

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.280
certain sort of structure
by which to view life.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.080
So it kind of makes sense that
the book would unfold by that.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.160
You mentioned earlier that
neither you nor your father is

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.970
a particularly talented
singer, per se.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.500
And yet you're a karaoke
fanatic.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.450
So what does go into a good
karaoke performance, if it's

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.140
not the technical
singing ability?

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.830
ROB SHEFFIELD: It just comes
down to just enthusiasm and

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.190
passion and courage, if
courage is required.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.300
Something that blows my mind,
it's kind of like when I was a

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.390
teenager in Boston, I was going
to punk rock shows.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.300
There'd be the Saturday
afternoon hardcore matinee

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.120
shows, which were the all-ages
shows, with just a crummy

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.100
local band, douchebag
kids my age just

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.720
plugging in their guitars.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.350
Not any more talented than I
was, but they were getting up

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.910
and doing it.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.960
And I used to love to go to
those all-ages hardcore shows

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.590
and always totally get
my ass kicked.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.120
But that was part of the fun
was that these guys, they

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.050
weren't waiting for anybody to
tell them they were good

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.570
enough to play music.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.920
They just got up there
and did it.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.770
And karaoke has that same kind
of punk rock spirit where, if

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.100
you're willing to get
up and do it,

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.480
that's all that's required.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.620
You just have to put yourself
up there and be willing to

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.080
risk a certain amount
of ridicule.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.590
INTERVIEWER: Was there stage
fright the first time you

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:29.250
tried this out?

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.310
ROB SHEFFIELD: Yeah,
terrifying.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.200
I still remember the first time
so well because it was

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.440
something that I dreamed
of all my life.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.940
have Everybody does the thing
in the bathroom mirror, with

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.700
the hair dryer as the guitar
and the hair brush as the

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.820
microphone.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.080
But I never got any further than
the mirror in terms of

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.330
that fantasy.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.920
I was out to dinner
with some friends.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.370
And they're total
karaoke fiends.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.480
And they were like, yeah,
we're going to sing.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.780
And I was like, yeah,
I'll sit.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:04.390
I'll enjoy.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.280
I'll listen to my friends.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:05.890
I'll clap.

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:08.010
I'll soak up the vibe.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.500
And that'll be that.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:15.620
And seeing them do it, but
also seeing just the way

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:21.050
everybody had so much fun with
it, kind of lured me in.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:27.920
And I sang a song by ELO, this
unbelievably great rock

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.580
classics of the '70s, where
"Telephone Line," everybody

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.110
remembers that ELO song.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.380
I was like, yeah, let's go
up-tempo on this one that

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.930
everybody can sing "Doo wop
dooby dooby wop." I forgot

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.440
that before you get to that
chorus, you go through some of

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.440
the most depressing, desolate,
lonely, desperate verses,

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.910
where they guy's on the phone.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:49.240
He's like, hello.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.790
How are you?

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:51.210
Have you been--

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.790
he's just talking to her
ringing phone because

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.290
answering machine's weren't
even invented yet.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:00.420
So he's just talking to
the ringing phone.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.510
And I was like, OK, if I can
just get to the chorus with

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:06.120
the "Doo wop dooby dooby wop,"
it's going to be OK.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.030
And it was.

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.250
And I was obsessed instantly.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.710
INTERVIEWER: I know you talk
some in the book, I believe,

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:14.330
about certain songs that have
been detached from their

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.670
meaning, like "One," U2's, for
example, which is not a love

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:20.320
song, per se, but people kind
of interpret it as such.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.910
What sort of feedback have you
gotten from actual musicians

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.460
about how they feel
about people doing

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.810
karaoke for their tracks?

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.740
ROB SHEFFIELD: Something that
blows my mind is how much

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.240
actual musicians love karaoke.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.400
It's really funny how much real
rock stars, who actually

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.400
have their own songs and their
own audiences and their own

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.669
concert halls--

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:47.780
I remember the first time I was
talking to Simon Le Bon of

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:54.490
Duran Duran, Nick Rhodes, two
of my all-time rock idols.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:56.270
And I'd just written a book

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:57.670
name-checking them in the title.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:02.120
And I was interviewing them
for "Rolling Stone."

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.620
And they said, well, what's
your next book about?

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.610
And I said, well, I have this
idea that I want to write

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:06.330
about karaoke.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.160
And they were like,
oh, karaoke!

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.670
And Simon Le Bon told me that
the first time he ever sang

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:14.160
karaoke was in the
'80s in Malaysia.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.210
And they'd never heard
of karaoke before.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:18.370
And they saw it in
a karaoke bar.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:23.260
And he got up and sang "Material
Girl," and Elton

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.470
John's manager just got up
there and started doing a

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.360
strip tease.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.170
And the way he talked about it,
like he remembered-- and I

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.980
was like, dude.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.400
You're an actual rock star.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.920
You don't have to
sing "Material

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.120
Girl" to get an audience.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.240
You've been singing your own
songs in front of your own

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.340
crowds for 30 years.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.430
But he still remembers
that night.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:42.740
And that kind of
blows my mind.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:47.855
A friend of mine interviewed
Robert Plant for "Rolling

00:09:47.855 --> 00:09:50.040
Stone." Robert Plant just had
the most amazing story about

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.410
doing karaoke in China, where
nobody recognized him, nobody

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:54.480
had heard of him.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.500
And he was like, I'm going to
bring the house down, because

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.230
there was a karaoke contest
at the end of the night.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.550
And he did Elvis, "It's
Now or Never."

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:04.970
And he said, but I
came in second.

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:08.610
I was beaten by a guy from
Taiwan doing Tony Orlando and

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:12.190
Dawn, "Tie a Yellow Ribbon
'Round the Old Oak Tree." And

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:13.320
Robert Plant was like, wait.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.590
How did I get beaten by
this dude singing

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:16.780
"Tie a Yellow Ribbon"?

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:19.485
And I think that's what rock
stars love about karaoke is

00:10:19.485 --> 00:10:23.040
that fantasy that, if they
didn't have the name and the

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.110
reputation and the myth to fall
back on, that they could

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:28.260
still start over from
scratch and just

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.460
earn it all over again.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:33.230
And that karaoke sort of lets
them slum it in the trenches

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.970
with the rest of us.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:39.940
So it's funny that actual
musicians, however they might

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.470
fear the way I butcher their
songs in the karaoke bar--

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.160
I wouldn't want them to hear
me do it-- but funny how

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.550
actual, actual rockers, there's
something in it that

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:48.590
responds to them.

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:49.680
INTERVIEWER: I assume
this was all done in

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.300
the pre-YouTube era.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.680
ROB SHEFFIELD: Yes.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:59.300
OK, the combination of karaoke
and video is absolutely crazy.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:03.300
I was singing karaoke,
a couple months ago.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:08.150
This is how I find out that
Vine was invented, a very

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:11.650
traumatic way to discover
that Vine was invented.

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:15.600
I was singing with a sort of
mixed crowd generationally.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:21.120
There were some of us who were
born before 1990, who, for

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.150
lack of a better collective
noun, I

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:24.480
will call normal people.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.610
And then there are people who
are after 1990, who are like--

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.840
and the next day, everybody
was emailing, like, yeah,

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.710
look, I put up this Vine
thing on Twitter.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:34.610
And I was like, Vine.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:35.520
I wonder what that is.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.460
Oh, it's seven seconds of me
singing Britney Spears's

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.960
"Toxic" in a very toxic site--

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.060
And I was like, wow.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.590
This exists now.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:45.690
Great.

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:51.260
I was like, the karaoke
humiliation boundaries have

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.150
been expanded.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:56.780
Thank you, Vine, for kicking
down that door.

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.950
INTERVIEWER: That touches on
an interesting aspect about

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:02.530
karaoke, the multi-generational
appeal.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:03.730
I think you mention
this in the book.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.090
But that is-- it's not an
exclusively American

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:09.560
experience, but it's a kind of
uniquely American experience,

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.360
in that I think you call
it maybe a democratic

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.530
environment, if I'm quoting
you correctly.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:17.140
ROB SHEFFIELD: Yeah.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.970
There's definitely nothing
quite like it in American

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:26.110
culture, the way America uses
karaoke, the way it brings

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:30.230
people from different age
groups, different tastes in

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.130
music, different cultural
backgrounds, different

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:39.150
personality types, all mixing it
up and performing for each

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:40.970
other and listening
to each other and

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:42.920
applauding each other.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:46.910
The most mind-blowing thing of
karaoke for me is that people

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:50.080
go there to enjoy listening to
other people sing badly.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.704
If you want to listen to
yourself sing badly, you can

00:12:52.704 --> 00:12:54.090
sing in the shower
or in the car.

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:54.660
We all do that.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.490
We sing to our plants, our
cats, like the mirror.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:00.970
But you go to karaoke, and it's
almost like we go there

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.220
to make each other stars.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.740
And you see ordinary people with
maybe even less talent

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:06.660
than yourself--

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:07.780
I've never had that
experience--

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:13.110
but where they're going up
there, and you cheer for them.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:16.670
And just seeing strangers
cheering for each other and

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:19.160
high-fiving each other, that's
a really mind-blowing aspect

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.015
of karaoke for me.

00:13:20.015 --> 00:13:21.890
INTERVIEWER: Well, I know you've
been a music critic

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:24.770
since you've been an editor
for "Stone" since '97.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:25.750
ROB SHEFFIELD: Yeah, '97.

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:29.080
INTERVIEWER: And it seems like
engaging with music via

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.460
criticism and engaging it via
karaoke are almost two

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:33.410
entirely different things.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:36.110
One's very solitary and very
critical, and the other's very

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:37.790
social and very celebratory.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:39.340
Do you get that at all?

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:39.560
ROB SHEFFIELD: Yeah.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:43.330
It's a weird kind of clash
between different parts of my

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:44.530
soul as a music fan.

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:50.240
Just because when you're a music
critic, you're kind of

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.990
kidding yourself that I have the
theory of how music works.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:58.220
I figure out how this stuff
operates, how it functions in

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:01.560
our lives, what music
should be like.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.870
There's all this kind of
arrogance of will to knowledge

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:07.660
that you can kid
yourself about.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.460
Then you go to the karaoke room,
and you're like, wow, I

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.000
don't understand anything.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.300
Music is so much weirder than
I could ever imagine.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.260
I was singing with a bunch of
friends a couple weeks ago,

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.790
and somebody did a song that
I have hated, hated, hated,

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.210
hated, hated since the '90s.

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:26.530
Does anybody remember
the Verve Pipe?

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:27.740
OK.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:28.580
They had a song.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:33.270
OK, that song had not crossed my
mind in well over 10 years.

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:36.310
And this dude, who was another
one of those awesome

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.940
22-year-olds, he gets up,
and he starts doing "The

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.150
Freshmen" the Verve.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.120
And I was like, OK.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.900
This is really weirding
me out.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.460
I never thought I was ever going
to hear this song again.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.480
The song, it's about
20 minutes long.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.830
There's a plot.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:54.610
I can't figure out quite what
the plot is, but it involves

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:54.865
[SINGING]

00:14:54.865 --> 00:14:57.680
oh, I am not responsible.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.560
And I was like, wow, I
hated this song then.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.490
I never expected to hear
it again in my life.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:04.590
But this is kind of awesome.

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:06.170
I'm really enjoying this.

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:10.530
And of course, I was like, OK,
if we're going to the '90s

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:13.130
one-hit wonders, I'll see your
Verve Pipe, and I'll raise you

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:16.370
a Primitive Radio Gods.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:20.000
But there's that thing of, you
think you have this idea of

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.410
how music works and what the
boundaries are and what the

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:26.630
confines are, and karaoke is a
place I always realize that

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:30.200
music is so much weirder than is
even comprehensible to me.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.080
INTERVIEWER: Is there any song
you've run into that's

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.480
completely karaoke-proof,

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.960
instrumentals aside, of course.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.030
But anything that can't be done
in a reasonable manner?

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.980
ROB SHEFFIELD: It's weird.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.340
Different--

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.740
it depends so much on the
vibe of the crowd.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.400
I used to go to this place
where they said, we

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.580
only have two rules.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.720
No "Stairway to Heaven," and no
"American Pie." And they're

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.680
like, they're both great songs,
but they're too long,

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:51.985
and they're too sad.

00:15:51.985 --> 00:15:55.050
Sometimes people, they feel like
doing a long, sad song,

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:59.100
like that damn Verve
Pipe song.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:03.570
And yet, if somebody brings that
requisite enthusiasm and

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:05.770
passion to it, you can listen
to a song that you've hated

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:09.370
for years and think, like, OK,
I get what this person hears

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.300
of themselves in this song.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.110
And I'm hearing, even
reluctantly, some of

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:15.480
myself in this song.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.120
INTERVIEWER: It seems like as
a music critic, you have the

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.620
ability to kind of break songs
down in terms of their

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:25.380
technical, mechanical component
parts, like the

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:28.030
bigger chorus, bridge
at a certain place.

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:30.580
Do you find yourself doing
that in terms of karaoke

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.220
songs, saying that--

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.675
listening to this, and this
would the perfect template for

00:16:34.675 --> 00:16:36.200
a karaoke jam?

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:36.550
ROB SHEFFIELD: Yeah.

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:40.750
It's wild how, just getting
into the sort of karaoke

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:45.740
mindset, but also having the
critical mindset to realize

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:49.670
how some people, when you
realize how they write songs

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:51.840
for their voice--

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.200
Neil Diamond is a
great example.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.610
I grew up in America, so
I love Neil Diamond.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:57.750
Always heard those songs.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.740
My parents always had
them on the radio.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:04.300
And I thought I knew those
songs, and I thought I

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.780
appreciated the Neil
Diamond cosmology.

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.869
And yet you sing them
in a karaoke bar,

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:10.420
and it's like, wow.

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:13.690
This guy, he really knows how
his voice works, what his

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:14.599
limitations are.

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:16.740
He has lots of breathing
spaces in his songs.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.369
So I like them a lot.

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:20.920
He likes to sing one line and
then wait about 30 seconds.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:21.940
You have [SINGING]

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.860
love on the rocks.

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.060
Ain't no big surprise.

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.670
And that man is pure
confidence,

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.660
pure superhuman bravado.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.780
And you hope a little that's
going to rub off on you when

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:35.960
you sing him.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.300
INTERVIEWER: So I know you
titled the book "Turn Around

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.380
Bright Eyes." It could have just
as easily been "Seeing My

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.270
Life" or any of the other
numerous chapters you have.

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:47.240
Why did you single out that
one particular song?

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.420
ROB SHEFFIELD: Well, "Total
Eclipse of the Heart" is one

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.820
of those karaoke things.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.680
You're always going to hear
it in a karaoke bar.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.280
It's like that and "Livin'
on a Prayer," "Don't Stop

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.320
Believin'." There are some
songs that you hear

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.100
them all the time.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.290
Once, I went to karaoke with
a friend of mine who's a

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:03.920
wedding video guy.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.360
And he was getting really
stressed out.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.470
He was like, just hearing "Don't
Stop Believin'" and

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:11.140
"Livin' on a Prayer" all night,
he's like, this is like

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.170
being at work.

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:16.440
Because those songs are
just requisite.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.090
For me, "Total Eclipse of the
Heart" is really personal

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:21.250
because that's the first song
that I sang as a karaoke duet

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:23.410
with my wife.

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:25.100
Which was just when
we first met.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:26.835
It was 10 years ago.

00:18:26.835 --> 00:18:30.100
I brought her to a party in
New York, in Chinatown.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.880
A friend of mine had
a loft party.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.750
In all candor, it was a fairly
druggy party, and it was kind

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:41.090
of a strange sort of vibe.

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:42.850
And of course, karaoke
was part of that.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:44.560
They had a couple
karaoke hosts.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.360
And I said to Ally, I was
like, let's do a duet.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.500
And she was like, yeah.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.270
And we picked out "Total
Eclipse of the Heart."

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:54.270
And she just instinctively did
the hard part, the [SINGING]

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:56.840
"Every now and then I get a
little--" But there's one part

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.130
of the song that has like 600
words, and it's really

00:18:59.130 --> 00:18:59.800
complicated.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.730
And there's one where it's
easy because it's just,

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:03.170
[SINGING]

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:04.825
"Turn around." And I was just
doing the [SINGING]

00:19:04.825 --> 00:19:07.180
"Turn around" and
turning around.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.150
And I was watching her.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:13.180
And she doesn't know anybody
in this room.

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:14.090
These are my friends.

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:18.190
And I was like, wow, this
chick is fearless.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.300
And I was like, wow.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.910
I feel like just singing this
song with her, I feel like I'm

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:23.670
learning all this
stuff about her.

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:28.980
And so it's funny that that
song, I just associate with

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:29.520
that moment.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.780
Because really, falling in love
with someone and karaoke,

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.850
they require the same kind of
courage, the same kind of

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:39.380
delusion, on some level.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.820
What the downside could be, and
yet you're like, OK, I'll

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:44.380
take a chance on this anyway.

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.810
And so for me, getting obsessed
with karaoke around

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:51.740
the same time that I was
starting my relationship with

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:57.225
her, for me, that song, "Total
Eclipse of the Heart," they

00:19:57.225 --> 00:20:00.700
were very, very woven in with
that sort of emotional change.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.195
INTERVIEWER: Would you two begin
to practice karaoke at

00:20:03.195 --> 00:20:04.660
home before going
out to karaoke?

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.170
ROB SHEFFIELD: No, I feel
like practicing karaoke

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:08.781
is kind of-- yeah.

00:20:08.781 --> 00:20:10.520
It's kind of like--

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.360
like remember when Trivial
Pursuit was new?

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.730
And my parents had a friend that
they would play Trivial

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:19.400
Pursuit with that they would
to try to learn.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.570
They would study the questions
so they could--

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:24.220
and I was like, that takes the
whole point out of it.

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.540
That makes it not
a game anymore.

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:30.250
Like they had a very uptight
couple friend who would quiz

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:34.120
each other on the yellows and
the browns, and they'd study

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.910
the cards so they
could remember.

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:38.130
I was like, that's not the way
the game is supposed to be--

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:39.770
and I feel like karaoke,
it's the same thing.

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:41.470
I feel like if you're actually
rehearsing--

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:44.460
although part of the thing is
that some people, what they

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:45.620
bring to it, they love
to rehearse.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.910
It makes them better singers.

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:48.780
I don't do it that way.

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:54.090
But everybody brings their
own karaoke mojo to it.

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:56.450
INTERVIEWER: I know in the book,
you also mention you and

00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:00.440
Ally's shared respect and
admiration for the music

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:05.700
critic Greil Marcus, who
wrote many, many books.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:06.870
Have you seen him karaoke?

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:08.880
Does he have a go-to karaoke
jam, do you think?

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.240
ROB SHEFFIELD: He told me
he has never karaoked.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:15.650
This is Greil Marcus, one of
my all-time writer heroes.

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.020
So he's written about music.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.490
And he actually had a band of
other authors that he played

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:24.310
in, the Rock Bottom Remainders
with Dave Barry and Stephen

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:28.380
King and Dave Marsh, and a
bunch of other flat-out

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:32.960
no-talents who were just writers
who enjoyed having

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.410
this garage band together.

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:36.500
And he said, I could
even do that.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:40.270
But the idea of karaokeing,
he was just like, no way.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:40.540
Never.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.430
Not in this life.

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:49.020
But it's funny that for music
critics and for those of us

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:52.080
who adopt a kind of--

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.160
who aspire to a certain studious
expertise about

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.600
music, it's weird how much of
that you have to let go of in

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.420
the karaoke room because all
your theories that you bring

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:04.130
in can be completely invalidated
by one dude

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:05.470
singing the Verve Pipe.

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:06.950
It's really great.

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:08.980
INTERVIEWER: I like Greil
Marcus and his book,

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:13.700
"Invisible Republic." He
positioned this Bob Dylan

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:16.910
song, "I'm Not There," as a
canonical Bob Dylan track,

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:19.170
which maybe, when he
wrote that book,

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:21.070
1,000 people have heard.

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:24.090
Do you have a similar sort
of holy grail of

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:26.985
karaoke that you--

00:22:26.985 --> 00:22:31.040
ROB SHEFFIELD: You know, there
are some songs that I like to

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:35.910
sing at karaoke because I kind
of think that these are songs

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:39.890
the world has forgotten, that
maybe one karaoke bar at a

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:41.300
time, we could sort
of revive them.

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.260
Because there's definitely the
phenomenon of songs that are

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.230
hits, then they disappear, and
then they kind of come back in

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:50.330
public consciousness, only
because of karaoke.

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:52.020
"Total Eclipse of the Heart"
is a good example.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.480
That's one that karaoke
made that song.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.870
That's a song that was a hit.

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:58.140
Then the radio was not
playing it anymore.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.830
But because people love to
sing in karaoke bars.

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:04.800
Another great example is
Ginuwine, "Pony," which was a

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.070
huge summer hit,
summer of '96.

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:08.320
I was living in the
South back then.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.465
You heard that song
everywhere.

00:23:09.465 --> 00:23:13.920
The most filthy song, the most
perfect song, and that's a

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.110
song that has come back, and
it's become famous again

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:19.260
strictly because people
love to karaoke it.

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:23.770
And it brings out something
super bold in

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:25.980
people, super brazen.

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.740
And so there are some songs that
I kind of always think,

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.480
maybe karaoke could perform
the same sort of

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.720
miracle for this song.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:37.370
Like Frankie Goes to Hollywood,
OK, they had a

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:40.240
sensitive love ballad called
"The Power of Love." It was

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:40.980
their third hit.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.980
Oh my god, I can't believe
you remember that song.

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:44.886
Nobody know that song.

00:23:44.886 --> 00:23:46.050
I'm kind of shocked.

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:48.630
Everybody remembers
Frankie say relax.

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:49.550
"Relax" is a great song.

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:50.590
Everybody can probably
sing that one.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:52.260
That's a great karaoke song.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:54.690
"Two Tribes," which was their
second hit, which was their

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:56.350
angry, serious, political
song.

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:58.690
And then they had their third
with "The Power of Love,"

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:01.560
which is their sensitive
ballad.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.200
And I adore that song.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.765
But you know, it's
like, [SINGING]

00:24:05.765 --> 00:24:10.800
"The power of love, a force
from above, a skyscraping

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:17.245
dove." It's really sort of
wiggity wack, as the late,

00:24:17.245 --> 00:24:20.200
great Kriss Kross would say.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.700
And I saw that song in a karaoke
book once, and I

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.230
almost had this feeling of--

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:28.040
I was spiritually obligated
to sing it.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.190
I was like, it's possible that
this song has been in this

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:32.970
karaoke book for years, and
not a single person

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:34.110
has ever sung it.

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:37.480
I just wanted it on the book,
somewhere in the karaoke

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.050
database, somewhere
that somebody,

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.190
somewhere sang this song.

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:44.050
And it was almost like I felt
an urgent need to do it.

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:45.340
And I warned my friends
before I did it.

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:48.200
I was like, you might not
like this one so much.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:51.740
And I was actually right.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:55.170
A lot of people were casually
taking their bathroom breaks

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:56.980
during that song.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:00.950
But there are always
obscurities, and sometimes you

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:03.720
discover them in the karaoke
bar, and you try to share them

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.670
in the karaoke bar.

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:06.140
That's part of what it's for.

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.260
INTERVIEWER: Do each kind of
karaoke bars have their own

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:10.620
nuance in terms of catalog
and playlists that

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:11.780
you can look for?

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:12.380
ROB SHEFFIELD: Yeah.

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:13.820
Every one of them
is different.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.460
Some of them are--

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:17.180
it's really funny.

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:21.270
Every karaoke bar has
its own vibe.

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:23.170
Some of them are super-sleazy.

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:24.090
They're dark.

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:27.040
They're almost like in old
movies, where you see the

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:27.970
opium dens.

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:29.080
It's like that kind of thing.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.290
Like people come there because
they need a fix of the singing

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:35.615
experience, and nobody wants
to be recognized.

00:25:35.615 --> 00:25:39.740
And there are other places that
are bright and festive.

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:41.940
And there are some places that
are family friendly.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.860
And there are some places that
are vaguely sinister.

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.570
And the song books are
always different.

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:51.670
There's this one place that I
love to go to in New York, in

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:57.200
Koreatown, called Music Story,
that has all these Yngwie

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:01.700
Malmsteen songs in the book,
Yngwie Malmsteen, the Swedish

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:02.850
death metal guitarist.

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:04.945
I was like, I didn't know his
songs even had words.

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:11.260
Nobody is a Malmsteen fan
because they like to sing

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:12.430
those songs.

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:14.640
But I was like, this is kind of
amazing that they're in the

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.320
karaoke book, which
means somebody,

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:17.730
somewhere is singing them.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:20.620
And that's part of the
beautiful thing.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:24.530
The same place that has 17
different songs in the book by

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:26.500
the Christian metal
band Stryper.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.560
And I was like, wow.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.890
I thought I probably knew more
about Stryper than a lot of my

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:34.120
friends, but I could not name
17 different Stryper songs.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:37.890
That's part of the magic
of every place we were.

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:39.260
INTERVIEWER: A Rhino comp
of undiscovered

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.740
karaoke cuts or something.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:45.880
But in the book, you kind of lay
out a timeline of karaoke.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.470
And I was surprised you didn't
mention the Scarlett

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:51.150
Johansson, Bill Murray scene
within "Lost in Translation."

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:54.410
But I think you circle back to
it, and listed as kind of the

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:57.195
perfect karaoke tune,
or a very ideal one.

00:26:57.195 --> 00:26:59.580
Can you discuss that at all?

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:03.410
ROB SHEFFIELD: Yeah, it's
[INAUDIBLE] because karaoke,

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:06.930
it's funny that it didn't take
long in the noughties for

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:10.510
movies to start realizing that
if you put a karaoke scene in

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:13.770
a movie, it's super effective
and super easy.

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:15.320
It requires no imagination.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:18.330
You just have characters just--
and this is their

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:21.030
awkward, ungainly
way of bonding.

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:24.420
And that you can put it in any
kind of move, a rom-com or a

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:28.490
crime thriller or
a goofy comedy.

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:33.750
And the karaoke scene is
always going to work.

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:35.170
There's this great one.

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:36.770
Really, this one always--

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:39.170
I was watching this recently
because "Breaking Bad" just

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:40.100
started a new season.

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:41.910
And there's that great
karaoke scene on

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:44.550
"Breaking Bad" where--

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:47.360
OK, total non-spoilerish,
how do I put this?

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:51.920
There was a character who's no
longer alive, and who had

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.450
vaguely criminal associations.

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:56.630
And the cops going through
his stuff, they're like,

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:57.290
wow, look at this.

00:27:57.290 --> 00:28:00.130
They find this karaoke video
he made in a karaoke bar,

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:04.760
where he's singing Major Tom
coming home, which is one of

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:05.820
my karaoke.

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:06.505
You know, [SINGING]

00:28:06.505 --> 00:28:09.150
four, three, two, one,
earth below.

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:10.750
And you see this video
of this guy.

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:13.075
And it's just heartbreaking.

00:28:13.075 --> 00:28:15.950
And you see him, and it's like
you're seeing him at his most

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:19.840
vulnerable and intimate, just
when he's singing this great,

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.890
old cheesy New Wave song from
the '80s in the karaoke bar.

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:30.360
And it's amazing the way the
karaoke story that movies and

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.280
TV shows keep finding
a way to tell--

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.100
at this point, there's
going to be karaoke

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:36.850
scenes in all movies.

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:39.840
INTERVIEWER: Wasn't there one
in "Blue Velvet," or am I

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:40.880
remembering that correctly?

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.550
ROB SHEFFIELD: I guess "Blue
Velvet," because it's sort of

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:47.250
pre-karaoke, so he's performing
in the lounge.

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:49.825
INTERVIEWER: Maybe I was
thinking of "My Own Private

00:28:49.825 --> 00:28:52.480
Idaho."

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.930
ROB SHEFFIELD: The first time
I saw a karaoke scene in a

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:59.650
movie was "The Crying Game" in
'92, where the guy goes to the

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:00.640
karaoke bar.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:06.400
I saw that in rural Virginia
in the spring of '91.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.580
And it really blew me away.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:09.240
And I was like, wow.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:09.860
That looks like fun.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:10.860
It's set in London.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.590
And there's a karaoke bar, where
he's like, if you want

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:15.190
to find this person, she's
always at this bar at this

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:17.070
time, and she always things
the same song, "The Crying

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:22.300
Game." And movies like that
started to circulate before

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.390
actual karaoke establishments
did.

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:27.480
So I think a big watershed one
was in '97, where there was

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:31.600
the Julia Roberts movie, "My
Best Friend's Wedding," where

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.640
karaoke plays a huge
role in that movie.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:34.950
And this is '97.

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:38.050
Karaoke is still pretty rare in
most parts of the country

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:38.980
at this point.

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:40.510
But that movie was
in multiplexes

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:41.150
all over the country.

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:42.820
And everybody sees that movie.

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:46.610
And all our moms saw that movie
and thought, holy cow,

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:48.730
that looks like fun.

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:52.370
So I karaoke with my mom now,
down in her little senior

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:53.890
village in Florida.

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:57.660
And everybody loves karaoke
as soon as they

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:58.890
find out about it.

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:01.130
INTERVIEWER: I know there was
this one part in your book

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:04.260
where you mention that new music
is not necessarily being

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:07.180
made for you, per se, as
a demographic audience.

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:10.190
But it seems like karaoke is
the one place where people,

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:13.910
those of us who were born before
1990 can still go and

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:18.410
supplement that rave or the
hardcore concert experience.

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:18.940
ROB SHEFFIELD: Yeah.

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:22.310
It's amazing how karaoke,
because of its nature, it's

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:27.220
not bound to generational ties,
where it's like, oh, you

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:29.950
were born at this time, so you
have to listen to this.

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:32.560
And of course, the way that
music technology is changing

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.840
so much, those boundaries are
less confining than ever.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:40.210
Basically anybody can listen
to anything now, which it's

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:42.550
wild to think of how it used
to be and think you had to

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:44.960
actually have a physical
copy of the record.

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.270
You had to go to the ends
of the earth to find it.

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:49.430
I remember the first time
I had a copy of Dusty

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:52.740
Springfield's "Dusty in
Memphis" in my hands.

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:54.690
And I couldn't believe that I
found this record that my

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:56.870
friends and I had all been
searching for for years.

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:59.265
Now it's like something you just
hear in Starbucks, and

00:30:59.265 --> 00:31:01.360
you don't even think about it.

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.190
My nieces and nephews, who are
little kids, they're really

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:07.780
into karaoke because it's on
their little karaoke video

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:09.570
game console.

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:10.100
And it's funny.

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:14.330
It's kind of traumatic for my
sisters because my nieces and

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:17.200
nephews, who are all toddlers,
little kids, they love doing

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:20.330
these songs that my sisters
thought that maybe they'd

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:21.440
heard the last of.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:24.390
Like my nieces and nephews, they
love to do "Copa Cabana."

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:27.110
Remember that one?

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:29.050
They actually have this dance
routine that they

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:32.450
choreographed, where one of them
is Lola, and one of them

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:34.830
is Tony, and one of
them is Rico.

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:36.340
Rico, he wore a diamond.

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:38.380
And they act out the whole
plot of the song.

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:42.070
And my sister, I vividly--

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:43.720
I love the image of my
sister watching this.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.940
And she's like, I kind of
thought that this already came

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:47.500
and went for me.

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.840
She's like, I did not envision
an adulthood where I was

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:51.830
hearing this song
10 times a day.

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:55.050
And they love to do "Dust
in the Wind" and "Sister

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:57.030
Christian" and all these
other songs that my

00:31:57.030 --> 00:31:57.870
sister can't stand.

00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:03.350
But that's part of how karaoke
is, just part of how

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:08.900
technology general is just
opening music up to people.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:10.622
INTERVIEWER: Music has changed
drastically in these past 10

00:32:10.622 --> 00:32:12.160
years, just in terms of
the technology side.

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:15.370
Has there been any transition
in karaoke, similar?

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:18.780
ROB SHEFFIELD: Well, because
karaoke is so mobile now, I

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:21.300
actually did--

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.670
my wife was out of
town last year.

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:27.090
And actually, we were like, hey,
this would probably work.

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:29.820
I actually brought the laptop to
the karaoke bar, and we did

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:30.440
Skype-aoke.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:33.490
And it was like, that
really worked.

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:35.320
It was not necessarily
my proudest moment.

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.115
And I'm sure for people walking
by and looking, they

00:32:38.115 --> 00:32:39.050
were like, OK.

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:41.280
This dude has a really
sad life.

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:46.680
He's in the karaoke room, by
himself, singing to a screen.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.190
But that was fun.

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:57.520
And just like a friend of mine
in New York found this Korean

00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:01.320
place in the east 30s
that has spa-raoke.

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:03.790
Where she had a spa-raoke
birthday party where it's a

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:06.500
spa where they have
a karaoke machine.

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:09.440
And the birthday girl's getting
a pedicure while she's

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.790
singing Stevie Nicks.

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:13.690
And it's like her two favorite
things in the

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:17.000
world, spa and karaoke.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.290
Now they can be combined.

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:20.960
The future is completely
unbounded.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:24.530
Like the idea that you can get
your nails did and sing your

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:28.230
song at the same time is
just mind-blowing.

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.985
INTERVIEWER: Absolutely.

00:33:28.985 --> 00:33:30.660
I have a couple more questions,
but I was wondering

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.960
if anyone in the audience had
anything they'd like to ask

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.590
Rob at this point.

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:38.140
There's a microphone right
there, by the way.

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:40.350
AUDIENCE: So my question is, I
know that you spent time in

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:41.540
Charlottesville, based on--

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:42.340
ROB SHEFFIELD: Yeah.

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:43.000
You too?

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.060
AUDIENCE: Yeah, UVA.

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:45.000
ROB SHEFFIELD: All right.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.190
All right.

00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:48.800
Wow.

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.174
OK.

00:33:50.174 --> 00:33:51.138
All right.

00:33:51.138 --> 00:33:53.110
I spent the whole '90s
in Charlottesville.

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:54.380
Love that place.

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:56.870
AUDIENCE: So my question for
that is, and I haven't been

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:59.370
able to read this book, so you
might cover it yet, but did

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:02.240
you notice a difference singing
karaoke, say, in

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:05.050
Manhattan versus
Charlottesville, Virginia?

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:07.100
And what were the differences
there?

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.949
ROB SHEFFIELD: It's
wild because

00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:11.219
it's funny that karaoke--

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:14.915
it's so different from place to
place that the boundaries--

00:34:14.915 --> 00:34:15.800
when I go back to

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.580
Charlottesville, and I sing karaoke--

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:19.360
I still go back there all the
time, still have lots of

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.670
friends and family there.

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:28.239
And it's wild that you hear a
lot more country songs there.

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:31.960
But there's different--

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:35.290
because every place has
its different vibe.

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:37.179
The first time I heard that
country song, "Before He

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:39.070
Cheats," remember that?

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:40.909
That was a Carrie Underwood
hit a few years ago.

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:43.130
The first time I heard that
was in a karaoke bar.

00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:45.090
And it was in Charlottesville.

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:49.219
And it was just someone that I
didn't know just getting up to

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:54.100
the mic and singing this super
scary song about how she's

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:56.730
going to destroy this guy's
car and destroy his life.

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:59.880
And it actually mentions
karaoke.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:02.180
Like, that girl, she's probably
singing some white

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.810
trash version of
Shania karaoke.

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:05.655
And it's like, wow.

00:35:05.655 --> 00:35:09.390
And I was like, hearing this
song in a karaoke bar,

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:11.240
absolute best first
way to hear it.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:13.690
And I will always love that
song because of my first

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:16.010
experience with it.

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:18.660
So it's a weird thing, going and
singing karaoke all over

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:19.190
the country.

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:23.820
It's funny how every place has
its different rituals, its

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:28.850
different etiquette and
its different code.

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:31.665
And it's funny how it's
different every place.

00:35:31.665 --> 00:35:33.530
That's part of the fascination
for me.

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:35.910
INTERVIEWER: Have you ever heard
a song at a karaoke bar

00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:38.320
that you really liked, then
heard the original version and

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:39.420
been like, this is trash?

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.380
ROB SHEFFIELD: Boy,
all the time.

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:44.210
It's funny, that happens to my
wife all the time because she

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:48.150
doesn't listen to a lot
of current top 40 pop.

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:52.170
So she will hear me destroy
songs in the karaoke bar long

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:53.870
before she hears the original.

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:59.050
And I still remember a couple
years ago, when the singer

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:04.740
Ke$ha, Ke$ha, was on the
American Music Awards, doing

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:10.250
her hit "We R Who We R."
And Ally was listening.

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:12.190
And she was like, wow, that's
the first time I'm hearing

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:13.880
actually Ke$ha sing this song.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:14.760
And she's like, wow.

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.815
She sounds just like you do when
you're drunk at 2:00 in

00:36:16.815 --> 00:36:17.690
the morning.

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:21.700
I was like, that's why it's
the perfect karaoke song.

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:25.870
And it's funny how, yeah,
sometimes that's the main

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:27.880
experience with the song.

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.360
AUDIENCE: I haven't been in a
karaoke bar in a really long

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.430
time, and I have very
limited experience.

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.840
ROB SHEFFIELD: Time
to change that.

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.100
AUDIENCE: I know, I now.

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:38.340
So back whenever that was, hip
hop, rap, basically was not

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:39.870
available in a karaoke.

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:42.930
It wasn't as big, obviously,
culturally as it is now.

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:45.850
But it's a huge part of music.

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:46.900
It's a huge part of pop music.

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:49.100
So has that changed?

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:49.910
Is it changing?

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:54.670
Do you find rap options
in karaoke bars more

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:55.730
than you used to?

00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:59.450
It seems like as far as if
karaoke is like a fantasy for

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:01.190
people, that there's
a lot of fantasy in

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:02.350
rap music in lyrics.

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:03.950
It would make a lot of sense.

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:05.940
But it's not singing,
necessarily.

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:06.480
ROB SHEFFIELD: Yeah.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:10.090
But it's vocalizing and
performing, and there's often

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:12.450
different singing involved.

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:17.950
Also, it's really hard if
you don't have actual

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:20.620
hip-hop-worthy mic skills.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:25.220
And so I will often begin
a lot of hip hop songs.

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:28.570
And then I'll be like, wow.

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:30.140
This is hard.

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:33.610
I need to lie down with a
cold towel over my head.

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:36.600
I will try like "Mo Money Mo
Problems." And I was like, OK,

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.320
the Mase verse I can handle.

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.570
The Puffy verse is a little
complicated for me.

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:43.660
The Biggie verse, I am
not even worthy.

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:45.073
I'm not even going to
step to that one.

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:51.610
But it's funny because with the
hip hop and the hip hop

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:54.620
aesthetic keeps changing pop
music, and pop music keeps

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:55.600
responding to that.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.850
That's part of--

00:37:59.015 --> 00:38:02.700
my karaoke fantasy for 2013, I
can't wait until this song

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.810
arrives at the bar, is--

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:06.600
well, all the songs from the
new Kanye West album,

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:11.930
"Yeezus," especially the last
song, "Bound To," which is one

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:15.260
that samples Brenda Lee, singing
like "uh-huh, honey."

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:18.345
And I cannot wait until that
song comes to the karaoke bar.

00:38:18.345 --> 00:38:23.710
In fact, I was out with a bunch
of friends of mine last

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:25.610
week, and we were doing all
these other Kanye West songs

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:29.210
in the book, just trying to do
that song over the different--

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:32.220
so we did "Runaway," but we kept
doing the "uh-huh, honey"

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:33.720
all the way through it.

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:37.640
It's funny because that "uh-huh,
honey," that's from a

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:41.230
song that I learned as a kid
because my parents had their

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:43.350
records from the '50s, and they
had these '50s rock and

00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:43.830
roll records.

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:45.920
And one of the songs I loved
was Brenda Lee, "Sweet

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.890
Nothin's," from the '50s.

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:50.440
And just the way she would
begin that song saying

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:52.630
"uh-huh, honey," and I just
thought that was the filthiest

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:53.650
thing I'd ever heard.

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:55.290
I couldn't believe my parents
had his record.

00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:57.760
I was like, how was
this allowed?

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:01.640
And now I hear that sound all
the time of her saying that in

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:02.910
that Kanye West song.

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:06.970
And that somehow, he decided to
just loop that Brenda Lee

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:09.350
"uh-huh, honey" all the way
through the song, a truly

00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:11.280
filthy song.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:16.330
And it's mind-blowing for me,
and it's just evidence of how

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:19.540
music keeps expanding, keep
getting weirder, and keeps

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:20.530
crossing those boundaries.

00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:21.610
It's really amazing.

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:23.520
AUDIENCE: So you are finding
it out there.

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:27.540
I can go to a karaoke bar now
and find hip hop as an option.

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:28.590
ROB SHEFFIELD: Yeah.

00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:30.360
More and more--

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:34.140
and it's funny because some
hip hop songs are more

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:37.190
karaoke-friendly than others.

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:41.210
And it's funny because of
the skill sets required.

00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:44.660
I think people in general, just
watching people do hip

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:48.490
hop songs in karaoke bars,
they tend to kind of

00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:52.820
overestimate their mic skills.

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:55.080
Like you realize, there's a
reason Jay-Z is Jay-Z, and

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.400
you're not Jay-Z, because
you try to do--

00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:01.470
Like I once tried to do H to
the Izzo, V to the Izzay.

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:04.140
And I was like, wow.

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:05.210
The chorus I can handle.

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:08.705
But I was like, I felt like
I owed Jay-Z an apology.

00:40:08.705 --> 00:40:12.490
I was like, I didn't mean
to do this to your song.

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:15.120
If I ever meet you, I will have
to apologize for that.

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.720
AUDIENCE: But do you feel the
same way if you don't hit a

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.560
note from a singer?

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.810
ROB SHEFFIELD: Yeah,
the same way.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:25.630
I'm OK with the fact that
I'm not going to do

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:27.100
justice to the song.

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:29.250
I can't aspire to do justice
to the song.

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:34.320
All I can do is just shine my
own badly performed version of

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:36.620
it, just my way of saying thank
you to the song and to

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:37.650
the artist.

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:39.250
INTERVIEWER: In short, do you
think Chief Keef will be more

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:42.010
popular with karaoke bars than
Kendrick Lamar in five years?

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:43.630
ROB SHEFFIELD: Yeah.

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:45.380
Well, part of it is that--

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:49.120
like Nicki Minaj, who has lots
of songs that are impossible

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:50.210
to do with karaoke.

00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:53.920
But she also has "Beez in the
Trap," which I really think

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:57.410
she designed to be karaokeable,
because that's a

00:40:57.410 --> 00:41:01.190
song that if you want to do a
Nicki Minaj song, but you

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:04.990
don't have Nicki Minaj skills,
that one is really slowed down

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:08.000
to the point where I really
think she was like, OK, I have

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.990
to do something for the really
drunk douchebags who decide

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:15.220
they're going to try this
at 2:00 in the morning.

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:16.780
And it's actually
really great.

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:18.870
I always do the 2 Chainz part
because my wife is kind of

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:19.980
obsessed with 2 Chainz.

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:20.240
INTERVIEWER: OK.

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.110
Well, Rob, thanks for coming
out here, man.

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:22.550
ROB SHEFFIELD: Thank
you for coming.

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:23.460
Oh my god, thank you everybody.

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:24.710
Thank you.
