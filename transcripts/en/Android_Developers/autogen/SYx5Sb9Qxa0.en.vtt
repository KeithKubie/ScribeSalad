00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.708
 [Electronic Music Bob] 

00:00:06.708 --> 00:00:08.166
 Match Nick: My name is Avi Match Nick. 

00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.291
 I am one of Aviary's founding partners. 

00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:12.666
 There are currently thousands of image enhancement applications. 

00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:16.083
 But what we seek to achieve is always simplifying the experience 

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:17.541
 We provide the user. 

00:00:17.541 --> 00:00:18.833
 We aim to create an application that encourages you regardless 

00:00:18.833 --> 00:00:20.125
 Your level of technology expertise 

00:00:20.125 --> 00:00:21.125
 To actually get it 

00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:22.333
 So you can in less than six seconds 

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.625
 From learning how to use it 

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:25.416
 And make your photos look great. 

00:00:25.416 --> 00:00:27.375
 One of the most amazing features of the basic Android system 

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:29.291
 In our communication with users. 

00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:32.291
 Not only are we responding to the error reports we receive. 

00:00:32.291 --> 00:00:34.125
 But it extends to this continuous bilateral dialogue 

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:36.208
 With users whether through experimental uses 

00:00:36.208 --> 00:00:38.000
 Or through assessments and reviews. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.125
 We also know what is happening in real time. 

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:41.541
 We can also talk to members of our forum 

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:42.791
 To see what features they like 

00:00:42.791 --> 00:00:44.375
 And those who do not like them 

00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:45.666
 As well as identify what they like to add to the application 

00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:46.958
 In a way that has not been mentioned in our minds before 

00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.416
 And then we execute all the required in real time. 

00:00:48.416 --> 00:00:49.666
 Schafer: I was working with the Android developer console 

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.166
 Amazing 

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.333
 As compared to other basic systems. 

00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:56.500
 Android lets us see metrics for our apps. 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.083
 We can also search through these measures 

00:00:58.083 --> 00:01:00.208
 We can also respond effectively to user feedback. 

00:01:00.208 --> 00:01:01.916
 Using the new tools I would say that we are 

00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:04.583
 We've been able to identify problems twice as fast. 

00:01:04.583 --> 00:01:07.875
 This makes it easier for us to search through reviews 

00:01:07.875 --> 00:01:09.458
 And communicate with users when we need it 

00:01:09.458 --> 00:01:11.125
 And get them to learn more 

00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:12.458
 All this has generally contributed to the provision 

00:01:12.458 --> 00:01:14.291
 A tremendous amount of time 

00:01:14.291 --> 00:01:16.041
 Anywhere from five to ten hours a week. 

00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:17.916
 Darling: Android in general 

00:01:17.916 --> 00:01:20.125
 Usually useful for the Aviary team. 

00:01:20.125 --> 00:01:22.583
 Through which we have acquired more than two-thirds of our user base. 

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:25.250
 We use search within reviews every day. 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.458
 We also use it to evaluate new features. 

00:01:27.458 --> 00:01:29.333
 For example we recently issued 

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:30.833
 A new feature called Discover. 

00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:32.333
 What we do is search in "Discover" to see what he is saying 

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:33.750
 Users about a product 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.000
 As well as whether they like the product 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.541
 Or if there are some problems you are having to use 

00:01:36.541 --> 00:01:37.875
 This helps us make a decision about this product. 

00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:39.583
 The ratings and reviews feature has been achieved 

00:01:39.583 --> 00:01:41.500
 The benefits are enormous to us. 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.333
 Because we've had the ability to browse problems quickly 

00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:49.625
 By device, app version, or Android version 

00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:51.125
 Then fast browsing 

00:01:51.125 --> 00:01:52.666
 For user opinions 

00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:54.458
 And know the actual words they use 

00:01:54.458 --> 00:01:56.291
 We confirm that this is all about features that are unique to the basic Android ecosystem 

00:01:56.291 --> 00:01:59.375
 This helps us to develop much more quickly. 

00:01:59.375 --> 00:02:01.791
 Schafer: The response to user feedback was in the developer console 

00:02:01.791 --> 00:02:04.333
 Useful to us tremendously. 

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:06.583
 For example, we recently issued a release 

00:02:06.583 --> 00:02:08.500
 Included a solution to a fairly large error 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.333
 It had a negative impact on our users' experience. 

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:12.125
 And moved to the developer console 

00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:14.458
 I responded to all the users who were facing this error 

00:02:14.458 --> 00:02:16.583
 About 50% of them actually returned 

00:02:16.583 --> 00:02:18.541
 To update their reviews. 

00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:19.875
 Match Nick: One of the things I like about creating apps 

00:02:19.875 --> 00:02:21.958
 For the Android platform is how fast 

00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.291
 The ability to test and publish these applications. 

00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:27.166
 We have a great community of experimental users on Android 

00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:28.541
 From which we can test new features. 

00:02:28.541 --> 00:02:31.625
 Darling: That's what helps us identify errors 

00:02:31.625 --> 00:02:34.041
 Or recognize features they like or dislike 

00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:35.666
 At a much faster rate. 

00:02:35.666 --> 00:02:37.208
 All of this allows us to replicate the application experience 

00:02:37.208 --> 00:02:38.833
 Faster than two or three times 

00:02:38.833 --> 00:02:41.583
 On Android compared to other platforms 

00:02:41.583 --> 00:02:44.416
 Which is a tremendous benefit to our application. 

00:02:44.416 --> 00:02:47.166
 The Aviary image enhancement program is designed to be very simple 

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:48.958
 While being a great tool for improving images at the same time. 

00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.333
 Through dialogue with our users 

00:02:51.333 --> 00:02:52.958
 Via the tools provided by us both from the developer console 

00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.750
 And Play shop we can 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.833
 Frequent application experience and much rendering 

00:02:56.833 --> 00:02:58.958
 Applications across the interface are easy and simple 

00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.375
 Which is truly remarkable for us.
