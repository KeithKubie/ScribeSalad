00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.620
We could have a debate about
what the most interesting cell

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.540
in the human body is, but I
think easily the neuron would

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.810
make the top five, and it's
not just because the cell

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:11.830
itself is interesting.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.640
The fact that it essentially
makes up our brain and our

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.420
nervous system and is
responsible for the thoughts

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.010
and our feelings and maybe for
all of our sentience, I think,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.625
would easily make it the
top one or two cells.

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:26.920
So what I want to do is first
to show you what a neuron

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.450
looks like.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.290
And, of course, this is kind
of the perfect example.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.670
This isn't what all
neurons look like.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.350
And then we're going to talk
a little bit about how it

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.000
performs its function, which is
essentially communication,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.760
essentially transmitting signals
across its length,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.400
depending on the signals
it receives.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.470
So if I were to draw
a neuron-- let me

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.720
pick a better color.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.060
So let's say I have a neuron.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.120
It looks something like this.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.780
So in the middle you have your
soma and then from the soma--

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.850
let me draw the nucleus.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.390
This is a nucleus, just like
any cell's nucleus.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.190
And then the soma's considered
the body of the neuron and

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.260
then the neuron has these little
things sticking out

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.680
from it that keep
branching off.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.080
Maybe they look something
like this.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.910
I don't want to spend too much
time just drawing the neuron,

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.700
but you've probably seen
drawings like this before.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.810
And these branches off of the
soma of the neuron, off of its

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.010
body, these are called
dendrites.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.455
They can keep splitting
off like that.

00:01:34.455 --> 00:01:36.990
I want to do a fairly reasonable
drawing so I'll

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.040
spend a little time
doing that.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.140
So these right here, these
are dendrites.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.500
And these tend to be--
and nothing is

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.860
always the case in biology.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.160
Sometimes different parts of
different cells perform other

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.940
functions, but these tend to be
where the neuron receives

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.160
its signal.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.220
And we'll talk more about what
it means to receive and

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.370
transmit a signal in
this video and

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.940
probably in the next few.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.630
So this is where it receives
the signal.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.160
So this is the dendrite.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.030
This right here is the soma.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.390
Soma means body.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.130
This is the body
of the neuron.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.600
And then we have kind of a--
you can almost view it as a

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.100
tail of the neuron.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.350
It's called the axon.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.880
A neuron can be a reasonably
normal sized cell, although

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.820
there is a huge range, but the
axons can be quite long.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.870
They could be short.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.520
Sometimes in the brain you might
have very small axons,

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.610
but you might have axons that
go down the spinal column or

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.190
that go along one of your
limbs-- or if you're talking

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.240
about one of a dinosaur's
limbs.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.190
So the axon can actually
stretch several feet.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.160
Not all neurons' axons
are several feet,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.150
but they could be.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.760
And this is really where a lot
of the distance of the signal

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.100
gets traveled.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.190
Let me draw the axon.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.620
So the axon will look
something like this.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.080
And at the end, it ends at the
axon terminal where it can

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.360
connect to other dendrites or
maybe to other types of tissue

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.990
or muscle if the point of this
neuron is to tell a muscle to

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.910
do something.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.810
So at the end of the axon,
you have the axon

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.070
terminal right there.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.170
I'll do my best to draw
it like that.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.830
Let me label it.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.270
So this is the axon.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.530
This is the axon terminal.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.090
And you'll sometimes hear the
word-- the point at which the

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.590
soma or the body of the neuron
connects to the axon is as

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.400
often referred to as the axon
hillock-- maybe you can kind

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.380
of view it as kind of a lump.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.690
It starts to form the axon.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:54.610
And then we're going to talk
about how the impulses travel.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.970
And a huge part in what allows
them to travel efficiently are

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.420
these insulating cells
around the axon.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.520
We're going to talk about this
in detail and how they

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.230
actually work, but it's good
just to have the anatomical

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:17.420
structure first. So these are
called Schwann cells and

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.450
they're covering-- they make
up the myelin sheath.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.040
So this covering, this
insulation, at different

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.850
intervals around the
axon, this is

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.710
called the myelin sheath.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.540
So Schwann cells make up
the myelin sheath.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.010
I'll do one more
just like that.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.780
And then these little spaces
between the myelin sheath--

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.390
just so we have all of the
terminology from-- so we know

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.650
the entire anatomy of the
neuron-- these are called the

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.900
nodes of Ranvier.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.950
I guess they're named
after Ranvier.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.910
Maybe he was the guy who looked
and saw they had these

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.810
little slots here where you
don't have myelin sheath.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.280
So these are the nodes
of Ranvier.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.980
So the general idea, as I
mentioned, is that you get a

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:08.860
signal here.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.070
We're going to talk more about
what the signal means-- and

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.890
then that signal gets--
actually, the signals can be

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.580
summed, so you might have one
little signal right there,

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.450
another signal right there, and
then you'll have maybe a

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.010
larger signal there and there--
and that the combined

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.780
effects of these signals get
summed up and they travel to

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.430
the hillock and if they're a
large enough, they're going to

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.940
trigger an action potential on
the axon, which will cause a

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.280
signal to travel down the
balance of the axon and then

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.920
over here it might be connected
via synapses to

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.440
other dendrites or muscles.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.420
And we'll talk more about
synapses and those might help

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.790
trigger other things.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.770
So you're saying, what's
triggering these things here?

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.400
Well, this could be the terminal
end of other neurons'

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.100
axons, like in the brain.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.910
This could be some type
of sensory neuron.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.490
This could be on a taste bud
someplace, so a salt molecule

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.280
somehow can trigger it or a
sugar molecule-- or this might

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.390
be some type of sensor.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.110
It could be a whole bunch of
different things and we'll

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.700
talk more about the different
types of neurons.
