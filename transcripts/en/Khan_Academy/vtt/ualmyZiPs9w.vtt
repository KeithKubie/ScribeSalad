00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.780
What I want to do in this
video is introduce you

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:09.160
to the idea of the covariance
between two random variables.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:16.129
And it's defined as the
expected value of the distance--

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.760
or I guess the product
of the distances

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.350
of each random variable
from their mean,

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.209
or from their expected value.

00:00:23.209 --> 00:00:24.500
So let me just write that down.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.280
So I'll have X first, I'll
do this in another color.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.660
So it's the expected
value of random variable X

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.730
minus the expected value
of X. You could view this

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.030
as the population
mean of X times--

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.220
and then this is a
random variable y--

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.880
so times the distance from
Y to its expected value

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:53.350
or the population mean of y.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.670
And if it doesn't make
a lot of intuitive sense

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.422
yet-- well, one, you
could just always

00:00:57.422 --> 00:00:59.380
kind of think about what
it's doing play around

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.150
with some numbers here.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.360
But the reality is it's saying
how much they vary together.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.936
So you always take an X and a
y for each of the data points.

00:01:08.936 --> 00:01:10.560
Let's say you had
the whole population.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.370
So every X and Y that
kind of go together

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.630
with each other that are
coordinate you put into this.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.230
And what happens is-- let's
say that X is above its mean

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.220
when Y is below its mean.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.290
So let's say that in the
population you had the point.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.760
So one instantiation
of the random variables

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.900
you sample once
from the universe

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:38.840
and you get X is equal to 1 and
that Y is equal to-- let's say

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.390
Y is equal to 3.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.550
And let's say that you
knew ahead of time,

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.070
that the expected
value of X is 0.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.200
And let's say that the expected
value of Y is equal to 4.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.990
So in this situation,
what just happened?

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.870
Now we don't know the
entire covariance,

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.000
we only have one sample here
of this random variable.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.490
But what just happened here?

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.150
We have one minus-- so we're
just going to calculate,

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.970
we're not going to calculate
the entire expected value,

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.511
I just want to
calculate what happens

00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:12.020
when we do what's inside
the expected value.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.400
We'll have 1 minus 0, so you'll
have a 1 times a 3 minus 4,

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.419
times a negative 1.

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:22.460
So you're going to have
1 times negative 1, which

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.980
is negative 1.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.430
And what is that telling us?

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.530
Well, it's telling us at least
for this sample, this one time

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.382
that we sampled the
random variables X and Y,

00:02:31.382 --> 00:02:35.740
X was above it's
expected value when

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.460
Y was below its expected value.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.130
And if we kept doing this, let's
say for the entire population

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.960
this happened, then
it would make sense

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.560
that they have a
negative covariance.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.770
When one goes up, the
other one goes down.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.990
When one goes down,
the other one goes up.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.750
If they both go
up together, they

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.350
would have a positive variance
or they both go down together.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.760
And the degree to which
they do it together

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.020
will tell you the magnitude
of the covariance.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.190
Hopefully that gives you
a little bit of intuition

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.380
about what the covariance
is trying to tell us.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.880
But the more important thing
that I want to do in this video

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.200
is to connect this formula.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.119
I want to connect to this
definition of covariance

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:13.660
to everything we've been doing
with least squared regression.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.550
And really it's just
kind of a fun math thing

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.420
to do to show you all
of these connections,

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.800
and where, really, the
definition of covariance

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.130
really becomes useful.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.450
And I really do think it's
motivated to a large degree

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.994
by where it shows
up in regressions.

00:03:27.994 --> 00:03:29.660
And this is all stuff
that we've kind of

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.430
seen before, you're just going
to see it in a different way.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.790
So this whole video,
I'm just going

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.280
to rewrite this definition of
covariance right over here.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.730
So this is going to be the
same thing as the expected

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.070
value of-- and I'm
just going to multiply

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.740
these two binomials in here.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.050
So the expected value
of our random variable X

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:01.280
times our random variable
Y minus-- well, I'll

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.240
just do the X first.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.050
So plus X times the negative
expected value of Y.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:18.543
So I'll just say minus X
times the expected value of Y.

00:04:18.543 --> 00:04:20.709
And that negative sign comes
from this negative sign

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:21.910
right over here.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:31.220
And then we have minus
expected value of X times Y,

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.404
just doing the distributive
property twice,

00:04:33.404 --> 00:04:35.820
and then finally you have the
negative expected value of X

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.940
times a negative
expected value of Y.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.630
And the negatives cancel out.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.360
And so you're just going to have
plus the expected value of X

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:53.320
times the expected value
of Y. And of course, it's

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.025
the expected value
of this entire thing.

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:01.110
Now let's see if we
can rewrite this.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.900
Well the expected
value of the sum

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.280
of a bunch of random variables,
or the sum and difference

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.120
of a bunch of random variables,
is just the sum or difference

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.340
of their expected value.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.250
So this is going to
be the same thing.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.560
And remember, expected
value, in a lot of contexts,

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.550
you could view it as
just the arithmetic mean.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.580
Or, in a continuous
distribution,

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.570
you could view it as a
probability weighted sum

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.450
or probability weighted
integral, either way.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.410
We've seen it before, I think.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.460
So let's rewrite this.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.330
So this is equal to the expected
value of the random variables

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:38.570
X and Y. X times Y. Trying to
keep them color-coded for you.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.550
And then we have minus X
times the expected value of Y.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:49.860
So then we're going to have
minus the expected value of X

00:05:49.860 --> 00:06:03.530
times the expected value of
Y. Stay with the right colors.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.170
Then you're going to have
minus the expected value

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:11.490
of this thing-- I'll close the
parentheses-- of this thing

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.250
right over here.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:17.942
Expected value of
X times Y. I know

00:06:17.942 --> 00:06:19.650
this might look really
confusing with all

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.334
the embedded expected values.

00:06:21.334 --> 00:06:23.000
But one way to think
about is the things

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.250
that already have
the expected values,

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.710
you can view these as numbers.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.169
You've already used
them as knowns.

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:29.668
We're actually going to take
them out of the expected value,

00:06:29.668 --> 00:06:31.650
because the expected
value of an expected value

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.080
is the same thing as
the expected value.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.579
Actually let me write this over
here, just remind ourselves.

00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:41.730
The expected value
of X is just going

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:48.049
to be the expected value
of X. Think of it this way.

00:06:48.049 --> 00:06:49.590
You could view this
as the population

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.290
mean for the random variable.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.656
So that's just going to be
a known, it's out there,

00:06:53.656 --> 00:06:54.530
it's in the universe.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:59.120
So the expected value of that
is just going to be itself.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.740
If the population mean, or
the expected value of X is 5--

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.989
this is like saying the
expected value of 5.

00:07:05.989 --> 00:07:07.530
Well the expected
value of 5 is going

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.130
to be 5, which is the same thing
as the expected value of X.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.160
Hopefully that
makes sense, we're

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.425
going to use that in a second.

00:07:12.425 --> 00:07:13.300
So we're almost done.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.060
We did the expected value of
this and we have one term left.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.296
And then the final term, the
expected value of this guy.

00:07:19.296 --> 00:07:21.920
And here, we can actually use a
property right from the get go.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.950
I'll write it down.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.630
So the expected value of--
get some big brackets up--

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.660
of this thing right over here.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:37.790
Expected value of X times the
expected value of Y. And let's

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.534
see if we can simplify
it right here.

00:07:39.534 --> 00:07:41.450
So this is just going
to be the expected value

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:44.350
of the product of these
two random variables.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.042
I'll just leave
that the way it is.

00:07:46.042 --> 00:07:47.500
So let me just--
the stuff that I'm

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.000
going to leave the way it is
I'm just going to freeze them.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.850
So the expected value of XY.

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:56.500
Now what do we have over here?

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.322
We have the expected
value of X times--

00:07:59.322 --> 00:08:00.780
once again, you
can kind of view it

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.321
if you go back to
what we just said--

00:08:02.321 --> 00:08:05.160
is this is just going to be a
number, expected value of Y,

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.440
so we can just bring this out.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.352
If this was the
expected value of 3X,

00:08:08.352 --> 00:08:10.810
would be the same thing as 3
times the expected value of X.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:18.420
So we can rewrite this as
negative expected value of Y

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:25.994
times the expected value of
X. You can kind of view this

00:08:25.994 --> 00:08:27.660
as we took it out of
the expected value,

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.630
we factored it out.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.170
So just like that.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.710
And then you have minus.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:34.880
Same thing over here.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.559
You can factor out
this expected value

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:42.530
of X. Minus the expected
value of X times the expected

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:53.750
value of Y. This is getting
confusing with all the E's

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.060
laying around.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.250
And then finally,
the expected value

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.200
of this thing, of
two expected values,

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.670
well that's just going to
be the product of those two

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:01.537
expected values.

00:09:01.537 --> 00:09:03.120
So that's just going
to be plus-- I'll

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:11.180
freeze this-- expected
value of X times

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:15.010
the expected value of Y.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:16.150
Now what do we have here?

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:20.180
We have expected value of Y
times the expected value of X.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:23.010
And then we are subtracting
the expected value

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.660
of X times the
expected value of Y.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.340
These two things are
the exact same thing.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:28.840
Right?

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.590
So this is going to be--
and actually look at this.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.080
We're subtracting it twice
and then we have one more.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.180
These are all the same thing.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.240
This is the expected value of Y
times the expected value of X.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.024
This is the expected value of Y
times the expected value of X,

00:09:41.024 --> 00:09:42.440
just written in a
different order.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.200
And this is the expected value
of Y times the expected value

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.650
of X. We're subtracting it
twice and then we're adding it.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:53.100
Or, one way to think about it
is that this guy and that guy

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:53.960
will cancel out.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.001
You could have also picked
that guy and that guy.

00:09:56.001 --> 00:09:57.230
But what do we have left?

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.650
We have the covariance of
these two random variables.

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:02.465
X and Y are equal to the
expected value of-- I'll

00:10:02.465 --> 00:10:04.215
switch back to my
colors just because this

00:10:04.215 --> 00:10:09.220
is the final result-- the
expected value of X times

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:22.869
the expected value of
the product of XY minus--

00:10:22.869 --> 00:10:23.410
what is this?

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:34.220
The expected value of Y times
the expected value of X.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.430
Now you can calculate
these expected values

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:40.080
if you know everything about
the probability distribution

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.480
or density functions for each
of these random variables.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.122
Or if you had the
entire population

00:10:44.122 --> 00:10:45.580
that you're sampling
from, whenever

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.912
you take an instantiation
of these random variables.

00:10:47.912 --> 00:10:49.370
But let's say you
just had a sample

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:50.453
of these random variables.

00:10:50.453 --> 00:10:54.100
How could you estimate them?

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:58.816
Well, if you were estimating
it, the expected value,

00:10:58.816 --> 00:11:00.940
and let's say you just have
a bunch of data points,

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:01.690
a bunch of coordinates.

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:03.670
And I think you'll start
to see how this relates

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:04.919
to what we do with regression.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.360
The expected value
of X times Y, it

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.130
can be approximated
by the sample mean

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.690
of the products of
X and Y. This is

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:19.230
going to be the sample
mean of X and Y.

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:21.920
You take each of
your XY associations,

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.660
take their product, and then
take the mean of all of them.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.535
So that's going to be
the product of X and Y.

00:11:26.535 --> 00:11:28.190
And then this thing
right over here,

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:33.030
the expected value of Y that can
be approximated by the sample

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.610
mean of Y, and the
expected value of X

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:38.480
can be approximated by
the sample mean of X.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.370
So what can the covariance
of two random variables

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:44.060
be approximated by?

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.680
What can it be approximated by?

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:52.480
Well this right here is the
mean of their product from

00:11:52.480 --> 00:12:01.110
your sample minus the mean of
your sample Y's times the mean

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:02.075
of your sample X's.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.940
And this should start
looking familiar.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.500
This should look a little bit
familiar, because what is this?

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.540
This was the numerator.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:16.880
This right here is
the numerator when

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.874
we were trying to figure out the
slope of the regression line.

00:12:19.874 --> 00:12:22.290
So when we tried to figure out
the slope of the regression

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:25.040
line, we had the-- let me just
rewrite the formula here just

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:30.560
to remind you-- it was literally
the mean of the products

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:35.530
of each of our data points,
or the XY's, minus the mean

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.370
of Y's times the
mean of the X's.

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:43.200
All of that over the
mean the X squareds.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.700
And you could even
view it as this,

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.570
over the mean of
the X times the X's.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:52.500
But I could just write
the X squareds, over here,

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:59.490
minus the mean of X squared.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.774
This is how we figured out the
slope of our regression line.

00:13:02.774 --> 00:13:04.440
Or maybe a better way
to think about it,

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.180
if we assume in
our regression line

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.675
that the points
that we have were

00:13:08.675 --> 00:13:12.410
a sample from an entire
universe of possible points,

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:15.265
then you could say that
we are approximating

00:13:15.265 --> 00:13:16.640
the slope of our
aggression line.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.550
And you might see this little
hat notation in a lot of books.

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:20.883
I don't want you to be confused.

00:13:20.883 --> 00:13:23.640
They are saying that you're
approximating the population's

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.340
regression line
from a sample of it.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.300
Now, this right
here-- so everything

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.990
we've learned right now-- this
right here is the covariance,

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:37.120
or this is an estimate of
the covariance of X and Y.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.620
Now what is this over here?

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.170
Well, I just said,
you could rewrite

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:43.040
this very easily
as-- this bottom part

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:47.310
right here-- you could write as
the mean of X times X-- that's

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:51.810
the same thing as X
squared-- minus the mean of X

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:53.660
times the mean of X, right?

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.440
That's what the mean
of X squared is.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.580
Well, what's this?

00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:03.060
Well, you could view this as
the covariance of X with X.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.230
But we've actually
already seen this.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:07.370
And I've actually
shown you many,

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:09.870
many videos ago when we first
learned about it what this is.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.640
The covariance of a random
variable with itself

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:18.680
is really just the variance
of that random variable.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.470
And you could verify
it for yourself.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.990
If you change this
Y to an X, this

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:25.870
becomes X minus
the expected value

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.590
of X times X minus
expected value of X.

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.720
Or that's the
expected value of X

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.940
minus the expected
value of X squared.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.270
That's your definition
of variance.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:39.650
So another way of thinking about
the slope of our aggression

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:45.160
line, it can be literally viewed
as the covariance of our two

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:53.350
random variables over
the variance of X.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.650
Or you can kind of view it
as the independent random

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:56.450
variable.

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:59.415
That right there is the
slope of our regression line.

00:14:59.415 --> 00:15:01.040
Anyway, I thought
that was interesting.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.940
And I wanted to make
connections between things

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.648
you see in different
parts of statistics,

00:15:04.648 --> 00:15:07.430
and show you that they
really are connected.
