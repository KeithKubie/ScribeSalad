00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.403
- Hello everyone, thank
you so much for coming,

00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:05.171
my name is Becca Skinner,

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:07.640
and I'm a National
Geographic Young Explorer,

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.943 line:0%
and an adventure photographer.

00:00:10.943 --> 00:00:13.146 line:0%
Before I get started
and tell you why,

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:17.483 line:0%
in this photo, I'm carrying
110 liters of camera gear,

00:00:17.483 --> 00:00:19.319
across the coast of Canada,

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:23.122
I just wanted to give you
a little bit of background,

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:25.491
so I'm based in
Bozeman, Montana,

00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:29.362
it's so beautiful, and
this is a little cabin

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:31.431
that I stay at quite often,

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:34.868 align:start size:84% position:16%
but most of the time,
I'm on the road.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:38.271 align:start size:94% position:6%
And I know most of you
have houses or apartments,

00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:41.941 align:start size:97% position:3%
and maybe you're looking out
the door at a front yard,

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:46.478
or backyard, but my view
often looks like this.

00:00:46.478 --> 00:00:49.883
This is my front
yard, or back yard.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:54.054 align:start position:0%
I'm also based out of my bright
yellow truck, named Happy,

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:59.759
very unstealthy, it's about
National Geographic yellow,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.832
but this is my view a lot of
times when I'm on the road,

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:08.935
and I was spending so much
time on the road last year,

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:10.503
that I actually
had a friend help

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:13.606
build me a bed in the
back of the truck,

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:15.108 align:start size:84% position:16%
it's way more
comfortable that way,

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:18.544 align:start size:97% position:3%
so you can see the two
storage systems on the side,

00:01:18.544 --> 00:01:21.614
and then I have this
bed in the middle,

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:24.883 align:start size:97% position:3%
which my dog and I fit
perfectly in that little nook,

00:01:24.883 --> 00:01:28.988
and obviously, a coffee
device, in the corner.

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:30.189
(laughter)

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.324 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I would argue
that this is actually

00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:35.794 align:start size:84% position:16%
more comfortable
than my bed at home.

00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:39.298 align:start size:97% position:3%
So I know I just said I
spend a lot of time outside,

00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:41.867
or on the road, but I
just wanted to give you

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:43.602
some statistics about how much

00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:46.572
time I actually spend outside,

00:01:46.572 --> 00:01:48.741
so last year, I kept track,

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:52.579
and last year, I slept
outside for 242 nights,

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:59.185 align:start size:97% position:3%
which estimates to be roughly
eight months of the year,

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:02.522 align:start size:88% position:13%
that means I was inside
about 123 nights,

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.958
which also means,

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:09.796
I only took about 123
showers last year,

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:11.297
(laughter)

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:14.166
which is not that much,
but don't be dissuaded,

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:15.635
I showered this morning,

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:18.104 align:start size:94% position:6%
please still come
talk to me after the show.

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:19.305
(laughter)

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:22.475 align:start size:84% position:16%
But most of my showers
looked like this,

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:27.013
so being an adventure
photographer means

00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:31.317
I get to see incredible places,

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:33.653
my day is not ever the same,

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:38.257
it just keeps me on my toes,

00:02:38.257 --> 00:02:40.893 align:start size:88% position:13%
as you can see, there's
quite a diversity

00:02:40.893 --> 00:02:43.729
of images in this picture.

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:45.864
But yeah, it's always different,

00:02:45.864 --> 00:02:48.600
and that's part of the
reason I love this job,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.770 align:start size:84% position:16%
the only thing
consistent is I drink

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.574
a very, very strong cup
of coffee every morning.

00:02:55.574 --> 00:02:58.277
But 90% of my job is really fun,

00:02:58.277 --> 00:03:00.946 align:start size:97% position:3%
and right now, I'm working for
a lot of outdoor companies,

00:03:00.946 --> 00:03:02.448
creating content,

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:05.651 align:start size:94% position:6%
a few of these photos have
not yet been published,

00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:08.320
so you get to see them first,

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.955
so yes, quite diversity.

00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:12.592
90% of my job is really fun,

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:16.095
and the other 10% is
totally miserable,

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:18.031
well, kind of.

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.633 align:start size:88% position:13%
Being an adventure
photographer also means

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:23.669 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm dealing with the
elements 24 hours a day,

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:26.005
seven days a week, when
I'm out in the field,

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:28.941
not something you
typically think of,

00:03:28.941 --> 00:03:32.845
when you see beautiful
images on Instagram.

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:37.016 align:start size:94% position:6%
So like, this day, we were
up at about 8,000 feet,

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:41.520 align:start size:88% position:13%
and the winds were
about 30 miles per hour,

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.155
and it got to the
point where it was

00:03:43.155 --> 00:03:46.092
such a terrible
blizzard outside,

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:47.560 align:start size:84% position:16%
that I could no
longer see the people

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.628
I was taking photos of,

00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:52.265
so I hunkered down
for about 10 minutes,

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:53.932
until the whiteout passed,

00:03:53.932 --> 00:03:57.369
and then we decided
it was probably okay,

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:58.771
we could go home.

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.874
Or there's days like this,

00:04:01.874 --> 00:04:03.075
where the elements turned me

00:04:03.075 --> 00:04:05.711
into a beautiful Lady Gandalf,

00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:06.578
(laughter)

00:04:06.578 --> 00:04:08.081
with an ice beard.

00:04:09.248 --> 00:04:13.052
On this morning, it is
negative 20 degrees,

00:04:13.052 --> 00:04:16.623 align:start size:94% position:6%
I am wearing five
jackets, in this picture,

00:04:17.756 --> 00:04:19.491 align:start size:84% position:16%
and the condensation
from my breath,

00:04:19.491 --> 00:04:21.593 size:88% position:44%
because it was
so cold outside,

00:04:21.593 --> 00:04:24.930
created this awesome
ice beard in my hair,

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.300
and I couldn't pull it
apart, until it melted,

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.205 align:start size:88% position:13%
which wasn't until about
11:00 in the morning.

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:34.140 align:start size:94% position:6%
And at these
temperatures, you're also,

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.409 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm being very
aware of frostbite,

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:39.411
and one of the people I was with

00:04:39.411 --> 00:04:41.647 align:start size:84% position:16%
started to get
frostbite on her toes,

00:04:41.647 --> 00:04:44.016 align:start size:84% position:16%
so again, turned
around and went back,

00:04:44.016 --> 00:04:48.187 align:start size:97% position:3%
because, also part of this job
is knowing when to call it.

00:04:50.489 --> 00:04:52.825
Or there are days like this,

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:54.694
it poured rain,

00:04:54.694 --> 00:04:57.730
last year, I was on an
expedition with this guy,

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.834
Bertie Gregory, and we were
filming for Bertie's digital

00:05:03.068 --> 00:05:07.273
series for Nat Geo Wild,
it's called wild_life,

00:05:07.273 --> 00:05:09.575 align:start size:84% position:16%
and it just finished
its last episode,

00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:12.445 align:start size:84% position:16%
so you can still watch
it, check it out.

00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:15.214
But in this photo,
we're about 75 miles

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:18.117
off the coast of
Vancouver Island,

00:05:18.117 --> 00:05:20.152 align:start size:84% position:16%
we're the only
people on the island,

00:05:20.152 --> 00:05:21.754
and we waved at our float plane

00:05:21.754 --> 00:05:23.088
as they dropped us off,

00:05:23.088 --> 00:05:25.491
hoping that we had
enough food and gear,

00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:28.828
and that our sat
phone was working.

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:32.331 align:start size:84% position:16%
And Bertie is building
a wildlife hide,

00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:34.800 align:start size:84% position:16%
which is, basically,
a wildlife blind,

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.101
and it breaks up your shape,

00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:38.036
because we were on the coast,

00:05:38.036 --> 00:05:40.106
and we wanted to try and find

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:43.543
coastal wolves for
this expedition,

00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:45.677
we needed a way to
break up the shapes,

00:05:45.677 --> 00:05:47.146
so we would sit in this hide,

00:05:47.146 --> 00:05:50.449 align:start size:84% position:16%
and this actually
contributed to about

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:53.218
one month's of my not showering,

00:05:53.218 --> 00:05:55.821
because you can't
alter your scent,

00:05:55.821 --> 00:05:58.090 size:81% position:41%
wolves will smell you,

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.960
or wildlife has pretty
great sense of smell.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.598 align:start size:94% position:6%
So no showering was a
strict rule for this trip,

00:06:05.598 --> 00:06:08.501 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I feel bad for
our float plane pilot,

00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:10.603
that had to take us home.

00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:14.206 align:start size:97% position:3%
But in situations like this,
where it's pouring rain,

00:06:14.206 --> 00:06:18.877
you're starting to be kind
of concerned about your gear,

00:06:18.877 --> 00:06:20.246
and that's a question
that I get a lot is,

00:06:20.246 --> 00:06:23.082 align:start size:84% position:16%
how are you dealing
with your gear

00:06:23.082 --> 00:06:24.283
when you're out in the field

00:06:24.283 --> 00:06:26.152 align:start size:84% position:16%
in the elements
for the whole time?

00:06:26.152 --> 00:06:29.955 align:start size:97% position:3%
And the truth is, it gets
first priority in your tent,

00:06:29.955 --> 00:06:31.023
(laughter)

00:06:31.023 --> 00:06:32.725
you must have a good tent,

00:06:32.725 --> 00:06:35.828
you need to really
trust your equipment.

00:06:35.828 --> 00:06:39.165
But this is about a
quarter of our gear,

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:41.901 align:start size:84% position:16%
actually, I'm
holding one camera,

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:44.236
there's a few more behind
me that you can't see,

00:06:44.236 --> 00:06:47.139
this is a four person tent,

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:49.008 align:start size:84% position:16%
and in the spaces
where two other people

00:06:49.008 --> 00:06:53.345
would typically lay, was
all of our camera gear.

00:06:53.345 --> 00:06:54.780 align:start size:88% position:13%
When you want to
stretch out, you can't,

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.250 align:start position:0%
because there's batteries behind
you, batteries beside you,

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.219
and we had to start sleeping

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:02.687
with batteries in
our sleeping bags,

00:07:02.687 --> 00:07:05.357
and it's not because they're,

00:07:05.357 --> 00:07:07.426
like, I have a weird
thing with batteries,

00:07:07.426 --> 00:07:10.663 align:start size:94% position:6%
it actually helps
prolong the life of them,

00:07:10.663 --> 00:07:12.931 align:start position:0%
so if they're not, warmingup 
and cooling,

00:07:12.931 --> 00:07:14.566
and warming up and cooling,

00:07:14.566 --> 00:07:16.736
you can just stick them
in your sleeping bag,

00:07:16.736 --> 00:07:18.370
and your body heat
helps keep them warm

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.106
and they last longer.

00:07:23.942 --> 00:07:27.413
But I haven't always been
an adventure photographer,

00:07:27.413 --> 00:07:30.015
I haven't always
been on Instagram,

00:07:30.015 --> 00:07:31.316
which I will tell you about,

00:07:31.316 --> 00:07:33.986
but I started Instagram in 2012,

00:07:35.821 --> 00:07:39.992
and at the time, it was just
being used as a really casual

00:07:41.426 --> 00:07:43.796
way to share parts of your life.

00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:46.398
And no one was really
using it for business

00:07:46.398 --> 00:07:49.235
or for promotion
and so part of a,

00:07:50.703 --> 00:07:53.072
a really fun part of pulling
together this presentation,

00:07:53.072 --> 00:07:55.774
is I dug through my images

00:07:55.774 --> 00:07:59.278 align:start size:84% position:16%
and found my very
first Instagram photo,

00:07:59.278 --> 00:08:01.347 align:start size:84% position:16%
which I am so
excited to show you.

00:08:01.347 --> 00:08:02.948
It's really compelling,

00:08:02.948 --> 00:08:03.882
(laughter)

00:08:03.882 --> 00:08:04.717
my dog,

00:08:04.717 --> 00:08:06.652
(laughter)

00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:08.654
this is my dog Vedauwoo,

00:08:11.123 --> 00:08:14.160
this is her sun
bathing position,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.130
and I saw her draped over this
garden hose in the back yard,

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.398
I thought it was funny,

00:08:19.398 --> 00:08:21.400
because she pulls her
legs up like a T-Rex,

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.868
when she gets like that.

00:08:22.868 --> 00:08:25.371
And obviously, pretty comedic,

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:30.376
so on my iPhone, I
though it was funny,

00:08:30.376 --> 00:08:33.278 align:start size:88% position:13%
snapped a photo, put
like four filters on it,

00:08:33.278 --> 00:08:35.514
because that's what you did,

00:08:35.514 --> 00:08:37.249
and then posted it to Instagram,

00:08:37.249 --> 00:08:39.585
so not a lot of forethought.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.689 align:start size:94% position:6%
Also, my favorite
section of the bookstore,

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:45.224
(laughter)

00:08:45.224 --> 00:08:48.861
again, though it was funny,
took a photo with my iPhone,

00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:52.865
posted it immediately,
not a lot of forethought.

00:08:53.965 --> 00:08:56.569
So I had, Instagram, as an app,

00:08:58.203 --> 00:09:01.106 align:start size:94% position:6%
and I was also
storytelling on the side,

00:09:01.106 --> 00:09:02.808 align:start size:84% position:16%
but it never really
occurred to me

00:09:02.808 --> 00:09:04.443
that I could do both,

00:09:04.443 --> 00:09:06.278 align:start size:84% position:16%
that I could
combine that effort,

00:09:06.278 --> 00:09:09.214 align:start size:94% position:6%
because no one was really
using it like that.

00:09:09.214 --> 00:09:11.717
So in 2010, I had won a grant,

00:09:12.617 --> 00:09:14.353
from the University of Wyoming,

00:09:14.353 --> 00:09:17.756 align:start size:97% position:3%
to go document post Hurricane
Katrina in New Orleans,

00:09:17.756 --> 00:09:20.959
and how they were recovering,

00:09:20.959 --> 00:09:24.362 align:start size:97% position:3%
so this was kind of my first
experience in the field,

00:09:24.362 --> 00:09:27.166
and that project led to
a National Geographic

00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:30.836
Young Explorer's grant
to document post tsunami,

00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:32.838
Banda Aceh, Sumatra,

00:09:32.838 --> 00:09:36.475 align:start size:94% position:6%
that was pretty
decimated by the tsunami,

00:09:36.475 --> 00:09:39.344 align:start size:84% position:16%
and if anyone in
the crowd is between

00:09:39.344 --> 00:09:41.347
the ages of 18 to 25,

00:09:41.347 --> 00:09:43.349 align:start size:84% position:16%
or if you know
someone in that age,

00:09:43.349 --> 00:09:44.649 align:start size:84% position:16%
that you think
might be interested

00:09:44.649 --> 00:09:46.218
in the Young Explorers grants,

00:09:46.218 --> 00:09:49.021 align:start size:84% position:16%
they're such an
awesome opportunity,

00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:50.890 align:start size:84% position:16%
and please come talk
to me afterwards,

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:54.493
because it got my foot in the
door with National Geographic,

00:09:54.493 --> 00:09:58.363 align:start size:84% position:16%
and it funded my first
big field project

00:09:58.363 --> 00:10:01.066
was documenting the tsunami,

00:10:01.066 --> 00:10:03.735
and I had a kind of similar idea

00:10:03.735 --> 00:10:05.137
for my Young Explorers grant

00:10:05.137 --> 00:10:07.907
on how Banda Aceh
was recovering,

00:10:09.041 --> 00:10:12.077 align:start size:88% position:13%
and I feel like this
photo really sums it up,

00:10:12.077 --> 00:10:15.247 align:start size:84% position:16%
in my entire project,
into this image.

00:10:16.415 --> 00:10:18.684 align:start size:84% position:16%
I like to play a
game with this photo,

00:10:18.684 --> 00:10:20.453
called find the boat,

00:10:22.287 --> 00:10:24.889
yeah, sort of in the middle.

00:10:24.889 --> 00:10:26.324
This barge had floated inland,

00:10:26.324 --> 00:10:29.027
and you can see the coastline,

00:10:29.027 --> 00:10:32.564 align:start size:94% position:6%
in this photo, so a couple
miles it floated in,

00:10:32.564 --> 00:10:35.100
and it settled there,

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.502
and instead of tear it apart,

00:10:37.502 --> 00:10:41.240
the Indonesians decided,
we'll just build around it.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.375
So you can pay a penny,

00:10:43.375 --> 00:10:44.977
and you can walk
up onto the barge,

00:10:44.977 --> 00:10:49.047 align:start size:94% position:6%
and look out over the city
of Banda Aceh, Sumatra.

00:10:49.047 --> 00:10:51.617
But really, really interesting.

00:10:52.817 --> 00:10:55.654
So I came back from my
Young Explorers project,

00:10:55.654 --> 00:10:57.990
so jazzed about photography,

00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:00.993 align:start position:0%
like, this is what I 
wanted to do,

00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:03.195
I was living my dream.

00:11:03.195 --> 00:11:05.731
But there was this
big jump in my head

00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:09.268 align:start size:88% position:13%
between what I just
got to do as a grantee,

00:11:09.268 --> 00:11:11.736
and being a full
time photographer,

00:11:11.736 --> 00:11:15.675
and I didn't really know
how to make that jump.

00:11:17.275 --> 00:11:20.512
So I was working for
the State of Wyoming,

00:11:20.512 --> 00:11:22.247
as a grant writer,

00:11:22.247 --> 00:11:23.882
and I decided to save
up a bunch of money,

00:11:23.882 --> 00:11:26.685
and that I would go travel.

00:11:26.685 --> 00:11:29.855
So I ended up taking
time off of that job,

00:11:29.855 --> 00:11:32.758
and traveling to
just shoot photos,

00:11:32.758 --> 00:11:35.861
because that's the only
thing I knew how to do,

00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:39.565
and the only thing I
really wanted to do.

00:11:39.565 --> 00:11:43.068
So this road trip ended up
being about 32,000 miles

00:11:43.068 --> 00:11:47.673
around the American West,
just with my dog and I,

00:11:47.673 --> 00:11:49.374
this is on a small break.

00:11:49.374 --> 00:11:53.212
A mouse had climbed into
my engine compartment,

00:11:53.212 --> 00:11:56.482
and at the time, I was
sleeping in this vehicle,

00:11:56.482 --> 00:11:58.817 align:start size:84% position:16%
like, I was sleeping
in the truck,

00:11:58.817 --> 00:12:00.085
and the entire night,

00:12:00.085 --> 00:12:03.422
I could hear it run
across the dashboard,

00:12:03.422 --> 00:12:05.624
and it kept me up all night,

00:12:05.624 --> 00:12:08.594
so this is like 5:00
am in the morning.

00:12:08.594 --> 00:12:10.429
And little did I know,

00:12:12.264 --> 00:12:15.134
my traveling around the West
and creating these images,

00:12:15.134 --> 00:12:18.871
just because I wanted to,
and because I loved it.

00:12:18.871 --> 00:12:22.941
It was creating this kind of
visual diary on Instagram,

00:12:22.941 --> 00:12:26.945
I made the switch, I stopped
taking pictures with my iPhone,

00:12:26.945 --> 00:12:29.982 align:start size:97% position:3%
and posting them, just
taking photos with my camera,

00:12:29.982 --> 00:12:32.317
and posting them there.

00:12:32.317 --> 00:12:35.287 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I had no idea that
people were paying attention

00:12:35.287 --> 00:12:38.623
until I started to
gather this audience,

00:12:38.623 --> 00:12:41.293
and when I hit 20,000 followers,

00:12:42.193 --> 00:12:44.363
my mom wanted to get me a cake,

00:12:44.363 --> 00:12:45.297
(laughter)

00:12:45.297 --> 00:12:48.033
and I was like, no, no, no.

00:12:48.033 --> 00:12:49.835
No, no, no, people don't
do that, thank you though,

00:12:49.835 --> 00:12:51.369
very, very kind.

00:12:51.369 --> 00:12:54.039
But I didn't really realize that

00:12:55.273 --> 00:12:57.709
people wanted to see
what I was shooting

00:12:57.709 --> 00:13:00.679
until I started to
gather this audience.

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:04.016
So at the very end
of 2014, I decided,

00:13:04.016 --> 00:13:07.820
I would make the jump into
full time freelancehood,

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:12.357
and it was like, a major,
major leap of faith for me.

00:13:12.357 --> 00:13:14.593
And, so as soon as I, like,

00:13:15.927 --> 00:13:17.396
publicly announced that I was

00:13:17.396 --> 00:13:19.999
going into full
time photography,

00:13:19.999 --> 00:13:23.635 align:start size:88% position:13%
I immediately panicked,
I was like, oh no,

00:13:23.635 --> 00:13:25.037
maybe this isn't right.

00:13:25.037 --> 00:13:28.207 align:start size:84% position:16%
And so when I panic,
I go fly fishing,

00:13:29.874 --> 00:13:33.011
so I left for a week
on a fly fishing trip

00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:35.947
in the back country of Montana.

00:13:35.947 --> 00:13:38.483
And when I came out
of the back country,

00:13:38.483 --> 00:13:41.420
I had an email from someone,

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.889
and I thought it was spam,

00:13:43.889 --> 00:13:46.759 align:start size:94% position:6%
it wasn't spam, it was
from a fly fishing company

00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:51.596
that wanted me to shoot their
entire campaign for that year,

00:13:51.596 --> 00:13:54.065 align:start size:88% position:13%
and when I finally spoke
on the phone to them,

00:13:54.065 --> 00:13:56.768 align:start size:88% position:13%
and asked them how on
Earth they had found me,

00:13:56.768 --> 00:13:59.371
they said, through Instagram.

00:13:59.371 --> 00:14:02.074
And that was my first
freelance job was,

00:14:02.074 --> 00:14:03.742
they found me there.

00:14:06.111 --> 00:14:14.486
So, for most of the half of
the 2015, the first half,

00:14:14.486 --> 00:14:18.991 align:start size:97% position:3%
this is last year, I got
that fly fishing job in 2014,

00:14:18.991 --> 00:14:22.695 align:start size:94% position:6%
and then I didn't get
another email for months.

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:23.762
Again, panic,

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:26.799
so I decided, okay,

00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:30.435
I would go on more trips,

00:14:30.435 --> 00:14:33.805
because I knew that
it was a gamble,

00:14:33.805 --> 00:14:37.275
but it was an investment
in making more images,

00:14:37.275 --> 00:14:38.843
things that were compelling,

00:14:38.843 --> 00:14:40.745
and things that I wanted to see.

00:14:40.745 --> 00:14:42.180
And I think it shines through,

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:46.351 align:start size:97% position:3%
when you're doing something
that you really love.

00:14:46.351 --> 00:14:49.020 align:start size:94% position:6%
And so, I started
creating things like this,

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.756
just totally diverse,

00:14:51.957 --> 00:14:54.893
and then it struck me
part way through 2015,

00:14:54.893 --> 00:14:58.263 align:start size:94% position:6%
that I could kind of start
leveraging the audience

00:14:58.263 --> 00:15:02.267 align:start size:88% position:13%
that I had built on
Instagram to companies,

00:15:02.267 --> 00:15:05.003 align:start size:84% position:16%
or for projects
that I wanted to do,

00:15:05.003 --> 00:15:06.204
I wanted to travel,

00:15:06.204 --> 00:15:08.440 align:start size:88% position:13%
and so I would send
out notes to companies,

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.476 align:start size:97% position:3%
and say, "are you interested
in this expedition?"

00:15:11.476 --> 00:15:15.547 align:start size:97% position:3%
And that's how the expedition
to Panama was born.

00:15:16.882 --> 00:15:19.284
This is my friend
Clare Fieseler,

00:15:19.284 --> 00:15:22.554 align:start size:84% position:16%
who is a fellow Young
Explorer grantee,

00:15:22.554 --> 00:15:25.424 align:start size:84% position:16%
and my favorite
expedition partner.

00:15:25.424 --> 00:15:30.362 align:start size:94% position:6%
And we had been in
contact with this company

00:15:30.362 --> 00:15:33.966 align:start size:84% position:16%
called Oru Kayak,
and we had proposed,

00:15:33.966 --> 00:15:35.634
it was Clare's idea,

00:15:36.501 --> 00:15:38.670
to circumnavigate this island

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:42.107
outside of Panama
called Bastimentos,

00:15:42.107 --> 00:15:45.310 align:start size:97% position:3%
and you can see it up
there, with the little pin,

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:47.779
it doesn't look that big,

00:15:47.779 --> 00:15:50.015
but it was a four day trip.

00:15:51.717 --> 00:15:55.086 align:start size:88% position:13%
And we had two
objectives for the trip,

00:15:55.086 --> 00:15:58.724
one, do a social media
story for Oru Kayak,

00:15:58.724 --> 00:16:01.560
and then two, to
write a blog post

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:05.163 align:start size:84% position:16%
for National
Geographic Adventure.

00:16:05.163 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start size:84% position:16%
And there were
only some problems,

00:16:09.435 --> 00:16:10.602
to begin with,

00:16:11.769 --> 00:16:15.240
problem number one, or
complication number one,

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.443 align:start size:84% position:16%
Clare and I had never
worked together.

00:16:18.443 --> 00:16:21.313 align:start size:84% position:16%
And this may not
seem like a big deal,

00:16:21.313 --> 00:16:23.782
but sometimes your
expedition partners,

00:16:23.782 --> 00:16:26.117
or sometimes your
friends don't make

00:16:26.117 --> 00:16:28.720
the best expedition partners.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.088
So we had been talking about

00:16:30.088 --> 00:16:31.990
a much larger circumnavigation,

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:33.591
but we decided we
should probably

00:16:33.591 --> 00:16:36.094
make sure we like each other,

00:16:36.094 --> 00:16:40.165
before we jump into
a multi-month trip.

00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:43.234 align:start size:88% position:13%
So we started having
these Skype phone calls,

00:16:43.234 --> 00:16:46.438
and we're, at this time,
in two different countries,

00:16:46.438 --> 00:16:49.474 align:start size:97% position:3%
and both of us are
traveling really frequently.

00:16:49.474 --> 00:16:51.810 align:start size:94% position:6%
So this Skype conversation
was the last one

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:54.512
before I went to Panama,

00:16:54.512 --> 00:16:57.416
and I'm, obviously
had a headlamp on,

00:16:57.416 --> 00:16:59.784 align:start size:88% position:13%
and I'm, like, standing
on my tippy toes,

00:16:59.784 --> 00:17:01.286
at the top of a peak,

00:17:01.286 --> 00:17:03.555 align:start size:94% position:6%
because that's where I can
get cell phone service.

00:17:03.555 --> 00:17:06.491 align:start size:84% position:16%
And Clare is in
her room in Panama,

00:17:06.491 --> 00:17:08.493
and she doesn't get
cell phone service

00:17:08.493 --> 00:17:10.929 align:start size:84% position:16%
on the island either,
so we're, like,

00:17:10.929 --> 00:17:14.165 align:start size:88% position:13%
trying to piece together
these Skype meetings.

00:17:14.165 --> 00:17:18.536
Problem number two, or
complication number two,

00:17:18.536 --> 00:17:21.540
we had never used
the kayaks before,

00:17:23.908 --> 00:17:25.477
just keep that one in mind.

00:17:25.477 --> 00:17:26.645
(laughter)

00:17:26.645 --> 00:17:28.413
Complication number three,

00:17:28.413 --> 00:17:32.584 align:start size:97% position:3%
we had no idea how much
carrying capacity they had,

00:17:34.452 --> 00:17:38.156
which might not be that big
of a deal, thinking about it,

00:17:38.156 --> 00:17:41.125
but when you start
adding things up,

00:17:41.125 --> 00:17:46.731
like, our self-supported gear,

00:17:46.731 --> 00:17:49.401
tent, sleeping pad, food, water,

00:17:51.303 --> 00:17:52.837
and then camera gear.

00:17:52.837 --> 00:17:55.374
And I don't know how many
of you have a camera body,

00:17:55.374 --> 00:17:59.344 align:start size:88% position:13%
with it's various,
heavy, heavy appendages,

00:17:59.344 --> 00:18:01.280
but it starts to add up.

00:18:02.147 --> 00:18:03.748
So we had no idea how much

00:18:03.748 --> 00:18:06.652
would actually fit
into the kayaks.

00:18:08.019 --> 00:18:10.488 align:start size:94% position:6%
Just a little bit of
background on the kayaks,

00:18:10.488 --> 00:18:13.258
they start as a
two by three box,

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:18.296 align:start size:88% position:13%
and they unfurl into
those large white kayaks

00:18:18.296 --> 00:18:21.766
that you saw Clare and
I standing in front of,

00:18:21.766 --> 00:18:23.602
roughly about 16 feet.

00:18:25.571 --> 00:18:30.108
They are really, well, the
website and directions said,

00:18:30.108 --> 00:18:33.478 align:start size:97% position:3%
give yourself 15 to 20
minutes to put them together,

00:18:33.478 --> 00:18:35.780
and so, Clare and I
are like, awesome,

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.949
that's great, we can do that.

00:18:37.949 --> 00:18:41.720
So we put it off until
the last thing we did,

00:18:43.555 --> 00:18:47.459
it took us a little bit
longer than 15 minutes.

00:18:48.393 --> 00:18:49.294
It took us,

00:18:51.496 --> 00:18:53.232
about two and a half,

00:18:54.399 --> 00:18:56.401
three and a half, hours.

00:19:00.172 --> 00:19:01.773 align:start size:84% position:16%
They are a little
bit more complicated

00:19:01.773 --> 00:19:03.108
than we initially thought,

00:19:03.108 --> 00:19:06.111
(laughter)

00:19:06.111 --> 00:19:08.046
so you can see it
getting darker,

00:19:08.046 --> 00:19:09.881
(laughter)

00:19:09.881 --> 00:19:11.082
and darker.

00:19:11.082 --> 00:19:13.318
(laughter)

00:19:16.054 --> 00:19:17.823 align:start size:84% position:16%
The other thing that
kind of put off,

00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:19.290
because we didn't know
the carrying capacity,

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.059
was the grocery list,

00:19:22.226 --> 00:19:25.063 align:start size:88% position:13%
and knowing that we were
going to be kayaking,

00:19:25.063 --> 00:19:26.965
multiple miles a day.

00:19:26.965 --> 00:19:29.434 align:start size:81% position:19%
I had put together
a last minute,

00:19:29.434 --> 00:19:32.771 align:start size:88% position:13%
but very calorie
efficient grocery list,

00:19:34.206 --> 00:19:37.408
with what was available at
the Panamanian grocery store

00:19:37.408 --> 00:19:40.078
on the island of Bocas del Toro.

00:19:41.345 --> 00:19:43.515 align:start size:84% position:16%
Cheese, peanut butter,
apples, water, rum.

00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:44.749
(laughter)

00:19:44.749 --> 00:19:46.251
Calorie efficient.

00:19:47.819 --> 00:19:50.188
So Instagram became this way

00:19:50.188 --> 00:19:54.159 align:start size:94% position:6%
to tell these little
vignettes, these stories,

00:19:54.159 --> 00:19:57.963
and, or as I like to call
them, learning curves,

00:19:57.963 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start size:97% position:3%
of what was actually
happening on the expedition.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.836
So learning curve number one,

00:20:08.039 --> 00:20:12.243 align:start size:94% position:6%
Clare and I are in a
rush to get out the door,

00:20:12.243 --> 00:20:13.712
to start kayaking,

00:20:13.712 --> 00:20:16.615
we finally figure out that
everything fits in the boats,

00:20:16.615 --> 00:20:17.449
win,

00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:21.586
the boats float, win number two.

00:20:21.586 --> 00:20:23.989
We finally start paddling,

00:20:23.989 --> 00:20:27.025
and it's been a year and
a half since I've kayaked.

00:20:27.025 --> 00:20:29.561 align:start size:81% position:19%
I was carrying
110 liters through

00:20:29.561 --> 00:20:34.298 align:start size:97% position:3%
a temperate rain forest in
Canada, I had not been rowing.

00:20:34.298 --> 00:20:37.535
So, a few miles into the trip,

00:20:37.535 --> 00:20:40.571
I am hoping that
my arms fall off,

00:20:40.571 --> 00:20:43.674
to give me an excuse to stop
paddling against the current.

00:20:43.674 --> 00:20:46.111
And I start to kind of panic,

00:20:47.011 --> 00:20:48.846
because the current is really,

00:20:48.846 --> 00:20:51.549
really strong on the ocean side,

00:20:51.549 --> 00:20:53.685
so it's pulling me one way,

00:20:53.685 --> 00:20:55.754
and I'm just digging
with my left hand,

00:20:55.754 --> 00:20:57.656
and I'm starting to panic.

00:20:57.656 --> 00:21:00.258 align:start size:84% position:16%
And Clare's a little
bit away from me,

00:21:00.258 --> 00:21:01.827
and so I'm paddling, and I yell,

00:21:01.827 --> 00:21:04.997 align:start size:84% position:16%
Clare, how much
further do have to go?

00:21:06.364 --> 00:21:10.001 align:start size:97% position:3%
And she's paddling, digging
with her left paddle,

00:21:10.001 --> 00:21:12.971 align:start size:84% position:16%
she's like, I don't
know, look at the GPS.

00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:17.042
And I'm paddling, and I'm
like, you have the GPS,

00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:19.377
and we both kind of turn
and look at each other,

00:21:19.377 --> 00:21:23.548 align:start size:97% position:3%
and stop paddling, and
realize that we left the GPS.

00:21:26.717 --> 00:21:29.587
Yes, this is a circumnavigation,

00:21:29.587 --> 00:21:31.088
there's an island on one side,

00:21:31.088 --> 00:21:35.426
there's an ocean the other,
it can't be that hard, right.

00:21:35.426 --> 00:21:36.261
Well,

00:21:37.962 --> 00:21:42.934 align:start position:0%
there are these mangrove
entrances with GPS coordinates,

00:21:42.934 --> 00:21:45.870 align:start size:88% position:13%
the mangroves are so
thick, from the outside,

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:49.340 align:start size:97% position:3%
in a lot of the places
that we were going to stay,

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.677
we actually could not locate

00:21:52.877 --> 00:21:56.081 align:start size:81% position:19%
where the mangrove
entrances were.

00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:58.416 align:start size:81% position:19%
This is when we
finally found one,

00:21:58.416 --> 00:21:59.684
on the first night,

00:21:59.684 --> 00:22:01.419
we were going to stay
at a fishing lodge.

00:22:01.419 --> 00:22:03.154
And they just happened to be

00:22:03.154 --> 00:22:05.557
blowing through conch shells,

00:22:06.758 --> 00:22:08.026
and we were like, let's
follow the conch shells,

00:22:08.026 --> 00:22:10.595
that sounds promising,
and we ended up there.

00:22:10.595 --> 00:22:11.430
So good.

00:22:14.098 --> 00:22:16.734
So this is the Instagram
post that we did with this,

00:22:16.734 --> 00:22:19.437
the best and scariest parts

00:22:19.437 --> 00:22:21.339
about expeditions
are the unknowns,

00:22:21.339 --> 00:22:23.608
there were quite a
handful on this trip.

00:22:23.608 --> 00:22:25.543 align:start size:84% position:16%
Clare Fieseler
tending to the fire

00:22:25.543 --> 00:22:27.145
after a long day of open ocean,

00:22:27.145 --> 00:22:30.982 align:start size:97% position:3%
dealing with my seasickness,
and the lost GPS.

00:22:34.753 --> 00:22:36.922
Learning curve number two,

00:22:38.323 --> 00:22:39.857
because we were lost,

00:22:39.857 --> 00:22:44.362
we were supposed to sleep
at an indigenous village,

00:22:44.362 --> 00:22:46.898 align:start size:84% position:16%
and both of us were
so excited about this,

00:22:46.898 --> 00:22:48.466
because the southern
part of the island

00:22:48.466 --> 00:22:50.935
is not a tourist destination,

00:22:50.935 --> 00:22:53.505 align:start size:84% position:16%
it does not get
visited very often.

00:22:53.505 --> 00:22:55.306
And we had the opportunity

00:22:55.306 --> 00:22:59.377
to camp with the indigenous
people in their village,

00:22:59.377 --> 00:23:01.146
which was so exciting,

00:23:03.348 --> 00:23:04.683
because we were lost,

00:23:04.683 --> 00:23:06.717
we couldn't find the
mangrove entrance,

00:23:06.717 --> 00:23:10.188
we decided to camp on
this beach instead,

00:23:10.188 --> 00:23:14.626 align:start size:97% position:3%
the last photo that you
saw, that's where we camped.

00:23:14.626 --> 00:23:17.396
And we decided,
the next morning,

00:23:18.596 --> 00:23:21.600
it's okay, we will
find this village,

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:26.204
we will portage, which
when full of possessions,

00:23:26.204 --> 00:23:28.873 align:start size:94% position:6%
the kayaks, when we
lifted them up to portage,

00:23:28.873 --> 00:23:32.978 align:start size:97% position:3%
they started to bow the
other way under the weight.

00:23:32.978 --> 00:23:35.613
Which is not something you
want from a foldable kayak,

00:23:35.613 --> 00:23:39.785
so, scratch that plan, dump
out all of our possessions,

00:23:40.918 --> 00:23:43.354 align:start size:88% position:13%
refold the boats, start
portaging the boats

00:23:43.354 --> 00:23:45.490 align:start size:81% position:19%
with our camera
gear on our backs.

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:48.492
And we start to go
down this trail,

00:23:48.492 --> 00:23:49.961
which, it starts on this bridge,

00:23:49.961 --> 00:23:52.730
and then the trail
was off to my right,

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:54.399
and we start to go
down this bridge,

00:23:54.399 --> 00:23:56.734
and we run into a local.

00:23:56.734 --> 00:23:59.938 align:start size:94% position:6%
So exciting, and the
local gives us some very,

00:23:59.938 --> 00:24:01.606
very key information,

00:24:04.776 --> 00:24:06.644
Clare Fieseler in
a short portage,

00:24:06.644 --> 00:24:09.146 size:88% position:44%
originally, Clare and I were
going to portage our gear,

00:24:09.146 --> 00:24:10.782
for a mile to an
indigenous village,

00:24:10.782 --> 00:24:12.317 align:start size:88% position:13%
right as we were packing
up to start hiking,

00:24:12.317 --> 00:24:13.784 align:start size:84% position:16%
we were told that
the dense jungle path

00:24:13.784 --> 00:24:16.921
we were going to use was
actually a crocodile trail.

00:24:16.921 --> 00:24:19.157
(laughter)

00:24:20.792 --> 00:24:22.594
Narrowly avoided that one.

00:24:22.594 --> 00:24:24.896
(laughter)

00:24:24.896 --> 00:24:26.197
So Clare and I had come up

00:24:26.197 --> 00:24:28.433
with the hashtag
#PaddlingPanama,

00:24:28.433 --> 00:24:30.501 align:start size:81% position:19%
you can kind of
see it down there,

00:24:30.501 --> 00:24:31.970
on the left,

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:35.807 align:start size:94% position:6%
and we used that to curate
these images together,

00:24:36.841 --> 00:24:39.344
to do this eventual blog post.

00:24:40.345 --> 00:24:42.446
Mine is here on my left,

00:24:42.446 --> 00:24:44.982 align:start size:94% position:6%
and Clare's, How
Circumnavigating an Island

00:24:44.982 --> 00:24:46.818
by Kayak Is Like Speed Dating.

00:24:46.818 --> 00:24:48.253
(laughter)

00:24:48.253 --> 00:24:50.588 align:start size:97% position:3%
And we were laughing and
joking while we were paddling,

00:24:50.588 --> 00:24:54.259
that expeditions are
like explore Match.com,

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.462 align:start size:84% position:16%
because you're trying
to put out these

00:24:57.462 --> 00:24:59.798 align:start size:84% position:16%
small little fires
when you're panicking,

00:24:59.798 --> 00:25:01.399
and you're like, oh, you
deal with it like that,

00:25:01.399 --> 00:25:02.667
me too, okay, we're good,

00:25:02.667 --> 00:25:06.571
we can go into the field
together, we're a match.

00:25:07.738 --> 00:25:11.009
So Instagram has done
so much for my life,

00:25:12.176 --> 00:25:14.779 align:start position:0%
it's really broughtinto 
my world,

00:25:14.779 --> 00:25:16.414
it's allowed me to
connect to people

00:25:16.414 --> 00:25:19.751
that I never dreamed
of connecting with,

00:25:21.185 --> 00:25:24.956
and share my images, just
outside of my community.

00:25:24.956 --> 00:25:27.025
I will continue to share,

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.929
it's also introduced me to
some of my best friends,

00:25:31.929 --> 00:25:33.831
this is my best friend Heidi,

00:25:33.831 --> 00:25:38.003
and these are seven year old
chickens sitting on our heads.

00:25:39.204 --> 00:25:41.172
It's introduced me to
some wonderful people,

00:25:41.172 --> 00:25:42.674
and as much as it's
broadened my world,

00:25:42.674 --> 00:25:45.410
it's really shrunk it too.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:48.513 align:start size:84% position:16%
I use it to check
conditions of places,

00:25:48.513 --> 00:25:52.517
if I'm going somewhere, and
need to look up the weather,

00:25:52.517 --> 00:25:54.386
then I will look
up the location,

00:25:54.386 --> 00:25:57.988 align:start size:84% position:16%
and see what has
recently been posted.

00:25:57.988 --> 00:26:01.025
I obviously use it for business,

00:26:01.025 --> 00:26:03.094 align:start size:84% position:16%
but, yeah, it's also
shrunk my world,

00:26:03.094 --> 00:26:06.865
and introduced me to some
really wonderful people.

00:26:06.865 --> 00:26:09.567 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's such a great
tool for connecting,

00:26:09.567 --> 00:26:12.537 align:start size:94% position:6%
so I hope you will
connect with me there too.

00:26:12.537 --> 00:26:14.806
(applause)
