00:00:00.175 --> 00:00:01.587
- [Voiceover] As you might already know

00:00:01.587 --> 00:00:03.253
or you're finding out through this video,

00:00:03.253 --> 00:00:07.489
a new SAT, a new SAT is coming.

00:00:07.489 --> 00:00:10.689
And the first administration
of that new SAT

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:15.058
is going to be on March 2016.

00:00:15.058 --> 00:00:16.744
So the first question
you're probably asking,

00:00:16.744 --> 00:00:19.020
"well, does this apply to me?"

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.747
And a simple rule of thumb is if

00:00:20.747 --> 00:00:22.423
you're going to need to apply to college

00:00:22.423 --> 00:00:25.623
before March 2016, and
so that's the majority

00:00:25.623 --> 00:00:29.717
of the folks who are
applying in the fall of 2015,

00:00:29.717 --> 00:00:31.159
well then the new SAT is probably

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:33.851
going to come a little
bit too late for you.

00:00:33.851 --> 00:00:35.720
But if you're applying
for college after that,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.752
so the fall of 2016,

00:00:37.752 --> 00:00:40.526
you could probably use either SAT,

00:00:40.526 --> 00:00:42.953
the new SAT or the current SAT.

00:00:42.953 --> 00:00:45.585
And for sure if you're
applying for college

00:00:45.585 --> 00:00:48.175
in the fall of 2017, 2018,

00:00:48.175 --> 00:00:50.887
you're probably going
to focus on the new SAT.

00:00:50.887 --> 00:00:53.011
So applying, let me write this,

00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:55.388
so this most likely will apply

00:00:55.388 --> 00:01:00.388
to folks applying for college

00:01:02.283 --> 00:01:07.283
fall 2016 and after.

00:01:10.495 --> 00:01:12.160
So with that out of the way,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.653
what's the whole point?

00:01:13.653 --> 00:01:16.223
What is different about the new SAT?

00:01:16.223 --> 00:01:18.326
And I'll do another video
where I'll go into the details

00:01:18.326 --> 00:01:19.789
and I look at some of the sample items,

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:21.353
and we think about how
they're different from

00:01:21.353 --> 00:01:24.553
the current SAT, but at a very high level,

00:01:24.553 --> 00:01:26.758
the goal is to really just be more aligned

00:01:26.758 --> 00:01:28.790
with what you learn in school.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.790
More aligned, more aligned with school.

00:01:34.692 --> 00:01:35.992
And the things that you need to know

00:01:35.992 --> 00:01:37.120
to be college ready.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.887
So, this even includes the vocabulary.

00:01:38.887 --> 00:01:42.282
The old SAT or you could
say the current SAT

00:01:42.282 --> 00:01:44.353
was famous for some words

00:01:44.353 --> 00:01:45.420
that you might not use in

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.659
your everyday conversations,

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.950
or you might not use in, even in college

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.754
while the new SAT is going
to be more aligned with that.

00:01:52.754 --> 00:01:54.247
It still helps to know vocabulary,

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:55.456
but they're going to be vocabulary words

00:01:55.456 --> 00:01:57.620
that you'll find using a lot in college

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.652
or in your later life.

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:00.759
So, it's going to be more aligned

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:01.988
with what you learn in school,

00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:06.418
and at a very general level,
it's going to be simpler.

00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:07.952
And it's going to be simpler in terms of

00:02:07.952 --> 00:02:09.323
the number of sections,

00:02:09.323 --> 00:02:10.522
and we'll talk about that a little bit.

00:02:10.522 --> 00:02:11.619
And you're going to have more time

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:13.752
for a question in general.

00:02:13.752 --> 00:02:15.185
It's also going to be simpler in terms

00:02:15.185 --> 00:02:17.054
of how you think about taking the test.

00:02:17.054 --> 00:02:19.025
The old or the current SAT,

00:02:19.025 --> 00:02:20.091
you have to think about,

00:02:20.091 --> 00:02:21.260
ok if I guess on this,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.651
there's going to be a
penalty for guessing.

00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:25.353
While on the new SAT, while on the new SAT

00:02:25.353 --> 00:02:26.613
there's no penalty for guessing.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:27.853
So if you can answer it, answer it.

00:02:27.853 --> 00:02:30.321
If you can rule out some choices,

00:02:30.321 --> 00:02:31.053
still answer it.

00:02:31.053 --> 00:02:32.872
You should just always
try to answer questions,

00:02:32.872 --> 00:02:34.120
so you don't have to really think about

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.157
the gamesmanship of it,

00:02:35.157 --> 00:02:38.255
you just answer, answer the questions.

00:02:38.255 --> 00:02:39.525
So the next thing you're
probably thinking about-

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:40.653
well, what are the sections,

00:02:40.653 --> 00:02:42.827
and how is it actually going to be,

00:02:42.827 --> 00:02:45.488
how is it actually going to be scored?

00:02:45.488 --> 00:02:47.693
So, what I've pre-drawn right over here,

00:02:47.693 --> 00:02:48.546
and I hope you can read it,

00:02:48.546 --> 00:02:49.681
the writing is a little bit small,

00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:54.681
is I'm comparing the
current/old SAT up here,

00:02:55.017 --> 00:02:58.054
so this line right over here is the,

00:02:58.054 --> 00:02:59.893
depending on your point of view,

00:02:59.893 --> 00:03:02.656
the current/old SAT.

00:03:02.656 --> 00:03:06.821
The one that is "sun-setting",
going into 2016.

00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:10.123
Your last chance to take
this is January 2016.

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:12.520
And then this one is the new one,

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.922
so this right over here,

00:03:13.922 --> 00:03:15.853
that is the new SAT.

00:03:15.853 --> 00:03:18.484
That's the one that we are talking about.

00:03:18.484 --> 00:03:21.724
So, big picture, you see
that the current SAT,

00:03:21.724 --> 00:03:23.573
you have three math sections.

00:03:23.573 --> 00:03:26.692
Two of them are 25 minutes,
one of them is 20 minutes.

00:03:26.692 --> 00:03:28.460
And it's not necessarily going
to be given in this order.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.918
In fact, it's likely
to be all shuffled up.

00:03:30.918 --> 00:03:34.717
While on the new SAT, you
have two math sections.

00:03:34.717 --> 00:03:36.983
One of them's 25 minutes
and one is longer.

00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:39.090
It's 55 minutes, but they only have

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.122
those two sections,

00:03:40.122 --> 00:03:42.387
and as you can see here,
with the longer section,

00:03:42.387 --> 00:03:44.586
you're allowed to use a calculator.

00:03:44.586 --> 00:03:45.892
And so you'll probably see questions

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:48.350
that may be helpful to use a calculator.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.387
And then the other one,

00:03:49.387 --> 00:03:50.880
you don't use a calculator.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.054
And you see that the time is,

00:03:53.054 --> 00:03:54.344
let's see you're comparing,

00:03:54.344 --> 00:03:59.344
this is 70 minutes and 54 questions

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.918
versus 80 minutes and 58 questions.

00:04:02.918 --> 00:04:04.821
So on average, you have a little bit,

00:04:04.821 --> 00:04:07.855
you have more time per question.

00:04:07.855 --> 00:04:09.450
And now we can look here in the reading,

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.451
again you have three sections of reading.

00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:13.788
Two 25 minute sections,
one 20 minute sections.

00:04:13.788 --> 00:04:17.719
Now you have one 65
minute reading sections.

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:19.213
And once again, on average,

00:04:19.213 --> 00:04:21.519
you have more time per question

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.926
in the new reading sections.

00:04:23.926 --> 00:04:25.054
And I just want to make it very clear,

00:04:25.054 --> 00:04:27.421
it's not necessarily going to
be administered in this order.

00:04:27.421 --> 00:04:29.422
I'm just showing you so
we can kind of compare.

00:04:29.422 --> 00:04:32.023
Reading to reading or math to math.

00:04:32.023 --> 00:04:34.989
Then in the current SAT, you have,

00:04:34.989 --> 00:04:37.854
the one that you would take
if you took it in 2015,

00:04:37.854 --> 00:04:40.018
you have two writing sections

00:04:40.018 --> 00:04:41.084
or two, I guess you could say,

00:04:41.084 --> 00:04:42.821
two non-essay writing sections.

00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:44.721
One is 25 minutes, one is 10 minutes.

00:04:44.721 --> 00:04:46.590
And then you also have an essay section

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.821
that helps form part
of your writing score.

00:04:49.821 --> 00:04:51.893
While in the new SAT, you have just a

00:04:51.893 --> 00:04:55.621
35 minute writing section and
then the essay is optional.

00:04:55.621 --> 00:04:57.084
This little green thing right over here,

00:04:57.084 --> 00:04:58.354
this is the experimental section

00:04:58.354 --> 00:04:59.817
in the current SAT,

00:04:59.817 --> 00:05:01.656
and there might be experimental sections

00:05:01.656 --> 00:05:04.856
in the new SAT as well.

00:05:04.856 --> 00:05:07.290
So this is kind of a comparison of things,

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.092
and kind of the big takeaways are

00:05:09.092 --> 00:05:10.585
you have fewer sections here,

00:05:10.585 --> 00:05:13.318
more time on average per question,

00:05:13.318 --> 00:05:15.752
and then the essay is optional.

00:05:15.752 --> 00:05:18.824
So, how is all of this going to be scored?

00:05:18.824 --> 00:05:23.824
Well, in the current SAT,
let me write it over here,

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.084
so let me write the current SAT,

00:05:29.084 --> 00:05:30.821
or you can view it as the old SAT

00:05:30.821 --> 00:05:32.091
if you want to view it that way.

00:05:32.091 --> 00:05:34.021
Current/old SAT and I want to compare it

00:05:34.021 --> 00:05:38.368
to the new SAT

00:05:38.368 --> 00:05:43.368
In the current one, math is scored

00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:48.193
on a scale from 200 to 800.

00:05:48.193 --> 00:05:50.753
And that's still going to
be the case in the new SAT.

00:05:50.753 --> 00:05:55.751
Math is going to be scored
on a scale from 200 to 800.

00:05:55.751 --> 00:06:00.751
Now on the current SAT,
you have a reading score

00:06:01.592 --> 00:06:04.486
based on these three
sections right over here

00:06:04.486 --> 00:06:08.388
that's going to be scored from 200 to 800.

00:06:08.388 --> 00:06:11.121
Now in the new SAT, reading and writing

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:12.757
is going to be combined.

00:06:12.757 --> 00:06:17.757
So reading plus writing is going

00:06:22.052 --> 00:06:26.491
to give you a 200 to 800 points of score.

00:06:26.491 --> 00:06:27.253
So this is going to be-

00:06:27.253 --> 00:06:29.021
I don't know whether to
write it in blue or orange

00:06:29.021 --> 00:06:30.220
so maybe I write it in both

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.354
or let me, I'll write it in another color.

00:06:34.354 --> 00:06:37.849
200 to 800 points for this.

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:40.534
And in the current or old SAT,

00:06:40.534 --> 00:06:45.534
you have writing/essay
as a separate section.

00:06:45.927 --> 00:06:50.927
Writing/essay and this also
gave you 200 to 800 points.

00:06:54.917 --> 00:06:57.284
While in the new SAT, you just have

00:06:57.284 --> 00:06:58.859
the essay section is separate from

00:06:58.859 --> 00:07:00.951
the writing in terms of score.

00:07:00.951 --> 00:07:04.294
So you just have the essay,

00:07:04.294 --> 00:07:05.756
and once again, this is optional.

00:07:05.756 --> 00:07:07.392
This is an optional thing.

00:07:07.392 --> 00:07:09.850
You have the essay which is optional,

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:10.887
I'll write it again even though

00:07:10.887 --> 00:07:12.654
I wrote it down here as well.

00:07:12.654 --> 00:07:14.219
It's optional and that's
going to be scored

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:19.219
from 2 to 4, sorry 2 to 8 points.

00:07:19.757 --> 00:07:22.051
So, what are the big takeaways here?

00:07:22.051 --> 00:07:23.148
Well in the current SAT,

00:07:23.148 --> 00:07:24.418
when people give you their SAT score,

00:07:24.418 --> 00:07:25.322
they're going to give you a score,

00:07:25.322 --> 00:07:26.460
if you add these up,

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:27.750
the lowest possible score's going to be

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.655
200 plus 200 plus 200
which is going to be 600.

00:07:30.655 --> 00:07:32.819
Then the highest one is 2400.

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:34.617
So it's on a 2400 point scale.

00:07:34.617 --> 00:07:36.283
That's the current/old SAT.

00:07:36.283 --> 00:07:37.756
Well the new one, well people are

00:07:37.756 --> 00:07:38.793
likely to give their scores,

00:07:38.793 --> 00:07:41.424
the lowest possible score is 200 plus 200

00:07:41.424 --> 00:07:42.856
which is going to be 400,

00:07:42.856 --> 00:07:45.822
and the highest one is going to 1600.

00:07:45.822 --> 00:07:48.352
800 in math, 800 in reading plus writing,

00:07:48.352 --> 00:07:50.120
and then people might have also

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.620
an optional essay score
that is as high as 8 points.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:55.920
So, those are the big takeaways.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.251
Hopefully that helps you a little bit.

00:07:57.251 --> 00:07:59.557
And in a future video, I'll
look at the actual items

00:07:59.557 --> 00:08:02.219
and think about how things have changed.
