00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:23.980
To 
begin with, cannibalism is absolutely legal

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.080
in the United States (with the exception of
the state of Idaho), the UK, much of Europe,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.080
Japan, etc.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.290
However, as Cornell Law School notes, a number
of laws are in place across America “that

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.180
indirectly make it impossible to legally obtain
and consume the body matter”.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.550
The same can be said for the many other countries
in which cannibalism isn’t directly illegal.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.520
For example, in much of the world desecrating
a corpse is a crime.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.699
On top of this, in cases where the flesh is
somehow obtained legally, a cannibal can be

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.769
charged for crimes ranging from “outraging
public decency” to “preventing a lawful

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.640
burial”, giving the law a number of avenues
to prosecute cannibals in this regard.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.120
All that said, if a person was mindful of
all these laws and managed to obtain some

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.760
human flesh legally, they could quite literally
eat said flesh in front of a cop, all while

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.680
wearing a sandwich board advertising the fact
that they’re a cannibal and suffer no legal

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.680
consequences.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.430
While this might sound like a fantastical
example, in fact, something like this has

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.430
actually happened.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.040
Enter Canadian performance artist Rick Gibson.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.580
Before his cannibalistic endeavors, he was
probably most famous for taking a couple human

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.159
fetuses and making earrings out of them.

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.600
These were then placed on a female mannequin
in yet another “lovely” example of modern

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.480
art at its finest.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.490
As for his cannibal “art”, he states,

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.350
I was given a bottle of preserved human tonsils
by a friend of mine in London.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.350
He was hoping that I would make a pair of
earrings out of them.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.490
Instead, I decided to eat them.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.200
Preserved in alcohol, they made a wonderful
canape.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.030
By eating this hors d’oeuvre at 1:30 PM
on 19 July 1988 at the corner of Erskine Road

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.680
and the High Street in Walthamstow Market,
I became the first cannibal in British history

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.460
to legally eat human meat in public.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.000
Disregarding the questionable accuracy of
that last sentence, despite some public outrage

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.909
over the events, the police were forced to
admit that nothing Gibson did was technically

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:17.280
illegal and he celebrated getting away with
it by eating a human testicle hors d’oeuvre

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.830
in front of the police station.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.609
The key here was that in each case, Gibson
obtained the flesh legally from people who

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:27.139
had surgery to remove organs and managed to
convince the respective hospitals to give

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:32.209
them the body parts back (A not so easy task-
see our article: Will Hospitals Give Back

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.769
an Amputated Limb if You Ask For It?)

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:42.049
In a similar publicity stunt, one Mao Sugiyama
of Japan had his testicles, scrotum, and penis

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:48.590
removed when he was 22 and served them to
dinner guests at $250 per plate (a total of

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.590
6 plates).

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.019
His motivation here was to raise awareness
for sexual minorities- in his case specifically

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.379
being an asexual individual.

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:01.349
As for legal ramifications, as in most countries,
Japan has no specific laws against cannibalism,

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:02.830
so there was no problem there.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.590
However, after the event, Sugiyama was initially
charged with indecent exposure, as he’d

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.920
shown pictures of his flayed penis and testicles
to the 71 gathered guests before serving the

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.980
prepared genitals to the few who’d paid
for the meal.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.489
However, as everyone at the event had known
this would happen and why they were there,

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.360
the charges were later dropped.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.000
That said, according to the Culinary Director
of Serious Eats, J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, Sugiyama

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.659
had nevertheless botched the event.

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:33.160
You see, it turns out his prepared genitals
didn’t taste that great and were very rubbery,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.390
leading Kenji to lament, “The chef didn’t
cook it right.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.920
What a waste of a perfectly good penis!

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.609
Penis is pretty tough and needs to be slow
cooked, either sous-vide or in a braise.”

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.469
The more you know…

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:52.419
In any event, the fact that there’s no direct
law against cannibalism in most of the world

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:56.059
means the courts often have to wrestle with
whether a given act of cannibalism should

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:59.439
be prosecuted for violating some tangential
law.

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:04.049
Most notorious on this front was the case
of Armin Meiwes- a German man who infamously

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.099
posted an ad on a cannibalism fetish website
to find someone who’d allow him to eat them.

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.969
Armin got a surprising number of responses
from people perfectly willing at first, but

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:15.010
all backed out when it came time to do the
deed.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.620
Important to arguments later made in the court
battle, Armin did not pressure any of them

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.459
to go through with the act.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.949
But in a nutshell, ultimately Armin found
a fully willing individual in a 43 year old

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.250
computer repairman called Bernd-Jurgen Brandes.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.490
Plans made, the pair met, attempted to share
a last meal for Brandes in his own penis,

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.710
with the initial intent for Armin to bite
it off, but this didn’t work out as apparently

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.199
this is harder than movies sometimes imply
to do, so they had to sever it…

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:47.449
And we’ll just stop there on the description
of this attempted last meal.

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.820
But if you care to be utterly revolted and
simultaneously lose all faith in humanity,

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.789
feel free to Google it and the full details
of the rest of the story.

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:53.971
Best to have some video footage of kittens
playing loaded up on another tab at the same

00:04:53.971 --> 00:04:54.971
time to cleanse yourself after.

00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:55.971
Skipping to the end of one of the most gruesome
things we’ve personally ever researched

00:04:55.971 --> 00:04:56.971
(including, I might add, having done many
an article on some of the most notorious serial

00:04:56.971 --> 00:04:58.159
killers in history), Brandes eventually passed
out from blood loss and Meiwes proceeded to

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:02.350
carve him up, with the whole thing capture
on video, which was also key in showing Brandes

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.370
was not only willing, but quite eager to be
killed and at no point did Meiwes pressure

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.370
him into anything.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.780
Over time Meiwes ate approximately 20 kg of
Brandes before police caught on to what he’d

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.690
done when he posted another ad online looking
for another willing participant in his self

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:16.690
reported sexual fetish.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.291
The horrific nature of these acts naturally
led to something of a media sensation over

00:05:18.291 --> 00:05:23.990
the case, but as cannibalism isn’t illegal
in Germany, and Meiwes’ victim wanted to

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.150
be killed and was fine with being eaten, the
court battle raged for some time before it

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.630
was finally decided that Armin should be convicted
of manslaughter and given an eight year prison

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.630
sentence.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.570
This ruling was later overturned and he was
convicted of murder and given a life sentence.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.919
(To wrap up this disturbing tale, it’s noted
that today Meiwes is a vegetarian and strongly

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:47.439
counsels anyone with a similar fetish to seek
professional help to stop things from escalating

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:48.439
as it had with him.)

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:52.000
An almost identical case a few years later
similarly caused contention in German courts

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.030
and they were unable to charge a former policeman
called Detlev Guenzel for cannibalism after

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.010
he killed and allegedly ate a man he met online.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:04.039
Instead, they resorted to charging him with
“murder and disturbing the peace of the

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:05.039
dead”.

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:08.360
This appears to be the case with virtually
all examples of cannibalism we could find

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.580
with nobody ever really being charged for
the direct act of cannibalism itself.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.370
But what about survival situations?

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:20.580
The most famous example of this from a legal
perspective is arguably that of Regina v.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.770
Dudley and Stephens, a landmark case that
involved the murder and cannibalization of

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.710
a young cabin boy after a ship called the
Mignonette was destroyed by a storm.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.460
For anyone unfamiliar with the case, in 1884
three sailors called Tom Dudley, Edwin Stephens,

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.340
and Ned Brooks and their cabin boy, Richard
Parker, were lost at sea after a wave destroyed

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.340
their ship.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.330
Cast adrift with only a few pounds of turnips
for sustenance, Dudley and Stephens eventually

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.520
made the grisly decision to kill and eat Parker.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.479
Brooks played no part in the murder, but would
later admit to consuming Parker’s flesh

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:52.939
and drinking his blood to survive.

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:57.310
Upon being rescued by a passing ship, Dudley
and Stephens immediately confessed to killing

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.310
Parker.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.650
The two men defended their decision by saying
that Parker had become violently ill after

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.819
consuming salt water and was at death’s
door anyway.

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:09.150
Both sailors argued that killing Parker was
morally justified to necessitate their own

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.629
survival, “citing the custom of the sea”
which had seen many a marooned sailor drawing

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:18.330
lots and eating one another to survive, generally
with no consequences to themselves after the

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:23.849
fact so long as the lottery of who should
be killed was deemed to have been fairly implemented.

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:28.900
The thing is though, nobody aboard the Mignonette
had drawn lots; Stephen and Dudley even admitted

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.219
that they’d held Parker down as they slit
his throat to stop him struggling.

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:36.419
The British courts disagreed that killing
Parker was “necessary” as there was no

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:40.249
way for the men to know that a ship wasn’t
about to crest the horizon and rescue them.

00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:43.940
And the fact that they needed to physically
restrain Parker seemingly meant he couldn’t

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.560
have been that close to death.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.729
On that note, a judge would later argue that
to justify Parker’s murder as a necessity,

00:07:49.729 --> 00:07:53.569
each man would have had to have been on the
very precipice of death.

00:07:53.569 --> 00:07:57.599
It’s also worth noting that in previous
cases where sailors had cited the “custom

00:07:57.599 --> 00:08:02.039
of the sea” after being marooned and drawing
lots to justify murdering and eating members

00:08:02.039 --> 00:08:06.529
of their own crew, cabin boys, slaves and
other people of low rank disproportionately

00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:08.999
found themselves drawing the short straw…

00:08:08.999 --> 00:08:13.259
This led to people calling into question whether
these lotteries were actually fairly implemented

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:18.030
as the survivors invariably claimed, partially
spurring the courts to finally set a legal

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:23.719
precedent for how to proceed in similar cases-
in effect making an example of Stephens and

00:08:23.719 --> 00:08:24.719
Dudley.

00:08:24.719 --> 00:08:28.300
Thus, a decision was made to try each man
for murder which was a capital offence at

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.300
the time.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.510
The problem was the public was largely on
the side of Dudley and Stephens and a jury

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:36.930
seemed initially reluctant to condemn the
men to death for doing something to survive

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:38.520
in a desperate situation.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:43.250
As for Brooks, he wasn’t convicted of any
crime and was largely let off despite readily

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.630
admitting to consuming Parker as well.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:50.330
The key distinction here was that he didn’t
take part in the actual murder in any way.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.770
As for the other two, they were initially
convicted of murder and sentenced to death,

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:57.770
but in part due to public pressure, their
sentences were later commuted to 6 months

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:58.770
in prison.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:03.670
But the case did set a legal precedent that
there is no defence of necessity for the crime

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:08.630
or murder in cases like this and it’s now
well established in law that the killing of

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:13.530
another human being to aid your own survival
by consuming their flesh can never be justified

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:14.560
in a legal sense.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.780
But, again, eating an already dead person
in the same type of situation is perfectly

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.820
legal in most countries.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.500
Of course, the law is one thing- it’s a
whole different thing to wrestle with the

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.370
moral aspect of the act.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:30.870
For example, there is the case of the now
infamous Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 crash

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:37.030
of 1972 which saw survivors cutting and eating
strips of flesh from dead passengers to survive.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:41.890
Despite initial religious reservations from
most on board, every survivor eventually gave

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:46.750
in to hunger which speaks to the power starvation
has to test the very limits of a person’s

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.010
personal morality.

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:50.490
As survivor Roberto Canessa later noted,

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:53.930
Our common goal was to survive — but what
we lacked was food.

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:57.980
We had long since run out of the meager pickings
we’d found on the plane, and there was no

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.530
vegetation or animal life to be found.

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:04.300
After just a few days we were feeling the
sensation of our own bodies consuming themselves

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.810
just to remain alive.

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.940
Before long we would become too weak to recover
from starvation.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.700
We knew the answer, but it was too terrible
to contemplate.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:17.160
The bodies of our friends and teammates, preserved
outside in the snow and ice, contained vital,

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.490
life-giving protein that could help us survive.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:21.080
But could we do it?

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.340
For a long time we agonised.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.080
I went out in the snow and prayed to God for
guidance.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.070
Without His consent, I felt I would be violating
the memory of my friends; that I would be

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:30.500
stealing their souls.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.970
We wondered whether we were going mad even
to contemplate such a thing.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:35.840
Had we turned into brute savages?

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.570
Or was this the only sane thing to do?

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:43.010
But to sum up, people who find themselves
in an impossibly dire situation and resort

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:47.890
to the cannibalization of the dead are almost
universally considered not guilty of any crime

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:50.500
as far as the law in most countries is concerned.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:55.230
On top of that, even in non-survival situations,
if you can manage to obtain the flesh of another

00:10:55.230 --> 00:11:01.230
human legally, you’re likely also going
to get off scot-free if you eat it, even publicly.

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:05.090
This fact has been particular beneficial in
recent times with the fad of people eating

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:10.140
the placenta after a woman gives birth, including
at times when their partner or family members

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.680
might partake, which most consider technically
a form of cannibalism.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.280
Although, where one draws the line with regards
to when consuming a specific bit of another

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.010
human’s flesh is cannibalism or when it
is not is hotly debated.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:21.570
(And if you search around enough, you’ll
inevitably find many a mildly humorous heated

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:26.810
argument over whether swallowing human sperm
counts as cannibalism, as it’s technically

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:28.490
flesh of a sort…)

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:32.920
And even in the state of Idaho in the United
States where cannibalism is explicitly illegal

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:37.480
and eating the placenta, by the wording of
their law, is most definitely an act of cannibalism,

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:41.260
it’s generally thought by various legal
minds who’ve chimed in on this one that

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.870
if any prosecutor actually tried to prosecute
in this case (or other non-harmful forms of

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:49.900
cannibalism) in Idaho, which could result
in an up to 14 year prison sentence for the

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:54.250
convicted, that the law in question would
probably ultimately be deemed unconstitutional

00:11:54.250 --> 00:12:59.150
after

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:19.420
a whole lot of legal wrangling.
