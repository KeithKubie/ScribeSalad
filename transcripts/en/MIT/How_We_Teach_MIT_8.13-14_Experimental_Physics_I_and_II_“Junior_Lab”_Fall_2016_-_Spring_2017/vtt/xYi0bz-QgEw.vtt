GUNTHER ROLAND: So teamwork
is extremely important,

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.510
both in 8.13 and 8.14.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.720
And again, that's one of
the things that many of them

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.890
really learn in Junior
Lab for the first time,

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.960
that they have the
partner and they really

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.580
have to figure out how to
make sure that the two of them

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.180
join forces in doing this.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.340
So it's not just
dividing the work,

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.460
but really working together
to make the most out

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.330
of their time.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.990
And I think it's really
the most successful teams

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.420
are the ones that
work closely together

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.930
and don't just meet in the lab
and then split up afterwards.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.590
And I think impressing that
on the students, the value

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.680
of collaboration,
is one of the goals

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.690
that we have in 8.13
and then in 8.14.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.330
At the beginning of 8.13, we
have lectures on collaboration

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.150
by one of the WRAP instructors.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.660
And the students
at the beginning

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.750
are sometimes a little bit
bemused at these lectures,

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.450
because they spell out concepts
that seem rather natural.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.701
But once this gets translated
into practice in 8.13,

00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:24.200
I think--

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.440
I hope that the students realize
that these concepts really

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.380
are important for their work
and to be able to be reliable,

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.990
to be able to trust
the other person,

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.400
to be able to take criticism
from their partner,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.740
to be able to really split
the work in an effective way,

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.930
but then also collaborate
on cross-checking

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.640
each other's work.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.400
These are things that we
discuss at the beginning

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.520
and then try to
monitor continuously

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.140
throughout the semester.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.450
And I find that, often, that the
students that find their time

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.699
management towards the end
of the semester the most

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.680
challenging are the
ones who didn't really

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.000
develop a good style
of collaboration

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.450
with their partner.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.600
So this is sort of
one of the predictors

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.840
of what causes difficulties
towards the end

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.550
of the semester, when
many things come due

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.871
in a very short time.
