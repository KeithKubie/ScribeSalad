00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 this capsule we will introduce the 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:09.120
 history concept g fat then holds 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.190
 we saw that thanks to the image gradient 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.320
 it was possible to do the detection 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.820
 of contagion now we will see that the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.049
 image bleachers can also be 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.560
 useful for extracting 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.789
 useful features of an image for 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.380
 solve different vision problems 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.880
 by computer including 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.519
 object recognition so we saw that 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.590
 gradient orientation actually does not 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.649
 does not want varied according to 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.540
 the intensity that is to say that in the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.600
 representation in the form of orientation 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.250
 gradient for a given image to the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.469
 gradients make it possible to separate 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.789
 training on the intensity of 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.890
 variations a given place 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.910
 so this more specified by the standard of 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.500
 guardian and direction of variations 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.140
 in an image is rather given 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.420
 by the gradients orientation question 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.219
 so the idea here is to try 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.300
 to use this property the dgrad 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.739
 imagery 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.210
 get features that are 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.670
 more variants with respect to 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.770
 the intensity of an ihm of the peaks in a 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.180
 image and variations between forgotten 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.740
 just variations 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.740
 of elimination in an image 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.390
 the characteristic we will see is this 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.880
 which is called the gradient histogram 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.479
 in english histogram of credit and sue 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.159
 we often want time of the acronym org 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.970
 which breaks down into four stages 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.979
 different 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.750
 the first step is simply to do 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.759
 a calculation of gradients in an image 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.310
 so the fields ie the 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.820
 gradients to each of the pixels in a 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.100
 picture 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.290
 so that's something we know 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.450
 do we have seen so far in 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.420
 either we will partition or divide 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.700
 the image into several segments that we are going to 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.890
 pleaded in English gasoline so 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.659
 imagine we have a big picture 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.310
 but when also in simple format 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:59.130
 there divided into different segments where 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.079
 finally each of the subregions 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.630
 here you fits a different segment 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.720
 and we could also choose to 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:11.110
 to take bleeding 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.430
 overlapping each other but the coc 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.560
 simpler if just take some 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.990
 segments that finally partition 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.840
 dividing different segments all 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.880
 an image of me too is some 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.200
 something that is simple to do and then 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.320
 of sauce we are going to make is a 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.990
 histogram of the orientations 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.480
 observe in each of the segments for 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.880
 each of the segments we will watch 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.070
 what are the orientations of 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.690
 bleachers that is inside the 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.330
 segment is offered a histogram of its 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.280
 directions and then finally for 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.980
 get a feature vector 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.440
 then simply conques to hold the 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.180
 box values ​​of all 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.490
 histograms in all segments 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.020
 so the idea here is get a vector 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.730
 x that we could perhaps give in 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.160
 input a learning algorithm like 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.980
 a proud glacis round percepts or 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.410
 logistic regression we will reason is 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.180
 the vector x it will be obtained in 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.740
 conquest and ultimately has the value of 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.250
 boxes of every moment g in all 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.250
 the segments 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.989
 how does a histogram calculate for a 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.470
 segment finally give an example here where 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.270
 we have one of the boxes so a little calm 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.800
 one of the segments in an image so 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.440
 imagine like a tiger in still picture 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:27.100
 also one of the boxes you have a place 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.660
 given in an image then to calculate 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.950
 the histogram of orientations 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:35.080
 we will take we will partition all 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.170
 the possible directions so zero 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.540
 up to 360 degrees in a certain 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.330
 number of cases so we could decide 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.690
 to have four possible boxes costil that 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:50.070
 here we have the box at 0 a center is at 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:54.880
 zero degree Corsican sorting 90 ° lake to 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:58.060
 180 ° Cance 270 ° to practice on 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.250
 often uses more boxes per 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.820
 example nothing to see 8 to 0 45 and 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.970
 institutes and the value of each of 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.670
 boxes in our story g it's going 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.760
 actually match the count of the number 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.209
 gradient that falls into each of 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.690
 cards 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.829
 so in fact every guardian in my 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.680
 segment will finally vote 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.180
 for orientation and orientation there 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.030
 must vote is the most 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.250
 close to its orientation 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.789
 so we have an example here of a segment in 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.009
 n 9 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:36.680
 xl so nine gradient when if this 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:39.710
 gradient if only radian6 and this guardian 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.479
 also voted for zero since its more 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.180
 close the author the gas with a 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:48.289
 orientation of zero degree orientation 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:50.240
 the closest among 0 90 180 and 270 not 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:54.590
 we have three votes for this 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:58.520
 orientation there is then five who have 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:01.159
 an orientation closer to 180 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.219
 degrees we feel that here and finally 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:05.710
 we only have one vote for an orientation 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:07.699
 from 278 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.469
 ok so that's a first approach 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:11.979
 to extract a gradient histogram 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:11.979
 in a segment 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.960
 now we might want to 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:21.259
 take into account the magnitude so the 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.029
 standard of gradients for example one 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:26.180
 actually remark that it may be a 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:28.490
 strange little that the gradient here here here 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.819
 a vote as high as the gradients 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.710
 which correspond to more variations 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:35.839
 high in the picture 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.250
 so here actually already because we have a 

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:39.680
 gradient that is weak maybe that 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.000
 our estimate of the gradient or 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.620
 the orientation of the caretaker 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.940
 maybe not so good 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.099
 variations could easily change 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.089
 in fact 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:48.680
 the orientation at that place so 

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:51.169
 maybe we'll be more robust by 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:54.650
 relation to that and for faso must hold 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:55.969
 account of the standard this gradient because 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.210
 it's a first approach it's just 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:00.860
 to add an additional box for 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.990
 gradients who would just have a man 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.980
 which is smaller advice give so 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:09.860
 we might have a fifth box 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:12.200
 so the plain christmas but there it is 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:16.430
 simply a box that corresponds in 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:18.410
 made to the vote gradients whose 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.070
 standard is too small and smaller than a 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.490
 certain threshold 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:24.170
 the lightning is specified a given threshold or 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:27.230
 another approach it would actually be 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.760
 take each of the gradients and the 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.610
 to vote but with some weight 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.130
 and so the importance of their vote the 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.900
 weight of their life is going to be 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.940
 proportional to the gradient standard 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.430
 question so I'm going to take my 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.960
 guardian quim well worth squared I 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.690
 sum it up as the norm 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.280
 Christian no sorry that's death 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.530
 opportunity kaori so I take the root 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.980
 square of savanna the norm is so the 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:55.430
 vote of an ingredient at the position and j 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:57.140
 it's going to be proportional to the standard of 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.490
 his guardian then in fact we're going 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.920
 normalize to be anyway and 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:04.100
 varying in relation to the elimination so 

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:06.590
 we will finally normalize by the sum 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.140
 standards of all gradients 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.940
 teaching so in what if 

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.380
 since we have enormous standards here 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.660
 we will still be a variant by 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:17.090
 relation to elimination 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:20.090
 and if we make that approach there in 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:22.370
 the example here because standards are 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.380
 of his three guardians then are 

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.630
 supposedly three times higher than the 

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.910
 standards of these three cardiologists that these 

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:32.510
 standards if they are almost zero then 

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:35.480
 for zero degrees that is the orientation of 

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:37.730
 his guards then 67% of the votes 

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:41.690
 because 32% of the votes go rather 

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:43.790
 go to 180 so if it's gradient the water 

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:47.900
 here then these two blocks are rather 1 to 

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:51.490
 0 and 1 or 1 because of this guardian 

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.490
 watch it are almost 7 

00:07:53.529 --> 00:07:58.959
 so the first approach which is to 

00:07:56.439 --> 00:08:00.639
 have a specific additional box 

00:07:58.959 --> 00:08:02.829
 for guards who are too small 

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:05.079
 it can help to better represent 

00:08:02.829 --> 00:08:06.549
 the presence of regions that are 

00:08:05.079 --> 00:08:08.649
 basically a woman so who have 

00:08:06.549 --> 00:08:10.809
 credit standards come in at the little bit 

00:08:08.649 --> 00:08:12.009
 of variation so if one in a 

00:08:10.809 --> 00:08:14.109
 given application is still a 

00:08:12.009 --> 00:08:16.749
 information we want to extract we want 

00:08:14.109 --> 00:08:18.429
 maybe have this box there to see a 

00:08:16.749 --> 00:08:20.679
 vote which is rather standardized by 

00:08:18.429 --> 00:08:22.239
 ratio by dividing to enter the 

00:08:20.679 --> 00:08:23.739
 standard of the gradients of each of the 

00:08:22.239 --> 00:08:25.569
 keepers in this segment by ten years by 

00:08:23.739 --> 00:08:27.009
 sum of guardian numbers 

00:08:25.569 --> 00:08:28.959
 it will give a representation that 

00:08:27.009 --> 00:08:30.939
 still remains quite invariant by 

00:08:28.959 --> 00:08:33.129
 relation to elimination what is a 

00:08:30.939 --> 00:08:35.889
 little less true here because we're going 

00:08:33.129 --> 00:08:37.689
 distinguish between this ingredients 

00:08:35.889 --> 00:08:40.029
 which we call small in absolute value and 

00:08:37.689 --> 00:08:42.519
 what high standards have presented 

00:08:40.029 --> 00:08:43.360
 also to combine both the two 

00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:45.850
 sites and sets 

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:48.220
 so there are different variations so 

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:51.550
 to have a box then anyway 

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:53.230
 standard of gradients 12:30 a space there 

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:55.629
 variations that can be considered on 

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:57.879
 the fictional gradient histograms 

00:08:55.629 --> 00:08:59.019
 explore in in literatures in 

00:08:57.879 --> 00:09:01.079
 vision applications by 

00:08:59.019 --> 00:09:01.079
 computer 

00:09:01.439 --> 00:09:06.250
 here is an example we illustrate 

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.319
 finally the representation extracted 

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:11.350
 by calculating gas histograms 

00:09:08.319 --> 00:09:13.540
 everywhere in an image so here we have 

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:16.360
 an image is here we have an illustration 

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:18.569
 histograms so the way that was 

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:23.740
 illustrated in fact is that for example 

00:09:18.569 --> 00:09:25.350
 here so that will fit roughly 

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:28.980
 a website 

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:33.360
 this area also actually because if 

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:36.480
 so I'm going to take off a little bit better 

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.960
 my box so here for the box here 

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.110
 about 

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.340
 we observe, among other things, that we are afraid of 

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:43.290
 gradients that go in that direction 

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:45.260
 also or maybe this direction if 

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:49.590
 since we have an outline like what is 

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:51.600
 con here is clearly in the ground and so 

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:55.470
 for in the illustration here we go 

00:09:51.600 --> 00:10:00.120
 actually show the the perpendicular of 

00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:02.130
 these gradient has so for example the 

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.740
 social gradient something like us 

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:07.260
 have degree there is demonstrated here as 

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:09.840
 that then for 180 degrees he would 

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.490
 demonstrated as this one so it allows 

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:15.570
 to see a little more visually than 

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:17.910
 actually in this part of 

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:19.650
 the image and it was detected by the itanium 

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:24.480
 of gas that we have variations that are 

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:25.920
 more vertical and horizontal and have for 

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.570
 all the boxes here we have this 

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.450
 illustration of the histograms of 

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:32.280
 gradient and we see that all the same but 

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:35.450
 precisely in this part if the image 

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:37.590
 we have the information that there are mostly 

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:39.810
 vertical variations and less 

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:41.570
 horizontal variations then to others 

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:45.330
 places in the image that we gave 

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:46.980
 some combinations of with 

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:49.890
 different weights of variation of sound 

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:51.420
 talent and vertical or in fact paul 

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:54.420
 just vertical horizontal but 

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:57.330
 also diagonal in situ and so if 

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.890
 it corresponds to an example of extraction 

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:01.380
 characteristics that correspond to 

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:03.150
 gradient histogram and when one 

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.650
 could do is take all these 

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:07.470
 values ​​there for each of the boxes 

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:09.480
 take value from each by 

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:11.580
 each of the segments take to each 

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.190
 boxes of the histograms and put that 

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:16.560
 in a vector where we managed the 

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.850
 first box of the first segment of 

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.310
 the histogram of the first segment the 

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:21.960
 second frame of the first segment and 

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:23.730
 so on for all the boxes of 

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.470
 all the histograms so in every 

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:27.090
 hits of the segments one could take 

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:28.740
 if he gave it that does not lead to algorithms 

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.330
 learning to solve a 

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:33.010
 given problem 

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:36.600
 and that's what we'll describe a little more 

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:36.600
 by the next caps them
