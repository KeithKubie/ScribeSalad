00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.469
Take a look at these.

00:00:02.468 --> 00:00:04.450
This one is an
image of a flamingo.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.000
This one is a request
to get this image.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.929
Do you notice anything
different between them, though?

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.952
HTTP has been around
for such a long time

00:00:11.952 --> 00:00:14.410
that the protocol still does
something that you will rarely

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.220
find in any Modern protocol

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.289
It's regular text

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.359
and can be read by a human.

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.579
The bytes being pushed back
and forth on the network

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:23.679
are plain, old
regular text, and can

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:25.899
be read by our human brains.

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:28.419
HTTP simplicity also
means that we can directly

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.660
interact with a protocol without
a third party library doing

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.579
any extra work for us.

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.210
Every HTTP request begins with
a unique verb called a method

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.520
and serves a specific purpose.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.340
We already know GET and
POST, and although these

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.200
are the most common
methods, there

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.080
are other methods you
will encounter regularly.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.710
The common set of methods
consist of GET, POST, PUT,

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.350
DELETE, HEAD, and OPTIONS.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.030
We will talk more
about these methods

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.870
when we talk about REST APIs.
