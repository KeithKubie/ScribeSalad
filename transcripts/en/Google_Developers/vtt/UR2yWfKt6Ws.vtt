00:00:00.801 --> 00:00:03.934
man:
Good evening, everybody.

00:00:03.934 --> 00:00:07.501
Wow, it's standing room only
back there.

00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:08.701
I'm going to get started,

00:00:08.701 --> 00:00:12.200
so everybody take a seat,
if you want.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.501
Thanks for coming out
this evening.

00:00:14.501 --> 00:00:18.033
Today is App Engine's
first birthday.

00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:19.033
[cheers and applause]

00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:20.367
It's been one year--

00:00:20.367 --> 00:00:21.734
Thanks.

00:00:21.734 --> 00:00:24.133
It's been one year
since we launched App Engine,

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.667
and so today--tonight
is a perfect time to tell you

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:28.033
about a bunch of new features

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:29.634
that we're going to be
launching.

00:00:29.634 --> 00:00:31.033
But before we do that,

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:32.267
I want to take a quick look back

00:00:32.267 --> 00:00:34.133
at what we've done
over the past year.

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.968
I want to give you
a brief refresher

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:37.634
about the design goals
for App Engine,

00:00:37.634 --> 00:00:38.968
and I want to tell you about

00:00:38.968 --> 00:00:41.267
the progress that we've made
in the past year.

00:00:41.267 --> 00:00:43.701
So, when we launched
App Engine last year,

00:00:43.701 --> 00:00:45.601
we made the following
observation.

00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:47.167
It's way too hard

00:00:47.167 --> 00:00:48.834
to build and deploy
web applications.

00:00:48.834 --> 00:00:50.133
You can see a list

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.033
of all the stuff you have
to worry about up there,

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:54.400
between Apache server configs

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.868
and database resharding

00:00:55.868 --> 00:00:57.067
and a bunch of other stuff.

00:00:57.067 --> 00:00:58.667
There's just way too much
to worry about.

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:00.267
You spend more time
being a sysadmin

00:01:00.267 --> 00:01:03.501
than actually building
your next great web app,

00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:05.834
so we wanted to change that
with App Engine.

00:01:05.834 --> 00:01:07.267
With App Engine,

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:09.267
you deploy your app
on Google infrastructure,

00:01:09.267 --> 00:01:12.534
and that means it's free
and easy to get started

00:01:12.534 --> 00:01:13.801
and also to scale,

00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:15.934
and that means that we
relieve you of the burden

00:01:15.934 --> 00:01:18.734
of dealing with a lot
of the sysadmin issues.

00:01:18.734 --> 00:01:20.234
As a developer myself,

00:01:20.234 --> 00:01:21.834
that's a really compelling
proposition.

00:01:21.834 --> 00:01:23.767
I really like the idea
of being able to think about

00:01:23.767 --> 00:01:25.000
how my app can be better,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.734
rather than thinking about
how to keep my app

00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:28.000
up and running.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.934
So developers have been
really enthusiastic about this.

00:01:30.934 --> 00:01:34.100
Since we launched,
we've had 150,000 developers

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.968
who've built more than 50,000
applications on App Engine,

00:01:36.968 --> 00:01:39.567
including apps like BuddyPoke,

00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:42.033
which is one of the most popular
open, social apps.

00:01:42.033 --> 00:01:43.434
App Engine helped BuddyPoke

00:01:43.434 --> 00:01:45.934
scale to more than
35 million users.

00:01:45.934 --> 00:01:47.701
That's really great.
That's huge.

00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:48.701
[applause]

00:01:48.701 --> 00:01:50.133
Congratulations to BuddyPoke.

00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:51.133
[cheering]

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:52.167
[laughs]

00:01:52.167 --> 00:01:55.501
Brands like Best Buy,
eBay, and Forbes

00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:56.934
have started to outsource

00:01:56.934 --> 00:01:59.801
pieces of their computing
infrastructure to App Engine,

00:01:59.801 --> 00:02:02.667
and also Google has been
adopting App Engine internally.

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:03.667
We have migrated--

00:02:03.667 --> 00:02:05.067
In the past six months alone,

00:02:05.067 --> 00:02:07.300
we have migrated
more than 50 applications.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.434
And I want to talk about

00:02:08.434 --> 00:02:10.400
one of those applications
in particular,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.834
and that's Google Moderator.

00:02:11.834 --> 00:02:13.133
Google Moderator is built

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.667
with App Engine on the back end,

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:16.667
and Google Web Toolkit
on the front end.

00:02:16.667 --> 00:02:18.167
And we originally
built Moderator

00:02:18.167 --> 00:02:19.701
as a way for Google employees

00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:22.100
to ask questions
in internal company meetings,

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.901
but a few weeks ago,

00:02:23.901 --> 00:02:26.701
WhiteHouse.gov
used Google Moderator

00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:29.033
to solicit questions
from all around the world

00:02:29.033 --> 00:02:30.067
for a big town hall.

00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:32.400
So here's a graph
of the traffic.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.133
You can see we launched
the product here.

00:02:35.133 --> 00:02:36.667
Watch out for that.

00:02:36.667 --> 00:02:38.767
Here we started to get
some press coverage,

00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:41.133
and then here, what happened
with that big spike

00:02:41.133 --> 00:02:45.100
is that right at the end
of the town hall,

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.234
people rushed in to get
their questions in

00:02:47.234 --> 00:02:49.834
at the last minute before
the town hall closed down,

00:02:49.834 --> 00:02:51.300
so you can see
there's this big spike

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.167
right when everybody's trying
to get their questions in.

00:02:54.167 --> 00:02:56.334
Now, with a traditional
hosting provider,

00:02:56.334 --> 00:02:58.167
You would have had to predict

00:02:58.167 --> 00:03:00.000
the load that you
were going to get,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.934
the traffic
that you were going to get,

00:03:01.934 --> 00:03:03.000
and you would have had

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.334
to pre-provision
a bunch of machines

00:03:05.334 --> 00:03:06.868
to take care
of your predicted load,

00:03:06.868 --> 00:03:08.567
and in fact,
you probably would have added

00:03:08.567 --> 00:03:09.567
a bunch more machines,

00:03:09.567 --> 00:03:11.067
because in the happy event

00:03:11.067 --> 00:03:12.467
that you get
a lot of extra traffic,

00:03:12.467 --> 00:03:14.300
you don't want
to have the app crash.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.834
So the great thing
about App Engine

00:03:16.834 --> 00:03:18.434
is that you didn't
have to do any of that.

00:03:18.434 --> 00:03:20.801
App Engine automatically
allocates resources

00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:22.300
on your app's behalf.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.334
It allows WhiteHouse.gov's
instance of Moderator

00:03:25.334 --> 00:03:27.434
to automatically
adjust and scale

00:03:27.434 --> 00:03:29.901
to these swings and surges
and spikes in traffic.

00:03:29.901 --> 00:03:32.467
I think that's a really
compelling testament

00:03:32.467 --> 00:03:33.734
to the power of App Engine,

00:03:33.734 --> 00:03:35.634
that you can take
an application like Moderator

00:03:35.634 --> 00:03:37.267
that was originally intended
to answer

00:03:37.267 --> 00:03:39.334
20 questions in an internal
company meeting,

00:03:39.334 --> 00:03:40.801
turn that into an application

00:03:40.801 --> 00:03:42.968
that took more than
three and a half million votes

00:03:42.968 --> 00:03:44.033
across a couple of days.

00:03:44.033 --> 00:03:45.467
That's really exciting.

00:03:45.467 --> 00:03:47.667
Okay, so that's what we've been
doing in the past year.

00:03:47.667 --> 00:03:49.267
I guess the other thing
we've been doing

00:03:49.267 --> 00:03:51.534
in the past year
is soliciting feedback

00:03:51.534 --> 00:03:52.901
from all of you,

00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:55.501
from developers out there
who are using App Engine,

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:56.968
and so based on that feedback,

00:03:56.968 --> 00:03:58.968
we have a bunch
of exciting new features

00:03:58.968 --> 00:04:00.167
to launch tonight.

00:04:00.167 --> 00:04:01.968
I'm going to give you
a quick overview,

00:04:01.968 --> 00:04:03.434
and then Kevin's
going to come up

00:04:03.434 --> 00:04:04.834
and give you all the details.

00:04:04.834 --> 00:04:07.234
So one thing that we're
going to talk about tonight

00:04:07.234 --> 00:04:09.868
is the ability to buy
additional quota

00:04:09.868 --> 00:04:12.601
beyond the free quota that all
App Engine applications get.

00:04:12.601 --> 00:04:15.300
So that means your app can scale
as big as you want it to get.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.133
We're going to talk about
cron support,

00:04:17.133 --> 00:04:18.601
so that you can schedule tasks

00:04:18.601 --> 00:04:19.901
at particular intervals,

00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:21.534
and then
we'll execute them for you.

00:04:21.534 --> 00:04:23.434
We're going to talk about
database import,

00:04:23.434 --> 00:04:25.400
which lets you take big chunks
of application data

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.000
outside of App Engine
and push them into App Engine,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.467
and we're going to talk about
access to firewall data,

00:04:30.467 --> 00:04:32.667
which allows App Engine
and also other Google apps

00:04:32.667 --> 00:04:33.968
like Google spreadsheets

00:04:33.968 --> 00:04:35.667
to communicate and cooperate

00:04:35.667 --> 00:04:38.000
with applications running inside
your corporate network,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.767
and then last but not least,

00:04:39.767 --> 00:04:44.367
last year we promised to support
languages other than Python,

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:46.534
and so
I'm really excited tonight

00:04:46.534 --> 00:04:48.667
to give you guys
an early preview

00:04:48.667 --> 00:04:51.167
of Java language support
on App Engine.

00:04:51.167 --> 00:04:53.067
I think this is going to
open App Engine--

00:04:53.067 --> 00:04:54.067
[audience cheers]

00:04:54.067 --> 00:04:56.267
...up to...wow.

00:04:56.267 --> 00:05:02.534
[laughs]

00:05:02.534 --> 00:05:03.534
Back to the fire.

00:05:03.534 --> 00:05:04.868
I think
the Java language support

00:05:04.868 --> 00:05:05.968
is going to open App Engine up

00:05:05.968 --> 00:05:07.367
to a whole new group
of developers,

00:05:07.367 --> 00:05:08.634
so I'm really
excited about it.

00:05:08.634 --> 00:05:10.801
And with that, I want to
hand things over to Kevin Gibbs,

00:05:10.801 --> 00:05:12.167
who's the tech lead.

00:05:12.167 --> 00:05:14.100
He's going to give you
all the technical details.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.100
Thanks.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.868
[applause]

00:05:19.868 --> 00:05:21.667
Gibbs: Thanks, Graham.

00:05:21.667 --> 00:05:23.200
Well, over the past year,

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.834
since we've launched App Engine,

00:05:24.834 --> 00:05:27.200
we've really been listening
to your feedback.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.467
You have guys have called out

00:05:28.467 --> 00:05:30.634
a number of areas
for improvement in App Engine,

00:05:30.634 --> 00:05:32.167
and we've been listening.

00:05:32.167 --> 00:05:34.968
So, in response, we've added
a lot of features to App Engine

00:05:34.968 --> 00:05:36.501
which, if you've been
watching, you've seen.

00:05:36.501 --> 00:05:38.400
Things like
our system status site,

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.567
where it shows live,
uptime information;

00:05:40.567 --> 00:05:44.033
HTTPS support,
our Memcache API,

00:05:44.033 --> 00:05:46.200
tons of new features
for the admin console,

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.300
and more.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.534
Now, we know we still have
lots left to do,

00:05:49.534 --> 00:05:51.534
but I want to thank you
for the feedback,

00:05:51.534 --> 00:05:53.501
both positive and negative
that you've given us,

00:05:53.501 --> 00:05:54.901
because it really lets us know

00:05:54.901 --> 00:05:56.834
what we're doing right
and what we're doing wrong

00:05:56.834 --> 00:05:58.100
and how we can improve.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.968
But one of the biggest
features you asked

00:05:59.968 --> 00:06:01.367
that we've gotten
from you guys

00:06:01.367 --> 00:06:02.567
over the past year

00:06:02.567 --> 00:06:04.601
has been that you want
the ability to grow

00:06:04.601 --> 00:06:06.467
beyond the free quotas
in App Engine.

00:06:06.467 --> 00:06:08.968
You want to have
the ability to pay us

00:06:08.968 --> 00:06:10.501
to use more App Engine,

00:06:10.501 --> 00:06:13.300
to allow your app to continue
to scale out.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.868
Well, because of that,

00:06:14.868 --> 00:06:16.467
I'm happy
that about a month ago

00:06:16.467 --> 00:06:17.701
we launched the ability

00:06:17.701 --> 00:06:20.067
to pay for additional
resources on App Engine,

00:06:20.067 --> 00:06:21.767
our new billing support.

00:06:21.767 --> 00:06:24.033
Now, with our billing support
for App Engine,

00:06:24.033 --> 00:06:25.000
it's very easy.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.267
You just sign up,

00:06:26.267 --> 00:06:28.968
set a budget for each
resource you want to use--

00:06:28.968 --> 00:06:31.400
like CPU and bandwidth
and so on--

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.200
and then you can scale
your application out

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.901
to your heart's content.

00:06:34.901 --> 00:06:38.133
You only pay for exactly
the resources you use

00:06:38.133 --> 00:06:39.834
in serving that request,

00:06:39.834 --> 00:06:42.067
and even then,
you only pay for the resources

00:06:42.067 --> 00:06:43.701
beyond our free quotas.

00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:45.501
Now, anyone can log in

00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:47.434
and try out
our billing support today.

00:06:47.434 --> 00:06:48.567
It's open to everyone.

00:06:48.567 --> 00:06:50.167
Here, I have
a quick screenshot

00:06:50.167 --> 00:06:51.400
so you can see how it works

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.400
if you don't have a big app
on App Engine.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.400
As you can see here,

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.000
this app's got billing enabled,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.467
and we've got different bars

00:06:57.467 --> 00:06:59.434
that show how much we're using
of each resource,

00:06:59.434 --> 00:07:01.767
like CPU and bandwidth
and so on.

00:07:01.767 --> 00:07:03.701
You can see on the side

00:07:03.701 --> 00:07:04.834
that we have our budget

00:07:04.834 --> 00:07:06.834
and how much
the resource costs per unit.

00:07:06.834 --> 00:07:09.400
And on the graph
you can see there's a line.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.968
That's our free quota.

00:07:10.968 --> 00:07:12.667
When you go beyond
the free quota,

00:07:12.667 --> 00:07:14.601
you just pay
according to the cost

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:15.734
you see on the side

00:07:15.734 --> 00:07:17.601
within the budget
you've specified.

00:07:17.601 --> 00:07:19.734
That's it.

00:07:19.734 --> 00:07:21.200
Now, something else
that we've heard

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.334
from a lot of you guys

00:07:22.334 --> 00:07:23.801
is that you'd really like a way

00:07:23.801 --> 00:07:26.601
to do some work outside
of the user's request,

00:07:26.601 --> 00:07:27.901
outside of the web request

00:07:27.901 --> 00:07:29.801
that came in
to your application.

00:07:29.801 --> 00:07:31.267
Now, we're working on

00:07:31.267 --> 00:07:33.634
a much larger-scale,
offline system

00:07:33.634 --> 00:07:36.267
to handle processing
lots and lots of data.

00:07:36.267 --> 00:07:38.167
We're not done with that yet,

00:07:38.167 --> 00:07:40.601
but tonight we want to take
a first step

00:07:40.601 --> 00:07:43.000
in the right direction
for offline processing,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.634
so we're happy
to announce to you

00:07:44.634 --> 00:07:46.167
our cron support for App Engine.

00:07:46.167 --> 00:07:49.534
[light applause]

00:07:49.534 --> 00:07:50.534
Smaller audience.

00:07:50.534 --> 00:07:52.667
Our cron support for App Engine

00:07:52.667 --> 00:07:55.534
makes it easy for you to list
some URLs in your application,

00:07:55.534 --> 00:07:57.400
and then have those URLs hit

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.601
according to a schedule
that you specify.

00:07:59.601 --> 00:08:01.300
When those URLs are hit,

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.100
we just send a request
to your application,

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.100
and you can do anything
that you'd like.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.634
Now, it's very flexible.

00:08:06.634 --> 00:08:09.767
You can ask that URLs are hit
once per minute or hour,

00:08:09.767 --> 00:08:12.534
or as specific
as every second Tuesday.

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:14.901
That makes it easy for you

00:08:14.901 --> 00:08:17.534
to execute regularly scheduled
tasks in your application,

00:08:17.534 --> 00:08:20.400
like sending a weekly mailing
or clearing out a summary

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.934
or stuff like that.

00:08:21.934 --> 00:08:24.300
So I have a quick example
of the configuration,

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.601
so you can see how easy it is

00:08:25.601 --> 00:08:27.067
to use cron in an application.

00:08:27.067 --> 00:08:28.968
This is a cron.yaml file,

00:08:28.968 --> 00:08:31.934
and here you can see
I specified two cron jobs.

00:08:31.934 --> 00:08:33.100
One of them says

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.734
that I would like to have
a daily summary.

00:08:34.734 --> 00:08:36.734
That's going to hit the
tasks/summary URL,

00:08:36.734 --> 00:08:38.400
and I said that
I want to hit it every day,

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.934
every 24 hours.

00:08:39.934 --> 00:08:41.634
You can see
I have another URL.

00:08:41.634 --> 00:08:44.000
This is the weekly mailout
under mail/weekly,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.234
and this will be hit
every Monday at 9:00 a.m.

00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:48.100
on Australian time.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.868
So I've also got another
example for you here

00:08:51.868 --> 00:08:53.601
which is an application

00:08:53.601 --> 00:08:55.234
running on our cluster
right now,

00:08:55.234 --> 00:08:56.501
a cron prober application,

00:08:56.501 --> 00:08:58.434
and you can see
it's actively being hit

00:08:58.434 --> 00:09:00.567
by App Engine
in response to your request.

00:09:00.567 --> 00:09:04.067
You can see we got a minutely
and an hourly probe in there.
