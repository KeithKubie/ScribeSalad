00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.050
Hope you're having an amazing day

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.710
It's Mark wiens in Tokyo Japan

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:07.710
And I think the best reason to travel is for food and to experience the local culture

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.099
And local food in a typical day and so today

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.469
I'm going to take you on a japanese food tour of tokyo where we're going to eat my typical breakfast lunch and dinner

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.269
Meal set for would eat on just a normal day

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.090
Living in Japan and living in tokyo that's about 8 a.m.. Time for breakfast

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.819
In the first restaurant for breakfast. Yeah, this is a typical Japanese diner, and you come in here

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.130
You can get a variety of different dishes

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.459
And I think this place is actually open 24 hours

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.999
grab a tray and then you can

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.820
pick and choose whatever dishes to watch

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.029
One of the reasons I love coming to a diner so much is because they have such a different

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.139
selection of different Japanese Foods pre cooked Foods you had like a

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.130
whole Countertop full of different deep-fried Foods

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.219
But I kept it pretty traditional this would be a very common breakfast in Japan some grilled fish

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.490
I just couldn't resist ordering two types of grilled fish with a bowl of rice a couple sides of pickles and then miso soup what?

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.579
You do actually some of the food is it kind of sits and gets cold so they actually have some microwave the front

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.880
I'm going to go microwave my fish real fast

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.760
I'm going to adapt these fish in microwave real fast

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.989
30 seconds should do it. Oh yeah that brings out that to fish aroma

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.979
I'm going to start with the saba Mackerel one. This is a this is a very common type of fish

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.769
It's grilled or you can just see the buttery juices coming out of it. I'm a huge fan and

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.900
It's commonly served with Daikon, and this is like a puree Daikon radish. Oh

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.179
Yeah, that's all that's oily juicy fishy goodness

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.980
Oh, yeah

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.279
It's wonderful, and then you gotta Gotta Follow with rice of course

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.410
It's good. You know just

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.030
It's just good

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.590
fish

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.239
it's not too salty it pairs well with the daikon because the Daikon is sort of a

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.410
Refreshing refreshing taste to it. Oh

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.170
Yeah, that's like. It's actually kind of sweet and

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:52.569
a little bit salty um that kind of kind of works as a garnish for the whole meal miso soup, and they're

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.269
All kind of hanging weaker. I also got some eggplant is because well, just because I love eggplant oh

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.140
Mm-Hmm mmM

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.329
Has a nice and ginger flavor to it and that just as usual the reason

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.659
I love eggplant so much is because it just melts in your mouth. Okay next fish

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.239
And again, this is a grilled fish. It's a quite a long long little fish

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.850
That fish is a little bit drier than the saba Microbes

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.040
Still very good it has that kind of almost tuna dry texture to it

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.909
Either way either fish you you take it's a good choice

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.799
They do have some seasonings in the center of the table as well in the center console you have some soy sauce and pepper

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.000
and going in for the chili flakes

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.730
Probably my favorite thing on this plate is the classic the Saba the grilled Saba Mackerel

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.749
It's so I love the texture of it. I love the oiliness of it

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.810
with that with some daikon

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.740
and

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.740
Onto My my rice with chili

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:18.060
What a combination, you just love the butteriness of that natural law mmM. It's a it makes a wonderful breakfast

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:28.579
Breakfast was excellent. I feel ready to start the day and this is just a very typical Japanese food diner

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.819
You can get a selection of different food this particular. Dye

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:37.549
no, I'm fucking sure it's open 24 hours a day so you can come here at all times of the day and eat a

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:43.879
Simple, but filling meal you see people from all walks of life in there. That was the fantastic way to start the day

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.019
That breakfast held me over nicely until lunch and for lunch today. We're in Ginza

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:01.460
Which is one of the central business districts of tokyo and we're going to a restaurant which looks like it's a traditional place

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.639
It's an old restaurant a real classic, and I can't wait for lunch now. We've down this small little alley

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.639
This is the sign for the place right here

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.149
It went Sashimi attention

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.160
Used to call me son shoe. Yep. They're really very shortly

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.709
It's pretty packed at lunch, but we got the last two seats and we got here at 11:30 third

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.359
I think they just opened and they are already packing all they specialize in

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.100
Especially it's mostly seafood and fish and then they have a chicken puck here. Oh

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.850
How she means hanging in wow I got the low

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:54.750
Okay, the class of this restaurant is absolutely amazing and we ordered some of their lunch specials here

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.460
I didn't know we just we just talked with a friendly again tea here and she kind of just

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.699
ordered for us, and we got some of their specialties, they're

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.879
Edible, I think this is my new favorite place in tokyo and even I'm not only of those pages right now

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.180
I'm so excited. I can I don't even know what I'm talking about okay?

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:17.669
We got started eating here something that they're famous for is their chicken soup even though most of the food here is

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.729
people if you chunk the chicken

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.280
Okay, I'm going right in for that

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.300
our pot

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:38.209
Overall that is incredible that tastes like roasted chicken soup. It's salty

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.720
It's so pure and that chicken literally melt in your mouth

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.100
Oh, that's like the cleanest chicken to buy I've tasted in a very long time

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.419
This is a beautiful another beautiful plate of fresh sashimi those

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.579
Justice pointed and then there's some fresh muscat be over here on the side. I'm going to take some of that Wasabi

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.080
It onto that

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.400
Which is the thickness of that just tuna?

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.070
Man a little dip in it's like

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:19.430
That's the texture of a slab of butter, but so much better tasting there's zero strain and in that whatsoever

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.009
It's so thick and so extreme you

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:32.300
It's almost like crab and things are there and they also have a sauce here that you'll add to this

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.980
well

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:43.159
and for the final dish of lunch that I think this is fish as well look at that shit so meeting and

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.770
Seemed it looks like it's team

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.720
oh

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:58.220
That this is is the texture of butter again it just melts in your mouth. You can taste all those fish oils

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.499
It's so like light and fluffy that is

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.840
Impressively fresh and clean and just the texture is insane

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:11.630
The background is silk

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.119
That's one of the most tender pieces of chicken I've ever had without it being mushy

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.179
Just look at the size of this piece of tuna

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.459
That is a huge thick slice

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.330
Hey, we got those

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:39.919
We're just coming out of the restaurant. Oh, that's one of the the best meals. I've had in tokyo hands down that was

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:47.000
Impressive that is the type of like home-cooked japanese food meal that like you would dream about

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:52.669
The Sashimi was unbelievably fresh straight from ceg Market. I'm sure this morning

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:59.719
The fried shrimp were were like some of the medias like almost crab tasting shrimp that I've had

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:04.309
The chicken soup oh yeah that you can see if not even a seafood dish

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.429
But I don't even I don't even it's almost unexplainable

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.840
How pure and how clean and how like perfectly salt chili?

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:16.789
Addictive that was and the chicken that was literally like chicken that melted in your mouth

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:20.690
It's it was unbelievably soft and tender without being mushy whatsoever

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.400
I want to quickly say thank you to you

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:29.569
Go for recommending this spot saying that this is the traditional place that I needed to try that was just awesome

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:37.130
For dinner we headed over to shibuya a busy business and shopping area of tokyo to eat at a popular after work Izakaya serving

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.619
Yakitori right now crossing over shibuya crossing this is one of the world's busiest Pedestrian

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.250
crossings

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:48.530
And I'm on my way to go eat at a yakitori restaurant. Which is a Japanese grilled

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.230
chicken restaurant

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:02.690
We just made it into this yakitori restaurant

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:10.639
So cool, and I was lucky they if they actually have one they have two tables back here, but most of the seating is armed

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.239
Let some time with my family. I'm glad they had an open table

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:21.230
So we're sitting at the table although the bar counter seating would be the ultimate experience here, but you can just hang all here

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.230
We're not drilling chicken in here

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:30.559
They have a oh Arigatou~. Thank you. - yes, please - people - ah

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:37.670
- I thought they have a couple of many courses which are the omakase which that chefs inside and just give you a course

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:43.639
And let four course a that is the main one it includes a bunch of things well

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.140
I'm lime times like that

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:51.049
Okay, the surprise the first course on omekata menu is chicken Sashimi

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.120
So normally just about anywhere

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:59.210
You are in the world. You want to make sure that your chicken is cooked fully cooked cooked all the way through

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.499
But Japan is the one place for where they take such care

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:11.540
of their chickens and especially at a special chicken only chicken restaurant like this where they source their their chickens from

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:14.989
From reliable sources and that's a certain breed

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.439
organic chickens that they know where they're getting their chickens from

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.490
You can eat chicken Sashimi, and I've had it one other time before

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:28.820
This is beautiful presentation served with a dabble Wasabi on the side she said to put in some soy sauce the Bowl

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:31.129
We did with lime and just enjoy

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.040
Wow

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.480
oh

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.480
It's so tender

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:45.579
Well, I was expecting it to be a little more chewy. It doesn't have any kind of an off taste or anything like that

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.780
they are moving along with the courses this one is the "Tsukune" which I think is the

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.500
type of meatball the Decision like most like sausage Form oh

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.240
Yeah

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.560
Like taste the "Yuzu(柚子)" under which is a Japanese citrus

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.580
That's so juicy as well

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:06.800
こちらが皮ですね～

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:11.920
Educators when is about in Arcola to know from now on?

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:17.350
Baby welcome no more tears, okay in water

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.030
We had nothing to the course and keep moving along. I got I gotta eat

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:27.399
Meatball is fantastic It's like a sausage shaped me ball

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.260
You do not need

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:38.650
Any sauce or anything on that and moving along to my next birth this one is chicken Gizzard

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:43.359
And you can see it's a little bit bloody you can actually see like some little little

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:46.149
like Bubbles of grilled

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:49.720
Grilled bubbles on there, and then maybe some stone that's on there

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:56.510
I'm a big fan of kids or kids one of my favorite organs that has a nice crispness to it

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.609
It really even has a minerally taste of it

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:04.700
That's just like like like crunchy chicken these ones look pretty pretty fatty and pretty crunchy

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.620
I'm not sure if one of them is chicken skin, and then this one looks like that the back tail of the chicken

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.210
looks like A

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:19.429
Productive mixture of fatty chicken skin, but it looks you can see those like crunchy bubbles of them. I'm pretty backward

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.250
I think that chicken tails

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:32.059
Yeah, that is like like juicy fatty, but crunchy at the same time where it's been grilled

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.800
It's oily definitely, but it's packed with liver you can taste the pureness of the chicken in that bite

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
next when we were and this looks

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:48.140
Might be the chicken skin skewer just skin just like crunched up onto a skewer

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:51.050
It's glistening

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.930
Wow

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:56.220
Wow

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:57.750
It is rich

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.830
its crunchy its gooey its

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:08.030
Total bit salty you got that crispy layer from where it's been ripping sizzle over the charcoal that

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:13.519
Is it's very greasy, but it's very tasty and this appears to be

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:22.460
Maybe chicken thighs mixed with their flesh room on here, and there's the week isn't just a beautiful media Midi skewer

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.930
join us

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:30.989
That's just as good as it looks are just

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:35.039
Dark meat chicken, I got a shiitake mushroom in that bite

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:42.390
Smokey it's salty and I love how they they use such such little seasoning

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:45.419
I suddenly. It's really about the technique of how he grows

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.190
And about the quality of the ingredients including that the chicken that they're using

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:55.109
That's what really makes the up you tori special in Japan. I was waiting for the next course

00:14:55.110 --> 00:15:00.599
I was wondering when this was going to come because chicken liver well, I just love Chicken liver

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:08.280
This is gorgeous. You can see even how they arranged it on the on the skewers. It's like from small to bigger

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:10.230
That'd be a different part

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:15.690
I don't even know how they've just say they know all the anatomy of the chicken and you can see how it Inaudi

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:17.690
It's actually better if they like

00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:34.610
Wow

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:36.610
Okay, that's the bite of the meal right there

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.709
Paul it has like this kind of almost like leathery

00:15:42.649 --> 00:15:46.839
skin around the outside from being grilled, but then on the inside of just literally like

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:52.599
Bursts, I get a picture in my mind of like one of those is it called the Lava cake

00:15:53.149 --> 00:15:58.839
Where you break it open and like juice like like like liquid chocolate just flows out of it

00:15:59.269 --> 00:16:06.368
That is what this liver like sort of does in your mouth except of course instead of chocolate. It's liquid deliver

00:16:06.619 --> 00:16:10.928
This was a complete surprise to me. I won't ever say no to eel and then she sprinkled on

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.480
pepper cement a spiker there

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.359
It just falls apart it has a wonder wonderful Smoky flavor to it as well

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:33.370
Okay, next thank you, er. And it appears to be chicken breast nice big chunk sizes

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:40.870
Forgot to mention, but you can see there's some Wasabi on there as well, and that's not just your average

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:43.810
dry piece of chicken breast

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:48.069
It's so juicy well it just gushes with juice. Oh

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:53.110
And that's only how cooked chicken breast it so as you can see how Rod is on the inside

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.739
These are quail legs. I think they're quail eggs, and what looks like

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.920
They appear to be Bucco nuts

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:04.570
right off the Grill

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:06.230
That's just like

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:13.990
Explain they're just straight up quail eggs and gingko nuts, and this is our final course. Thank you kaki mushrooms

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.560
They're big, and they're really big in the Media

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:27.109
And how much of potato or juicy sauce and like silky?

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.750
silky rubbery at the same time

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:34.760
We just finished with the yakitori Corson. Come outside. I didn't even know it's raining out here

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.489
Oh, I was in like a little bit of a chicken

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:42.019
Paradise heaven inside there without even knowing what was going on on the on the outside

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:48.259
What just amazes me so much about Japanese food in General? Is that how they take just simple?

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:55.790
Single ingredients like chicken and just do amazing things with it, but you know like I'm a spice guy. I love spices

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:57.790
I love like overpowering

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:03.499
spices which Japanese food is not, but I love it because it's so

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:10.609
It's so precise. It's so quality and they just focus on the single paste of those ingredients

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:13.339
but they know how to enhance it so well and

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:16.729
Yakitori is a perfect example of that

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.610
Japanese cooking expertise

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:27.619
that was amazing and that brings us to the end of this japanese food tour video including breakfast lunch and dinner in tokyo and

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:31.010
While I was there that night it started raining

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:37.130
And then we had to get home, so I actually completely forgot about making an ending to this video. So I'm back at home now

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:43.189
But that was a fantastic day the food was amazing and it was

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:49.429
