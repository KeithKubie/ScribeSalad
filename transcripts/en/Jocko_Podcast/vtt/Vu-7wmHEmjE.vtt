00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.950
You had a bunch of fights in UFC, by the way, make sure that I,

2
00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:08.170
I don't forget to tell the kill Jocko story. I gotta tell that story later,

3
00:00:08.171 --> 00:00:12.730
but we'll just tell it right now. Well, I'll say, but, but um, okay.

4
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.910
So I was not, I mean there wasn't pride at the time.

5
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.990
Jocko went to Afghans. We were somewhere, I think it was,

6
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.860
I think it was my first deployment to Iraq for a couple months and then it was

7
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.820
maybe I was just doing a walk maybe if I'm not sure, but you were gone and um,

8
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.010
you come back and my mom had this, uh, medication.

9
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.270
I had acne and o t this was, it was some kind of antibiotic helped it,

10
00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:42.010
but I didn't know it made me really weak and uh, took my endurance away.

11
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.110
This is actually true. This is not an excuse that they [inaudible].

12
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.480
So Jocko comes back and I'm not really feeling a good song cause I was trained.

13
00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:52.180
I'm like, okay, and Jagoda kicks my ass. And junk was like, literally,

14
00:00:52.181 --> 00:00:55.780
he's angry. He's like, you lazy more than we, I'm in the desert.

15
00:00:55.781 --> 00:00:58.240
I'm doing this and you're, you're sitting on your ass,

16
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.060
you understand you'll do nothing and I kicked your ass. And W and I'm like, Eh,

17
00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.670
I'm just like, I was like, I'm like ashamed, shaming myself. Cause,

18
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.410
cause then you go away for like a month or somewhere you're gone. And I'm like,

19
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.180
and I, but that medication, we were at 10 days and I stopped him.

20
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.040
I feel strong again. I'm like, oh, I understand now. So I'm training. I'm like,

21
00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:18.550
mother [inaudible] comes back. I can't wait for this. I made a CD

22
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.360
kill Jocko and it was, I like corn in Metallica, so I'll use like,

23
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.730
it's a job came in, I'm like, Hey Jocko. And I put this money in and we train.

24
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.740
And that was my day, I guess. I think I was like talking Shit Dude,

25
00:01:32.741 --> 00:01:36.970
like you, my feelings were hurt, you're gonna talk to me.

26
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.530
And here's what sucks for me is so if, if both of us are on point, I'm get,

27
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.980
I'm catching the beat down. If so, if both of us are bringing our a game on,

28
00:01:44.981 --> 00:01:45.814
catching the beat down,

29
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.710
if Dean's bringing his a game and I'm bringing my week game,

30
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:51.880
I'm catching a beat down.

31
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.990
If I'm bringing my full a game and beans having a horrible day,

32
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.970
I do like barely. Okay.

33
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.040
So it's like I'll have your days whether you have good days,

34
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.380
they really good days that I have are, are very, I have to, I have to earn them.

35
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.300
I'll put it through that way I have to earn them.

36
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.650
And then so you do UFC,

37
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.030
you do decent. UFCU has some tough fights, good fights. Three,

38
00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:17.690
four ranked in my division. My,

39
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.820
my only two losses by decision was named mark and you should know,

40
00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:23.760
call me and they both after that fight fire and as the silver.

41
00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:27.750
So I was two times right there. Fight for the belt. I was top five, top four.

42
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.310
No, I don't care. Tops. What I fought to fight and Sylvan,

43
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.700
I lost both those matches, but the four I won. And uh,

44
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.710
my first fight was Elisa Sakara who was from Italy's really tough fighter fat.

45
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.060
Probably the fastest hands. And actually I figured this out later.

46
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.080
I was the underdog, but they were actually trying to feed me to him.

47
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.990
He was gonna fight chocolate. Allow her, you are stepping stone.

48
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.930
Well supposedly you're supposed to demand this screwed up.

49
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.220
They were already planning like using a fight.

50
00:02:54.221 --> 00:02:57.150
Chocolate l cause he has probably f he has faster hands.

51
00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.970
Probably Chuck has a really good Chen, better wrestling,

52
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:04.960
but Sakara faster hands, better boxing. So yeah. Oh, have them fight after.

53
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.900
That's what I heard. But um,

54
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.570
that day I got in the same triangle I got showed you a Karin and uh,

55
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.820
but he taught, uh, showed your here, went to sleep.

56
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.560
So both my debuts won't one by the same move and up against a tough guys.

57
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.050
So then I find, uh, another Japanese opponent.

58
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.900
I fight a Bulgarian Olympic wrestler. I fought Nate Mar. Quote,

59
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:26.590
you should have called me and I fought Jeremy Horn. So six fights in USC.

60
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.920
So my career has been focused on Jujitsu more No-gi is because when you do MMA

61
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:35.560
you don't, you don't have a g or ki-moon one. So it kind of wasting your time.

62
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.090
If you're training in that aspect and you don't have a g on your candidate,

63
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.200
how to grab the belt, how to do this, you kind of wasting your time. So yeah,

64
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.200
I've distributed my time between mixed martial arts and grappling.
