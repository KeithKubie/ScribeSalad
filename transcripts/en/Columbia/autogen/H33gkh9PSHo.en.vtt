but does it mean it would be better to

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:42.780
but does it mean it would be better to
 

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:45.740
but does it mean it would be better to
delay the new legislation I don't think

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:45.750
delay the new legislation I don't think
 

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:47.480

so because this new legislation is
 

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:50.260
so because this new legislation is
extremely important for giving rise to
