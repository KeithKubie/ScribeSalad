00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.510
Welcome back.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:04.280
We were in the midst of figuring
out the Laplace

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.210
transform of sine of at when
I was running out of time.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.980
This was the definition
of the Laplace

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.470
transform of sine of at.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.380
I said that also equals y.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.750
This is going to be useful for
us, since we're going to be

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.120
doing integration
by parts twice.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.130
So I did integration by parts
once, then I did integration

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.160
by parts twice.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.900
I said, you know, don't worry
about the boundaries of the

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.700
integral right now.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.390
Let's just worry about the
indefinite integral.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.820
And then after we solve for y--
let's just say y is the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.270
indefinite version of this--
then we can evaluate the

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.830
boundaries.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.540
And we got to this point, and we
made the realization, after

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.480
doing two integration by parts
and being very careful not to

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.560
hopefully make any careless
mistakes, we realized, wow,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.240
this is our original y.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.410
If I put the boundaries here,
that's the same thing as the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.100
Laplace transform of
sine of at, right?

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.760
That's our original y.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.700
So now-- and I'll switch colors
just avoid monotony--

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.295
this is equal to, actually,
let me just-- this is y.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:05.560
Right?

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.600
That was our original
definition.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.420
So let's add a squared over
sine squared y to

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.900
both sides of this.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.400
So this is equal to y plus--
I'm just adding this whole

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.130
term to both sides of this
equation-- plus a squared over

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:31.470
s squared y is equal to-- so
this term is now gone, so it's

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.475
equal to this stuff.

00:01:32.475 --> 00:01:34.260
And let's see if we
can simplify this.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.845
So let's factor out an e to the
minus st. Actually, let's

00:01:38.845 --> 00:01:45.360
factor out a negative e to the
minus st. So it's minus e to

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:58.320
the minus st, times sine of--
well, let me just write 1 over

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:10.900
s, sine of at, minus 1 over
s squared, cosine of at.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.650
I really hope I haven't made
any careless mistakes.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.010
And so this, we can add
the coefficient.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.030
So we get 1 plus a squared,
over s squared, times y.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.440
But that's the same thing as s
squared over s squared, plus a

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.100
squared over s squared.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.920
So it's s squared plus a
squared, over s squared, y is

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:40.320
equal to minus e to the minus
st, times this whole thing,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.510
sine of at, minus 1 over s
squared, cosine of at.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.410
And now, this right here, since
we're doing everything

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.050
with respect to dt, this is
just a constant, right?

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.740
So we can say a constant
times the

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.290
antiderivative is equal to this.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.360
This is as good a time as any
to evaluate the boundaries.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.580
Right?

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.440
If this had a t here, I would
have to somehow get them back

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.820
on the other side.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.230
Because the t's are involved in
evaluating the boundaries,

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.040
since we're doing our definite
integral or improper integral.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.230
So let's evaluate the
boundaries now.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.620
And we could've kept
them along with us

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.810
the whole time, right?

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.510
And just factored out this
term right here.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.920
But anyway.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.090
So let's evaluate this
from 0 to infinity.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.050
And this should simplify
things.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.820
So the right-hand side of this
equation, when I evaluate it

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.290
at infinity, what is e to
the minus infinity?

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.250
Well, that is 0.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.850
We've established that
multiple times.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.350
And now it approaches 0 from
the negative side, but it's

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.020
still going to be 0,
or it approaches 0.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.010
What's sine of infinity?

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.130
Well, sine just keeps
oscillating, between negative

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.840
1 and plus 1, and
so does cosine.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.470
Right?

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.970
So this is bounded.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.180
So this thing is going
to overpower these.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.030
And if you're curious,
you can graph it.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.220
This kind of forms an envelope
around these oscillations.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.110
So the limit, as this approaches
infinity, is going

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.360
to be equal to 0.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.450
And that makes sense, right?

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.270
These are bounded between
0 and negative 1.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.750
And this approaches
0 very quickly.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.420
So it's 0 times something
bounded between 1

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.540
and negative 1.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.360
Another way to view it is the
largest value this could equal

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.390
is 1 times whatever
coefficient's on it, and then

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.080
this is going to 0.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.310
So it's like 0 times 1.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.610
Anyway, I don't want to focus
too much on that.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.830
You can play around with
that if you like.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.880
Minus this whole thing
evaluated at 0.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.840
So what's e to the minus 0?

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.840
Well, e to the minus 0 is 1.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.310
Right?

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.780
That's e to the 0.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.160
We have a minus 1, so it becomes
plus 1 times-- now,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.370
sine of 0 is 0.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.190
Minus 1 over s squared,
cosine of 0.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.580
Let's see.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:11.190
Cosine of 0 is 1, so we have
minus 1 over s squared, minus

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.230
1 over s squared, times 1.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:23.720
So that is equal to minus
1 over s squared.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.100
And I think I made a mistake,
because I shouldn't be having

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.270
a negative number here.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.260
So let's backtrack.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.910
Maybe this isn't a
negative number?

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.310
Let's see, infinity, right?

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.660
This whole thing is 0.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.800
When when you put 0 here,
this becomes a minus 1.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.460
Yeah.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.750
So either this is a plus
or this is a plus.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.480
Let's see where I
made my mistake.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:58.130
e to the minus st-- oh, I
see where my mistake is.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.650
Right up here.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.650
Where I factored out a minus
e to the minus st, right?

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:05.270
Fair enough.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.920
So that makes this 1
over s, sine of at.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.840
But if I factor out a minus e to
the minus st, this becomes

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.680
a plus, right?

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.005
It was a minus here, but I'm
factoring out of a minus e to

00:06:16.005 --> 00:06:16.980
the minus st.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.420
So that's a plus.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.160
This is a plus.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.470
Boy, I'm glad that was not
too difficult to find.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.170
So then this becomes a plus.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.550
And then this becomes a plus.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:26.165
Thank God.

00:06:26.165 --> 00:06:29.420
It would have been sad if I
wasted two videos and ended up

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.030
with a careless, negative
number.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.470
Anyway.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:39.660
So now we have s squared plus
a squared, over s squared,

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.880
times y is equal to this.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.480
Multiply both sides times
s squared over-- s

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.010
squared plus a squared.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:49.420
Divide both sides by this, and
we get y is equal to 1 over s

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:56.570
squared-- And actually, let me
make sure that that is right.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.870
It's 1 over s squared.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:07.980
y is equal to 1 over s squared,
times s squared, over

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.760
s squared plus a squared.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.570
And then these cancel out.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.090
And let me make sure
that I haven't made

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.202
another careless mistake.

00:07:16.202 --> 00:07:16.750
Because I have a

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:22.970
feeling I have. Yep.

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:23.360
There.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.150
I see the careless mistake.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.090
And it was all in this term.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.010
And I hope you don't mind my
careless mistakes, but I want

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.720
you to see that I'm doing these
things in real time and

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.470
I am human, in case you haven't
realized already.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.600
Anyway, so I made the same
careless mistake.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:45.410
So I factor out an e to the
minus st here, so it's plus.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.310
But it was a over s squared.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.290
So this is an a.

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:50.720
That's an a.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.640
And so this is an a.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.370
And so this is an a.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.470
And so this is an a.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:07:58.740
Right?

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.640
This was an a.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.730
And this is the correct
answer.

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:07.120
a over s squared
plus a squared.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.360
So I hope those careless
mistakes didn't

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.910
throw you off too much.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:14.490
These things happen when you do
integration by parts twice

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:15.840
with a bunch of variables.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.430
But anyway, now we are ready
to add a significant entry

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:23.600
into our table of Laplace
transforms. And that is that

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.860
the Laplace transform-- I had
an extra curl, there.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:27.520
That was unecessary.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.740
Let me do it again.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:40.230
The Laplace transform of sine
of at is equal to a over s

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.159
squared, plus a squared.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.210
And that's a significant
entry.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:48.100
And maybe a good exercise for
you, just to see how fun it is

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.070
to do these integration by parts
problems twice, is to

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:55.390
figure out the Laplace transform
of cosine of at.

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:56.240
And I'll give you a hint.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.410
It's s over s squared over
s squared plus a squared.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.620
And it's nice that there's
that symmetry there.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.330
Anyway, I'm almost
at my time limit.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.850
And I'm very tired working
on this video.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:12.360
So I'll leave it there and I'll
see you in the next one.
