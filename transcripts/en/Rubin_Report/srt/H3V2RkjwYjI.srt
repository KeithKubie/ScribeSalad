00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,400
[inaudible]

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,680
joining me today is an Iraq war veteran,

3
00:00:06,681 --> 00:00:11,480
a political analysts at America's
favorite Black Gay Republican.

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,360
Rob Smith. Welcome to the Rubin
report. Thanks for having me.

5
00:00:14,361 --> 00:00:17,780
Day America's favorite
Black Gay Republican.

6
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:20,540
That's a lot of pressure to
put in a Twitter bio. You know,

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,390
it's a lot of pressure. I feel that, um,

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,700
about a year ago about this time,

9
00:00:25,701 --> 00:00:30,360
because I came out as conservative a
year ago and I out as conservative about

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,490
fascinating phrase that we're going to
talk a little, get into that. Absolutely.

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,660
But when I came out I said
I want something pithy and
catchy and kind of funny

12
00:00:38,661 --> 00:00:41,720
because it's a joke. Yeah. America's
favorite Black Gay Republican.

13
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:44,810
I want there to be as sense of humor
in it because as you know, you know,

14
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:47,990
you use humor to bring people in,
then you hit them with the facts.

15
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,870
So a lot of people are going to be
going, wait a minute, wait a minute.

16
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,270
These guys are supposed
to hate identity politics.

17
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:57,350
But he's saying he's America's
favorite Black Gay Republican. Well,

18
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,980
here's my thing with that. I
think that there's a, number one,

19
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:04,550
all politics is identity politics.
So everybody does identity politics.

20
00:01:04,551 --> 00:01:05,990
The left does it in the right,
does it,

21
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,330
I think that since coming
out as a conservative,

22
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,840
the way I play identity politics
is this, I'm black, I'm gay,

23
00:01:11,841 --> 00:01:12,780
I'm going to rock war veteran,

24
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,460
I'm all these different things and they
don't matter about my politics because I

25
00:01:16,461 --> 00:01:18,890
can be all of these things
and still love America.

26
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:23,030
And the way the left plays
identity politics is we hate you,

27
00:01:23,031 --> 00:01:27,770
evil white men or you know,
this is my 72 genders or all this stuff.

28
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:32,000
So I feel like they use identity
politics not only in a super negative and

29
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:35,960
controlling way, but as a way to
get people's votes. 80 sucks though,

30
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:39,410
to kind of have to do a little bit of
what they do to throw it in their face.

31
00:01:39,411 --> 00:01:42,890
Right. Cause like anytime, I don't
mention that I'm gay that often,

32
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,280
but anytime that I do,
I have no problem mentioning it.

33
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:48,800
Like I'm more than happy to talk
about it. Yeah. But anytime that I do,

34
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:53,801
it really only is to throw the use
the way that they use gay people.

35
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,800
Uh, it's to throw that back
in their face like I have no,

36
00:01:57,801 --> 00:02:00,710
I don't want special credit for
it. You know? I mean, there's,

37
00:02:00,711 --> 00:02:02,900
there's no special credit.
I think that for me,

38
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,110
when you get into my history and you know,
I'm going to Iraq war veteran,

39
00:02:06,111 --> 00:02:07,970
I protested against,
don't ask, don't tell.

40
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:13,010
And I came out at 19 or I came out at 19
kind of like to myself and a couple of

41
00:02:13,011 --> 00:02:15,250
friends of my mother. But when
I got out of the military, I'd,

42
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:18,260
we're on 21 years old because I had
to serve under, don't ask, don't tell.

43
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,170
I said I'm done with closets,
so I'm going to be out as gay.

44
00:02:21,171 --> 00:02:24,830
So being gay to me has always
kinda been a political act.

45
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,980
And when I was protesting
against, don't ask, don't tell,

46
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,680
and getting arrested at the White House
and doing all these different things,

47
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,230
it was always a political
act for me to be gay.

48
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,740
So even coming out as a
conservative and being on the right,

49
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:38,210
and I'm proudly on the right,

50
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,840
being gay is still a political act
because I have to go into these spaces and

51
00:02:41,841 --> 00:02:46,841
say I'm gay and this is why that matters
and this is how we can change the party

52
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,810
and change the idea of conservatism
to bring more people in.

53
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,370
Do you ever find that conservatives
have problems? We gave people,

54
00:02:55,371 --> 00:02:59,260
cause people keep telling me that all
these conservatives hate gay people and I

55
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:00,100
go to events all

56
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,200
over the place, all over the
country, all over the world.

57
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,630
And I meet all these conservatives.
And I'm not saying there are none.

58
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,860
I have no doubt there's a certain sect
of Bible thumpers obviously that's still

59
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:12,010
do or some people that have different
religious beliefs. You know,

60
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:15,130
Ben Shapiro from an Orthodox
Jewish perspective, not
thrilled with gay marriage,

61
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,160
but now takes a libertarian approach
to civil marriage. I'm okay with,

62
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:20,410
I don't need him to bow to my beliefs,

63
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,650
but I don't find that there's any
real push back against gay people from

64
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:27,650
conservatives anymore. I just
don't see it. This is, yeah.

65
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,000
What I've seen and I've seen very,

66
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:34,320
very little in the way of people having
some problem with me being gay. The um,

67
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,860
in my experience, and I've been, God, I,

68
00:03:36,861 --> 00:03:40,170
I spoke to the Metropolitan Republican
Club in New York City and I speak at

69
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:43,620
these republican events all over the
country and it's not so much I have a

70
00:03:43,621 --> 00:03:47,200
problem with you being gay.
It's some people say, um, one,

71
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:49,260
one person came up to me and she said,
you know,

72
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:52,590
you're so good looking and you're black
and you know, you're all these things.

73
00:03:52,591 --> 00:03:56,150
Like why do you have to talk about the
gay thing? And I told her, I was like,

74
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,430
I talk about the gay thing because it's
very important for me to talk about it

75
00:03:59,431 --> 00:04:02,730
because people need to know there are gay
conservatives out there that follow me

76
00:04:02,731 --> 00:04:04,380
right now that are afraid to come out.

77
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,940
And so I need to take this gain as to the
space and let them know that it's okay.

78
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,930
And also let you guys know that you're
missing out on a base of millions of

79
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:16,860
voters by, by doing things that
can even be construed as it. Yeah.

80
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,670
Do you think it's one of those things
where it's sort of you have to do it so

81
00:04:20,671 --> 00:04:23,910
that it can get to the point that you
don't have to do it? Is that really? Yes.

82
00:04:23,911 --> 00:04:24,410
Yeah.

83
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,710
And I was having the, um,
this conversation with,

84
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:29,690
with Candace and I shared this at the
blocks are rally over the weekend as well.

85
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,720
Um,
doing identity politics,

86
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,470
you do it now so that at a certain
point we don't have to do it anymore.

87
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,890
So we have to say that I'm
a gay republican or I'm a
black republican or I'm a

88
00:04:39,891 --> 00:04:41,810
gay, black, conservative,
whatever you want to say.

89
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:47,050
Because as Americans we have to break
all that stuff down and figure out what

90
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:51,530
our identity as Americans is.
And that's the point for me.

91
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,171
Yeah.
All right.

92
00:04:52,171 --> 00:04:54,960
So I want to talk about what it's
like coming out as a conservative,

93
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,460
as a gay black man. The rest
of it. But let, let's just
back up. Yeah. All together.

94
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,310
Tell me a little bit about growing
up in a family, that kind of thing.

95
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,630
So I am from Akron, Ohio.
One of the biggest, um,

96
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,920
things that people like
to say to discredit black
conservatives is that we were

97
00:05:10,921 --> 00:05:14,580
all born wealthy. We were all
born upper, upper middle class.

98
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:17,880
And what we're doing is we're just
trying to protect our privilege.

99
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,460
I'm from Akron, Ohio. You weren't in Bel
Air. I was not in Bel Air. All right.

100
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,320
I was in Akron, Ohio in check
the stats on Akron, Ohio.

101
00:05:25,321 --> 00:05:28,050
Anybody that doesn't know where that is,
um,

102
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,370
went to the worst one of the worst
public school systems in the state.

103
00:05:32,371 --> 00:05:35,280
You can look on the website right now.
I can, public schools are rated d plus.

104
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,460
So I came from a single
mother household. You know, I,

105
00:05:40,461 --> 00:05:44,840
I came from all this stuff and my
mother tells me this story now.

106
00:05:44,841 --> 00:05:45,960
I was too young to remember,

107
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:51,150
but obviously I went to kindergarten in
a school that was in my neighborhood and

108
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:55,110
my mother tells me the story about
going to see me in kindergarten one day.

109
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,920
And it was just, you
know, 90% black school.

110
00:05:57,921 --> 00:06:01,430
She's just to the people who are just
running around crazy. And she said,

111
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,800
I had to pull you out of that school
because I knew you weren't going to learn

112
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:08,460
anything, send me to school all the
way across town. Um, the school was,

113
00:06:08,461 --> 00:06:10,550
was mostly white that doesn't
make it better or made it better,

114
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:13,700
was the property taxes and it was just a,
a more funded school.

115
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,940
So I was able to get that kind of base,

116
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,960
went back to my side of town for
middle school and high school,

117
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:23,330
which was just a terrible experience.
I,

118
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:26,300
and I tell people all the time
when they asked me about, you know,

119
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:29,630
sort of things in the world, in Western
civilization, all that, I'm like, look,

120
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,170
I went to Akron public schools. There are
so many things that I just do not know.

121
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,510
Um, and so I had that
experience. But in those days,

122
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:40,910
and probably still today,
somebody that looks like me,

123
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:42,350
that comes from where I come from,

124
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,470
if I'm not dribbling a basketball
or doing whatever they like,

125
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,740
they don't know what to do with you.
So it's not tracked in the college.

126
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:52,880
I wasn't attracted to any of these things.
I graduated high school at barely,

127
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,840
I think it was either 16 or
barely 17 and just had no path.

128
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:02,000
So I joined the military right out of
high school because I needed a path.

129
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:06,110
I needed a job. I needed something
to do. I wish that I could say in,

130
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:08,900
in my military service is
great and I love this country.

131
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,440
And that five years that I spent in the
military is probably the the greatest

132
00:07:12,441 --> 00:07:16,790
thing I'll ever do. But I can't
lie and say that as 17 years old,

133
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:19,520
like I was so patriotic,
I wanted to serve my country like that.

134
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,250
And it was a way for me to move beyond.

135
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,510
Yeah. Yeah. All right.
Well before we get to that,

136
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:28,350
I can't let anyone mention basketball.
I got a boy. You got any skills?

137
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:33,240
And I don't, I'm the word black man
ever. I like am terrible at basketball.

138
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:33,961
I don't want to Brag,

139
00:07:33,961 --> 00:07:38,390
but I won most improved player of the
New York City gay men's basketball this

140
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,460
year.

141
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,260
I think 2012 when I was already like 37
which could be most improved player at

142
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,920
37. That's not bad. That's
pretty good. It's really good.

143
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,150
Funny that um, they have that
gay basketball league there.

144
00:07:47,151 --> 00:07:49,810
There's a part of me that
has always wanted to try it,

145
00:07:49,811 --> 00:07:50,800
but I know it'd be so great,

146
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,560
bad and there were guys dunking.
I mean it's a serious,

147
00:07:55,561 --> 00:07:58,500
it's a serious you got, it's funny because
I don't mind, I always, for me at least,

148
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,970
and I wonder for you,

149
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:05,150
like my sports and my sexuality had
nothing to do with each other ever.

150
00:08:05,161 --> 00:08:08,670
Like I never brought my sexuality
when I'm out on the court in any way.

151
00:08:08,671 --> 00:08:10,140
You know what I mean?
Like it wasn't like that.

152
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,010
The only reason I joined that league
was at that point in my life when I came

153
00:08:14,011 --> 00:08:17,610
out late and I finally was like, Oh, let
me just meet some, I didn't really like,

154
00:08:17,611 --> 00:08:22,590
like the bar scene or like, yeah, like I
didn't, I didn't like that and I was like,

155
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,770
Oh mate, if there's happened to be some
gay people that also like basketball,

156
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:29,290
maybe I'll find some friends. And I did
find some friends there and it's like,

157
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,280
and half of them, it's
like you're gay. Really?

158
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:36,290
Like when a guy like dunks on you and
like some of those guys like almost went

159
00:08:36,421 --> 00:08:38,070
pro.
That's how good they got.

160
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,480
The weird thing about kind of like
being gay in not only am I gay,

161
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:45,870
I was so used to be a fat kid. Um, as
well. So you're really going forward here.

162
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,950
I'm like, I got everything. Did
you have Olympic at any point?

163
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,720
Did not have a was five.
Like I said,

164
00:08:51,721 --> 00:08:55,980
I was like some fat black gay
kids was not athletic at, so I

165
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,810
didn't discover because there
are some sports I'm good at.

166
00:08:57,811 --> 00:09:01,200
I played in the Gay Volleyball League in
New York City for a couple of years and

167
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:04,700
now I'm a pariah since I came
out as conservatives. Oh, GPA.

168
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,900
I thought they were all telling Shannon,
right? New York City gays, they're not,

169
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:13,780
are not intolerant. This is
not so much. I am shocked,

170
00:09:13,781 --> 00:09:18,030
but I discovered that I am athletic
and I discovered that I'm great at

171
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:21,270
volleyball, great at tennis, you
know like like lifting weights,

172
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:24,600
like being in shape. But that's kind
of what I discovered about myself.

173
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:26,130
Kind of like,
I don't want to say later in life,

174
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:30,120
but definitely post 30 that I actually,
you know, have some sports skills.

175
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,350
Yeah. All right, good. So
when you joined the military,

176
00:09:33,351 --> 00:09:35,270
where you were you already
sort of out to yourself?

177
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,650
Now I'm talking about
sexuality and politics,

178
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,460
politics, NYSE, but certainly
not a conservative thing. I was,

179
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:46,290
I was out to myself I think in the way
that a lot of gay teams are. You know,

180
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:50,670
I knew that I was kind of like feeling
away about guys that I was supposed to

181
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:51,600
feel about girls,

182
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,690
but I don't know if I could really
kind of quantify it in that way. Um,

183
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,330
and when I went into the military,
they actually,

184
00:09:57,331 --> 00:10:01,200
in those days I actually asked you,
are you gay? And I said, no, I'm not.

185
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:04,050
Only because I, I didn't know
how to define it at the time,

186
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:08,100
but also I knew that that was a barrier
to, to what I wanted to do, you know.

187
00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:10,380
So being in the military,

188
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:15,150
I came out to myself, you know,
started exploring my sexuality,

189
00:10:15,151 --> 00:10:18,720
exploring all of that stuff. And like I
said, when I got done with the military,

190
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:21,030
coming out was like a political
act. I was like, no more closets.

191
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,930
Were you finding other gay people
in the military? Like what is that?

192
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,850
What was that like then? I mean, now,

193
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,290
now where it's more accepted and donate
that it doesn't exist or whatever

194
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,623
about,
um,

195
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,140
it's really funny how it is now is that
there are entire Instagram accounts

196
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:40,340
dedicated to gay guys in the military.
It's called gay military dudes.

197
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,790
And I love the fact that these bees,

198
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,700
young gay men in the military,
so open about, you know,

199
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:50,200
their sexuality and their posting thought
picks and they're doing all this like

200
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:50,600
great.
Yeah.

201
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,770
Yeah. And you're saying the military
hasn't crumbled since and it's causing

202
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,820
demoralization or everyone's still okay.

203
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,610
We still, everybody still good.
Okay. But back then there was this,

204
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:05,330
this underground movement of,
of gay people,

205
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,100
gays and lesbians that
were in the military.

206
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:10,520
And I remember the very first
pride I went to, I was, I'm,

207
00:11:10,521 --> 00:11:13,400
I was stationed in Fort Carson, Colorado,
so like right on Colorado Springs.

208
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:18,310
And my very first pride was
Denver pride. So I went there, uh,

209
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:21,440
I think it was like maybe
19 or 20 at the time.

210
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:26,540
And that was my first time being around
a lots of other gay men at the same time.

211
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,160
And it was the first time
that, um, you know, I was,

212
00:11:29,161 --> 00:11:32,810
I was getting attention from men and
then like people were looking at me and I

213
00:11:32,811 --> 00:11:36,200
was like, oh, he's cute. And I was like,
oh, so this is what this is like. Um,

214
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:39,410
so there was a thriving underground
gay culture in the military.

215
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,310
Were you afraid to go out and go to a
gay pride parade while you're at serving?

216
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,400
Absolutely,

217
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,840
because it's like if don't ask, don't
tell was tricky because it was not only,

218
00:11:49,841 --> 00:11:53,830
you can't tell somebody that you're gay,
but if you were discovered be gay,

219
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,820
then people would, um, you know, go up
the chain of command and kick you out.

220
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,340
But the thing about it is,
and this is what we always realize,

221
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:03,540
that nobody would care because there
are plenty of guys in my unit that,

222
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:07,060
that knew I was gay and a funny story,
there was a club called,

223
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:11,350
I think it's now different called hide
and seek in Colorado Springs and they

224
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:16,030
used to be open to people under
21 after 2:00 AM. So I would be,

225
00:12:16,031 --> 00:12:20,030
yeah, yeah, yeah. It
will be open at 21. Uh,

226
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,560
it would be open to people under 21 after
2:00 AM because it'd be like open till

227
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:27,710
five and um, they wouldn't be serving any
booze. So I was young in the military.

228
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:31,120
I was like maybe 20 years old.
I would take a nap at 10 30 at night.

229
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:33,490
I wake up at one 30,
I would put on,

230
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:38,140
I had like black leather pants and
a tank top is insane, crazy. Um,

231
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:41,620
and then drive to hide and seek and
dance all night. And it was kind of,

232
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:44,200
it was a more gay crowd,
but it was mixed as well.

233
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,770
And I saw a couple of my sergeants there.
Wow.

234
00:12:46,771 --> 00:12:48,580
The time at the club and they saw me,

235
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,620
they saw me and they saw me and they
were like, okay, this is interesting.

236
00:12:53,621 --> 00:12:56,920
And they saw me kind of like dancing
with some red head and, you know,

237
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,520
feeling my oats, you know
what I mean? Feeling myself.

238
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,840
But I remember being terrified that
weekend that they were going to out me,

239
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,990
that they were gonna like tell my
superiors or whatever. It never did well,

240
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:11,770
but you had it on them too, right? I
mean, no, they weren't gay. They were,

241
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:12,840
they were just like,
they with their growth

242
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,030
friends because it was like,
oh wow.

243
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,000
I just had a completely different story
going on in my head for the last 30

244
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:22,760
seconds. Yeah, no, they were
there with their girlfriends,
their hour spot. Oh, whoa.

245
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,100
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay.
And so they did. They did

246
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,180
bust me out in a lot of these guys
are still my friends to this day,

247
00:13:31,431 --> 00:13:33,350
my Facebook friends and they see
all the stuff that they're doing.

248
00:13:33,351 --> 00:13:34,910
I'm here there and coming
out as a Republican.

249
00:13:34,911 --> 00:13:37,610
I'm doing all this and they're
like, Smith, you know, we
always knew you were gay.

250
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:38,470
We just didn't care.

251
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,580
Yeah.
Cause you're a good soldier.

252
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:43,180
So I know what most gay people
feel about being in the closet.

253
00:13:43,181 --> 00:13:46,210
Just how you can be as a person.
It's just, you know, you're, you're,

254
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:49,930
I always felt like I was like lying
all the time accidentally. Like I was,

255
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,440
it wasn't even intentionalized people
would ask me something and I could

256
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:55,180
immediately, you know,
where were you last night?

257
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:57,970
And I could just lie without
thinking, you know, it's really,

258
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:02,690
it's a really twisted, dark. It's not fun
to think back on that kind of thing. Um,

259
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,410
but for someone in the military
during don't ask, don't tell.

260
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,910
Do you think that affected
your ability to function as a,

261
00:14:09,911 --> 00:14:12,310
as a soldier? And I think it did. Yeah.

262
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,540
Says the,

263
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,080
I think that to me the biggest thing
about being closeted in the military was

264
00:14:21,341 --> 00:14:24,460
that it affected the relationships
that I was able to have with my fellow

265
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:25,180
soldiers.

266
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,830
There was a wall there and if I was
able to just be gay and nobody cared,

267
00:14:29,831 --> 00:14:31,540
that wall wouldn't be there.
And,

268
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:35,170
and it's so important when you're serving
with people to be able to be close to

269
00:14:35,171 --> 00:14:38,650
them. Like literally to be able to,
to bring your full self to work.

270
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,280
Because not only were we serving together,
I mean we deployed together, you know,

271
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,370
I did a tour in Kuwait,
I did a tour in a ripe,

272
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,970
these are the people that you're with.

273
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:50,890
These are basically your family and you
have to hide a part of yourself and all

274
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:55,010
the, that they were hanging out or doing
things that we could become closer.

275
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,920
I was separating myself from that because
I knew that there was a part of me

276
00:14:57,921 --> 00:14:58,760
that had to hide.

277
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,730
And so when I bring all
of that stuff now too,

278
00:15:03,731 --> 00:15:06,920
to being gay and being open as
a conservative and everything,

279
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,570
it is so important for me to be open in
that way because there I can't have that

280
00:15:11,571 --> 00:15:14,830
wall there between me and
other conservatives and
me and other people in the

281
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,300
movement. And the younger
conservatives have been s like,

282
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,650
these kids don't care.
They don't care.

283
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,890
Some of the older ones need to kind of
be brought around a little bit, but man,

284
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:25,724
they don't care.

285
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:30,150
Do you think it's just because young
people somehow have started to embrace a

286
00:15:30,151 --> 00:15:33,590
more libertarian view of
the world? I mean, it's like
we've got sort of, you know,

287
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:37,030
crazy leftism. On one hand you seems
to be catching fire all the time.

288
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,860
It's really pushed on us by the media.
But then I see,

289
00:15:39,861 --> 00:15:43,160
and I guess it's a little selected by,
by who invites me to these schools,

290
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:48,460
but I see such a strong libertarian
like spirit with these kids.

291
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,830
Not meaning that they're all
politically libertarians at every level,

292
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:54,440
but like they just,
they want to live their lives.

293
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:55,730
They want to love who they love,

294
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:59,030
they want to smoke whatever they
want to smoke or whatever. And,

295
00:15:59,031 --> 00:16:03,320
and I'm very enthused by that. I think
that the, the generation right now,

296
00:16:03,321 --> 00:16:04,640
they really do just,

297
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:08,660
they just want to let people live and
they want to let people do their thing.

298
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,090
They don't care about gay,
they don't care about transgender,

299
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:13,610
they don't care about any
of these different things.

300
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,310
They just want to let people live.
And it's really funny,

301
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:19,730
like the conversation I had last
night, I'm at Ucla, I had an event.

302
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:24,230
And it's so funny because when I was
protesting against don't ask, don't tell,

303
00:16:24,231 --> 00:16:25,100
I was, I was, you know,

304
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:28,790
doing a lot of lecture work and I was
talking with the young LGBT student groups

305
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,160
and I was just like, you know, you
can be anything you want to be.

306
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,500
Let's empower you. Like,
let's do all this stuff.

307
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,950
And I'm having these same conversations
with young people who are afraid to come

308
00:16:36,951 --> 00:16:39,770
out as conservative. Same thing.
Date. Yeah, no, it is. All right.

309
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,520
So let's just dive into that then too,

310
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,810
because I really do feel
this now because I find,

311
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,070
I know what the closeted thing was
like, as, as in terms of sexuality,

312
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,030
but I see this now the amount of emails
that I get and when I meet people on the

313
00:16:53,031 --> 00:16:56,900
street and they'll kinda whisper
it to me, you know, it's not even,

314
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,480
they're not even saying, yeah, well
they'll go hit Dave and then they'll go,

315
00:16:59,481 --> 00:17:01,340
it's not even like they're saying
they are conservative per se.

316
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,940
They're basically just saying they're
not a progressive yeah. That they're not,

317
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,440
they don't come from the woke monster.
You know what I mean?

318
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,350
And I,
and they're walking around with that,

319
00:17:12,351 --> 00:17:15,410
that feeling that you described a moment
ago related to sexuality where you

320
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:18,870
can't be fully there with someone.
And I think there are,

321
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,210
there are quite literally,

322
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:23,180
I think there were millions of people
in the United States that are walking

323
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:25,630
around in a closeted stand,

324
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,060
not because they're Nazis are white
supremacists are haters are racist,

325
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,800
but just because they happen to have
either some conservative beliefs or uh,

326
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,390
some libertarian beliefs
or something like that.

327
00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:38,960
And I see it all the time and I'm
sure you probably get 10 times as many

328
00:17:38,961 --> 00:17:43,340
messages as I do, but you see it and
when you go have these conversations,

329
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:47,930
it is the same conversations that I was
having with a young gay kids that were

330
00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:50,460
afraid to come out. I had a
conversation with the kid last night.

331
00:17:50,461 --> 00:17:51,390
He was just like,
man,

332
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,290
how do I come out to my friends is
conservative or how do I come out to my

333
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,450
friends as somebody
who's like not a leftist?

334
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,240
And this is what I always say to them.
You know,

335
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:04,980
the real ones will stick around the
fake ones. We'll go, I promise you that.

336
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,240
And when, like a year
ago, I remember sitting,

337
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:13,110
I was visiting my best friend in
Vegas and I was thinking about,

338
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,340
I know from my experience, you know,
being very prominent in, in the don't ask,

339
00:18:17,341 --> 00:18:20,490
don't tell thing that when
you come out as something,

340
00:18:20,491 --> 00:18:24,240
like you're coming out to make a statement
and it has to be a media moment and

341
00:18:24,241 --> 00:18:27,450
you have to get your face out there
because that's what gives other people the

342
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:31,140
strength to come out. And I was
like, man, if I don't do this,

343
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,380
somebody else is going to do this
because I know I'm not the only black gay

344
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:36,870
republican out there.
I have fans that are,

345
00:18:36,871 --> 00:18:41,820
that are Black Gay Republicans and Latina
Lesbian Conservatives and all sorts of

346
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:44,100
stuff. Um, but I was
like, if I don't do this,

347
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:47,940
somebody else is gonna do this and
somebody needs to do this because these

348
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:49,590
people need to know that it's okay.

349
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:54,830
And when I take the hits and you take
the hits and Candice takes the hits and

350
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:56,700
all of these other people takes the hits,

351
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,600
it makes it easier for these
other people to come out.

352
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,100
So I've asked a lot of my guests that have
taken those heads. Yeah. This question,

353
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:04,240
I usually ask it at the end,

354
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,710
but what do you think it is
about you that allows you to,

355
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,210
to want to take the hit
or maybe not even want to,

356
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,490
that you do whether you want to or not.

357
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:16,530
I'm telling you the army built
something that is indestructible,

358
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,220
indestructible.
I served for five years.

359
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,860
I saw some things on a rock.

360
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:27,690
I saw some things overseas and
in not even outside of that.

361
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,830
What the basic training does is it just
builds you up and as somebody that has a

362
00:19:31,831 --> 00:19:36,540
lot of discipline that can take a lot of
hits and I know enough about media and

363
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:40,170
I know enough about the people that
are making the moves right now.

364
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:44,940
I know that it is important for me to
do this because, and I'm telling you,

365
00:19:44,941 --> 00:19:45,240
they have,

366
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,380
and you've probably seen the shift in
the past five to seven years since you've

367
00:19:49,381 --> 00:19:52,190
been doing this and have really
been blown up and traveling all the,

368
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,033
all the world.

369
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,690
There's a shift that's going
on and I believe it's real.

370
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,060
And in three to five years,
me being a black gay conservative,

371
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,920
this is going to be
like, you know, whatever.

372
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:10,110
And I hate the fact that
the gay community, I'm,

373
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:14,450
I'm Kinda my am ex communicated now, you
know, so I'm not getting invites to the

374
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,300
thrilled with me there. Yeah,
we should start our own awards.

375
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:21,550
We totally should do the, the,
the gate free thinkers. Right.

376
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,200
You know,
but you get excommunicated and they're,

377
00:20:25,201 --> 00:20:28,680
they're very high level people that,
I mean I used to get invited to,

378
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,610
to all this stuff in New York City
because I was a gay person in the media.

379
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,890
And when I came out last year it was like,
it was like silent.

380
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,830
So what does that really tell
you about these organizations?

381
00:20:39,831 --> 00:20:43,250
And sorta like glad and these other
organizations that they're there for gay

382
00:20:43,251 --> 00:20:45,440
people,
they're supposed to be for gay people and,

383
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,010
and if they subscribe to
intersectionality, they should be

384
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,810
for black people.
And the rest of it.

385
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:54,010
But you're saying you were in that they
loved you. You come out as conservative.

386
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,640
We're done with you would,
it tells me is number one,

387
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:02,500
that these organizations are not
for all Lgbtq people. Therefore,

388
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:06,920
Lgbtq, um, democrats, first of all,
these are leftist organization.

389
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,550
People really need to understand this.
I know I say it all the time,

390
00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:13,960
but like I think that because people
just think glad is for gay people.

391
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:18,100
This is for this per, and it's like, no,
that's not really what's going on here.

392
00:21:18,101 --> 00:21:22,570
But it really takes work to get people
to fully understand why that is true.

393
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:26,080
And there used to be, and we talked about
this a little bit before we started,

394
00:21:26,081 --> 00:21:27,070
before we started filming,

395
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:31,900
there used to be a part of me that wanted
nothing more than to be kind of like a

396
00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:34,780
gay celebrity in life. Oh, I get to go,

397
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:39,670
I get to go to the glad media awards and
I get to go to the HRC red carpets and

398
00:21:39,671 --> 00:21:40,660
I get to,
to be,

399
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:45,870
and now I realize that what I'm doing
right now is so much bigger than any of

400
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:51,850
that stuff. And I'm not, I'm
doing this not for fame or,

401
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:56,020
because the concept of fame has been
very strange to me and in grappling with,

402
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,700
with this newfound attention.

403
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,200
But it's not about being with some delist.

404
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:05,080
I'm gay celebrities on the red carpet.
It's certainly not about being with,

405
00:22:05,081 --> 00:22:06,310
even though I love the way,

406
00:22:06,311 --> 00:22:08,140
usually the ones that they're
putting on the red carpet,

407
00:22:08,141 --> 00:22:10,010
they're not even gay half the time.
Oh yeah.

408
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,540
I told you I used to do these red carpets
when I had a show on our Q and I was,

409
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,590
so I was interviewing people.

410
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:18,070
I was on the other side of the red carpet
and mostly it was just housewives of

411
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,240
New York drunk. These drunk
plastic women that are like, ah,

412
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:23,170
I'll have them gave,

413
00:22:23,171 --> 00:22:26,380
let me tell you something and I can
tell you a story and she will remain

414
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:30,850
nameless. But I was actually at, Huh? Oh,

415
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:32,140
I can tell you the name
of it, so yeah. Yeah.

416
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,170
But I was on one of these award shows
and this was obviously before I came out

417
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:38,660
when I was still getting
invited and this person was H's,

418
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,070
a drunken sloppy mess.
And I'm just like,

419
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:45,910
how is this celebrating gay people?
How is this elevating us?

420
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:50,440
And so what you have is
with the glads of the world,

421
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,610
this is about bullying
Hollywood celebrities in the
thinking that you know what,

422
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:57,220
if you don't, if you don't show
up to our red carpet events,

423
00:22:57,221 --> 00:23:01,500
you're not supporting, you know, the
Lgbtq community. So that's what, what,

424
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,460
what that's all about.
Um,

425
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:08,260
the HRC is obviously of leftist
organization like very much so I left this

426
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:13,090
organization and what irritates me
about this entire thing is that these

427
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:16,450
organizations were not started
as leftist organizations.

428
00:23:16,451 --> 00:23:18,400
They weren't supposed to be left as well.

429
00:23:18,401 --> 00:23:20,650
Cause at that time they
wanted real equality.

430
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,240
You didn't want it to
quality under the law.

431
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,850
They wanted the things
that we have right now.

432
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,700
But to continue to get funding,

433
00:23:27,701 --> 00:23:30,940
to continue to be data centers
for the Democratic Party,

434
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,150
they have to go with
whatever far left craziness.

435
00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:36,930
And it's the intersectionality cold.
And it's,

436
00:23:36,931 --> 00:23:41,931
it's being lectured by a queer Muslim
at the glad media where it's about how

437
00:23:42,191 --> 00:23:46,970
gays aren't inclusive enough for, for
Islam and, and about, you know, how you,

438
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
how the LGBT community needs to accept
undocumented people who are just like all

439
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:56,120
this stuff that was never,
it's never what our movement was about.

440
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,990
And at the same time for me as a gay man,
I know that um,

441
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,050
HIV aids rates among young black
gay men are still exploding. Um,

442
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:08,360
we have a huge problem with meth.
There's real stuff's still going on.

443
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,490
So what should they have done then?

444
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,340
Was there a moment that there
should've been a course correction?

445
00:24:13,341 --> 00:24:16,500
So say gay marriage gets passed
on. Ask. Don't tell is yeah.

446
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,640
What do you think the organization's, if
they had done it right? I mean, is it,

447
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:22,580
is it, do they close up shop? Do
they well, that's what I think.

448
00:24:22,581 --> 00:24:24,320
That's what they were afraid of.
They were afraid of.

449
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:28,130
Now that we have this quote unquote true
equality that the close up shop Chris,

450
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,320
Chris rock that had been
one of his great lines,

451
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:32,660
the cops need a certain
amount of crime. Yeah. Yeah.

452
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:36,950
And I think that would happen after,
don't ask,

453
00:24:36,951 --> 00:24:41,951
don't tell repeal a marriage equality
were two of the biggest gay rights wins of

454
00:24:43,401 --> 00:24:47,150
our generation. Like I think of our
lifetime. And after that happened,

455
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:50,030
I think that they just needed something
else. They needed some more funding,

456
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:53,930
they needed to,
to continue to be relevant.

457
00:24:53,931 --> 00:24:58,510
So they'd gone into all of this
intersectionality far left insanity.

458
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:03,810
And what I see from being so open and
being a gay conservative out here is that

459
00:25:04,191 --> 00:25:09,191
there is a large group of gays and
lesbians that are conservative that want

460
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:12,230
nothing to do with the leftist nonsense.

461
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:15,170
They don't want to vote with
their sexual orientation.

462
00:25:15,171 --> 00:25:19,550
They want to vote for their values,
they want to vote with their pocket books.

463
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,300
You know, they, they, they want to vote
based on who they are. So you're saying,

464
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,560
let me get this straight.
Gay people are just like everybody else.

465
00:25:26,561 --> 00:25:29,740
Just like everybody else stayed.
Just like everybody's getting just crazy,

466
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,580
right nuts in the same.

467
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,850
And you'd think so where are, where
are the, the right gay organizations.

468
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,010
Are there any,
I mean like the log cabin Republicans,

469
00:25:40,011 --> 00:25:41,810
are there anybody that you're
out there and you're like, oh,

470
00:25:41,811 --> 00:25:46,040
you guys are doing some good
grassroots related to the eye issues.

471
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:47,810
It's always,

472
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:52,190
it's never going to be the HRCS
and the glads of the world.

473
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:56,000
It's always the grassroots
organizations. It's your, your,

474
00:25:56,001 --> 00:26:00,050
your um, Columbus pride. You know, it's,

475
00:26:00,051 --> 00:26:02,390
you're the Brooklyn
Community Pride Center.

476
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,220
It's like these are the organizations
that are money really needs to go to

477
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:12,460
because these organizations are doing
work on the ground to like give young LGBT

478
00:26:12,681 --> 00:26:17,681
people access to jobs and education and
all the stuff that the glads and the HRC

479
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:20,810
is of the world claim
that they're fighting for.

480
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,130
But really they're just paying
a lot of big wigs, sick,

481
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:28,640
like insane six figure salaries and,
and trying to get Madonna on a red carpet.

482
00:26:28,641 --> 00:26:32,090
And God loved Madonna. We don't love
Madonna, but that's not the word.

483
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:37,170
So I always try to elevate the smaller
organizations because they need the time

484
00:26:38,061 --> 00:26:40,100
and the money more than the big ones.
For the record,

485
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:42,440
I'm more of a Tina Turner guy.
You Remember Tina Turner?

486
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,540
I hear she gives an amazing show.
I haven't been yet. I've never,

487
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,390
well I don't think she's
going live anymore.

488
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,860
I think she's done tore
and I think she like,

489
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,660
she moved to like Sweden or something.

490
00:26:51,661 --> 00:26:56,340
I think she gave up her us citizenship
and she's just riding it out and man. Ah,

491
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,310
but um, I, I would, I will say about
Madonna. The gays are going to kill me.

492
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:03,610
I saw her one time and it wasn't
great. I saw her once. New York, uh,

493
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:07,860
confessions, confessions on the dance
floor. It wasn't, it was Mbna oh,

494
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:11,250
that's the one. Yeah. That was
the whole dance album, right?

495
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,480
We know confessions was the dance out.
Okay.

496
00:27:13,481 --> 00:27:18,010
So that day was like in 2012 I think
that was odd. Mtma when I went to the,

497
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,210
you went, that's okay. I paid a
lot of money for those tickets.

498
00:27:21,211 --> 00:27:23,360
We were at Madison Square
Garden somewhere out in jars.

499
00:27:23,361 --> 00:27:24,270
I was at Madison Square Garden,

500
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:28,550
I was way up there in the rafters
and I was just like, yeah, yeah,

501
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:31,920
I'll wait until I'll wait until they're
at the Farewell Vegas tour where she

502
00:27:31,921 --> 00:27:34,770
finally does all the things
that people want to hear.
Right, right. Well, age wise,

503
00:27:34,771 --> 00:27:37,800
she's, she's getting there. Yeah.
But you know, she keeps it together.

504
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,380
She keeps it together. She does.
She does. All right. Let's, uh,

505
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,210
let's talk a little bit about,

506
00:27:42,211 --> 00:27:45,750
I've heard candidates talk about
how most black people actually are

507
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:46,590
conservatives,

508
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:51,480
but they sort of don't know it or they
can't accept it because of the way the

509
00:27:51,481 --> 00:27:53,190
media has treated black people.

510
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:57,600
That the default position is you must
be a democrat. Yeah. Do you sense that,

511
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,510
I sensed that.
And to get into that,

512
00:28:00,511 --> 00:28:05,511
you really have to understand how deeply
entrenched this idea that black people

513
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:09,680
have to be Democrats is. And,
and I said this a little bit, uh,

514
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,100
on the vice thing that I did,

515
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:15,960
we have black celebrities,
entertainers,

516
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,890
ball players,

517
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:21,160
athletes from the top of
the charts to the answer,

518
00:28:21,161 --> 00:28:23,640
the thought with 10,000 followers.

519
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,910
These are all people that are
pushing leftists. You know,

520
00:28:26,911 --> 00:28:30,810
they are pushing leftists
tactics and black people.

521
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:34,170
We more so than I think other races.

522
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:38,490
We look for representation in media
and we look for representation and pop

523
00:28:38,491 --> 00:28:42,300
culture and these are our heroes. These
are the people that we want to be like.

524
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:46,920
And that's one of the reasons why this
idea that we have to be on the left is so

525
00:28:46,921 --> 00:28:51,420
firmly entrenched. So why,
why do you think that is
looking for sort of elsewhere,

526
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,050
do you think that has something to do
with the black family and some of the

527
00:28:55,051 --> 00:28:57,620
stuff that Larry elder would talk about?
It has everything to do with,

528
00:28:57,621 --> 00:29:00,060
with Larry elders talking about
literally odor will tell you,

529
00:29:00,061 --> 00:29:03,780
and I'm pretty sure he did that.
The number one kicked the shit out of me.

530
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,620
That's what woke me up.
Yeah.

531
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,960
But leary elder will tell you that the
number one problem in the black community

532
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:13,800
is black poppin listeners, right?
That we don't have men in the homes.

533
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:17,370
And so when there's not a man in the home,
when there's not a man to,

534
00:29:17,371 --> 00:29:21,420
to raise that young man in the home,
they look to athletes, ball players,

535
00:29:21,421 --> 00:29:25,980
the Collin, Kaepernick's, whoever.
And so when Colin Kaepernick,

536
00:29:25,981 --> 00:29:27,210
just to give an example,

537
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:32,330
if some kids he wrote right and he sees
Colin Kaepernick taking a knee for black

538
00:29:32,701 --> 00:29:33,600
lives matter,

539
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:37,380
and that's where he's getting his politics
from because that kid doesn't know

540
00:29:37,381 --> 00:29:38,100
who I am.

541
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,710
They can certainly doesn't know who Larry
elder is and the fact that kid is not

542
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:44,830
gonna know who Larry elder is is a shame.
You know what I mean?

543
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,050
And so that's the message that we get.

544
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,580
Even though black people do tend to
be a little bit more conservative,

545
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,510
just in terms of if you,
for example,

546
00:29:55,511 --> 00:29:59,620
said that black people need fathers in
the home and we need to stop having kids

547
00:29:59,621 --> 00:30:02,950
out of wedlock and we need to start doing
all of these things that will elevate

548
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:07,450
ourselves. You're a racist. I would say.
I would say everyone, regardless of race,

549
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,820
should have those things to
the best of their ability.

550
00:30:09,821 --> 00:30:11,410
Not to say it can't happen otherwise.

551
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,480
You just said you were
raised by your mother.

552
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:17,650
I want to do turned out pretty good.
[inaudible] those outlier cases. Yeah.

553
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,660
But at the same time I was,

554
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:23,230
I went to military for five years
and so the military taught me,

555
00:30:23,231 --> 00:30:26,800
the military gave me a male influence.
Um, multiple male influences.

556
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,800
The military taught me how to be a man.
The military taught me discipline.

557
00:30:29,801 --> 00:30:32,470
The military taught me courage and
military taught me self control.

558
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,940
The military taught me reliance,

559
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:38,470
all of the things that a father
is supposed to teach you.

560
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,690
And so now me as a,
as a gay black man saying these things,

561
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,870
you know, if you're a white
person, you know, you're
white supremacist or whatever.

562
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:51,160
But I'm sorry about that, you know? Yeah.
I'm, I'm the COO and I'm the uncle Tom,

563
00:30:51,161 --> 00:30:51,994
I'm whatever.

564
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,240
And there is this very huge movement of
like very far left gay black men who it

565
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:06,040
seems like they have these large online
platforms and it seems like their entire

566
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:11,041
goal in life is to just tear down straight
black man or tear down the idea of

567
00:31:11,441 --> 00:31:16,441
masculinity or tear down the idea that
our boys need men in the homes to teach

568
00:31:16,631 --> 00:31:18,910
them how to be men.
So they want to tear that down.

569
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:22,810
And when I look at their platforms and
I look at the things that they say,

570
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:26,620
and sometimes they come after me and I
ignore it because none of those people

571
00:31:26,621 --> 00:31:27,454
are my enemy.

572
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,760
There is nobody that is out there that's
a public figure that looks like me.

573
00:31:30,761 --> 00:31:33,670
That is not my enemy, that is my,
these people are not my enemy.

574
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:39,130
But when I look at the
platform that they have, I say,

575
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:41,290
you have so many people listening to you.

576
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:44,200
Why are you always preaching
divisiveness and hatred?

577
00:31:44,201 --> 00:31:48,130
Why are you trying to tear down black men?
We should be lifting each other up.

578
00:31:48,131 --> 00:31:52,270
We should be empowering each other because
you know our community meets. Yeah.

579
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,530
Well, it seems to me that mostly, and
it's not just with say those black men,

580
00:31:56,531 --> 00:31:59,890
but anyone that buys in
to the far left ideology,

581
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:04,300
they want conformity and they, there
is some sort of, as I say all the time,

582
00:32:04,301 --> 00:32:06,010
Peter Boghossian,
he's been on the show many times,

583
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:11,170
calls this postmodern ideology a secular
religion and they don't want a pasta

584
00:32:11,171 --> 00:32:13,840
date and they especially don't want
to pass states that look like you.

585
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:18,250
That's crazy. I've never, I've
never really heard that. I mean,

586
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,770
I've talked about that idea
and some of my lectures,

587
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:23,560
but I've never heard it say quite
like that because this is my thing.

588
00:32:23,561 --> 00:32:27,660
And one of the best things that happened
for me over the past year is that I

589
00:32:27,661 --> 00:32:31,240
found religion and I found
God because I will tell you,

590
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:35,230
and you probably know there and I don't
know, I don't know what your religion is,

591
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,650
but for me there's a lot of people
that are running after Twitter,

592
00:32:39,651 --> 00:32:43,520
followers and fans and Instagram followers
and fame and money and all this other

593
00:32:43,521 --> 00:32:45,530
stuff and not,

594
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:49,280
there's not an amount of Twitter followers
or fame or any of that stuff that is

595
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:52,160
going to fill that hole
that you're looking to fill.

596
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:56,950
And Twitter followers don't feel
the existential void things out.

597
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:00,650
What you telling me you do not the black
hole of existence you've got filled by

598
00:33:00,651 --> 00:33:05,590
Instagram line is nodding. You've got
like 10 times my following. And when,

599
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,230
when things started taking off a
little bit last year, like when,

600
00:33:09,231 --> 00:33:12,980
when my life started getting
bigger in some other ways,

601
00:33:12,981 --> 00:33:17,680
I had to make things smaller. Um,
and so I made my circle smaller and,

602
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:19,880
and I tried to get close with
my husband and my best friends,

603
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:23,920
but I also found God. And it is when
you not religious before, were you not,

604
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:27,170
were you, were you specifically not a
believer before? No, not at, not at all.

605
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:31,820
I was raised in the church
African Methodist Episcopal.
Um, so the AME church,

606
00:33:31,821 --> 00:33:36,110
like I was there. And when you're young
and black in the church churches a full,

607
00:33:36,111 --> 00:33:37,220
like an all day event,

608
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:40,370
I'm there at 10:00 AM for Sunday school
and then you do the service and then

609
00:33:40,371 --> 00:33:42,980
it's two 30 dinner. You're like, you're
not out of there until after dark.

610
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:48,020
But I think that in my first 11 years in
the city when I was kind of doing some

611
00:33:48,021 --> 00:33:50,780
of the, don't ask them until
activism and trying to find my path,

612
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,750
I was looking for fulfillment in all
of those things that I told you before.

613
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,530
And when I started getting those things,

614
00:34:00,531 --> 00:34:02,690
I realized that not that it wasn't enough,

615
00:34:02,691 --> 00:34:04,580
but there needs to be
something else to ground me.

616
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,880
And one of the biggest things that the
super far left tells young gay people is

617
00:34:11,061 --> 00:34:14,300
that God is your enemy and
Christians are your enemy.

618
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:17,750
And Evangelical Christians want to put
you in conversion campaign and just all

619
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:22,751
of this crazy stuff to separate them
from relation so that this far left

620
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:29,030
ideology becomes their religion.
And I say that,

621
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,100
you know,
God is a gift in my life right now.

622
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:35,840
And I say that and I'm not embarrassed
by that anymore and I don't feel like

623
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:38,960
that's something that I should be ashamed
to talk about. Even as a, as a gay man.

624
00:34:38,961 --> 00:34:43,640
Somebody described me on, on Twitter
when I think it's funny and they said,

625
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,503
um,

626
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:49,570
former military leftist turn right
wing Bible thumping from tarred.

627
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,830
And I thought that, that a lot of
words, a lot of where it was hysterical.

628
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:59,360
I showed that to my husband.
We both cackled I don't
hear you Bible. Nothing. No,

629
00:34:59,361 --> 00:35:03,680
I mean I'm not, you may, maybe a Trump
card and I, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah.

630
00:35:03,681 --> 00:35:06,500
Right wing Trump tart. I
don't Bible thump. I just,

631
00:35:06,501 --> 00:35:11,501
I talk that I talk about religion in my
life and how it's grounded me and how

632
00:35:11,961 --> 00:35:16,961
it's become just a really powerful guiding
force and it is fulfilling and it is

633
00:35:18,771 --> 00:35:22,040
grounding in a way that, let me tell
you something as a young gay man, like,

634
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:25,070
like all the sex, all the
partying, all that stuff,

635
00:35:25,071 --> 00:35:29,120
like I did it all and there's,
there's nothing in that.

636
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:32,930
And for me it is becoming
grounded in religion and God.

637
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,620
Do you think a lot of gay people have
like an extra struggle when it comes to

638
00:35:36,621 --> 00:35:38,040
sort of be questions?

639
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,930
Cause I know I definitely did like that.

640
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:45,210
You are something that society tells
you at least, you know, how old are you?

641
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,910
How old are you?
I am I allowed to ask how old you are.

642
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,240
I just get to the one
question that I get it.

643
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:56,930
I'm in my thirties you're in your
thirties wow. Wow. Yeah. All right.

644
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:01,270
So that's how it is. Well I as an elder,
I am 42 years. Okay. So, you know,

645
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:05,100
when I was in say high school and college,
you know, this way before gay marriage,

646
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,470
you know, during don't ask, don't tell,

647
00:36:07,471 --> 00:36:11,470
and I never really saw sort
of a functional future. I,

648
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,920
it's not that I saw at dysfunctional
future, I just saw no future.

649
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:16,710
I was just like, I'm now and I'm
just going to keep living now.

650
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,600
So something like that.
Um,

651
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,870
but I do think for a lot of gay
people that causes like this weird

652
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,370
belief schism or something like that.

653
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:29,400
So it's interesting to hear that just in
the last year you've come back to some

654
00:36:29,401 --> 00:36:31,860
of this stuff and I think a
lot of people have, by the way,

655
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:36,840
they are in, in, in I want them to,
and it's like, so we, we tell the,

656
00:36:36,841 --> 00:36:37,671
I guess I don't,

657
00:36:37,671 --> 00:36:40,480
I don't want to say right wingers anymore
because I guess I'm a right winger now,

658
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:43,200
but they always say that,
you know,

659
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:47,040
you can't call gay lifestyle because it's
my sexual orientation as a lifestyle.

660
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:50,740
But there are elements of it that
are very lifestyle oriented. The,

661
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:53,490
the party lifestyle, the circuit
party culture, the gay culture.

662
00:36:53,491 --> 00:36:57,180
Like all of that other stuff. Um, I
don't like any of that stuff. Yeah.

663
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:00,470
I like the golden girls who
doesn't like the golden girls.

664
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,550
I love like gay enough for me.
You know what I mean?

665
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:04,710
I watched three hours of the golden girls
on a Sunday morning. I'm very happy.

666
00:37:04,711 --> 00:37:09,711
But the cool thing right now is that
people like you and people like me can

667
00:37:09,931 --> 00:37:14,931
reach these young people and they can
see something that is outside of all of

668
00:37:15,721 --> 00:37:20,070
that messiness. And I come to it
is not somebody that judges it,

669
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:24,150
but if somebody that did it all now,
I never did drugs. That was never,

670
00:37:24,151 --> 00:37:26,340
I was never a druggie.
I don't even like smoking weed.

671
00:37:26,341 --> 00:37:29,370
They say that people that are better,

672
00:37:29,371 --> 00:37:31,500
a little neurotic and
I'm a little neurotic.

673
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:34,290
They say we doesn't go well with
us and it doesn't go well with me,

674
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,400
so I never did the drugs.
Yeah.

675
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,150
Yeah. I haven't found the right
[inaudible] good, but I get it.

676
00:37:37,151 --> 00:37:38,070
You're a conservative now.

677
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,530
Yeah. No, it's not even that because
some them, and it's really funny,

678
00:37:41,531 --> 00:37:44,200
I'm like to the right of some
people in marijuana legalization,

679
00:37:44,201 --> 00:37:47,840
but that's a whole nother issue.
We can go there, but yeah, good.

680
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,620
But I did all the partying.

681
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:55,210
I did all of the circuit parties and I
traveled and kissing boys and having lots

682
00:37:55,211 --> 00:37:55,481
of sex.

683
00:37:55,481 --> 00:38:00,070
It's like I did all that
and I fundamentally know
that there's nothing there.

684
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:05,080
And I think that the problem with
reaching these kids right now is that I am

685
00:38:05,081 --> 00:38:05,780
like,

686
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:10,780
it feels lonely because it really does
feel like I'm one of maybe three or four

687
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:14,950
people that like have these large
platforms and obviously you as well,

688
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,970
but they see people that are like,
you know,

689
00:38:18,971 --> 00:38:22,120
they see the drag queens and the Hollywood
celebrities and all that other stuff.

690
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:26,830
I just really want these kids to see
that they can have a more grounded life.

691
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:30,880
And not that I'm trying to be anybody's
role model in a way because I'm like,

692
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,670
my thing is I did all the mess.
So you don't have to.

693
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,980
Yeah, I feel very, even
though I didn't do the math,

694
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,590
I mean I did do my own mess in
a way. Yeah. Like, and I did,

695
00:38:38,591 --> 00:38:42,040
I did do the drugs and I did do all that.
But I wasn't really into the scene,

696
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:43,810
let's say.
But I do feel that too.

697
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:48,650
I'm not trying to be anyone's role
model at all. 100% not failure.

698
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,010
Yeah. And I lived through, if anything,

699
00:38:51,011 --> 00:38:55,330
I would say I lived through
shit to get to where I am.

700
00:38:55,331 --> 00:39:00,331
So that hopefully the next that that
gay kid that's 18 doesn't have to do it.

701
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,150
You know what I mean? And yeah, we're
living right. Cause everyone's got shit.

702
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,050
We're on the right.

703
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:07,810
And the people that came before me
lived through far more than that.

704
00:39:07,811 --> 00:39:12,811
So there's an interesting parallel here
with the way Hollywood treats all of

705
00:39:12,911 --> 00:39:15,460
this. Because you mentioned something
about, or just a moment ago,

706
00:39:15,461 --> 00:39:16,850
you mentioned how,
uh,

707
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:21,610
the black culture puts more emphasis
on Hollywood and these figures and

708
00:39:21,611 --> 00:39:22,630
everything.
And I was thinking like,

709
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:27,220
even just in the Oscars last year that
Black Panther was nominated for an Oscar.

710
00:39:27,221 --> 00:39:28,570
Now I've seen every,

711
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:31,210
so I think we're going to have a
little difference here because I,

712
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:34,880
I've seen every marvel movie I just saw
I end game a couple of days ago, uh,

713
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,730
as what's going to make me
go see it at this weekend.

714
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,880
I don't want to say anything right now,
but um,

715
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,880
but I've seen every one of the movies. I
love superhero movies. I Love Star Wars,

716
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,940
love all that stuff. Black Panther was
a very average movie there. There was,

717
00:39:45,941 --> 00:39:48,120
in my opinion,
there was nothing racist.

718
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:51,320
Same for same racist.

719
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,460
Well guess what? Why are you all of you
said it too, but he's a self hating.

720
00:39:54,461 --> 00:39:57,520
Black guys just can't win here button.
But my point is,

721
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:00,250
but it was within the
scheme of superhero movies,

722
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,460
none of them get nominated
for anything and that's fine.

723
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,270
But it was very average.
It in my opinion,

724
00:40:06,271 --> 00:40:08,920
it was just a very average movie and it
got nominated for all these things and I

725
00:40:08,921 --> 00:40:12,490
saw the media was like, ah, see
Black Panther. Got It. Like,

726
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:17,120
like it was some major wins that would
somehow make people more equal or feel

727
00:40:17,121 --> 00:40:20,380
better. Or now we can look at the
numbers and go this many black films,

728
00:40:20,381 --> 00:40:22,660
this and this many white is.
And I was like,

729
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:27,820
it just seems to me that the aim is just
so off of where you should go for the

730
00:40:27,821 --> 00:40:29,020
price,
the real price.

731
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:32,740
No, and I agree with you on that personal,
I love Black Panther. I really do.

732
00:40:32,741 --> 00:40:33,574
Like I'm a,
I'm a huge,

733
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:35,820
yeah, no, it's perfectly fine.

734
00:40:35,821 --> 00:40:39,290
But you got an Oscar Award
winning nominated for that.

735
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:44,580
She make a really good point in minority
communities and specifically the two

736
00:40:45,461 --> 00:40:48,910
groups that I'm a part of,
blacks and, and, and gay people.

737
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:54,180
We always look for representation in
the media as some sort of barometer of

738
00:40:55,061 --> 00:40:59,740
progress. And that's a trap. It's a huge,

739
00:40:59,741 --> 00:41:02,470
it's a big Tridell Chinese people do it.
Yeah.

740
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,330
Because they're focused on making money.

741
00:41:04,331 --> 00:41:08,350
And when I tell him and I'm all about it,
and when I go give these lectures,

742
00:41:08,351 --> 00:41:13,351
and I told people that the biggest way
for any group of people to achieve any

743
00:41:13,931 --> 00:41:16,270
kind of power is financially.

744
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:19,690
It is not through Oscar nominations.

745
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:23,680
And that stuff is great and it's amazing,
but it's,

746
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:24,820
it's kind of like these,

747
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:29,920
these are false idols because Black
Panther is great for visual representation

748
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:31,690
and it's great that all
those people on the stage,

749
00:41:31,691 --> 00:41:33,340
and I personally think this amazing movie,

750
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,940
but what that does for the young black
kid that's struggling in the high school

751
00:41:37,941 --> 00:41:42,740
that I went to right now, not
much. Not much. Right. Um, and,

752
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,730
and we do it as gays and
lesbians as well. If, you know,

753
00:41:46,731 --> 00:41:49,820
if somebody comes out and look
at the, look at the, the, the,

754
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:52,170
the Buddha judge thing
right now. Yeah. Um,

755
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,140
look at how people in this
is somebody that is, I mean,

756
00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:01,500
I'm not a Buddhist meditator at all,
but I, it seems to me, you know, I,

757
00:42:01,501 --> 00:42:02,151
I see the game,

758
00:42:02,151 --> 00:42:05,460
I see what's going on and I see the way
that he picked the fight with pence to,

759
00:42:05,461 --> 00:42:08,900
to ingratiate himself to the far left
though. Use it. Like, I get it, I see it.

760
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,150
But just the idea that any power
comes from media representation,

761
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,370
it's,
it's false hope.

762
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:21,700
It also separates the people
from what should be the end goal.

763
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:26,210
Because I think that empowerment for any
of our communities only comes through

764
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:30,620
entrepreneurship. Look at this, look at
that. That is your name. On that sign,

765
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:32,300
you are an entrepreneur.

766
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:37,720
And if somebody had given me the message
about entrepreneurship when I was 1718

767
00:42:38,151 --> 00:42:40,490
1920 God knows where I'd be by now.

768
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,730
And one of the biggest things that
I've gotten out of out of become a

769
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:48,260
conservative and kind of moving
over to the right is the fact that

770
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:52,760
entrepreneurship and capitalism
is not a bad thing in my,

771
00:42:52,761 --> 00:42:56,060
both of our communities need more of it,
but especially my black community,

772
00:42:56,061 --> 00:42:59,300
we need more entrepreneurship.
We need more job creators.

773
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:04,220
We need to stop looking for
representation in the media to, to,

774
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:07,280
to elevate ourselves or to make
us feel good about ourselves.

775
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:11,280
So when you see then the Democrats, so
just in the last couple of weeks, yeah,

776
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:14,580
there's now this debate suddenly
about reparations and I,

777
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:19,020
I saw the video of Senator Elizabeth
Warren talking about reparations and she's

778
00:43:19,021 --> 00:43:22,710
going to commission a panel about
reparations. And my first thought,

779
00:43:22,711 --> 00:43:25,740
the first thing that just popped into
my head as I was watching it was,

780
00:43:25,741 --> 00:43:27,000
holy shit,

781
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,420
Candice did it.

782
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:31,750
You know what I mean? Like
whatever anyone thinks it. Candace,

783
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:36,780
she created enough of a crack in that
layer that that caused black people to

784
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:42,790
either be completely afraid of saying
they're conservatives are just,

785
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:46,930
just say that they're not Democrats.
Yeah. That now the Democrats are like,

786
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,010
Oh shit, what do we got left?
Here's money. Could you take,

787
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:52,760
yeah, I bet some money in the
words of the Great Candice Owens,

788
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,170
fear in handouts is what they have
to offer black people this cycle,

789
00:43:57,171 --> 00:43:59,600
and it is no mistake,
first of all,

790
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:04,010
that Donald Trump got more
African American votes in
the two previous Republican

791
00:44:04,011 --> 00:44:06,470
nominees combined.
That is just the fact,

792
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,350
and it is no mistake that you know what?

793
00:44:09,351 --> 00:44:12,440
You know people say a lot about the
black set movement and they say it's not

794
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,340
real.
It's not that.

795
00:44:13,341 --> 00:44:17,960
And what I tell people is that you're
going to see Republicans make a bigger

796
00:44:17,961 --> 00:44:21,170
play for the black vote than
you had ever seen before.

797
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:22,850
I think in the history of this country,

798
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,710
and it's not going to come
through fear and handouts,

799
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:27,800
it's gonna come from talking to the people
that are the real job creators in the

800
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:32,370
real entrepreneurs and saying that
these policies will help you create.

801
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:37,670
And the fact that reparations is even
a conversation right now among the

802
00:44:38,431 --> 00:44:43,030
Democrats means that they're scared.
Um, I, I just did a video for,

803
00:44:43,031 --> 00:44:46,680
for turning point about reparations and,
and not to spoil any of that,

804
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:51,860
but none other than Bayard Rustin who
is one of the architects of the march on

805
00:44:52,381 --> 00:44:52,981
Washington,

806
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:57,390
a huge civil rights leader who by
the way was black and gay in the 60s.

807
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:02,780
They interviewed Baird Rustin about
reparations in 1969 and he said,

808
00:45:02,851 --> 00:45:07,140
it's, he said, this idea is ridiculous.
And the quote is something like,

809
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:09,930
if my great, great grandfather, you know,

810
00:45:09,931 --> 00:45:12,600
picked cotton than
reparations are owed to him,

811
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:15,350
but he's dead and nobody owes me anything.
Yeah.

812
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:17,310
But this is how they're going
to try to buy the black vote.

813
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:21,960
It's also just a crazy way of
dividing this. Yes. Each other.

814
00:45:21,961 --> 00:45:26,961
I was at a cousin's wedding on my
husband's side this past weekend and uh,

815
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:30,090
was with the young guy who's 21,

816
00:45:30,091 --> 00:45:33,180
22 and he was telling me about
how woke it is in college.

817
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,690
Now this is this a kid who grew up,
his mother died when he was very young.

818
00:45:36,691 --> 00:45:40,860
He grew up, he had no money,
bunch of different homes, uh,

819
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,050
all sorts of crazy history in the family.

820
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:48,440
And it's like the idea that this kid has
privileged because he's white and we're

821
00:45:48,571 --> 00:45:52,230
going to take from him. I mean that's in
essence, that's what he was saying like,

822
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,880
and it wasn't specifically
about reparations,

823
00:45:53,881 --> 00:45:58,881
but just this idea that this kid is
somehow guilty or somehow privilege just

824
00:45:59,011 --> 00:46:02,520
because of the skin color, having nothing
to do everything. He's lived through it.

825
00:46:02,521 --> 00:46:04,830
But that's what they're pushing
on everybody. I mean, you know,

826
00:46:04,831 --> 00:46:09,060
that's what they're pushing
and, and there's not a lot
of pushback to that idea.

827
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:14,061
And I just feel that there's a correction
going on right now and there's a

828
00:46:14,191 --> 00:46:18,120
correction because you're seeing a lot
more conservatives that are younger and

829
00:46:18,121 --> 00:46:22,000
browner and whatever. And there's a really
different movement right now. And the,

830
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:25,800
the, the leftist, it's like, I
call it the intersectionality Colt.

831
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:30,450
The intersectionality Colt will eat itself
because there's all these things that

832
00:46:30,451 --> 00:46:33,800
you cannot stay on the left right now.
And there's somebody who,

833
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:36,070
I'm not going to name, but
this is, this person is,

834
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:40,080
it has a platform as a feminist, right?
And this is a male feminist. And I'm like,

835
00:46:40,081 --> 00:46:41,550
great, you know, do what you gotta do,

836
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
but don't call me Trans phobic for
defending women's sports or women's spaces

837
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:51,600
or,
or lesbians who are now,

838
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:56,310
who now feel pressured into having
relationships with transgender women. Um,

839
00:46:56,311 --> 00:47:00,090
when, when you call yourself a feminist
and you're not standing up for,

840
00:47:00,091 --> 00:47:03,330
for lesbians. And I standing up for
women in that way, I, I, you know,

841
00:47:03,331 --> 00:47:06,720
you call me whatever you want to call
me, but I'm, I'm always going to,

842
00:47:06,721 --> 00:47:10,920
to stand up for, for lesbians to stand up
for women in that way. But like I said,

843
00:47:10,921 --> 00:47:13,890
the intersectionality coat there,
things that they can't say, um,

844
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,280
they're things that they can't say
about radical Islam. You know when,

845
00:47:17,281 --> 00:47:21,450
when they run into a gay bar and kill
49 of us, you mood, they can't say that.

846
00:47:21,451 --> 00:47:25,110
You got Jonathan Capehart
running around talking about, oh,

847
00:47:25,111 --> 00:47:27,990
this guy was a closeted gay in this.
I was this and this guy was that.

848
00:47:27,991 --> 00:47:30,730
And I'm like,
that completely ridiculous and not true.

849
00:47:30,731 --> 00:47:32,170
And we know that that's not true now,

850
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:36,460
but the intersectionality Colt will
eat itself because there there is,

851
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:40,480
it is becoming to the point where there
are too many things that they can't say.

852
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:43,580
So people like you and I have to
say the things that they can do.

853
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:47,180
Is that doubly tough then
for you as a gay black man?

854
00:47:47,181 --> 00:47:51,830
Because the culture, if we're talking
about black culture and gay culture,

855
00:47:51,831 --> 00:47:55,170
there's so much humor richness,
their political incorrect. Yes. Yeah.

856
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:58,640
All of these things.
So for someone like you to be fed these,

857
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,250
these ideas that you've
obviously rejected now,

858
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,760
but to be fed these ideas that would
stop you from joking the way you want to

859
00:48:04,761 --> 00:48:08,330
joke or saying something politically
incorrect with the rest of it, it's like,

860
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:11,390
like I remember going when I would go to
gay bars and they would be like a drag

861
00:48:11,391 --> 00:48:14,090
queen. Now I again, I was never into it.

862
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:16,610
I thought drag queens were all bad comics.

863
00:48:16,611 --> 00:48:19,100
Like they all struck me as just
hack comics. That being said,

864
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:23,720
they would say a ton of
politically incorrect shit.
They would mock gay people.

865
00:48:23,721 --> 00:48:27,020
They, I mean they would mock everybody.
That was the point where now it's like,

866
00:48:27,021 --> 00:48:28,740
I don't know,
I don't know what's going on in the,

867
00:48:28,741 --> 00:48:31,580
in the drag queen world these days,
but it's like,

868
00:48:31,581 --> 00:48:35,590
I'm guessing it's gotten pretty bad
because they're probably really afraid to

869
00:48:35,591 --> 00:48:36,330
say,
yeah,

870
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,750
I'd be irreverent. I mean, I, I think
that right now, I mean I, I'd love drag.

871
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:42,450
I ru Paul's drag race. I'm like,
I'm all about it. You know, my,

872
00:48:42,451 --> 00:48:43,670
my husband and I are big fans.

873
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:47,840
When I voted for the, in the last
election I voted for Gary Johnson,

874
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:50,960
but I used to live in West Hollywood
so I had to go over there to, to vote.

875
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:53,480
I was standing behind
Ru Paul at the voters.

876
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:56,990
Oh, not in drag. And you
want to talk about like,

877
00:48:57,090 --> 00:49:01,500
and you want to talk about how crazy
the is. Let's talk about Ru Paul.

878
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,900
Let's talk about the crazy blue Chez.

879
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:08,830
Ray's ease on the LGBT
left coming after Rupaul.

880
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,850
Like forgive me for being gay.
Mvaa you come from mother,

881
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:18,830
you say that Ru Paul is transphobic or
she doesn't represent gains and whatever.

882
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:22,190
What was it that she said this
about a year and a half ago,

883
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:23,550
this is about a year and a half ago.

884
00:49:23,551 --> 00:49:27,990
Like ru Paul did an interview where
she says she doesn't, we're Paul. Hey,

885
00:49:27,991 --> 00:49:28,890
because we pause,
man.

886
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:33,420
Rupaul said he doesn't believe in
transgender women in drag because drag is

887
00:49:33,421 --> 00:49:37,950
supposed to be a male's elevated
and comedic idea of what a woman is.

888
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:42,000
And so they came after Ru Paul for
that. They came after. There was a,

889
00:49:42,001 --> 00:49:45,780
I'm a segment on drag race called
a sheet shemale girl, you got shit.

890
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,680
You know what I mean?

891
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,560
And so they kept the blue checks
came after Rupaul for that.

892
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:54,660
And so it's really funny when I look at
the Ru Paul situation and we'll look at

893
00:49:54,661 --> 00:49:57,500
somebody who has done more for,

894
00:49:57,501 --> 00:50:02,280
for LGBT culture than maybe anybody
walking on this earth right now.

895
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:07,700
And the fact that people are attacking
him after everything that he's done tells

896
00:50:08,521 --> 00:50:11,940
me that these people are insane,
tells me that there's not enough.

897
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:15,920
And if there's one
thing that I would need,

898
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:18,800
I don't know if this is a
critique because I, I love Rupaul.

899
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,420
And by all accounts I hear
people say that Rw is amazing.

900
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:25,840
It's that like real kind of bended bending
the knee a little bit. Oh, you know,

901
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:29,560
he apologized. We're bending
the knee a little bit. Um, um,

902
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,620
two people coming for him and I want to
get to a point where we are not bending

903
00:50:33,621 --> 00:50:34,940
the knee to the mob anymore.

904
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:40,150
They came after Ellen degenerates what
lesbian on this planet has done more for

905
00:50:41,031 --> 00:50:43,320
freaking gay and lesbian visibility.

906
00:50:43,321 --> 00:50:48,321
And an Ellen degenerates came after Ellen
just because she sat down with Kevin

907
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:53,600
Hart and Hart for having the conversation
with Kevin Hart and they came for

908
00:50:53,601 --> 00:50:55,940
Ellen.
And so this is what I say,

909
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:59,570
if they're coming for ru
Paul in Ellen degenerate,

910
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:04,520
they'll come for you and me so die.
So I will never been the knee. I was,

911
00:51:04,521 --> 00:51:05,120
um,

912
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:09,740
we were supposed to have them an LGBT
conservative panel at the LGBT center in

913
00:51:09,741 --> 00:51:13,820
New York City. Um, and when, you
know, people found out about it,

914
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:18,440
we've got excommunicated from the center
because we were all racist and all

915
00:51:18,441 --> 00:51:21,050
white and transphobic and
all of that other stuff.

916
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:24,590
And so I will never apologize
for things that I say.

917
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,570
I don't try to offend people,

918
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:30,290
but you're certainly not going to control
my tongue and I'm not going to bend

919
00:51:30,291 --> 00:51:33,470
the knee to these people.
And I'm really glad that Ellen didn't,

920
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:37,730
and I hope Rue Paul never
does again because these are
two people that have done

921
00:51:37,731 --> 00:51:39,860
more for this community
that anybody in the planet,

922
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:44,810
certainly not some blue check mark that
writes for some blog. Right? Right.

923
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:48,530
But we create this reverse or this
perverse I should say incentive structure

924
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:51,380
where it's like there's a lot of
value for those blue checkers.

925
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:54,620
We go after them cause it's like,
oh you can ruined one of the heroes.

926
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:57,380
Even if they were the ones that
paved the road for you. Wow.

927
00:51:57,381 --> 00:51:59,880
If you can build your castle
on their blood, you know,

928
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,520
car Cardi B says they do
anything for cloud cloud chasers.

929
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:08,430
That's all they're doing. And the
fundamental critique that I have with,

930
00:52:08,431 --> 00:52:13,040
with a lot of these people that the
cloud chasers is that the platforms are

931
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:16,220
always built on destruction.
It's cancel culture.

932
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:18,590
So everything is always built on.

933
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:23,600
If I build a platform of let's say
like a one hundred thousand two hundred

934
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,990
thousand three hundred thousand and my
platform is completely built on tearing

935
00:52:26,991 --> 00:52:27,824
people down,

936
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:31,010
like I'm going to go up to Dave Ruben
because he's got 10 times my following and

937
00:52:31,011 --> 00:52:33,790
he said something I don't like,
so maybe I'll get some attention for,

938
00:52:33,791 --> 00:52:37,850
for tearing him down. You
know what I mean? So if your
platform is built on that,

939
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:42,830
then you always have to look for new
things to be offended by new people to

940
00:52:42,831 --> 00:52:45,350
destroy new cloud to chase.

941
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:50,510
And I don't think that it goes anywhere.
Yeah. You know? Well, it's also sad,

942
00:52:50,511 --> 00:52:52,160
right? It's like, it's deeply sad. I mean,

943
00:52:52,161 --> 00:52:55,790
I see this with this crew going after
me all the time and I just ignore it.

944
00:52:55,791 --> 00:52:59,010
But it's like the idea that you're
waking up in the morning and go into,

945
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:01,790
where did Ruben say today so I can
get some clicks? It's like, man,

946
00:53:01,791 --> 00:53:04,320
there's so many things going on
in the world that pathetic. Yeah.

947
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:07,610
And it's like I'm not perfect and I've
made mistakes in this very room on this

948
00:53:07,611 --> 00:53:11,330
show, but it's like if you're waking up
going, this is the guy we got to go after.

949
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:17,180
I, I see more value than it says about me.
It does. And I, and I feel sorry, I just,

950
00:53:17,181 --> 00:53:21,560
I, I feel sorry for their life because
I just, there's nowhere to go from that.

951
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:26,770
And I would like to use
these opportunities that
I'm getting right now too.

952
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:31,320
I want to engage people,
but I also want to empower people.

953
00:53:31,321 --> 00:53:36,321
Like I want to empower my people
is much crap as Candice Owens gets.

954
00:53:36,691 --> 00:53:40,290
And Man, she gets the a level
that I couldn't even dream of.

955
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,590
She is a true believer.

956
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:46,080
She is really out here
trying to empower people.

957
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:50,940
She is really out here trying
to wake people up. And I um,

958
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,990
I saw a Bernay Brown special, I think
her name is Renee Brown on Netflix.

959
00:53:54,991 --> 00:53:59,400
So she's apparently enormously
huge motivational speaker
but I'd never heard of,

960
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:02,310
um, so she just got, um,
promoted to me on Netflix.

961
00:54:02,311 --> 00:54:06,660
So I decided to watch a little bit
of, of Bom special. And she said that,

962
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:09,030
and I think she,
I think this is a doodle Roosevelt quote.

963
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:14,270
She said that don't worry about critiques
that come from people who are not in

964
00:54:14,491 --> 00:54:16,860
the field,
who are not in the battle,

965
00:54:16,861 --> 00:54:20,940
who are not putting themselves out there
in some way and trying to affect change

966
00:54:20,941 --> 00:54:23,940
in some way.
And now that I've saw,

967
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:26,910
I've seen that that's how
I try to live my life.

968
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:29,010
And because you can't take
all of these critiques,

969
00:54:29,011 --> 00:54:33,780
there was a point where you can get 90%
of love from people and we'll follow

970
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:37,280
because sometimes in the person of, Hey,
you know, I was really doing stand up.

971
00:54:37,281 --> 00:54:40,070
I always remember I could be killing
like 300 people laughing hysterically.

972
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:41,990
If there's one guy look at his phone,
it's like,

973
00:54:41,991 --> 00:54:45,710
that's the guy I'm looking at that there's
a guy that was asleep in my lecture

974
00:54:45,711 --> 00:54:49,280
last night. Did you call
it out? I did. I said,

975
00:54:49,281 --> 00:54:52,400
I didn't call him up directly, but I was
like giving my speech and I was like,

976
00:54:52,401 --> 00:54:54,920
you know, and, and I think that
everybody needs to have conversations.

977
00:54:54,921 --> 00:54:59,150
Even that guy is funny. He
wake up. He did. He did.

978
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:01,640
Uh, I'm sorry we didn't
do more of this earlier,

979
00:55:01,641 --> 00:55:04,730
but tell me a little bit just about
your service having nothing to do with,

980
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,090
with all of this stuff
only. And that's, yeah,

981
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,870
just, you know, my service in general,

982
00:55:08,871 --> 00:55:13,010
I think that when I look
back at the military service,

983
00:55:13,011 --> 00:55:16,310
what I regret is that,
you know,

984
00:55:16,311 --> 00:55:19,760
people come up to you when
you're a veteran and they
thank you for your service.

985
00:55:19,761 --> 00:55:22,640
And like people call me a hero
and all that other stuff in it.

986
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:28,090
I'm always uneasy by that because I
didn't do anything particularly heroic.

987
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,890
I was a young kid.
Um,

988
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,160
just just trying to make it from
one day to the next. I mean,

989
00:55:34,161 --> 00:55:35,750
I was doing things that I believed in,

990
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:40,190
but when I look at some of these kids
that are serving right now and they're the

991
00:55:40,191 --> 00:55:43,010
same age, I was, you
know, 1920, 21 years old,

992
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:47,720
it's so much for a young
person to take on. But for me,

993
00:55:47,721 --> 00:55:50,660
when I look back at it
and it just, it, you know,

994
00:55:50,661 --> 00:55:54,710
I lost weight and it gave me
discipline and it gave me kind of that,

995
00:55:54,711 --> 00:55:57,530
that strong male influence
that was missing in my life.

996
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,360
And when I talk about my service,

997
00:55:59,361 --> 00:56:04,100
it's not so much the day to day of what
I did because it was really, you know,

998
00:56:04,101 --> 00:56:08,720
I did one tour in Kuwait, I did one
tour in Iraq right after the invasion.

999
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:12,130
Um, you connect those dots, you
can get to that age question. Yeah,

1000
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,060
yeah. [inaudible] it, yeah.
Connect the dots. It's okay.

1001
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:20,890
Um, but when I look back
to that, we were just,

1002
00:56:20,891 --> 00:56:25,000
I was just trying to do the best that I
could and everybody that I served with,

1003
00:56:25,001 --> 00:56:27,360
we were just trying to do our best and I,

1004
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:31,150
the people that are serving the military,
they are heroes from like, you know,

1005
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:33,720
from the guy who captured a Sama Bin,
Ladin indies,

1006
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:37,180
these great men that you see these
books from and all that stuff.

1007
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:41,440
But just the people that
give up three, four, five,

1008
00:56:41,441 --> 00:56:45,700
sometimes 20 and 25 years of their
life to be of service in some way.

1009
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,570
Like there is a very
heroic element to that.

1010
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:52,300
And I think that with me and my service,

1011
00:56:52,301 --> 00:56:57,301
I talk about it a lot and I talk about
loving America because it has given me so

1012
00:56:57,791 --> 00:56:58,181
much.

1013
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:03,100
Just that service has just put me onto
a path that just sitting here with you

1014
00:57:03,101 --> 00:57:07,540
right now and coming back from being
with Candice and going to events in the

1015
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:12,220
White House, like what? What were
black kid from Akron, Ohio could,

1016
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:16,570
could see that vision for himself in
the military put me on the path to doing

1017
00:57:16,571 --> 00:57:19,390
all of these things,
so I don't look at myself as heroic,

1018
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:22,660
but I look at all the people that
are serving now as as heroic.

1019
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:26,200
It's to me it's very strange. I feel like
I'm not giving you an answer, but no, no.

1020
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:31,260
It's very hard to reconcile who I am now
with who I was then and to see that as

1021
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:35,500
anything other than a scared
kid doing the best he could,

1022
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:40,180
if that makes sense. It does make sense
and that feels like a nice ending. Yeah.

1023
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:42,490
How do you feel about that?
I think that's a great ending.

1024
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:45,130
I don't know what I'm doing later,

1025
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:48,320
but there would be something if we just
showed up at the Abbey in West Holly.

1026
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:52,660
Oh my God. Are you, can we find some
other band that deplorable? Oh my God,

1027
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:54,740
we should, we should make
it happen. We should,

1028
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,910
we should make the could the conservative
gay meetup or something like that.

1029
00:57:57,911 --> 00:58:01,900
We should make it happen.
Classical liberal. Oh, that's
right. Classical liberal.

1030
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:05,410
