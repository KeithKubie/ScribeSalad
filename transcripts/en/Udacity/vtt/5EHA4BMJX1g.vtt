00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
So we talked a lot about domain and range in this lesson so far, but I want to

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.750
give you a slightly different perspective on how to visualize them, and how to

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.300
think about values of the domain through the relation of a function mapping to

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.796
values in the range. So let's say we have some function f and for three to our

00:00:17.796 --> 00:00:22.269
values a, b and c, constants not exactly sure what they are, we get outputs of

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:27.694
one, four, and five. We know that if we graph this, we would pair the

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:33.175
coordinates a and 1, b and 4, and c and 5. And what the function is really doing

00:00:33.175 --> 00:00:37.205
is taking this input value, playing with it somehow, and spitting out this

00:00:37.205 --> 00:00:41.792
output. So you could visualize this by writing out values of the domain over

00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:46.544
here, and then showing that via the function, they get paired with these values

00:00:46.544 --> 00:00:51.230
in the range. Let's say actually that for this particular function f, a, b and c

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.265
are the only values in the domain. So if the entire domain of this function is

00:00:56.265 --> 00:01:01.346
just the set a, b, c, what values are in the range? Please separate any values

00:01:01.346 --> 00:01:03.263
that are in the range by commas.
