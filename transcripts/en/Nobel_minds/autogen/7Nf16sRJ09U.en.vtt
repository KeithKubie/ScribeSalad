and do you feel that do you feel this is

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119
and do you feel that do you feel this is
 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:24.620

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.370
lab you've been trying to disentangle
the structures of those receptors for

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380
the structures of those receptors for
 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.600
the structures of those receptors for
those who've never seen one could you

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610
those who've never seen one could you
 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.969
those who've never seen one could you
describe what they look like their

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979
describe what they look like their

beauty that's really does I'm trying to

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570
beauty that's really does I'm trying to
 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.120
beauty that's really does I'm trying to
think of something in nature that I

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130
think of something in nature that I
 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.030
think of something in nature that I
could you know could use as an example

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040
could you know could use as an example
 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.810
could you know could use as an example
but there really isn't any you know any

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820
but there really isn't any you know any
 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.670
but there really isn't any you know any
thing that you encountering in a day

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680
thing that you encountering in a day
 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.800
thing that you encountering in a day
that you could say it's a good model for

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810
that you could say it's a good model for
 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.469
that you could say it's a good model for
it but to be able to see it for the

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479
it but to be able to see it for the
 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.630
it but to be able to see it for the
first time it was really amazing in

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640
first time it was really amazing in
 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.190
first time it was really amazing in
three dimensions and so that was

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200
three dimensions and so that was
 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.520
three dimensions and so that was
probably that there were there are times

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530
probably that there were there are times
 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.860
probably that there were there are times
when you see some of the structures that

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870
when you see some of the structures that
 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.880
when you see some of the structures that
we've got in particular

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890
we've got in particular
 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.770
we've got in particular
the one last year where you see

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780
the one last year where you see
 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.270
the one last year where you see
everything together and how it works

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280
everything together and how it works
 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.120
everything together and how it works
together was really you know really very

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130
together was really you know really very
 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.460
together was really you know really very
satisfying so this is the entire complex

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470
satisfying so this is the entire complex
 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.559
satisfying so this is the entire complex
together with the g-protein attached and

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569
together with the g-protein attached and
 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.410
together with the g-protein attached and
the ligand in place yeah that's an

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420
the ligand in place yeah that's an
 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.210
the ligand in place yeah that's an
amazing feat I mean it took so many

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220
amazing feat I mean it took so many
 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.600
amazing feat I mean it took so many
years to get to that point and many I

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610
years to get to that point and many I
 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.970
years to get to that point and many I
think felt that it was or an almost

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980
think felt that it was or an almost
 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.400
think felt that it was or an almost
impossible task what kept you going I

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410
impossible task what kept you going I
 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.979
impossible task what kept you going I
don't know it was just something that I

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989
don't know it was just something that I
 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.110
don't know it was just something that I
really wanted to see and I had you know

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120
really wanted to see and I had you know
 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.660
really wanted to see and I had you know
a great group of colleagues working on

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670
a great group of colleagues working on
 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.670
a great group of colleagues working on
it we were all excited about doing it

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680
it we were all excited about doing it
 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.860
it we were all excited about doing it
and you know we just kept making

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870
and you know we just kept making
 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.590
and you know we just kept making
incremental improvement in what we were

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600
incremental improvement in what we were
 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.420
incremental improvement in what we were
doing and finally we succeeded I mean

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430
doing and finally we succeeded I mean
 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.220
doing and finally we succeeded I mean
she said it was a you know it was a

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230
she said it was a you know it was a
 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.020
she said it was a you know it was a
really a group effort a lot of people

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030
really a group effort a lot of people
 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.880
really a group effort a lot of people
involved it was very very exciting

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890
involved it was very very exciting
 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.680
involved it was very very exciting
project strangers these receptors are

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690
project strangers these receptors are
 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.449
project strangers these receptors are
normally said to mediate the actions of

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459
normally said to mediate the actions of
 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.420
normally said to mediate the actions of
about half the medicines we take and yet

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430
about half the medicines we take and yet
 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.190
about half the medicines we take and yet
nobody really knows about them it's

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200
nobody really knows about them it's
 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.750
nobody really knows about them it's
amazing we're full of them and they're

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760
amazing we're full of them and they're
 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.660
amazing we're full of them and they're
so important but rather unknown yes and

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670
so important but rather unknown yes and
 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.640
so important but rather unknown yes and
we don't really know how to control them

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650
we don't really know how to control them
 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.530
we don't really know how to control them
very well yet so even you know the

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540
very well yet so even you know the
 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.479
very well yet so even you know the
medicines still aren't perfect they have

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489
medicines still aren't perfect they have
 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.449
medicines still aren't perfect they have
side effects some of these are because

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459
side effects some of these are because
 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.830
side effects some of these are because
targeting for one receptor they're still

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840
targeting for one receptor they're still
 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.539
targeting for one receptor they're still
kind of promiscuous and though they'll

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549
kind of promiscuous and though they'll
 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.600
kind of promiscuous and though they'll
bind to another type of GPCR so we still

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610
bind to another type of GPCR so we still
 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.970
bind to another type of GPCR so we still
have quite a ways to go before we can

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980
have quite a ways to go before we can
 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.500
have quite a ways to go before we can
really take advantage of what we know

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510
really take advantage of what we know
 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.949
really take advantage of what we know
about them in terms of therapeutic now

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959
about them in terms of therapeutic now

you're a notoriously self-effacing

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850
you're a notoriously self-effacing
 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.000
you're a notoriously self-effacing
person and quite a quiet person I gather

how do you feel about the prospect of

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079
how do you feel about the prospect of
 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.960
how do you feel about the prospect of
the deluge of press attention that's

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970
the deluge of press attention that's
 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.600
the deluge of press attention that's
about to arrive looking forward to that

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610
about to arrive looking forward to that
 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.880
about to arrive looking forward to that
I mean you tend to avoid the limelight

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890
I mean you tend to avoid the limelight
 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:57.350
I mean you tend to avoid the limelight
as far as I know maybe you can minimize

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360
as far as I know maybe you can minimize

characters how did the two of you mesh

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030
characters how did the two of you mesh
 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.470

together together very well in fact

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480
together together very well in fact

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.740
together a paper that our groups have
been collaborating on a project for a

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750

the first structures again how does one

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780
the first structures again how does one
 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.270
the first structures again how does one
deal with the competition element of it

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280
deal with the competition element of it
 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.790
deal with the competition element of it
I don't know that I don't know how much

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800
I don't know that I don't know how much
 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.730
I don't know that I don't know how much
it affects you you when you have a goal

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740
it affects you you when you have a goal
 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.730
it affects you you when you have a goal

scientists are sometimes as competitive
 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.379
scientists are sometimes as competitive
as professional athletes maybe but like

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389
as professional athletes maybe but like
 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.149

you can't worry about it too much or

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:08.159
you can't worry about it too much or
 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:10.430
you can't worry about it too much or
it'll distract you from your goal so and

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440
it'll distract you from your goal so and
 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.230
it'll distract you from your goal so and
I'm not sure how us what else to say

I'm not sure how us what else to say
 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.670
I'm not sure how us what else to say
about that but if you really want

about that but if you really want
 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.350
about that but if you really want
something bad enough if you're really

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360
something bad enough if you're really
 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.850
something bad enough if you're really
interested in something enough you just

beautifully to some GPCR features we

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080
beautifully to some GPCR features we
 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.600
beautifully to some GPCR features we
were doing so it's a particular pleasure

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610
were doing so it's a particular pleasure
 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.209

effect it was quite a bit before we got

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139
effect it was quite a bit before we got
 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.040
effect it was quite a bit before we got
the structure but yeah so when you said

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050
the structure but yeah so when you said
 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.869
the structure but yeah so when you said
someone did you have yourself in mind or

00:05:56.869 --> 00:05:56.879
someone did you have yourself in mind or
 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:59.390
someone did you have yourself in mind or
were you not that well I hoped it would

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400
were you not that well I hoped it would
 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.450
were you not that well I hoped it would
be me but we didn't have any there's a

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460
be me but we didn't have any there's a
 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.430
be me but we didn't have any there's a
difference between yes certainty I

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440
difference between yes certainty I
 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.140
difference between yes certainty I
suppose and confidence because you seem

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150
suppose and confidence because you seem
 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.029
suppose and confidence because you seem
to remain confident in the ability to

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039
to remain confident in the ability to
 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:12.920
to remain confident in the ability to
get somewhere even though you weren't

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930
get somewhere even though you weren't
 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.170
get somewhere even though you weren't
certain you'd make it that's true I

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180
certain you'd make it that's true I
 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.240
certain you'd make it that's true I
think I was somewhat confident I think I

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250
think I was somewhat confident I think I
 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.249
think I was somewhat confident I think I
had worked on it long enough I think I

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259
had worked on it long enough I think I
 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:22.100
had worked on it long enough I think I
knew the protein really well so somehow

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110
knew the protein really well so somehow
 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.869
knew the protein really well so somehow
I mean I think if you've got to believe

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:23.879
I mean I think if you've got to believe
 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:26.300
I mean I think if you've got to believe
you can do it otherwise it's you know

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310
you can do it otherwise it's you know
 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.769
you can do it otherwise it's you know
it's sort of a struggle because you have

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:27.779
it's sort of a struggle because you have
 

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:29.809
it's sort of a struggle because you have
to you know get funding and keep the lab

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:29.819
to you know get funding and keep the lab
 

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:32.089
to you know get funding and keep the lab
going and so you have to believe in

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:32.099
going and so you have to believe in
 

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:35.480
going and so you have to believe in
yourself well it's been a great pleasure

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490
yourself well it's been a great pleasure
 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:36.800

one of the rare marriages where my wife
and I have been working together in the

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:51.540
and I have been working together in the
 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.020
and I have been working together in the
lab for I mean ever since I was in the

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030
lab for I mean ever since I was in the
 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.780
lab for I mean ever since I was in the
left quits lab and and we still you know

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:56.790
left quits lab and and we still you know
 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.910
left quits lab and and we still you know
she still we still work together so it's

00:06:58.910 --> 00:06:58.920
she still we still work together so it's
