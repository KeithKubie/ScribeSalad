00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.404
The opposite of cay plus 1 is less than or equal to sara is cay plus 1 is

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:10.618
greater than sara. The opposite of cay plus 1 is greater than or equal to sara

00:00:10.618 --> 00:00:16.251
is cay plus 1 is less than sara. And the opposite of cay plus 1 is not equal to

00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:20.991
sara is cay plus one equals equals to sara. You may have thought that the

00:00:20.991 --> 00:00:24.123
opposite cay plus 1 is less than or equals to sara should be cay plus 1 is

00:00:24.123 --> 00:00:29.181
greater than or equals to sara. But the opposite value has to disagree every

00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:33.859
possible value of cay and sara. Let's look at a representative set of

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:37.552
example's. Our original expression was cay plus 1 is less than or equals to

00:00:37.552 --> 00:00:42.164
sara. We found that when Cay has 3 Twitter followers and Sara has 4 Twitter

00:00:42.164 --> 00:00:47.634
followers, that's the boundary. So, I'm using that case and two cases, one on

00:00:47.634 --> 00:00:52.119
each side of that boundary to compare these three conditions to see which ones

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:57.422
are opposites. When cay has 3 and sara has 3, it's not true that cay plus one

00:00:57.422 --> 00:01:03.726
is less than or equal to sara. When cay has 3, and I have 4, this condition's

00:01:03.726 --> 00:01:09.539
true. When cay has 3 and I have 5, the condition is still true. Now for the

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.504
next condition, we find that they disagree on conditions that are not right on

00:01:13.504 --> 00:01:19.975
the boundary. But, right on the boundary, they agree. So these conditions are

00:01:19.975 --> 00:01:25.046
not opposites. But this last condition is true for the first case, false for

00:01:25.046 --> 00:01:31.347
the boundary case and false for the last case. So, it differs in every case

00:01:31.347 --> 00:01:36.810
from the original condition. You could write out similar tables for the other

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.210
two original equations, but I think this is enough writing tables for now.
