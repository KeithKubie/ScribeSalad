00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's begin with a discussion of the World Wide Web.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The World Wide Web is a collection of HTML documents.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
These documents are made up of something called HTML,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
which stands for HyperText Markup Language--

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
this is the basis for almost every webpage.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Even though there can be--you know--

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
documents, images, videos, and--you know--

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
all sorts of things online,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
HTML is what glues everything together.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And the links between these pages,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
called hyperlinks--or links for short--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is what makes the web web-like.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The web was invented in the early 1990s,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and has something on the order of 30 billion pages.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Time for the first quiz.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
What is the main type of document on the web?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Is it HTML? Microsoft Word documents? PDFs?

00:00:49.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Or plain text?
