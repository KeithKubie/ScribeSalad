00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.200
We're now on test number
6 in section 3.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.140
Let's just get started.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.250
Problem number 1.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.560
Which of the following numbers
is between 1/5 and 1/4?

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.170
So when you look at the choices,
you immediately see

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.340
that all of the numbers
are decimals.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.010
So let's just convert
these to decimals.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.290
1/5 is what?

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.320
It's 0.2.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.270
And 1/4 is 0.25.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.390
So we need a number that's
larger-- so let me call it x--

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.170
than 0.2 and less than 0.25.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.980
And if you look at the choices,
d is that answer.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.840
And if you didn't know off
hand that 1/5 is 0.2, you

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.890
could divide 5 into 1.0.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.850
5 goes into 10 two times.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.450
2 times 10 is 10, 0, and then,
of course, the decimal you

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.590
bring up, so it's 0.2 times.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.540
And just do the same
thing with 1/4.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.970
Next problem.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.630
Problem 2.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.150
The following are coordinates
of points in the xy plane.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.800
Which of these points is
nearest the origin?

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.690
So if we look at all of the
choices-- well, let me

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.110
actually write all
the choices down.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.020
We have a, a says
0, minus 1/2.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.160
b is-- I was thinking whether
I should draw these for you,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.540
but it's good to learn how
to do this without

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.540
drawing-- 0, 1/2.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:32.400
c is 1/2, minus 1/2.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.550
d is 1/2, 1/2.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:45.530
And e is minus 1, minus 1.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.110
So if we look at all the
choices, we didn't move at all

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.520
along the x-axis here, right?

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.560
Because we're still
at x equals 0.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.740
We want to figure out how
far it is away from 0.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.130
So we didn't move at all from
the x-axis and we went one

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.510
below the y-axis here,
to minus one.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.070
Clearly b is closer than
a because b is

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.220
only 1/2 away, right?

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.320
Once again, we didn't move on
the x-axis, and we only moved

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.470
1/2 away on the y-axis.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.680
So a is not our choice.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.350
So far, b is our
best contender.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.790
It's only 1/2 away
from the origin.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.720
c is 1/2 away in the x direction
and 1/2 away in the

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.720
y direction, and if you do
the math, if you use the

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.365
Pythagorean theorem, you'll see
that, of course, is going

00:02:27.365 --> 00:02:29.080
to be further than 1/2.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.270
And let me just draw a little
bit of a graphic for you just

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.240
so you get the intuition.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.550
How I can do that without
drawing it.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.800
So this point is 0, 1/2.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.200
So that point is here.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.450
That's our best contender
right now, 0, 1/2.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.480
The point 1/2, negative
1/2 is here.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.570
See, this is 1/2
minus 1/2 here.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.450
So its distance from
the origin is

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.450
this line right here.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.980
And that difference is
definitely going to be longer

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.730
than this distance.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.170
How do I know?

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.890
Because this distance is the
same thing as this distance,

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.800
it's the same thing as 1/2 to
the negative side, right?

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.570
And if you do the Pythagorean
theorem, we

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:20.340
could figure it out.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.420
This distance is 1/2
half as well.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.700
This is going to be the square
root of 1/2 squared plus 1/2

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.950
squared, so 1/4 plus
1/4, which is 1/2.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.020
So it's the square root of
1/2, which is 1 over the

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.190
square root of 2.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.550
Which is the same thing as two
square roots of 2 over 2.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.750
Any way you look at it, it is
a bigger number than 1/2.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.120
When you take a square root of
a fraction, you're going to

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.680
get something bigger than
the fraction, right?

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.250
So this is essentially the
square root of 1/2.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.810
So it's going to be
bigger than 1/2.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.930
So we know that this
isn't the choice.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.005
And d is the same distance as c,
d is up here, it's just in

00:03:57.005 --> 00:03:59.740
the positive quadrant, right?

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.190
This distance is 1/2 and then
this distance is 1/2.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.320
So d, for the same reasons,
is further then b.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.910
And e is the furthest
of them all, right?

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.890
It's one away in two directions,
so it's out here

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.520
someplace relative to
this origin, so

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.330
that's not the choice.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.190
So b is definitely the closest,
and it's only 1/2

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.610
units away from the origin.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:21.860
Next problem.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.120
I will change colors
for variety.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.370
Problem 3.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.330
OK, they drew a lot here.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.090
Let me see if I can draw the
same thing they did.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.746
So they have a horizontal
line.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.380
I want to draw just like
the way they did it.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:51.730
And so then there's
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.660
I'm telling you, drawing
it is the hardest part.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:04.110
And they have something
like this, like that,

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.310
and then like that.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.410
And then the next two don't go
all the way through, they go

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.090
kind of halfway.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.050
That one goes like that.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.100
And that one.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.090
That's my best shot.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:25.670
And they say that this is x
degrees, x degrees, x degrees,

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.980
x degrees, x degrees, x
degrees, x degrees.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.940
And they say that this big one
right here is y degrees.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.180
In the figure above, what
is the value of y?

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.880
Well, the first thing I would
do is figure out what the

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.080
value of x is.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.840
And how do I do that?

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.470
Well, you could make a whole
circle or whatever, but you

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:52.010
could say look, all of these
x's here, how many is that?

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.470
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, x's right?

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.660
These five x's are collectively
supplementary to

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.350
each other, right?

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.590
They're going to add
up to 180 degrees.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:07.240
So we know that 5x is equal
to 180 degrees.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.230
And that x is equal to-- how
many times does 5 go into 180?

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:17.740
5 goes into 150 30 times, and
so there's another 30, so

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.210
it'll go into it 36 times.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.680
So x equal to 36 degrees,
you just divide

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.470
180 by 5 to get that.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.780
So how do we figure out y?

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.820
Well, the easy way to do this
is say well, if you go into

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:38.180
the other side of the circle,
that's also going to be equal

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.470
to 180 degrees, right?

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:41.910
So we have two x's here.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.160
And then we have y, right?

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:54.090
So you could say y plus
2x is equal to 180.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.290
I know what x is.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.990
x is 36 degrees, so y
plus 2 times 36 is

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.170
72 is equal to 180.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:12.340
y is equal to 180 minus 72,
which is 108 degrees.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.360
Now, if you wanted to do this
really, really, really fast,

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.080
what you could have said
is well, you know what?

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.440
If I kept drawing these
x's all the way

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.730
around the circle, right?

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:27.420
So let's say that I had
lines like this.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.820
Say this line actually just
continues on like this.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:35.310
And let's say that this line
continued on like this.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.790
And we know that this is kind
of a visualization exercise,

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.290
but you'd have known that this
is x, this is x, this is x.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:43.620
And then how many x's
total are there?

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.790
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.020
There would have been
10 x's, right?

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.630
And we're going all the way
around the circle, so 10x

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.090
would equal 360.

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:55.760
x is equal to 36.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.380
And then a really easy thing,
you could've said well y is 3

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.150
of these x's, right?

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:01.870
1, 2, 3.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.190
y is three of those x's,
so three times

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.650
36 is equal to 108.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:07.740
Either way would've been fine.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.970
I think the way we did it the
first time, well, it didn't

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.880
take too long, but if you
can do it faster,

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.832
that all the better.

00:08:13.832 --> 00:08:16.490
Because at some point,
the SAT really just

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.770
becomes a speed exam.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:20.020
Problem number 4.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:34.130
If 6,565 is equal to 65 times
x plus 1, then x equals?

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.280
So the real trick here is being
able to divide fast.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:42.710
Divide both sides by 65, you
get 65 goes into 6,565 goes

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:48.200
into 65 one time, 1 time 65, 0,
0, 6, goes into it 0 times.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.410
Get a 0, 65, goes into
65 one time.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:54.560
So you divide both sides
by 65, you get 101 is

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.920
equal to x plus 1.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.180
Subtract 1 from both sides,
you get 100 is equal to x.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.960
This is just kind of
a speed problem.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.500
Maybe they want to make you
have a careless mistake.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.920
The answer is c.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.880
I'll see you in the
next video.
