Uh, before
we get out for our For the Win,

00:00:03.237 --> 00:00:05.506
uh, you guys... uh, you guys
at home have been tweeting

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:07.140
#MyLoveLifeIn5Words jokes
all night,

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:09.009
but I want the #Soulmates
over here a chance

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.645
to each throw in one
of their own, so ladies first.

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:13.247
-Emily.
-All right.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.648
I'd have to say...

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.851
"Mmm, pull down my Spanx,
cowboy."

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:20.888
-All right, very good.
Points to you. -Oh! Very nice.

00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:24.157
And now, uh...

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:26.059
Brian, you got to top that.

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:29.463
I... I might be able to. Um...

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:31.832
Emily, will you marry me?

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.800
(cheering, applause)

00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:42.142
Holy (bleep)!

00:00:42.176 --> 00:00:44.545
Yes! Yes!

00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:47.247
Yes!

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:49.016
Yeah!

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.584
Oh, wait.

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:53.687
Hang on.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.888
Yes!

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:57.224
-You good?
-Oh, my... Yes!

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:58.792
Wait, wait, wait, wait
wait, wait! Wait.

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:00.394
Oh, my God!

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:02.329
Everyone was screaming.
You said yes, right?

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:04.464
-Yes. -Okay, good, okay, good.
That would have been really...

00:01:04.498 --> 00:01:06.533
-Yes!
-...really unfortunate.

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:08.001
He liked it!

00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:10.270
-And he put a ring on it!
-How are you doing?

00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:12.139
-Doing all right.
-Oh, my God. -Look at this!

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:14.575
-Did you have any idea
this was coming? -No! No!

00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:16.310
Oh, my God.

00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:18.712
Brian, you had to...
How are you feeling?

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:20.647
I'm feeling pretty good right
now. -You <i>are</i> feeling

00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:22.983
-pretty good right now.
Yeah, yeah. -Yeah.

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:25.686
That would explain the... your
pants slowly filling with poop

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.321
for, like, the first half
of the show...

00:01:27.354 --> 00:01:29.423
-Yeah, pretty much.
-...figuring out how to do this.

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:32.392
But, uh, what a great... So you
got-you got engaged on the show

00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:34.328
that you guys
initially bonded over.

00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:36.897
Now you're gonna go get married,
so we'll bring that back

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.932
-onto the show at some point.
-Oh, my God!

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:41.568
-(cheering, applause)
-Congratulations.

00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:43.937
I want you to...

00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:47.875
I want you to name
your first kids together

00:01:47.908 --> 00:01:51.545
@midnight Hardwickton III.

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:51.645
-Think it's a great name
for a kid. -Of course.
