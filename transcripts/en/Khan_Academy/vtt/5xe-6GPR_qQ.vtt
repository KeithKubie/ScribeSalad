00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.890
Which of the following
numbers is a factor of 154?

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.240
So when a number is going
to be a factor of 154

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.020
is if we can divide
that number into 154

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.554
and not have a remainder.

00:00:11.554 --> 00:00:13.470
Or another way of thinking
about it-- a number

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:19.250
is a factor of 154 if 154 is
a multiple of that number.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.060
So let's look at each of these
and see which of these we

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.420
can rule out or say is a factor.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.309
So does 3 divide
evenly into 154?

00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:28.850
Or, another way of
thinking about it,

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.172
is 154 a multiple of 3?

00:00:32.172 --> 00:00:34.130
Well you'll later learn
that you could actually

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.640
test whether something
is divisible by 3

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.890
by adding up the digits.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.870
And if that's divisible
by 3, then it's

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.760
going to be divisible by 3.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.690
And so you see
here, 1 plus 5 is 6.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.280
6 plus 4 is 10.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.431
10 is not divisible by 3.

00:00:48.431 --> 00:00:50.430
But if you didn't want
to do that little trick--

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.480
and we have other
videos where we

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.350
go into more detail
about that trick--

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.170
you can actually just
divide 3 into 154.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.260
3 doesn't go into 1.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.060
It does go into 15 five times.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.170
5 times 3 is 15.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.190
Subtract.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.710
Then we have 0.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.910
Then you bring down a 4.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.960
3 goes into 4 one time.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.520
1 times 3 is 3.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.690
Subtract, and you
have a remainder of 1.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.160
So 3 is clearly not a factor of
154, so we can rule that out.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.830
Now what about 5?

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.900
Well, any multiple
of 5 is either

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.900
going to have 5 or
0 in the ones place.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.290
You see that if we write 5
times 1 is 5, 5 times 2 is 10,

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.150
5 times 3 is 15, 5 times 4 is
20, you either have a 5 or a 0

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.400
in the ones place.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.960
This does not have 5
or a 0 the ones place,

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.610
so it's not going to
be divisible by 5.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.130
5 is not a factor.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.070
154 is not a multiple of 5.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.044
Now 6 is interesting.

00:01:50.044 --> 00:01:51.210
You could do the same thing.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.890
You could try to
divide 6 into 154.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.927
But if something
is divisible by 6,

00:01:55.927 --> 00:01:58.010
it's definitely going to
be divisible by 3 as well

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.950
because 6 is divisible by 3.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.080
So we can immediately
rule this one out as well.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.480
Because 154 is not
divisible by 3,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.590
it's also not going
to be divisible by 6.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.419
And you could try
it out if you like.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.540
And we could make the
same argument for 9.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.990
If something is divisible by 9,
it's going to be divisible by 3

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.540
because 9 is divisible by 3.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.810
Well, it's not
divisible by 3, so we're

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.241
going to rule out 9 as well.

00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:21.490
So we've ruled out everything.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.360
It looks like 14
is our only option,

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.960
but let's actually verify it.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.940
Let's actually
divide 14 into 154.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.570
14 doesn't go into 1.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.360
It goes into 15
exactly one time.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.570
1 times 14 is 14.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.840
We subtract.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.060
We get 1.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.230
Bring down the 4.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.150
14 goes into 14 one time.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.660
1 times 14 is 14.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.790
And of course, we
have no remainder.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.750
So 14 goes into 154
exactly 11 times.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.280
Or 11 times 14 is 154.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.940
154 is a multiple of 14.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.490
Let's do one more.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.122
Which of the following
numbers is a multiple of 14?

00:03:01.122 --> 00:03:02.580
So now we have 14,
and we're trying

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.610
to think of its multiples.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.600
So there's two
ways of doing this.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.824
You could go number by number
and try to divide 14 into them,

00:03:09.824 --> 00:03:11.240
or we could just
try to figure out

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.620
what all of the multiples
of 14 actually are.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.620
So let's try to do that.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.390
Let's try to do that
second technique.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.810
14 times 1 is 14.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:21.795
You add another 14.

00:03:21.795 --> 00:03:24.010
14 times 2 is 28.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.274
Add another 14.

00:03:25.274 --> 00:03:26.190
Let's see, you add 10.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.150
You get to 38.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.600
Then you add 4 more.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.210
You get to 42.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.430
Then you add another 14.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.580
I haven't seen any of
these numbers show up yet.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.840
Add another 14 to this.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.440
You get to 56-- still
not quite there.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.006
Add another 14.

00:03:42.006 --> 00:03:43.630
Let's see, if you
add 4, you get to 60,

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.754
and you have to add the 10.

00:03:44.754 --> 00:03:46.870
So then you get to 70.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.560
And it looks like we have
found one of these numbers.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.070
70 is a multiple of 14.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:59.268
14 times 1, 2, 3, 4,
5-- 14 times 5 is 70.
