00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.760
Censorship is a tricky thing.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.250
The line between artistic freedom of speech
and the need to protect the “common good”

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.780
are at odds every day.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.550
But some people have begun to question the
agenda of some behind the scenes experts.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.810
Do the ideas on screen match up with the story
they’re supposed to tell?

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.220
This isn’t meant to be a discussion on politics
or the state of the world.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.550
But rather, the behind the scenes decision-making
that goes in to some Hollywood movies.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.160
Everyone wants to look good on the big screen,
and the government is no exception.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.210
Here are 10 Famous Movies That Were Altered
By The Government.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.270
Goldeneye
Whenever an actor debuts as the new James

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.680
Bond, fans of the franchise always wonder
if the’ve got what it takes to embody the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.950
iconic super-spy.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.980
And after Timothy Dalton passed the torch
to Pierce Brosnan, people got excited.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.540
His first appearance as 007 was in 1995’s
Goldeneye.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.040
The movie spawned one of the most iconic video
games of all time, and contains some of the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.370
best moments in the character’s big-screen
history.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.170
But there was one scene that stood out to
some members of the United States military.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.900
An unfortunate encounter with Xenia Onatopp
leaves one Admiral dead.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.990
And in the original script the character was
American, but was later changed to Canadian

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.689
for the final cut.

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.070
Django Unchained
Quentin Tarantino is not exactly a subtle

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.290
guy, and his movies have a unique style.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.780
Usually his vision includes troves of well-crafted
dialogue mixed with a few bloodbaths.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.600
Needless to say, audiences have come to expect
a certain level of violence and gore when

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.140
heading to the theater to see his latest work.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.729
Except in China, where the government’s
strict film regulations clashed with the release

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.670
of Django Unchained in 2012.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.450
The authorities pulled it from rotation on
the same day it was released, and made some

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.450
changes.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.640
The censored final cut is about three minutes
shorter than the original, and is missing

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.020
some of its nudity and violence.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.420
Iron Man 3
Robert Downey Jr’s take on Tony Stark is

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.150
officially legendary, and expanded the character’s
fan base tenfold.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.990
He’s been in a ton of movies over the last
decade, and Iron Man 3 was one of the most

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.990
successful.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.530
Legions of fans think the film is perfect
just the way it is, but before it was released

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.920
in China, the authorities did a little editing.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.979
Usually censors remove footage, but in this
case they actually added a couple of minutes

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:06.979
to the movie.

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.070
And the way they used their time was kind
of odd.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.610
There were a few changes, but the most obvious
one is a scene where they advertise a real-world

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.919
drink as the reason for Iron Man’s stamina.

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:20.230
Zero Dark Thirty
Oftentimes when filmmakers take on delicate

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.780
or complex subject matter, they consult with
an expert.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.450
It’s a lot of pressure and they have a responsibility
to be accurate when handling real-life events.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.800
But some argue that a line was crossed during
the making of Zero Dark Thirty.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.569
And there are opponents on both sides of the
line.

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.870
The movie follows a team looking for Osama
Bin Laden.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.309
Consulting with a team of CIA agents, the
film was guided by their expertise in some

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:45.139
spots, and has been criticized for it’s
use of “enhanced interrogation”.

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:49.010
After it’s release, some audience members
felt that the story was swayed to be pro-torture

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.659
because of the CIA’s involvement.

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:57.040
While some fans saw the scenes as finally
exposing a hidden truth.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.139
World War Z
With China being the fastest growing market

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:04.030
for movies, filmmakers are doing their part
to make sure their work is up to code.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.129
Since their industry only accepts a finite
amount of foreign films every year, the competition

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.129
is fierce.

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.639
After Brad Pitt got the rights to make the
movie World War Z, he’s had his eye on the

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:13.639
ball.

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.499
Any movie about zombies always gives an explanation
about how and where the outbreak began.

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:19.819
And in this case, it was supposed to be China.

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.189
So to be safe, they just nixed the conversation.

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:27.749
It wasn’t enough, and executives were still
butting heads over if it would be released.

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:31.629
Based on Max Brooks’ book of the same name,
the film turned out to be the most successful

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.169
zombie movie ever made.

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:37.090
Pearl Harbor
Michael Bay was given all kinds of military

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.430
support when he announced he’d be making
a movie about Pearl Harbor.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.510
And as we mentioned earlier, filmmakers often
rely on the expert knowledge of real world

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.299
people who know a thing or two about the subject
matter.

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.400
Since wartime history is not exactly Bay’s
specialty, he was advised on more than one

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.400
plot point.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.659
One of his experts even had him change an
entire character so the audience would like

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:56.659
him more.

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:00.049
Too bad it didn’t work, since the movie
is considered by many to be a low point in

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.209
movie making.

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.379
The Hunger Games
The Chinese box office process is heavily

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.699
regulated, and officials have the right to
pick and choose what movies are released.

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:12.969
They knew audiences were eagerly anticipating
one installment in The Hunger Games franchise,

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:16.959
Mockingjay Part 1, but worried that it’s
release would knock the entire entertainment

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.630
economy off it’s axis.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.500
So in an effort to encourage citizens to see
domestic movies, the government stalled the

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.720
films release by a few months until the new
year.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.530
Thankfully audiences didn’t have to wait
too long, and Mockingjay was eventually released

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.530
in 2015.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.660
Black Hawk Down
Knowledge can be expensive, and many people

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.500
believe that director Ridley Scott traded
his integrity for access during the making

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.500
of Black Hawk Down.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.030
While working with officials on the film,
the director allegedly agreed to give the

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.730
insiders a first look at the film and final
say about what could and couldn’t be included.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.980
Many felt like the result was a glorification
of Americas military.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.620
Instead of seizing the opportunity to tell
the story they were “supposed” to, dissenters

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.910
argued that the advisors were over-involved
in tailoring the final product.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.200
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen
Here he is again.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.200
This time Michael Bay was called out for his
super militarized vision in Transformers:

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.310
Revenge of the Fallen.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.790
Yes, obviously if giant robots began attacking
the planet, the military would get involved,

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.880
but some people argue their overwhelming presence
throughout the movie is secretly a recruiting

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.880
tactic.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.310
When asked about it in an interview, deputy
director in the public affairs department

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.930
of the United States Air Force didn’t deny
it.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.730
But stated that the primary goal of working
on the film was to assist with the finer points

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:27.970
of military life.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.110
If they get some new recruits out of it, that’s
fine too.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.810
Pixels
Okay, the premise that video game characters

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.320
could someday attack the world and we’d
be given three lives to defeat them sounds

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.340
really cool, right?

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.010
Nobody could ruin that, right?

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.010
Wrong.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.210
Adam Sandler can, and did, in the 2015 flop
Pixels.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.310
Aliens battle earth in the form of iconic
gaming characters, destroying huge chunks

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.440
of it in the process.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.160
But when it came time for the aliens to blow
up the Great Wall of China, the executives

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.200
came to a screeching halt.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.750
Obviously the movie was going to be at least
a little crass, it is Sandler after all.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.160
But they didn’t want to completely eliminate
themselves from the competition for a Chinese

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.780
release date.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:04.960
So what do you think of our list?

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.720
Do you know of any other movies that were
altered by the government?
