00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.590
So why are field techs so important? Let's take

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.560
an example of an email address. Now you could format

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.580
that as a plain text field and then users would

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.800
enter so and so at something dot something and it

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.490
would work in most cases. Now the great part

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.840
about choosing a data type is that it provides automatic

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.820
data validation. Someone couldn't enter in an illegal email address,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.720
because the, they wouldn't be able to save their record.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.000
Moreover, that functionality of that will later show up in

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.020
an app so we will be able to tap that email

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.020
address and it would open a mail-to link and their default

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.770
email application. That's great functionality, so we want to make sure

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.380
to use the data text that users expect for it. If

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.400
it's a calendar, choose the date type. If it's email, choose

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.080
email, etcetera. Now the best way to learn is by doing

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.790
so let's go back with Samantha and Andy and do that.
