00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.940
One of the reasons quantum mechanics is hard
to get your head around

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.840
is because it’s just so friggin' weird.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.960
Things at the quantum level behave completely
counterintuitively,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.100
compared to what we’re used to
out here on the macro-scale.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.240
Recently, though, scientists have announced
possibly the largest objects yet observed

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.300
being governed by quantum physics.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.620
Macroscale objects doing quantum things 
sounds absurd;

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.540
at least, Erwin Schrödinger thought so.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.400
That’s what Schrödinger’s cat is all about.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.740
The famous thought experiment says that if
a cat is in a box with an atom

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.340
that has a 50-50 chance of decaying and setting off a
Rube Goldberg murder machine,

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.220
then, according to one interpretation 
of quantum physics,

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.680
the cat should simultaneously exist 
as both alive and dead.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.960
Erwin Schrödinger dreamed up this scenario
to point out just how ridiculous the interpretation was,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.700
since a cat obviously can’t be both
alive and dead at the same time.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.288
But since then, experiments have shown particles
like electrons and photons

00:00:53.288 --> 00:00:58.660
existing in multiple states simultaneously,
demonstrating the quantum weirdness is real.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.720
Still no half-dead cats, though.

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:04.350
But just like how there’s nothing in the
rulebook that says a giraffe can’t play football,

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.140
there’s nothing in quantum physics
that says there’s a size limit.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.330
There are, however, two important conditions.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.210
The first is isolation.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.540
An isolated object can behave 
as quantum mechanics allows.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.260
But if an object isn’t isolated, the rest
of the world interferes.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.780
Things like other matter and radiation prevent
the object from doing everything possible,

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.310
and instead restrict it to what we classically see.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.320
But nothing can be perfectly isolated from
its environment,

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.880
so the second condition is energy.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.259
To exhibit quantum behavior, an object must
have more energy than its environment.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.360
These two constraints are why light in a vacuum

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.240
is a great candidate for observing quantum behavior.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.440
Scale things up, though, and those two requirements
get harder to meet.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.020
But they can be met, and in April of 2018,
Nature published a paper detailing the largest

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.000
objects yet to exhibit the quantum phenomenon
known as entanglement.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.140
Entangled objects are somehow connected over
a distance, and what happens to one

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.420
has an immediate effect on the other, what Einstein
dubbed, “spooky action at a distance.”

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.560
Using a carefully applied superconducting
electrical circuit, two vibrating circular

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.690
membranes were made to oscillate so similarly
they could be considered in an entangled state.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.640
Although these drum-like membranes are just
about the width of a human hair, they contain

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.720
trillions of atoms, making them the largest
objects entangled yet.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.640
Compare that to 2015, when the record was
a mere 3,000 entangled atoms.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.260
Macro-scale objects like these could be used
for super-sensitive measurements,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.460
and could be applied to things 
like detecting gravitational waves.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.040
So what’s next?

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.780
Can I one day entangle my cat with my dog?

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.940
Would it be possible to entangle myself with
Beyoncé so I can finally dance like her?

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.680
Will we finally get entangled ice skates and hockey pucks like the 1999 Disney Channel original movie

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.490
"Genius," that is the basis
for most of my life?

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.560
Probably not for a long time, and before that,
a lot more spooky research is needed.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.350
