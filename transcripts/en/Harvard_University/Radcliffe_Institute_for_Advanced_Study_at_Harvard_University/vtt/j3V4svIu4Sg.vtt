00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:04.951
- Hello, everyone.

00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:07.450
It's very exciting to start out
this science lecture series.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.620
Sandro Galea was an emergency
physician and epidemiologist.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.536
He's the Robert
A. Knox professor

00:00:14.536 --> 00:00:15.910
and Dean of the
Boston University

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.560
School of Public Health.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.330
He is the former
chair of epidemiology

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.670
of the Columbia
University Mailman School

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.260
of Public Health.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.840
Prior to his academic
career in public health,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.700
Dr. Galea practiced
emergency medicine in Canada

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.750
and served in Somalia with
Doctors Without Borders.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.370
He was named one
of Time magazine's

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.479
epidemiology innovators in
2006, and Thomas Reuters

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:39.520
listed him as one of the
world's most influential

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.780
scientific minds for the
social sciences in 2015.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.320
Dr. Galea is a past president
of the Society for Epidemiologic

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.680
Research and elected member of
the American Epidemiological

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.030
Society.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.850
He was elected to the National
Academy of Medicine in 2012

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.180
and shared two of IOM's most
recent reports on mental health

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.264
in the military.

00:00:59.264 --> 00:01:01.180
Dr. Galea serves frequently
on advisory groups

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.072
of national and
international organizations.

00:01:03.072 --> 00:01:05.530
He formerly served as Chair of
the New York City Department

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.980
of Health and Mental Hygiene's
community services board

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.750
and as a member of
its health board.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.330
We are thrilled to have Dean
Galea here, and please join me

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.432
in welcoming him.

00:01:15.432 --> 00:01:15.932
Thank you.

00:01:15.932 --> 00:01:19.369
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:25.555 --> 00:01:26.180
- Good evening.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.013
Thank you very much.

00:01:27.013 --> 00:01:29.720
Thank you, everybody, for
inviting me to come and present

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.590
here.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.190
It's really a
pleasure to be here.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.750
So I'm delighted to open
this series, although I'm not

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.470
entirely sure that I am going
to do justice to epidemics.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.740
Because my title is
about epidemiology

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.482
counts, but I want to talk less
about the academic application

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:49.940
of epidemiology, which those
of you who are not so inclined

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.900
may be relieved, and more
about the core meaning

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.840
of epidemiology.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.510
And by the core meaning
of epidemiology,

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.350
I mean that, since epidemiology
became a discipline

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.990
roughly 150 years ago,
the core definition

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.500
has been that this epidemiology
is about understanding

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.029
the causes of health so that
we may do something about them.

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:11.570
So understanding
the causes of health

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.194
so that we may do
something about them.

00:02:13.194 --> 00:02:15.749
And I actually think
that that meaning--

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:17.540
so in my title, I said
epidemiology counts.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.770
I think that meaning counts.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.149
I think that it is important to
understand the causes of health

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:23.690
so that we may do
something about it.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.340
And I'm going to
make an argument

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.550
that how we think
about those causes

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.360
has clear consequences for
whether we succeed in promoting

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.750
healthy populations or not.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.240
So that's the arc of my talk.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.260
And I'm going to start off by
trying to lay out a challenge,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.750
and say, this is what
we'd like to get to.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.000
Point out some problems and
then offer some solutions.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.041
And then, of course, I
would be delighted to have

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:46.850
some questions.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.040
So let me plunge right in.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.440
So let me start by arguing
that we want a healthier world.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.830
And when we say you
want a healthier world,

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.000
it seems to me reasonable
that, if this is the world,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.880
we are interested not simply
in a few people with disease,

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.710
schematically.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.740
We're actually interested in
understanding the whole world

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.701
and understanding a universe
of people who may have disease.

00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:16.200
Right?

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.640
That our interests are
not particular to just

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.360
a small group.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.990
We're interested in a
healthier world for all.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.570
It seems to me like
it's a tough argument

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.340
to say that we want
something else.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.260
And ideally, we want to
understand the health for all,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.220
and assuming that the
people in the dark blue

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.410
are disease people,
so that we actually

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.420
make them better, right?

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.510
So ultimately,
what we want to do

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.968
is we want to
understand the world,

00:03:39.968 --> 00:03:42.560
understand about the disease,
and make some people better.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.600
That's ultimately
our aspiration.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.250
Now, I start with
this-- and this

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.720
is a very, very simple concept.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.771
And you're going to say,
OK, OK, I know that.

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:50.270
That's OK.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.450
But this has
implications for how

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.480
we think about the cause of
health and the cause of disease

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.190
and what we do about it,
as I'm going to get to.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.159
Now, let me start
with good news.

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:02.200
I'm going to start with--

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.881
there's abundant good news.

00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:05.880
One of the challenges of
being an epidemiologist

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.270
or a public health person is
I always come to audiences

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.790
and I talk about people dying
and being sick; it's all bad.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.206
So I want to start
with good news.

00:04:12.206 --> 00:04:13.490
All great stuff.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.750
This is the best slide I know
that says good news all around,

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.040
which is this.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.570
So this is life expectancy
from the 1500s to the present,

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.150
and what I want you to
see is the longest records

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.330
of life expectancy
are in the UK,

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.410
and life expectancy really
grumbled along around 40

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.900
all the way till about 150 years
ago-- really in the mid 40s

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.150
till about 100 years ago.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.470
So life expectancy grumbled
along, like, 40 to 45.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.630
And I would ask
everybody in this room,

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.200
how would your life decisions
have been different had you

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.652
expected to die at 45?

00:04:54.652 --> 00:04:57.430
And I mean, we all know
people do die at 45,

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.630
but let's be honest.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.610
We expect to live
much longer than that.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.640
So, not so long ago--

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.042
100 years ago-- we could
expect to live till 45.

00:05:04.042 --> 00:05:06.000
Now look what's happened
in the past 100 years.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.357
It's been this extraordinary
zooming upward.

00:05:08.357 --> 00:05:09.940
And these are just
selected countries.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.760
The United States is over--

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.510
I can't remember which
one of these it is.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.426
And it's one of these.

00:05:14.426 --> 00:05:16.240
But we can see all
countries zooming up

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.010
in the past 100 years.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.250
So that is extraordinary.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.010
Like, this is great good news.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.400
We haven't gained, in
the past hundred years,

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.480
about a 40% increase in life
expectancy after having not

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.540
budged life expectancy
for hundreds of years.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.100
That is great good news.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.880
And you can see this good
news manifest in all sorts

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.850
of other ways that
we measure health.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.600
So I'll give you
another example.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.100
This is global child mortality
between 1800 to the present,

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.080
and the red is the
share of children

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.510
who died before age
five, and the blue

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.200
are the ones who
live past age five.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.100
So look at 1800.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.830
That's not that long ago.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.936
I understand in our
short lifespans,

00:05:58.936 --> 00:06:00.310
200 years seems
like a long time,

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.597
but it's actually not that
long ago in human lifespan.

00:06:02.597 --> 00:06:04.930
Nearly half of all children
used to die before age five,

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.100
and look at today.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.690
We're down to
under five percent.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:08.650
Right?

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.400
So this is all good news.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.617
So we've done some things right.

00:06:12.617 --> 00:06:14.200
So I want to start
with the good news.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.790
Now, if it's all
a good news story,

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.100
you probably don't need
to invite me to say, well,

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.960
there are things that
we should do better.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.707
So let me talk a little bit
now about how we fall short.

00:06:23.707 --> 00:06:25.540
And I'm going to start
with a domestic lens,

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.900
and then I'll-- for briefly,
I'll expand to a global lens.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.610
But let me start domestically.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.119
So this is a
sophisticated audience,

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:36.160
so everybody is going to
know the first slide I'm

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.460
going to show you.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.040
So the first slide I'm going
to show you, domestically,

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.700
is this.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.270
But this is non-communicable
disease mortality.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.430
So is death from, essentially,
non-infectious diseases.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.460
The line between the two
blurs, but that's fine.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:49.835
And all I want
you to see here is

00:06:49.835 --> 00:06:52.540
that this is the US
comparing ourselves

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.966
to any number of other
high income countries.

00:06:54.966 --> 00:06:56.590
You know, we're worse
even than Greece,

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.631
and goodness knows they
can't get anything right,

00:06:58.631 --> 00:07:01.330
but we still kill more
people than they do.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.522
You know, Italy,
Japan, Spain etc.

00:07:03.522 --> 00:07:05.230
I always like putting
in Greece in there,

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.580
because whenever I compare--

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.290
like if I compare to
Sweden, everybody says, ach!

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:10.581
But the Scandinavians, they're
just good at everything.

00:07:10.581 --> 00:07:12.850
But you know, hard to
argue the same for Greeks.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.900
So we have worse
life expectancy--

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.810
I speak above people from
where I come from, so it's OK.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:23.410
But everybody knows this.

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:29.200
You all know that life
expectancy, or the measure

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.416
on any number of health
outcomes in this country

00:07:32.416 --> 00:07:33.790
is worse than our
peer countries.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.160
Everybody walked into
this room knowing this.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.490
Now, what I suspect
you do not know

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.250
is that it wasn't
always like this.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.460
And in fact, it wasn't
like this not so long ago.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.190
So let me show
you another graph.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.620
So the way to read this is,
this is 1980 to the present.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.870
These are the OECD countries--
high income countries.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.397
There are 17 of them.

00:07:55.397 --> 00:07:56.980
The gray dots are
all these countries,

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.930
the red dot is the US.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.690
So in 1980, we were
in the top half.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.700
Everybody see the
life expectancy?

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.850
And over the course
of the past 35 years,

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.650
we have steadily
drifted to the bottom.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.910
Now, there's an
upward slope here,

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.834
so our life expectancy
has been going up,

00:08:12.834 --> 00:08:14.750
but at a much slower
rate than everybody else.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.500
So we now have the
worst life expectancy

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.130
of any of our high income peers.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:24.070
The bad news is that
we have wrought this

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.570
upon ourselves in 35 years.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.850
The good news is, well, if
we've done it in 35 years,

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.300
we should be able to reverse it
over the next 35 years, right?

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.140
That's the good news.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.473
This is clearly not intractable.

00:08:33.473 --> 00:08:35.799
Because I feel like
the public discussion--

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:39.730
the informed public
discussion about US health--

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.657
often stops at the slide
and says, oh, it's terrible.

00:08:42.657 --> 00:08:43.240
It's terrible.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.090
We're worse than everybody else.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:44.719
Yes, we are.

00:08:44.719 --> 00:08:46.010
But we weren't always that bad.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:49.510
We actually-- not so long
ago, we were not that bad.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:50.650
Now how bad are we now?

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.480
I just want to deepen
the misery for a second.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:58.510
So I'm going to show you
two slides about mortality

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.780
in the US compared to median
mortality in high income

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:02.745
countries.

00:09:02.745 --> 00:09:04.120
And I'm just going
to divide them

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.720
by age, just to make the point.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.870
So let me start
with young people.

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:12.070
And by young, here, I take the
liberal definition of under 75.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:16.090
So young people under
75 75 is the new 55.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:18.370
We all know that.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.200
So here are people under 75.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.000
So here's the way to read this--

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.170
the blue is mortality
in the US, the red

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:30.050
is median mortality in all the
other high income countries.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.939
So what you see;
under one, one to 14.

00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:35.230
So first of all, you see this
U-shaped mortality curve.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:36.139
That's very standard.

00:09:36.139 --> 00:09:38.680
We have more mortality at the
youngest stages, more mortality

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.580
as you older, right?

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.260
Nothing surprising there.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:42.490
But then look at this.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:46.380
We kill more newborns than
anybody else, you know,

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.080
and that's not--

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.950
the safest age to be
is always one to 14.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:50.590
That's like when you
live, and then you

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.070
start killing people again.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:52.870
But look at this--

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.060
the blue bar is always
higher than the red bar.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.690
So we are consistent that we
kill more people at all age

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:00.340
groups than all the
other high income

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.190
countries, which at least
would give us for consistency.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:06.970
So that's slide A, but now let
me show you the second slide.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:09.220
If I may take the
liberty to say over 75

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:12.130
is the older age group--
not old, just older.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:14.710
So now let's flip to over 75.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.270
So these are over 75.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.230
And now you see, again,
US and other countries.

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.110
So this is 75 to 79.

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:21.430
Roughly even.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:25.380
Over 80 we're less,
85 we're less, 95-99,

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.670
100 plus were less.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:33.690
So we actually are doing great
in mortality over age 75.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.566
So this is an amazing
country to live in

00:10:35.566 --> 00:10:36.940
as long as you
live until age 75,

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.190
because then you live forever.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:39.600
Because then, nobody dies.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.570
If you go to, like, 150, our
mortality goes really way down.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:47.590
So when you compare
how we're doing

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:50.950
to these other high income
countries and just rank us.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.690
So you rank us, one through 17.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:53.960
There are 17 OECD countries.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.694
One through 17.

00:10:54.694 --> 00:10:55.360
What's our rank?

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.444
So here's a graph of that.

00:10:56.444 --> 00:10:58.818
The way to [INAUDIBLE] these
ranks, [INAUDIBLE] 17, so 17

00:10:58.818 --> 00:10:59.440
is bad.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.580
There are two lines
here, men and women.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.455
They behave the same.

00:11:01.455 --> 00:11:02.830
Pretend they're one line.

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:03.530
So we are 17th.

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:04.030
You see it?

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:07.660
17th, roughly, at all
age groups all the way

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.180
to age 75, all of a sudden,
poof, we jump to number one.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.170
So we are great.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:14.530
Now, you say, OK,
OK, OK, but you're

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:17.610
complaining that things are
not as good as they could be.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.535
But we just don't--

00:11:19.535 --> 00:11:20.910
you know, you
start off by saying

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:22.530
we care about health
of populations,

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:24.440
but maybe we don't, really.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.600
What we really care
about is shiny iPhones

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.024
and having nuclear weapons
that we can drop on Korea.

00:11:30.024 --> 00:11:31.440
I mean, that's
what we care about.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.890
We don't really
care about health.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:35.280
So we're not spending that
much money on it, so it's OK.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:35.790
This is OK.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.170
This is what we get.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:41.907
Well, that's not true, because
this is national spending.

00:11:41.907 --> 00:11:44.490
All these colored lines are all
the other rational high income

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:47.160
countries, and the
purple line is the US.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:53.370
So are we spend nearly
40% of our GDP on health,

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:56.100
and our rate of
increase is steeper

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.687
than anybody else, and our
change in the rate of increase,

00:11:58.687 --> 00:12:00.270
which means second
derivative, is also

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:01.270
steeper than anybody else.

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.820
So we spend a lot
of money on health.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.290
And perhaps the best
graph to capture

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.915
that-- if you want to have a bar
fight with someone about this,

00:12:06.915 --> 00:12:09.330
this is the best graph,
because it maps life expectancy

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:10.410
and spending.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.250
So you see all these countries?

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.800
You know, more spending,
more life expectancy.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.790
And you see us, where you
have more spending and life

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:21.450
expectancy sort of trundles
down the non-trodden path.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:24.390
So there are clearly
problems, right?

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:27.090
And it seemed to me, when I was
given the challenge of opening

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:28.830
up this magnificent
lecture series you're

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.494
having, that if I
was going to talk

00:12:30.494 --> 00:12:32.910
about the causes of health,
like, I felt like you couldn't

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.868
start this lecture series
without understanding

00:12:34.868 --> 00:12:36.030
these basic facts.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.180
Now this is the US.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.000
I just want to,
just for a second,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.260
make a quick global comment,
because ultimately this

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.620
has to be a global lens.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:47.470
So let me just go back to a
slide like the one I showed you

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:47.970
earlier.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:49.340
This is maternal mortality.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:53.416
This is death of
mothers in childbirth.

00:12:53.416 --> 00:12:55.290
And what you see here,
you see the US, again,

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.090
is higher than all these other
countries I showed you before,

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:57.590
right?

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:58.960
So nothing surprising there.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.335
But all I want to
do here is, I'm

00:13:00.335 --> 00:13:02.770
going to add one more country.

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:06.300
I'm going to add to
this graph Ethiopia.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.064
So maternal mortality,
I add Ethiopia.

00:13:09.064 --> 00:13:09.730
That's Ethiopia.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:10.646
That's the same graph.

00:13:10.646 --> 00:13:12.710
Let me go back.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:14.120
You see these countries here?

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.160
Just look at the axis.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.610
0 to 16.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:19.280
Now the axis is in the 0 to 400
scale, because that's the US

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.390
and that's Ethiopia.

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:23.630
So I just did want to, for
a second, take us out a lens

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:26.210
to say that, while I was
talking about the domestic lens,

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:28.520
there is absolutely no
reason why we don't take

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.122
a global lens, and from point
of view of health equity,

00:13:31.122 --> 00:13:33.080
there is absolutely no
reason why this happens.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.400
This is just as
unacceptable as is that.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:35.900
OK?

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.870
So I just want to label
that, that these issues are--

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.740
one can take a national lens
as well as a global lens.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:45.860
Now, let me get to the
crux of my argument.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:46.912
So where do we go wrong?

00:13:46.912 --> 00:13:48.620
And I want to make a
three part argument,

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.590
and then I will counter it with
a sort of three part solution

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:53.960
just for the sake of symmetry.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.420
And why is this the case?

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:59.960
Now, there's plenty
of blame to go around,

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:04.430
and I approach this very much
from the perspective of someone

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:09.050
who has spent my professional
adult life, really,

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:09.980
within the Academy.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.869
So I tend to tend
to try to figure out

00:14:12.869 --> 00:14:15.410
where I've gone wrong, where we
collectively have gone wrong,

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:16.910
rather than trying
to point fingers

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:18.666
at broader, other forces.

00:14:18.666 --> 00:14:20.165
But with that in
mind, I think there

00:14:20.165 --> 00:14:21.950
are three places we
have gone wrong, which

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:25.970
I think gets at this notion I
was trying to make that, if we

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:29.700
understand the causes of health,
that has real consequences

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:30.950
and allows us to act properly.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:32.241
So three ways we've gone wrong.

00:14:32.241 --> 00:14:34.150
Number one.

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:38.770
Number one, we lose sight
of what causes health.

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:42.130
Now, you all say, well, I
know what causes health.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.910
Well, you know, heart disease
and stroke and cancer,

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.170
et cetera.

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:50.280
So, that's not quite right.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:54.420
And I want to illustrate what
causes health with a story.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.380
So This is a blues man.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.420
His name was Blind
Willie Johnson.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.711
So this is the only known
photograph of Willie Johnson.

00:15:00.711 --> 00:15:03.340
Any of you who like the blues
will know Blind Willie Johnson.

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.940
He was born at the turn of
the 19th century in Texas.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:10.830
And he was born in
Texas, he was poor.

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.320
The story is that
when he was three,

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.700
his mother threw lye in his eyes
in an act of domestic violence,

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.980
and he became blind.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.380
He lived fairly poor.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.030
He learned how to
play the guitar,

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:27.201
he made money playing
the blues, and he busked.

00:15:27.201 --> 00:15:28.950
Essentially, that's
the way he made money.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:31.920
He was married, he lived in a
house, the house burned down,

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.600
he had no money so
he continued living

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.110
in the burned down house.

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:39.460
And when he was 44,
he developed malaria.

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.430
So blind Willie Johnson,
who was blind, poor,

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:44.630
and black in Texas, and
this is now in the 40s--

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.100
1940s-- his wife took
him to the hospital,

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.157
where he was turned away.

00:15:48.157 --> 00:15:50.490
Unclear whether he was turned
away because he was blind,

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:53.190
because he was black, because
he was poor; and went home

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:54.860
and died.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:57.350
So the question is, what
killed Blind Willie Johnson?

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:59.339
Well, obviously the
malaria killed him, right?

00:15:59.339 --> 00:16:01.130
But it wasn't just
malaria that killed him.

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:01.629
Right?

00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:03.630
It was his malaria,
it was racism,

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.684
it was domestic
violence, it was poverty.

00:16:06.684 --> 00:16:09.100
All of that killed Blind Willie
if malaria didn't get him,

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.410
something else was going
to get him any day, right?

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:13.900
Now, why am I telling you
this obvious, obvious story?

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.780
I'm telling this obvious
story because unless we

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:21.340
ground a conversation in the
foundational causes of health--

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:25.600
unless we understand
that, if we fix malaria,

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.350
and we don't deal with the
racism, with the poverty,

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:31.540
with the domestic
violence, we are not

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.490
going to fix health for all.

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:35.540
We actually go down a
totally different path.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.360
So I'm starting with
an obvious story.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:41.380
Now, I would argue that
while this may be obvious,

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.860
this is in no way where our
national conversation is at.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:44.920
And that's bad news.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.070
But here's good news, perhaps--

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:49.750
that this kind of battle
about what causes health,

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:56.410
we have been having in the
world for hundreds of years.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:57.930
Here's a classic example.

00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:01.220
These two generously
mustachioed gentlemen

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:05.929
are two of the founding
fathers of public health.

00:17:05.929 --> 00:17:08.700
The gentleman on the left is
Edwin Chadwick, the gentleman

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.579
on the right, William Farr.

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:14.630
And William Farr is
credited with being

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:16.490
the father of statistics.

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:19.430
He started life table
counting in the UK.

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:22.520
Edwin Chadwick is the
architect of the British Health

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:26.390
Act of 1848, which was one of
the sentinel health acts that

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:28.410
created health in cities.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:30.710
But they had a big
argument, and the argument

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:34.220
was as follows-- that William
Farr, who was counting deaths,

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:38.780
said that the babies
of poor mothers

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.420
were dying more than
babies of rich mothers.

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:44.760
So he said, poverty is
killing these babies.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:49.206
Edwin Chadwick was a
politician, and he said--

00:17:49.206 --> 00:17:50.830
and there's a quote
which I'm not going

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:52.780
to get exactly right, but--

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:57.607
babies do not die of
poverty in civilized London.

00:17:57.607 --> 00:17:58.690
He says, it's not poverty.

00:17:58.690 --> 00:17:59.640
So what was it?

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.570
Well, it was
nutritional deficiency,

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:03.929
said Chadwick, that was killing
the babies, not poverty.

00:18:03.929 --> 00:18:05.470
And the argument
went back and forth,

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:06.886
because Chadwick
was a politician;

00:18:06.886 --> 00:18:09.940
Chadwick won, and nutritional
deficiency was recorded.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.440
But the reason I'm
showing this is

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.440
because this gets at
the heart of how we

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.876
think about what causes health.

00:18:15.876 --> 00:18:16.750
Now, how about today?

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.430
What is the
implication for today?

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:21.010
In Epidemiology 101,
Public Health 101,

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:23.051
any health 101 class
anywhere in the country,

00:18:23.051 --> 00:18:25.300
you will have a discussion
of a table like this, which

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.850
says the causes of death
in the United States

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.770
are heart disease,
stroke, et cetera;

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:32.950
or tobacco, poor diet,
alcohol consumption, bugs,

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:34.969
toxic agents, etc.

00:18:34.969 --> 00:18:36.760
And these are the
[INAUDIBLE] those people.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.410
But is that what causes health?

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:40.300
Or is this what causes health?

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.550
Low education, low social
support, racial segregation,

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:44.050
income inequality, poverty.

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:46.270
Look at the number
of deaths from this.

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:48.127
Low education, 190,000.

00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:49.710
Acute heart attacks,
roughly the same.

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:51.670
Low social support,
stroke, roughly the same.

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:53.500
Racial segregation,
lung cancer, the same.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:57.670
Obviously, all of these
are causes of health.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.400
I'm in no way saying
it's this, not that.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.530
But what I'm saying
is that, unless we

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:08.120
keep our eye on the multiplicity
of causes of health,

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.920
we will not invest in
these other causes.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.630
To go back to the
Willy Johnson example,

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:16.630
we'll invest only in malaria and
forget about everything else.

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:18.852
Now you say to me, oh,
we're better than that.

00:19:18.852 --> 00:19:19.810
We're better than that.

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:20.620
We understand this.

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:21.370
We understand this.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:21.880
There, there.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:22.838
Why don't you sit down.

00:19:22.838 --> 00:19:23.380
We get this.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.213
We know that these
things matter for health.

00:19:25.213 --> 00:19:27.660
Of course we invest in them
when it comes to health.

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.420
But do we?

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:30.601
Now, we're in Massachusetts.

00:19:30.601 --> 00:19:32.600
We have the privilege of
being probably the most

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.030
progressive state
in the country.

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:38.580
Do we understand this
in Massachusetts?

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.230
Does our money follow
where our ideas are?

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:44.080
Let's look at where health
spending is in Massachusetts.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.650
Massachusetts health spending.

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:49.080
These are causes of health.

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.955
It's a real schematic.

00:19:50.955 --> 00:19:53.192
You know, access to
care, most people

00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:54.400
think it's about five to 10%.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.680
Genetics, socioeconomic
physical environments,

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.080
healthy behaviors,
interaction about everything.

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.250
Here's our spending.

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:02.460
90% of our spending is
on medical services,

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.270
but less than 10% is
on healthy behaviors.

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:09.640
Most estimates are that we
spend 3% to 5% on things

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.886
that aim at prevention.

00:20:12.886 --> 00:20:13.760
How has this changed?

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.480
You're like, OK, well, maybe
this was bad over time,

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.110
but it's changing.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:17.010
We're getting better.

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:18.500
Let's look at change over time.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:22.130
Past 15 years, Massachusetts
spending 2001-2014.

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:26.169
We have increased our
spending in medical care 81%.

00:20:26.169 --> 00:20:28.210
Kept the same or decreased,
primary and secondary

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:29.520
education, law and public
safety, mental health,

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.120
public health, higher education,
early child education,

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.490
and environmental education.

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:36.730
So you tell me that we actually
understand the Blind Willie

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:38.280
story.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.570
Because surely if we understood
it, we would not be doing this,

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:44.620
right?

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:47.610
And this, of course,
directly maps on

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:49.980
to the slides I
showed you earlier

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:53.110
that talk about the
fact that the US spends

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:56.530
far more than anybody else
and has far worse health

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:57.872
indicators.

00:20:57.872 --> 00:21:00.080
Because of course we are
spending more than everybody

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.150
else, but we're
spending it on just one

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:04.040
aspect of what causes health.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.500
In some respects, if
the audience actually

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.480
understands that point,
my work here is done.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:12.680
Because the core point is that
if one thinks about the causes

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.550
of health-- remember,
that's how I started--

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:17.630
and one understands that
there's a full range of causes.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:20.240
If we're spending on
only one of those causes,

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:24.070
we are inevitably going
to be underperforming.

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:27.340
I want to show you
a metaphor, and then

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:30.985
move onto the second thing
I think we're doing wrong.

00:21:30.985 --> 00:21:32.860
So this is the best
soccer team in the world.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.470
This is the US Women's
National Soccer Team.

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:39.061
And I know that soccer is not
the most popular sport here,

00:21:39.061 --> 00:21:41.060
although in Massachusetts,
it's probably better.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:42.730
But for those who don't
know how the game is played,

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.530
there are 11 people on one
side, 11 people in the other,

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:49.352
and they get the ball to the
other side and try to score.

00:21:49.352 --> 00:21:50.560
They can only use their feet.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.893
That's why it's called football,
it's the real football.

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.050
Except for the goalie.

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:57.620
The goalie is this
woman right here.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:58.870
They wear a different uniform.

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:02.176
Her name is Hope Solo,
she's a terrific goalie.

00:22:02.176 --> 00:22:04.240
Yeah, anyway, there's
just-- good goalie.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.800
Leaving that aside.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.020
The goalie can catch
the ball with her hands.

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:11.920
Now for those who don't
know soccer, football,

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.490
the misconception is
that the way to win

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:18.460
is to have a great goalie
so that any time the ball's

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:21.290
coming at you, you
can save it, right?

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:23.390
But anybody who
knows football knows

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:25.640
that when you look
at a good goalie,

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:28.401
she is spending all her time
yelling at her teammates.

00:22:28.401 --> 00:22:29.900
And what she's
telling her teammates

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.840
is, get the ball away from me!

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:36.560
Because every goalie knows,
doesn't matter how good she is,

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:40.480
you are going to score on her
if the ball comes close enough.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.980
So the metaphor is this--

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:44.110
the goalie is medicine, right?

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:45.124
We want a good doctor.

00:22:45.124 --> 00:22:46.040
We want good medicine.

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.610
I want to be very clear on this.

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:50.470
As Sean said in my introduction,
I started my life in medicine.

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:52.594
When I'm sick I want a
great I want a great doctor,

00:22:52.594 --> 00:22:53.590
I want a great goalie.

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:55.798
But I would rather the ball
never comes near the net.

00:22:55.798 --> 00:22:56.780
And how do you do that?

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:59.485
Well, that's was for the
other 10 players are about.

00:22:59.485 --> 00:23:02.290
And those other 10 players
are those other dimensions

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:04.420
that I mentioned and
blind Willie's story.

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:08.350
They are the racism,
they are the violence,

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:10.960
they are the homelessness,
they are the poverty.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.815
They are what we're
under-investing in

00:23:12.815 --> 00:23:13.660
in Massachusetts.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:17.150
Early childhood education,
public parks, public safety.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.160
That's what those
other 10 players are.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:23.757
And that is what ultimately is
the core combination of causes

00:23:23.757 --> 00:23:25.590
of health, and that's
what we misunderstand.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:26.590
So, issue one.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:29.700
We misunderstand
the cause of health.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.690
Issue two.

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:35.440
This leads us to focus
on the urgent rather than

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.380
the important.

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:37.630
So let me just talk a little
bit about a couple of things

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:39.010
that are potentially important.

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:41.991
And actually, this
echoes one of the

00:23:41.991 --> 00:23:43.990
lectures you're going to
be having in the series

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.615
later, obesity.

00:23:44.615 --> 00:23:46.210
Let's talk about
obesity for a second.

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:48.220
You have a lecture, I think,
called the obesity epidemic.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:50.022
I just want to show
you one slide that--

00:23:50.022 --> 00:23:50.980
three slides, actually.

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.438
I've captured the
obesity epidemic.

00:23:52.438 --> 00:23:55.150
I'm sure you'll see
this in that lecture.

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:58.317
This is obesity
in the US in 1990,

00:23:58.317 --> 00:24:00.400
and the darker the color
is, the more the obesity.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.070
All I want you to see
here is, in 1990, you

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:05.620
had several states that
had about 10 to 15%

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:07.740
of their residents
who were obese.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:09.630
There was 1990.

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:11.680
Jump to 2000.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.630
Now you have a lot
of states-- actually,

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:16.652
only one state is even in
that range, 10% to 15%.

00:24:16.652 --> 00:24:18.610
15 to 19% in all these
states, and these states

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:20.620
are all 20% to 25%.

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:27.520
And you jump to 2010 where 20
to 25%, 25-19, more than 30%.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.410
That's over 20-- what did I say?

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:30.150
1990 to 2010.

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:30.910
20 years, right?

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:31.840
20 years.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:35.350
Just to be clear,
20 years is a blink

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:37.880
of an eye in human
time span right?

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.000
Like, for all of us,
our life's been short.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:40.600
Twenty years is a long time.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.140
But it's actually not.

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.640
Life-- 20 years is [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.830
So this is a problem, right?

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:47.750
This is a problem.

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:48.690
Over 20 years.

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:53.040
Now, let me ask this question.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:59.190
What has not changed about
humans in the past 20 years?

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:02.410
One thing that has not changed?

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:04.350
What do you think
has not changed?

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:05.670
I know you can think of all
many things that have changed.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:06.710
I mean, something's
changed, right?

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:08.090
I mean, something's changed.

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.390
I mean, we're all fatter,
so something's changed.

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:11.760
If there's a cause,
something's changed.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.410
Tell me something
that has not changed.

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:17.995
Genetics, right.

00:25:17.995 --> 00:25:18.620
So the obvious.

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:19.661
You got there right away!

00:25:19.661 --> 00:25:22.142
So therefore, given
this epidemic, of course

00:25:22.142 --> 00:25:23.600
it makes sense that
we're not going

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.190
to invest more and
more in genetics,

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:27.490
because clearly genetics
can't explain this, right?

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:31.444
So, you know, we launched a
Precision Medicine Initiative,

00:25:31.444 --> 00:25:32.860
also called
personalized medicine,

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.040
and this is our funding in
genetics over the past 10

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.900
years.

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.040
Now you say, OK, OK, OK.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.610
Well that's-- you're
making a strawman argument,

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:46.060
because of course we are aware
of this epidemic and realize

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.570
it's bad, so our funding
and everything else has also

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:49.530
increased, right?

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:51.887
Because you know, for
example, that things like this

00:25:51.887 --> 00:25:52.470
have happened.

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:55.080
Look at this food, 20 years,
the number of calories, today;

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:58.710
a bagel has gone from
140 to 250 calories.

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:00.509
Cheeseburger, my
favorite, has almost

00:26:00.509 --> 00:26:01.800
doubled the number of calories.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.610
Pasta-- don't even go pasta.

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:05.490
it's 500s.

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:07.290
So those are things
that have changed.

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:11.010
So surely, understanding
this, what we have done

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:12.930
is, we have spent more
on these things, right?

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:14.263
More on research in these areas?

00:26:14.263 --> 00:26:16.860
And the answer is, not really.

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:23.450
So we have focused on
areas that, I think,

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:27.500
are urgent and not important.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.030
I think it's discovery science.

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:30.140
I want to be very clear--

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:32.348
discovery science, the
Precision Medicine Initiative,

00:26:32.348 --> 00:26:34.070
has tremendous potential.

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:37.160
And I want to be very careful
in my comments, that in no way

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.260
am I saying we should
not be doing that.

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:43.100
I'm simply saying that we are
investing in the wrong areas

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:45.650
if one comes from a
place of understanding

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:49.490
the core causes of
health states, which

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:53.200
is why this is ultimately framed
around the core cause of health

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.029
states.

00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:55.070
So is the second problem.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:58.320
And the third problem is this.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:03.860
This has resulted in a loss
of confidence in our science.

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:07.940
And this is a very simple
cartoon which I quite like,

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:10.840
which is the newscaster saying,
according to a report released

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:13.610
today coffee can cause
depression in twins,

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:15.155
but equally well,
he could have said

00:27:15.155 --> 00:27:18.530
day care causes a feeling of
well-being in men 25 to 40.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.290
This matters!

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:30.860
This matters because I often
ask our faculty and students

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:32.780
this question.

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:38.930
Whose job it is but ours
to communicate the causes

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:40.680
of the health of populations?

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:46.160
It is ultimately the fundamental
job of those in the Academy.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:51.020
So if we are, A,
misunderstanding the causes; B,

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.720
focusing on urgent
but not important;

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.230
C, that inevitably is leading
to loss of confidence in us,

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:59.030
which leads to
poor communication

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:01.550
of these causes, which
means that society will not

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:03.980
be acting appropriately.

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.330
So those are the three problems.

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:08.360
Now, I promised I would
actually say, OK, what should we

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.650
be doing instead?

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:12.790
Let me start my
three part argument.

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:18.250
Number one, we should be
focusing on what matters most.

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:23.200
And when I was reviewing
my slides, which I

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.630
created a couple of weeks ago--

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:26.713
and I was reviewing them
yesterday and [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:26.713 --> 00:28:28.906
today, I realized
that the example

00:28:28.906 --> 00:28:30.655
I chose in what matters
most as an example

00:28:30.655 --> 00:28:32.210
is even more poignant
today than when

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:34.540
I created my slides, because
it's one about firearms.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:39.010
I had created the slides before
the Las Vegas horror happened.

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:43.000
So we all realize that
there is a firearm injury

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.090
problem in this country.

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:46.840
And I'm using choosing
my words carefully.

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.060
It's a nonpartisan
comment, it's simply

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.787
an epidemiologic comment, OK?

00:28:51.787 --> 00:28:53.620
And just to show one
simple example, I mean,

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.700
this is our rate of gun
deaths in children and teens.

00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:00.550
I'm choosing children and teens,
assuming that by and large they

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:03.520
are not complicit in
their own gun death

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.940
and this is the US versus
all other countries.

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:16.040
So when gun deaths happen, there
is a great collective gnashing

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.250
of teeth and disagreement on
anything except for one thing,

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:20.870
and one thing alone-- and that
one thing that we generally

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:23.120
agree on is this-- is that
actually, what we should do

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.380
is make sure that
guns don't make it

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.330
into the hands of people
with mental illness.

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:26.830
Right?

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:29.240
There is broad bipartisan
agreement on that,

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:32.250
and everybody says yes,
that is the problem.

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:35.180
Let's make sure that no
crazy people get guns.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.190
So we'll deal with
our gun problem.

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:39.570
So you might say, OK, well,
does that really matter?

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:41.690
I mean, when you look at
the psychiatric evidence,

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:43.282
people with
psychiatric disorders--

00:29:43.282 --> 00:29:44.990
more psychiatric
disorders-- are, indeed,

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:47.270
more likely to be
violent than people

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:49.040
without psychiatric disorders.

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:49.880
There is also, by
the way, people

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:50.840
with psychiatric
disorders are much more

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.173
likely to become victims of
violence than those without,

00:29:53.173 --> 00:29:56.690
but just to label it, this
is epidemiologically correct.

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:59.210
So as a result, you
get an avalanche of us

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:01.490
saying, OK, let's make sure
people with mental illness

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:03.230
do not get access to guns.

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:07.100
So national instant check
system is, essentially,

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:08.829
checking to make sure
that people are not

00:30:08.829 --> 00:30:11.120
eligible for guns, and this
has increased dramatically,

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.770
a lot of that because
of mental health check.

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:13.920
So the question is this--

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.170
is that likely to matter much?

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:19.232
Well, you know, we have a handy
little experiment here, the US.

00:30:19.232 --> 00:30:20.690
But we compare
ourselves to Canada.

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:22.648
I don't know if any of
you have been to Canada,

00:30:22.648 --> 00:30:24.530
but for Americans who
have been to Canada,

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:28.190
Canada is just a
lot like the US.

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:31.760
It's only people
like hockey more.

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:34.810
So you say, OK,
what's the prevalence

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:35.949
of psychiatric disorders?

00:30:35.949 --> 00:30:37.490
What's mental illness
like in Canada?

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:39.360
So this is the US,
this is Canada.

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:41.410
Bipolar disorder and major
depression and anxiety

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:42.820
disorder roughly the same.

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:43.840
It's a little bit
higher in the US,

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.298
but that's not
unreasonable, seeing

00:30:45.298 --> 00:30:48.190
as you can't go to a concert
without getting killed.

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:50.270
So broadly, we're the same.

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:53.511
And this is our
firearm homicide rate.

00:30:53.511 --> 00:30:54.010
Right?

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:55.240
So what causes the difference?

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.110
So what's causing
the difference?

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:58.980
Well, here is the proportion
of households owning firearms.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:00.160
That's the US versus Canada.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.640
So-- and this is--

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.982
I'm reducing a complex
argument, making it very simple.

00:31:04.982 --> 00:31:06.440
But if you want a
complex argument,

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.439
there are papers that
make the complex argument.

00:31:08.439 --> 00:31:10.870
It's very, very clear
that what matters

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:13.840
most in the context of firearm
and the firearm epidemic

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:17.300
in the US is firearm
availability.

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:20.170
Now, we can have a
charged political argument

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:23.020
about what to do about
that, but let us not

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.980
allow ourselves to get
distracted by issues

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.720
that actually do not matter.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.175
Because what matters most
is firearm availability.

00:31:31.175 --> 00:31:32.050
Period.

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:34.360
Solution one, focus
on what matters most.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:38.215
Solution two, embrace approaches
to deal with complexity.

00:31:38.215 --> 00:31:39.730
Now, this is very unpopular.

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:42.320
This is the most unpopular part
of my talk, I realize that.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.460
Because you came here--

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.120
astonishingly, even though
epidemiology was in the title--

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:51.100
and epidemiology gives
this impression like,

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:52.450
going to find a cause.

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:53.710
We're going to find one cause.

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:55.564
And I'm here to tell you--

00:31:55.564 --> 00:31:57.730
I hope you're seeing that
was the theme of my talk--

00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:59.677
there is no "a cause."

00:31:59.677 --> 00:32:00.760
There are multiple causes.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.080
There are architectures
of causes.

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.330
It's all really complicated,
and not just complicated,

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:05.420
it's actually complex.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.320
And that's why I
show you one example.

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:11.010
So let us for a second
as I presume, if I may,

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:15.220
that, since you all decided to
spend an hour plus of your time

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:20.080
on a lovely Monday afternoon
at the Radcliffes Institute,

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.830
you're all pretty smart.

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:23.710
OK?

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:25.650
Actually, when I put it
that way, it sounds--

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:27.920
but anyway, you you
know what I mean.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.920
So I'm going to ask
you one question, OK?

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.530
A very simple
question, which is,

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:34.050
how much of your
cognitive ability--

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:37.150
that's a polite word
for brains, smarts--

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:38.670
is determined by your genes.

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:41.709
So, put another way, everybody
here is sophisticated.

00:32:41.709 --> 00:32:44.000
You all understand complex
causes, et cetera et cetera,

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:44.040
right?

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:45.070
I settled that.

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:46.040
So here's my question.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.725
What percent of your IQ--

00:32:48.725 --> 00:32:51.100
I'm just reducing it-- do you
think is due to your genes?

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:54.160
Now, I would like you all
to be honest with yourselves

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.220
and write it down or come up
with an answer, because then

00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:59.150
I'm going to back to it, OK?

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:01.650
You need to be honest
about what your answer is,

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:03.066
so I'm going to
give you a second.

00:33:03.066 --> 00:33:07.417
What percent of your IQ
is due to your genes?

00:33:07.417 --> 00:33:08.250
I don't know, it's--

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:09.620
I'm not taking
questions now, sorry.

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.494
Now it's your time to
come up with an answer.

00:33:11.494 --> 00:33:13.820
I'll come back afterwards.

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.130
Everybody has an answer?

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:18.587
Yes So let me just
show you a schematic.

00:33:18.587 --> 00:33:19.420
Here's my schematic.

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:20.836
I'm going to answer
this question.

00:33:20.836 --> 00:33:23.110
These are people, again,
as I showed before.

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:27.100
And I'm going to
assume that two things

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:31.380
matter for your IQ, your genes
and your environment, right?

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:34.684
I'm reducing things, but
it seems plausible, right?

00:33:34.684 --> 00:33:36.850
That your IQ is your genes
and your environment, OK?

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:42.180
So I'm going to
illustrate the smart gene

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:46.600
as the characters turn black
and the smartogenic environment

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.070
as the characters
being in green.

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:48.700
OK?

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:51.220
So smart gene is black,
smart environment is green,

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:53.450
and I'm going to assume
that, to be smart,

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:55.210
you need smart gene
and smart environment.

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:56.770
Now, there are
exceptions to this.

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:58.360
We all know people
who like, you know,

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.035
grew up in horrible environments
and they are still smart,

00:34:01.035 --> 00:34:02.660
you don't understand
how that happened.

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:05.260
So I'm going to throw in a
few random, like, super smart

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:06.670
people, just like that.

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:07.340
These reds.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.070
So CA plus is
cognitive ability plus,

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:11.320
which means they're smart,
and these people are smart.

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:13.719
But everybody else, apart from
these random smart people,

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:16.320
needs to have the gene and
the environment to be smart.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.000
OK?

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:17.500
That's it.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:18.520
So then you do a simulation.

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.020
So let's do a couple
of simulations.

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:22.900
Scenario one-- here's scenario
one, where the environment

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.190
is nearly universally good.

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:24.689
See this?

00:34:24.689 --> 00:34:25.630
All green.

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:27.020
These are the red smart people.

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:29.139
These are random smarts,
but then the black--

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:30.429
this is the same as the
genes I showed before.

00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:32.595
I'm showing them as dots
here just so you can see it

00:34:32.595 --> 00:34:33.620
across the green, OK?

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.880
So this is where
the smart genes are.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:37.690
But the smart gene,
smart environment,

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:39.830
that also becomes red, right?

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:41.330
So what do you see
in this scenario?

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:42.772
Well, what you see is--

00:34:42.772 --> 00:34:44.980
I just want to point out
for a second-- everybody who

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:48.580
had the smart gene
became smart, right?

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:51.429
Because everybody who was
black is also in green,

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:52.780
and they became red.

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:56.500
So everybody who had
the gene became smart.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:57.700
So when you do the math--

00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:59.824
I'm not going to bore with
the epidemiologic math--

00:34:59.824 --> 00:35:02.410
the relative risk of brains
given the gene is about four,

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:07.150
and the fraction of brains
attributed to genes is 100%.

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:08.050
Why is that?

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:10.630
Just intuitively, because
everybody who had the gene

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:12.396
became smart.

00:35:12.396 --> 00:35:15.020
Now you're beginning to smell a
rat, I can see it in your eyes.

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:17.750
Because now I'm going to show
you a different scenario.

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:20.470
Here's the same black
gene pattern, right?

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:22.670
See, the same--
this turning black,

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:24.110
here's the random smart people.

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:27.140
Only these two now
actually overlap

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:29.510
with the smartogenic
environment.

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:31.460
So those two become red.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:32.960
Now I have a situation
where there's

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:38.040
a lot of people with the smart
gene, and they're not smart.

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.120
So when you do the math,
relative risk of 1.7,

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.100
the proportion is about 40%.

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:50.400
So the answer to the question,
what percent of your IQ

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.290
is due to your genes--

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:57.760
the only correct answer to that
is, it depends on what else

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.250
also causes smarts.

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:03.340
Now, I want an
honest show of hands.

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:06.430
How many people- hold
yourself accountable--

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:09.370
said to yourselves
that was the answer.

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:12.400
How many of you said
that was the answer?

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.144
Yeah.

00:36:13.144 --> 00:36:14.810
It's usually-- in an
audience like this,

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:16.610
it's usually 10% to 20%.

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:19.204
I would like to point out that
I didn't trick you, right?

00:36:19.204 --> 00:36:20.120
I didn't-- I did say--

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:23.150
I told you exactly
what I want you to say

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:26.684
and you were entirely within
your domain to say it depends.

00:36:26.684 --> 00:36:28.850
But most of us-- by the
way, I do this all the time,

00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:30.766
and every single time I
give myself a present,

00:36:30.766 --> 00:36:32.720
because it's so easy
to think that way.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:38.170
The only point I'm making is
that you simply cannot say how

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:42.299
much of your brains is due
to your genes unless you know

00:36:42.299 --> 00:36:42.840
other things.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.423
I didn't change the
genes here at all.

00:36:44.423 --> 00:36:46.371
All I changed was
the environment.

00:36:46.371 --> 00:36:47.870
By the way, is this
all theoretical?

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:49.536
Is this all epidemiologic
flim flammery?

00:36:49.536 --> 00:36:50.410
Or No, it's not.

00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:52.640
There's actually abundant
data to show this.

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:57.380
This is actually plotting IQ
variance on SES due to genes.

00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:04.970
So actually, the richer
people are, the more likely

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:07.707
it is that, the math
shows, that genes matter.

00:37:07.707 --> 00:37:09.290
Because of course
it's the same thing,

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:11.430
that you have actually
a positive environment.

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:13.880
Let me go back to the other
topic, actually, before.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.700
This is obesity.

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.720
This is a fat David.

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.084
What does complexity mean?

00:37:21.084 --> 00:37:22.250
Do genes matter for obesity?

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:23.600
Of course genes
matter for obesity.

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.340
But do food environments
matter for obesity?

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:26.090
Of course they do.

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:28.067
There's a map of New
York City that looks

00:37:28.067 --> 00:37:29.150
at poor food environments.

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:31.760
These are zip codes in New
York City where there is

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.530
only unhealthy food available--

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:36.530
South Bronx, northern
Manhattan, central Brooklyn.

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:39.290
By the way, they happen
to be the areas that

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:41.747
also have most obesity.

00:37:41.747 --> 00:37:44.330
There's been a lot written about
the food environments lately.

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:46.010
But how about
things like schools?

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:47.594
Where are the bad
schools, by the way?

00:37:47.594 --> 00:37:49.385
Where are the bad
schools in New York City?

00:37:49.385 --> 00:37:51.660
Well, they're in the South
Bronx, northern Manhattan,

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:52.520
central Brooklyn.

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.510
Same area.

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:54.099
So, questions.

00:37:54.099 --> 00:37:56.390
What's the greatest return
investment to lower obesity,

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:57.990
better food or better schools?

00:37:57.990 --> 00:38:00.050
And these are the kind
of complex questions

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:03.350
that I actually
think that we should

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:05.249
be tackling if we
want to understand

00:38:05.249 --> 00:38:06.540
the cost of health and disease.

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:08.930
And this is a-- sort of one
analysis that's actually--

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:10.010
the answer to that
question is, if you're

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:12.495
going invest in something
you should invest in schools.

00:38:12.495 --> 00:38:13.620
That's the second solution.

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:15.578
So the first solution is
focus on what matters,

00:38:15.578 --> 00:38:18.050
second solution is accept
the fact that complexity

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:20.010
is inevitable and
somehow deal with it,

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:21.920
and third solution,
which is-- now I'm

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.960
really veering from--
remember in the beginning,

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.210
I said this is not an
academic epidemiology talk.

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:27.650
This is not about what happens
in academic epidemiology

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:28.850
departments and
it's not a critique

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:30.391
of academic epidemiology
departments.

00:38:30.391 --> 00:38:32.780
it is simply taking
epidemiology at face value

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:36.150
as being about understanding
what causes health.

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:40.050
And ultimately, what causes
health is inextricably

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:42.145
tied with our values.

00:38:42.145 --> 00:38:43.770
It's inextricably
tied with our values,

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:49.590
and there is this conflation of
our values with the mathematics

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:51.890
of the causes of health,
and the two are inseparable.

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:53.550
Because ultimately,
if we are not

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:56.670
allowing ourselves to go back to
the Blind Willy story, and say,

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:58.700
we want to deal with
the homelessness,

00:38:58.700 --> 00:38:59.940
want to deal with the poverty,
want to deal with the racism,

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:02.070
because without them we're
not going to improve health.

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:03.960
If we say we actually
don't care about that--

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.670
all we care about
is fixing malaria--

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:08.730
and if Blind Willie happens to
be black, poor, and homeless,

00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:09.960
that's his problem.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.970
If that's what we're
willing to say,

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:13.684
then it changes the
entire conversation.

00:39:13.684 --> 00:39:16.350
And that this is a schema which,
actually, I published recently,

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:19.742
which talks about the
challenge that we have

00:39:19.742 --> 00:39:20.950
in thinking about our values.

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:22.449
And all I want to
just show here is,

00:39:22.449 --> 00:39:25.800
there's sort of a spectrum of,
we don't have enough evidence

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.620
and we know what to
do; and over here is,

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:31.960
we actually think this is an
acceptable way to operate;

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.170
and this, we don't
know what's acceptable.

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:36.870
So just give an example, polio
eradication is an example.

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:39.090
We broadly know what
to do eradicate polio,

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:41.950
and we all accept that's
a good thing to do.

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:43.180
Zika is a good example.

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.070
I heard you say somebody is
coming to talk about Zika.

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:46.690
We don't really have
all the evidence,

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:49.360
although we all agree that we
should do something about Zika.

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.550
Now we're getting into
messier territory.

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:53.470
Injection drug use.

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:58.570
We know that syringe exchange
reduces the harms of injection

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:02.020
drug use, and yet, we are
squeamish about expanding

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:04.760
syringe exchange, resulting in
worsening of many infections

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.550
diseases epidemics,
like the HIV epidemic.

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:09.490
And then, I put it here,
where we don't actually

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:10.990
know enough about
what we should do,

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:13.190
and we actually don't
know what we value or not.

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:14.110
And of course, the
reason we don't

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:16.317
know enough of what we'll
do is because of the fact

00:40:16.317 --> 00:40:18.400
that funding in the area
has been hampered because

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.610
of very particular interests.

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:24.304
OK, so, now I'm going to
sort of start winding down.

00:40:24.304 --> 00:40:26.470
So, I outlined three problems,
[INAUDIBLE] solution.

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:29.420
You say, OK, but how will
this then change our approach?

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:32.720
So supposing you're right,
which is a big supposition,

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:35.040
how would this approach
change what we do?

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:39.370
Well, we know a lot of
things that, actually, we

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:40.930
can do to improve health.

00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:42.504
We know a lot of
causes of health.

00:40:42.504 --> 00:40:44.170
I go back to definition
of epidemiology,

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:45.160
understanding the
causes of health

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.493
so we may do something about it.

00:40:46.493 --> 00:40:49.270
We actually do know
things we can do.

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:51.220
Just to give you
a couple examples.

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:54.790
We have evidence that shows
that if we expand the transit

00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:57.460
development in a city of a
million residents by about 40%,

00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:00.100
we end up saving about
$200 million in health.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:02.940
And by the way, I have
citations for all of these,

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:05.710
and I specifically
took these examples

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:08.322
from examples the CDC
has on their website,

00:41:08.322 --> 00:41:10.030
just so that you don't
think I'm actually

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:13.047
digging into some journal
[? Academia Obscura. ?]

00:41:13.047 --> 00:41:15.130
This is actually-- this
is all on the CDC website.

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:16.150
OK?

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.990
Number two.

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:18.910
We do know that
financial support

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:22.250
to create better housing
doubles the proportion of people

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:24.790
with excellent health.

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:28.120
We do know that multi
component work site

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:31.510
obesity prevention programs,
result in about a five percent

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:34.030
weight loss in workers resulting
in $90 average per person

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:35.740
saving a year.

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:37.900
We do know that early
childhood education has

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:40.470
a five-to-one benefit
to cost ratio,

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:42.970
and we do know that every time
we increase the Earned Income

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:45.010
Tax Credit by 10%, we
drop infant mortality

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:47.230
by 23 per 100,000.

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:49.000
These are data that we have.

00:41:51.592 --> 00:41:55.170
So why don't we do this?

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:56.840
I mean, my argument
is very simple.

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.790
I go back to the
beginning, which is,

00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:04.120
we have not been clear about
what the causes of health are,

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:06.106
we have not focused
on what's important--

00:42:06.106 --> 00:42:07.480
we're focused only
on the urgent,

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:09.100
rather than what's important--

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:11.150
we have lost public confidence.

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:13.155
But if we focused
on what matters,

00:42:13.155 --> 00:42:15.280
if we actually understood
that the causes of health

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:19.090
are complex, and we make sure
that our values were aligned

00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:20.650
with what we know,
we would do this.

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:23.110
There's no reason why
we would not do this.

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:25.829
Now, just to be honest, one of
the reasons we don't do it--

00:42:25.829 --> 00:42:27.370
and let's just be
honest about this--

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:30.700
is that somewhere in
the back of our minds,

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:33.790
there is this notion that, yeah,
yeah, yeah, OK, that's good,

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:38.780
but I'm smart enough
and well-off enough

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:41.930
that I don't need any of this,
because I can insulate myself

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:44.080
from this badness.

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.120
So just briefly, can you really?

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:47.350
Can you really ?

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:49.960
Unless you can wrap
yourself in bubble wrap,

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:51.010
i don't think you can.

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:52.830
Just give a couple of examples.

00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:55.060
Up to 50,000 people have
died from flu since 2010.

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:56.830
This is largely
vaccine preventable,

00:42:56.830 --> 00:42:59.650
and in no small part driven
by herd immunity around you.

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:02.440
I'm not even going to get into
children dying of a vaccine

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:03.940
preventable disease
because people around them

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:05.065
are not getting vaccinated.

00:43:05.065 --> 00:43:06.930
How about children dying
from car accidents?

00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:08.800
10% of kids killed
by motor vehicles

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:11.890
are actually killed by
completely unrelated alcohol

00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:13.502
impaired drivers.

00:43:13.502 --> 00:43:15.940
This is a slide
which I always enjoy.

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:18.449
Your risk of cavities
increases by 15%

00:43:18.449 --> 00:43:19.990
if you don't drink
fluoridated water.

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:21.770
One-third of the
country, by the way,

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:23.961
does not have sufficiently
fluoridated water.

00:43:23.961 --> 00:43:26.210
Do you know if your water
is sufficiently fluoridated?

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:29.090
How many of you have
checked that recently?

00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:31.850
I will not comment about
the Republic of Cambridge.

00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:33.680
And, by the way, we
also know that you

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:36.260
know your risk of becoming
obese is influenced quite a bit

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:37.250
by your friends.

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:38.972
So just a very
simple point that,

00:43:38.972 --> 00:43:41.180
if you think you can insulate
yourself from all this,

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:43.400
you really cannot.

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:44.930
So let me conclude.

00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:49.310
So, at the end of the
day, you came here

00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:53.450
to hear about the
causes of health

00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:56.990
and why understanding those
causes has consequences for us,

00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:59.270
and I just want to
end with a schema that

00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:04.040
shows that it is impossible
to improve health

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:08.074
without improving the fullness
of the causes around us,

00:44:08.074 --> 00:44:09.740
including the causes
that are not really

00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:11.910
about us, but around
the world around us.

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:15.400
So let me just go back to my
schema of sort of small people

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:15.900
here.

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:21.440
And I'm going to show you an
example with blue and red,

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:24.020
and these are the people
in the population.

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:29.180
And supposing supposing for
a second that we accept--

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:31.160
suppose you accept
everything I said.

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:32.612
And you say, OK,
OK, that's great.

00:44:32.612 --> 00:44:34.320
I get everything you
said, so we are just

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:35.140
going to tackle racism.

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:36.340
We are just going
to deal with racism.

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:36.839
OK?

00:44:36.839 --> 00:44:39.300
So you say, well, some
people experience more racism

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:40.140
and some people experience less.

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:42.930
Note I'm not saying all or none,
I'm just saying more and less.

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:45.930
So red, they're
experiencing more racism.

00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:48.370
And you say, look, that is
associated with disease.

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:51.480
So here there are Xs, right,
where there's disease.

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:54.520
And a bunch of people with
the red have Xs in them.

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:55.100
You see them?

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:57.180
They experience disease, and
some part [INAUDIBLE] racism,

00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:58.080
but some of the
people in the blue

00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.380
also have Xs, because
it's not just all or none;

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:02.850
it's just more racism
and less racism.

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:05.790
So that's the way
the world looks.

00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:09.500
Now let me just change it
to a simple curve like this.

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:12.150
So this is a simple bell curve.

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:14.570
And this is racism experience.

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:17.020
So let's say that modally--
this is the number of people.

00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:17.770
OK?

00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:20.103
So this is a lot of racism,
this is a little bit racism.

00:45:20.103 --> 00:45:22.860
Let's say that most people
experience somewhere

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:23.690
in the middle.

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:26.290
Some people experience a lot,
some people experience less.

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:27.440
And you say, I get it.

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.690
I get what you're saying.

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:31.776
So I'm really-- I just think all
we should focus on is racism.

00:45:31.776 --> 00:45:33.400
So let us actually
deal with the people

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:34.691
who experience a lot of racism.

00:45:34.691 --> 00:45:37.510
Let's draw a line and
focus on that group,

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:42.040
and if we really work at it, we
are actually going to fix that,

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:44.760
and nobody else is going
experience so much racism.

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:45.260
Right?

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:46.676
So in some respects,
that could be

00:45:46.676 --> 00:45:49.132
the conclusion of what I said.

00:45:49.132 --> 00:45:50.340
What's the problem with that?

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:55.020
The problem with that is that
that strategy, going back

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:57.280
to my world I showed you
before, sees only this.

00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.988
Because it's only
dealing with the people

00:45:58.988 --> 00:46:01.110
with more racism, which
are the red people, right?

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:03.750
Some of whom have disease
as a result of racism.

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:06.840
But it's missing
all of those people,

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:09.390
because you just
ignored them altogether.

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:13.740
The alternate strategy
is to say, that's racism.

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:15.960
And ultimately, it
comes as a complex

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:17.370
with all sorts of other things.

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:19.170
Yes, access to care.

00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:20.520
Yes, homelessness.

00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:21.690
Yes, poverty.

00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:23.190
Yes, not having adequate food.

00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:24.060
All of these things
come together,

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:25.476
and what we really
should be doing

00:46:25.476 --> 00:46:29.310
is shifting the entire curve,
and that everybody experiences

00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:31.170
a little bit less racism.

00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:35.010
Because if we did that in the
population health strategy,

00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:37.562
we actually are looking
at the whole population,

00:46:37.562 --> 00:46:39.270
and any of the days,
what we're doing is,

00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:42.000
we're reducing racism
experienced by people

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.660
from all over the population.

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:45.940
And if you'll remember,
that's where I started.

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:47.523
That's the slide I
started with, where

00:46:47.523 --> 00:46:50.220
I said we care about
the whole population,

00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:53.550
and we care about
reducing experiences

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:58.200
that can produce poor health
in the whole population.

00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.130
And that gives us a
healthier population.

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:07.120
So I'm going to end
with my last metaphor,

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:09.140
and this is my pet goldfish.

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:11.454
So, as you heard in
the introduction,

00:47:11.454 --> 00:47:13.370
for the past few years,
I've had the privilege

00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:14.839
of having a dean job.

00:47:14.839 --> 00:47:16.255
And the problem
with a dean job is

00:47:16.255 --> 00:47:18.046
it's very busy,
particularly combining that

00:47:18.046 --> 00:47:19.310
with one's own scholarship.

00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:22.870
So I don't have much time for a
pet, but I do have a goldfish.

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:24.750
And I love my goldfish.

00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:28.220
And I want my goldfish
to be healthy.

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:31.220
So I say to my
goldfish, we're going

00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:34.720
to genotype you to figure out
that we understand your genome,

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.470
so that when you are
sick, we can give you

00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:39.170
the perfect
personalized medicine

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:42.860
for your particular
little fishy disease.

00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:45.332
I say to my goldfish,
you need to exercise.

00:47:45.332 --> 00:47:47.040
So I want you to swim
10 times clockwise,

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:49.090
10 times counterclockwise in
your little bowl every day.

00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:51.290
And when I feed you little
flaky food, don't eat too much,

00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:51.890
don't get fat.

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:53.580
And when you have a
goldfish companion,

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:55.121
make sure you have
safe goldfish sex.

00:47:55.121 --> 00:47:57.506
I say all these
things to my goldfish.

00:47:57.506 --> 00:47:58.630
And I'm like, OK, I got it.

00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:59.534
I nailed this.

00:47:59.534 --> 00:48:01.200
And one day, I walk
into my living room,

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.230
my goldfish is dead.

00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:04.330
How could she be dead?

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:05.080
I'm so distraught!

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:05.820
And there it is.

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:06.570
Ah!

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:08.034
I forgot to change its water.

00:48:08.034 --> 00:48:09.450
Doesn't matter
everything else you

00:48:09.450 --> 00:48:10.270
do-- if you don't
change its water,

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:11.610
the goldfish is going to die.

00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:13.560
So the point is--
what's the point?

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:16.674
The point is, if we care
about the core definition

00:48:16.674 --> 00:48:18.840
of epidemiology, understanding
the causes of health,

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:20.784
the causes of
health are complex.

00:48:20.784 --> 00:48:22.200
The causes of
health ultimately do

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.820
involve the water, as well
as the fish's behavior,

00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:25.260
as well as the fish's genome.

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:25.980
Going to to Blind
Willie Johnson,

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:27.050
we need to care
about the malaria,

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:28.030
we need to care
about homelessness,

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:30.113
care about racism, we need
to care about violence.

00:48:30.113 --> 00:48:31.935
And unfortunately,
unfortunately, I

00:48:31.935 --> 00:48:34.350
am here to tell you that
there is no magic bullet.

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:36.450
And the reason why
American health indicators

00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:37.890
have been as bad
as they have been

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:40.410
is because we have focused
on only one aspect of this.

00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:43.410
That if we are serious
about improving health,

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:46.170
we need to take epidemiology
to its core definition,

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:48.660
understand the full range
of complex causes of health,

00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:50.452
and work on all of
them at the same time.

00:48:50.452 --> 00:48:52.410
If anybody actually is
still interested in what

00:48:52.410 --> 00:48:54.630
I have to say, this is my
latest book that just came out,

00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:56.180
which actually has a
lot of these ideas.

00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:56.700
And that's it.

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:57.325
I'll stop here.

00:48:57.325 --> 00:48:58.290
Thank you very much.

00:48:58.290 --> 00:49:00.390
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:05.240
