WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.330
You as a leader,
right?
There's actually

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:06.880
millions

3
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.650
<v 1>of people that follow you,
right,
that listened to you,</v>

4
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.190
that respect what you say.
And they,

5
00:00:16.191 --> 00:00:20.680
they truly follow your lead.
I mean,
clearly they follow your lead.

6
00:00:20.681 --> 00:00:25.600
We saw this with,
uh,
with the,
the launch of,
or the release,
what's it called?

7
00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:28.120
When a book comes out when my book comes out.
Yeah,

8
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.050
you'd kind of predicted everything that was going to happen to a tee of like
VIP.

9
00:00:32.051 --> 00:00:34.570
When we talk about this book,
it's going to,
you can people go and buy it.

10
00:00:34.571 --> 00:00:39.190
That's got it.
And so people clearly follow you and listen to what you say

11
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.490
as a leader.
And I don't know if you've perceived herself that way,

12
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.310
but you are a leader.

13
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.910
<v 0>Two questions.
One,
where do you think he falls short and too</v>

14
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.010
in more important,
where are you trying to lead people?

15
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.270
Yeah,
these are good.
Uh,
so I haven't thought of myself as a leader,
uh,
but

16
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.700
I think that two terms sometimes get used interchangeably and I view them as

17
00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:18.870
very different.
So as a leader,

18
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.900
if I'm looking through that lens at myself,

19
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.220
I think I'm very good at

20
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.050
affecting national conversations and steering the attention of groups to one

21
00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:35.430
thing for sustained periods of time.

22
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.520
I think I'm very good at that and helping people to prioritize.

23
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.240
If I were to view myself as a manager,

24
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.380
I think I have many deficiencies.
Uh,

25
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.250
and one of them would be,

26
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.810
and this has been a help and a hindrance,
as many things are,

27
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.080
uh,
inpatients,

28
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.950
I have extremely high standards and hold myself to just,

29
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.313
<v 2>yeah,</v>

30
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.930
<v 0>a ridiculous degree of expectation for perfection,</v>

31
00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:14.080
which of course leads to a lot of the problems we've talked about earlier.

32
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.060
But on the flip side,

33
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.740
I get a lot done in part I think because of that is,

34
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.800
is a driver that can also damage relationships very quickly and it can,

35
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.170
in a management environment,
uh,

36
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.040
cause hurt feelings and people to not put forth their best because they feel

37
00:02:33.041 --> 00:02:38.041
like they are being criticized and not lauded for their successes.

38
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.010
And in part that is because as an athlete,
I really,

39
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.403
and hope,

40
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.180
hopefully it doesn't sound weird or I don't really care if it sounds weird,

41
00:02:46.181 --> 00:02:49.930
it actually in sports and in business,
my general feeling was,

42
00:02:49.931 --> 00:02:53.530
and I remember mentor early on said something like this to me.
He said,

43
00:02:53.531 --> 00:02:56.380
don't tell me about the good stuff.
The good stuff takes care of itself.

44
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.700
Just tell me about the bad stuff.

45
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.420
And that's been my personal policy for myself,

46
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.610
but that does not always translate well to team environments.

47
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.550
So that,
that I think is my,
my,
my homework that,
uh,

48
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:13.180
and,

49
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.180
and a deficit that I've been working hard to correct for the last few years is

50
00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:23.971
getting better at managing people who do not necessarily conform to that mindset

51
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:27.400
at all times,
which I think can be,
uh,

52
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.580
a big problem when it's,
when it's out of control,
but that,

53
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:32.320
that would be the biggest deficit.
But if we're,

54
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:37.321
if we're defining leader as someone who can put forth a vision or an objective

55
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.730
or catalyze a movement and move attention and people in one direction,

56
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.040
I feel like I'm,
I'm quite good at,
at,

57
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.600
at mitigating the risk of that.
Uh,

58
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.890
because for instance,
people think that the haters,

59
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.190
this is a very popular word on the Internet and not all critics are haters of

60
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:03.520
course,
important to be able to take criticism and feedback,

61
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.580
but many people who were thrust into a position where they have the opportunity

62
00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:13.540
to lead people virtually on a,
on the Internet,
which is a huge responsibility.

63
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.310
And I take it extremely seriously,
worry about,

64
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.840
say their detractors causing problems.
It's not the detractors in my experience.

65
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:26.320
They can do the most damage.
It's the die hard fans who get the message wrong,

66
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.710
who get the directive and misinterpreted that that is where you have to do

67
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:35.080
damage control and to think ahead.
So I think,

68
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.930
I think I'm quite good at that as far as where I'm leading people,

69
00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:42.220
if I'm leading them anywhere.
Uh,
I,

70
00:04:42.221 --> 00:04:45.640
I've always,
I shouldn't say always,
but for the last at least five years,

71
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.760
thought of my goal as creating a benevolent army of

72
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.230
super learners effectively who can teach intern 10 additional people each the

73
00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:01.834
same skillset.

74
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.120
So to propagate a toolkit that enables people to be elite problem solvers

75
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.980
instead of accidental,

76
00:05:11.981 --> 00:05:15.340
haphazard problem creators is,

77
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.970
has been my goal for at least the last five years.

78
00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:23.971
Explicitly teaching people how to learn so they can teach people how to learn.

79
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.660
That's right.
And part of learning is problem solving.

80
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.630
So you buy by definition,

81
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.410
getting people who are good at dissecting problems,
testing assumptions.

82
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.740
That's where I'm leading people now.
That's,

83
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.960
that's solid.
I mean that's obviously a really positive thing.

84
00:05:43.961 --> 00:05:45.700
I always talk about the fact that,
you know,

85
00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:48.580
I want to help people learn how to learn.

86
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.880
I talk about that all the time and I've said that before on the podcast.

87
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.690
We will teach people how to,
not,
not what to think,
but how to think.

88
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.890
Obviously,
I'm not

89
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.720
<v 1>the same scale that you are in terms of volume of masses of people,</v>

90
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:08.050
but there's definitely some people out there that I think are following me in

91
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:10.820
some way.
And that might be a strong word,

92
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:14.330
but I always think of that what I'm trying to get people to do,

93
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:16.070
if you're following me,

94
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.890
I'm really trying to get you to follow yourself and lead yourself.
I don't,

95
00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:26.360
I don't,
you know,
lead yourself.
Okay.
You see it my path.
That's cool.

96
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.050
My Path was good.
I like my path now.

97
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.710
Forged your path,
you know,
figure out where you want to go,

98
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:36.770
how you're going to get,
how you're going to get stronger,

99
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:38.750
how are you going to get faster,
how you're going to get smarter,

100
00:06:38.751 --> 00:06:42.050
how you're going to get,
how are you going to get better.

101
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:47.170
And I always think that those answers work best when they don't come from

102
00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:51.740
somebody else,
but when they'd come from yourself.
Absolutely.

103
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.710
And I think also the teaching people

104
00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.510
how to learn,
uh,
enabling

105
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.260
my audience to learn how to learn.

106
00:07:03.261 --> 00:07:08.210
And when I say that I mean 1,000 times faster than would be expected in a lot of

107
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.080
domains.
That's only one leg of the stool.
So let's say there are three legs,

108
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:17.110
the other two would be teaching them to dissect and manage fear and then the

109
00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:22.151
third leg would be teaching them to be emotionally aware and resilient in that I

110
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:27.491
think is covered largely by stoicism if you take it as a practice and not as

111
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.810
something to passively ingest.
Yeah.

112
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.880
And I just talked about stoicism on my last podcast because somebody hit me up

113
00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:38.420
on Twitter and says,
do you practice stoicism?
And I was like,
no,

114
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.350
I just said no because I pretty terse on Twitter and,

115
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.660
and the guy kind of wrote back,

116
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.660
I don't want to say he was offended and I don't want to rehash the whole story

117
00:07:47.661 --> 00:07:50.540
cause I just talked about in the last podcast.
But you know,
he said,
hey,

118
00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:54.440
well you know what's wrong with stoicism?
And I never wrote back.
I'm like,
man,

119
00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:57.260
there's nothing wrong with stoicism.
I,
I get it.

120
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:02.500
But for me to say that I practice it or even that I learned it from studying the

121
00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:06.110
agents is not true.
I didn't go to Princeton.
I,
you know,

122
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.620
I didn't study when I was in high school.
I wasn't an over achiever.

123
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.760
I was an underachiever.
I was,
uh,
I was up troublemaker.

124
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:19.330
So I didn't learn anything about stoicism until much later in my life.

125
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.520
My roots aren't,
my beliefs aren't founded on what I read.

126
00:08:22.521 --> 00:08:27.470
They're founded on what I lived.
And it's just,
it,

127
00:08:27.471 --> 00:08:30.260
does it make sense?
Yeah.
When I look at it now and people have always asked me,

128
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.630
are you going to do Marcus Aurelius on them?

129
00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.590
I'm going to do Marcus Aurelius on the podcast.

130
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:35.480
And really all I be saying is like,
look,

131
00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:39.770
Mark Israelis said this thousands of years before I did awesome.

132
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:44.990
And,
but I would love this,
be all educated,
but I wasn't.
I was just,

133
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.500
I went down the path that I went down and experience the things that I

134
00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:53.501
experienced in my life and I came to the same conclusions that these ancients

135
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:58.500
came to.
So it's an interesting dynamic.
No,
it is.

136
00:08:58.501 --> 00:09:03.420
And I think it's worth noting also that if you find anyone who is consistently

137
00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:08.421
good at operating at a high level in stressful environments,

138
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.480
the tools are the same.
Exactly.
I mean if you read one of my favorite books,

139
00:09:15.481 --> 00:09:20.340
Musashi historical fiction,
fantastic book,
it's all the same shit.

140
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.830
You read that stoicism,

141
00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:25.920
stoicism and Seneca was my real introduction but that didn't come into my life

142
00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:30.090
until 2004 so it was after graduation.

143
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.540
For those of you that want me to do Musashi on this podcast,

144
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.130
I'm not going to do it.

145
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.970
Not going to do Musashi and I'll tell you why and if you've read it,

146
00:09:38.971 --> 00:09:40.740
you know you can't.

147
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.460
You got to go through Musashi to get to the end,

148
00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.500
got to go through the whole thing to get the head.

149
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:51.390
It is one of the best rewards in all of literature to get to the end and the

150
00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:53.070
end.
This is a what's a,

151
00:09:53.071 --> 00:09:57.510
how many pages is Musashi's 978 massive book and it's,

152
00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.690
and you have to read the whole thing and it's all good.

153
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.420
But it all comes and it's literally,

154
00:10:03.421 --> 00:10:05.340
I think in my copy because I always laugh about this,

155
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.420
it is two or three pages from the end of the whole book.
It's weird.

156
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:13.530
You get to the end of Musashi where you go,
damn,

157
00:10:13.531 --> 00:10:16.270
that just happened on the pay office.

158
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.920
All the pay off is so good and the O and I'm not going to do it on here cause I

159
00:10:19.921 --> 00:10:22.620
obviously I'd have to give away the pay off and so I'm not going to do that.

160
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:26.730
And you have to go and read Musashi.
It's,
it's awesome.

161
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.360
And the ending is just as good as it gets.

162
00:10:30.361 --> 00:10:33.450
It's as good as it gets and it's historical fiction.
But that happened.

163
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:37.140
Oh that's documented.
Oh yeah.
And it doesn't get any better.

164
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.960
So read Musashi for yourself people.

165
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:45.470
Maybe I'll give a like a one year lead time and then I'll do it one year episode

166
00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.860
in 100 maybe we'll do give people enough heads up,

167
00:10:49.861 --> 00:10:51.970
episode 100 we'll go back and do massage if,

168
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:57.170
and I'll give you a spoiler alert at the beginning because massage is good when

169
00:10:57.181 --> 00:11:01.110
you get to the end.
And Go.
Yeah,
that kind of like the Matrix.

170
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:02.813
What's that?

171
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.590
Is there like a spoiler at the end of the Matrix?
Oh,

172
00:11:10.591 --> 00:11:13.640
does it end up thinking,
oh man,
I got to watch more movies.

173
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.520
Echo Charles movies.
Highly recommend babe involves a pig.

174
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.280
I think you'd like a junk,
didn't,
where do you do it?

175
00:11:19.281 --> 00:11:22.620
Did you watch that a bunch of times they've got some saved story,
right?

176
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:28.770
Yeah,
I do,
so I,
I tend to,
when I write books,
so then I don't feel isolated.

177
00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:32.190
I will generally I write late at night.
That's when I do my synthesis,

178
00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:33.510
so I can do research and interviews and so on,

179
00:11:33.511 --> 00:11:38.511
but I'll do my writing generally between 11:00 PM and 5:00 AM and so that I

180
00:11:38.701 --> 00:11:40.740
don't feel like I'm sitting in a cave by myself.

181
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:46.820
I will generally listen to the same track or same album over and over again for

182
00:11:48.871 --> 00:11:49.704
a given book.

183
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:54.340
That's how I focus and then I will have a movie playing mute in the background

184
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.220
<v 0>so that I feel like there are other people in the room now.</v>

185
00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.380
At one point I was like,
all right,

186
00:11:59.381 --> 00:12:03.070
I've seen the Bourne identity 5,000 times that I want to see it anymore.

187
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.370
I have seen,
because I was for the first book,
I've Seen Shaun of the dead,

188
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.770
which is a comedy 6,000 times.

189
00:12:08.771 --> 00:12:09.970
I don't want to watch that anymore cause I'll just say,

190
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
I'll just watch it on repeat.
So I might watch a movie five times a night.

191
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.220
He'll go,
let's go to Amazon prime.

192
00:12:15.221 --> 00:12:19.570
And I pull it up in the first movie that gets displayed as babe battled little

193
00:12:19.571 --> 00:12:24.240
pig and farmer hogget and I put it on and I was like,
God,
this is hilarious.

194
00:12:24.241 --> 00:12:26.620
This is all right.
Well I'll pick a real movie after this.
And I was like,

195
00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:31.380
good God,
this is a fine film
and

196
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:37.660
the renegade duck.
Anyway.
Uh,
so yeah.
Yeah,
Babe.
I don't think you'd actually like,

197
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.830
I think you'd be disgusted with my recommendation,
but I don't watch enough.

198
00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:45.490
I don't watch a lot of movies.
Um,
I think you'd like Narcos,

199
00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:49.390
which is a miniseries.
Yeah,
I've heard of that.
That Pablo Escobar.
Right.

200
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.270
I think I've heard about that one.
I just then,
then you're,

201
00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:56.690
then you're jumping into what,
like 30 hours of content that is only,

202
00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.580
yeah,
you're looking at that 20 then you're in the vortex.
You know what?

203
00:13:00.581 --> 00:13:05.260
You know what?
I want to watch that like when I'm 78 I'll watch narcos.

204
00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:06.160
Put that on my list.
