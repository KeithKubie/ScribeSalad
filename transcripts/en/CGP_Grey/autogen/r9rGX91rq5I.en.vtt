00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:00.979
 Hello internet. 

00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.060
 The UK had an election that we should talk about, because after the debates, 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.779
 voting and adding the ballot papers the result looked like this: 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:10.260
 While the division in parliament came to look like this: 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.900
 This is a little unrepresentative and by a little not mean I absolutely do not. 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.609
 Red received 30% of the votes and 36% of the seats, which is sort of true but the rest 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.699
 looks awful. Orange got 8% and only one eighth of seats while Geels got 5% 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.279
 doubled and purple earned 13% and received payment. 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.670
 Meanwhile, Blauws increased 37% of the votes to 51% of the seats in parliament. And that 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.870
 profit is even greater since that 51% of the seats you 100% of the 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:39.800
 gives control. 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.530
 How could this happen? 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.050
 In the UK, national elections are not really national. They are a lot of local elections. 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.710
 The UK is divided into districts, each of which elects a MP (MP) 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.219
 to represent them. This division between local / national is where the problems begin. 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.340
 Imagine a parliament with only three districts and you quickly see how such a system is not always 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.160
 corresponds to the people. Some people think that's fine, "it's all about 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.200
 winning local elections "they will say." Each MP represents its own district " 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.920
 And although the deviation in this example is exaggerated, the same problem happens in the real one 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.430
 election and the same argument is given, but there are still two problems 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.540
 the land of reality. 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.119
 1) Few citizens know who their MP is, they only know which party they voted for 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.960
 - which party they want as a representative at the national level. And pretend 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.750
 it is a local election is rather unfair. In practice it is an election for how 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.430
 the country is governed, not who becomes the representative of a small part of it. 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.100
 And even if that was the case 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.899
 2) the districts are even worse in representing their citizens than the parliament. 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.450
 Please excuse this Excel sheet containing nerd for a moment. 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.850
 The difference between what a party earns from votes and what a party earns from seats 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.590
 is the deviation in misrepresentation. 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.670
 If we calculate all deviations for all parties and add them all up then we can say that the parliament 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.490
 47% of misrepresentation. That sounds bad but is a utopian 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.739
 rainbow of diversity compared to the local election for local elections have 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:17.670
 only 1 winner. Of the 650 districts, 647 have a higher deviation than 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.430
 the parliament. These are the only three who don't have that and they are very unusual for having 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.270
 from so many voters from just one party in a district. 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.459
 most places look like The Wrekin, which is right in the middle, with a hundred and one points difference. 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.200
 But the winning candidate did not get a majority here. What does that mean 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.470
 more than half of the districts have elected their MPs with a minority. 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.660
 The worst is Belfast South, at the bottom of the list. Hilariously unrepresentative. Less than 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.910
 a quarter of voters speak for the entire district in parliament. This is 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.120
 the lowest percentage ever with which an MP has been elected. 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.819
 So if people argue that the elections are a set of local elections, then: 1 people behave 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.640
 do not adhere to it and 2 it is an even better argument that the elections are not good because on 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.140
 at this level they are worse. 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.150
 These local elections are unrepresentative because of the terrible "first past the post" 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.810
 system-- which I often complain about and so will not complain about - look at 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.319
 the video - because it only 'works' if voters are limited to 2 choices 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.720
 Voting for a party other than the largest makes it more likely that the largest party with a minority wins. 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.060
 Exactly what happened. 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.120
 That residents continue to vote for smaller parties, even though this goes against their strategic interests 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.620
 shows that people want different representation. But this makes it the most misrepresented 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.299
 Parliament in the history of the UK. 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.090
 People who are happy with the result will say that the system works. 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.940
 Naturally, their team has won. 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.540
 But the government is not a sport where a winner must be designated. It is a system 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.230
 to make rules that everyone must follow. So we need a system where everyone agrees 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.049
 that the process is fair, even if the results are not what they want. 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.299
 If you are in favor of a system that disadvantages people that you do not like, and puts people ahead 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.340
 that you like, then you are not really someone who supports representative democracy. You are more it 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.280
 kind that supports some form of dictatorship light, where a small group of people 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.190
 makes the rules for everyone. 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.740
 But as it is now, and when people indicate more and more what they want in elections, this will lead to a bad system 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:30.120
 making people uninterested, or worse: angry and JEMIG IK SNAP 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.500
 NOT WHY. 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.310
 This is recoverable. There are much better ways the UK can vote. Here are 2 options that even 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.160
 local representatives. 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.720
 And restoring voting is important, because this is a kind of government legitimacy score 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.990
 and this score has been getting worse for some time, and will get worse unless this is fundamentally wrong 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:05:00.500
 is being changed.
