&gt;&gt; Peter Vankevich: Okay,
welcome to the afternoon session

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.790
of the fiction stage here.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.090
I'm Peter Vankevich.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.220
If you see any ushers
or have any questions,

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.520
please check with us.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.980
You'll all see our
uniforms on right now.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.300
I just want to introduce
you to Lynn Neary.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.170
She's the arts correspondent
for NPR,

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.370
and I will add she's
on a lot of shows.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:28.700
I don't think I ever turn on
when I'm driving and get on NPR,

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.380
which is my number-one
station, without hearing Lynn

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.680
on one of the shows there.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.310
So welcome, Lynn.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.800
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Good to be here.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.030
So it's so good to
be here again.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.900
This is the fourth
time I've come

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.370
to the National Book Festival
to interview wonderful authors

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.040
like Min Jin Lee, and I love
this event, as I say every year,

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.730
because I feel like it
brings all the book lovers

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.830
in Washington, DC together
in one huge building,

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.290
and there's this great energy
around books and reading.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.760
And one of the questions
that I get a lot as the books

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.710
and publishing correspondent
for NPR is, you know,

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.740
how do you choose the books,
and I was thinking about this

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.120
as I got ready for this
interview, because I feel

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.640
like I helped discover Pachinko.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.880
I interviewed Min Jin Lee pretty
early on, and I was thinking,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.440
well, how did I, because you
know, we get a lot of books,

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.800
and you're not supposed to
judge a book by the cover,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.770
but I really like that
cover, and I saw the word,

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.500
and I saw Pachinko, and I didn't
really know what that was.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.850
And then I read something
about it,

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.260
and I realized it was this
game in Japan, and I remembered

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.890
when I was in Japan
many years ago,

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.730
I had seen these brightly
colored parlors all

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.330
over the place, and
then I realized

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.590
that the cover was actually a
picture of a pachinko board,

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.250
and I thought that
was pretty cool.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.570
Then I heard it was about --

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.500
I read it was about
Japanese Koreans,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.390
and I thought I don't
know anything about that,

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.220
and then I read that they were
somehow involved with pachinko,

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.590
so put that all together.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.460
I was very intrigued,
so I opened the book.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.150
It starts with a love story.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.390
What's wrong with that?

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.650
Then it moves on to
historical fiction.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.900
Then it becomes a family saga,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.830
and it ends as a
coming of age story.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.820
It's what every fiction
lover loves.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.420
What was not to love
about Pachinko?

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.280
So that was how I discovered
the book, and I'm happy

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.130
that I may have helped
some of you hear about it

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.950
through my interview
with Min Jin Lee,

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.020
because I had not read
your first book --

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.590
I have to be honest with you --

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.530
which is Free Food
for Millionaires,

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.430
and I know that it
took you a long time

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.540
to write Pachinko, right.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.840
How long?

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.140
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Thirty years.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.370
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: And you
didn't know very much

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.490
about Korean Japanese
when you started, did you?

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.530
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Oh, no, I knew
nothing, absolutely nothing,

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.110
but before we talk, I just want
to embarrass Lynn a little bit

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.950
because I have the stage.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.830
So I just wanted to thank you
so much for your championing

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.240
of this book because
for a person like me

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.380
from my background, for
people who take 30 years

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.670
to write a book, if you
don't have a really smart

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.510
prize-winning journalist
saying please read this book,

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.890
it's actually really hard
to break out of the fray.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.680
So there are 600,000

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.790
to a million published
every year in America.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.410
They all go to her office.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.710
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: That's true,

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.860
and I have to tell you
we didn't have an intern.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.310
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Thank
God for that cover.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.610
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Yeah.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.910
We didn't have an
intern this summer,

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.180
so you should see the books
piling up at NPR right now.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.930
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: No, I'm judging
the National Book Awards this

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.290
year, and there's 370
books for fiction.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.590
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: I know,
and we should ask --

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.890
I'm going to ask you --

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.190
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Yeah.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.490
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: -- about that
before we start talking about --

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.790
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Right.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.090
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: -- Pachinko,

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.390
because that means you
have to read 370 books?

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.500
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: I can't
talk about it, but yes,

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.040
everybody has gotten
my attention,

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.150
and that's all I've been
doing, because I just read

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.450
and read and read some more.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:57.750
There's a lot of --

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.050
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: I don't even
understand how you read

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.350
that many books in a year.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.650
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: It's
really hard.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.800
It's really hard, and it's
really hard to write --

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.100
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Yeah.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.400
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: --
when you're reading.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.700
I mean you know.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.000
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Yeah.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.300
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: We're
reading all the time.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.600
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Yeah.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.900
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: And eating
a lot of chocolate, for me.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.200
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Well, let's
talk about Pachinko, because --

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.500
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: I do
want to say thank you.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.800
I just wanted to say.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.100
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Well, you're
welcome, because I really do.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.400
This is a wonderful book, for
those of you who haven't caught

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.700
up with it yet, and I
think a lot of you have,

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.600
which is why you're here,
but I just wanted to ask you,

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.130
you know, you yourself, how
you sort of stumbled upon --

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.660
you kind of stumbled upon
this subject, didn't you?

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:32.960
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: I did.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.000
So when I was in college,
I had all these problems.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.620
I'm sure none of you did,
but I was a history major,

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.050
which means that I knew
my direct path in life.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.720
So I was totally lost, and I was
dating this really bad guy --

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.110
it's all true -- and the head

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.440
of my residential college said
would you go to a master's tea,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.610
which now it's called like the
head tea or something like that,

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.460
and nobody wanted to go because
it was an American missionary

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.720
talking about the Korean
Japanese, a very sexy topic.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.430
So I went because the person
who asked me was a minister,

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.030
and it's really hard to
say no to Harry Adams

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.260
because he's a really
great person.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.110
So I went, and so it was me
and another guy named Wilson,

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.730
so there was two of us,
there's an American missionary

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.510
who has dedicated his
entire life to serving

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.220
to serving the poor Korean
Japanese, so I felt like I had

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.330
to go, and then Harry Adams.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.610
There was four of us, a
humongous plate of cookies,

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.390
and it was about 15 minutes.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.690
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Yeah.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:37.990
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: And he talked
about the history of the Koreans

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.290
in Japan, and I knew nothing,

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.070
and I thought it was really
sad and, you know, very moving,

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.390
but then I didn't
think that I was going

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.690
to spend my life doing this,

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.580
because I didn't know what I
was going to do with my life.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.880
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Yeah.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.710
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: But he mentioned
this one story of a little boy

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.090
who had climbed up to
his apartment building,

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.390
and he jumped off to his death
immediately following his middle

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.110
school graduation, and it turned

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.720
out that he was ethnically
Korean,

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.190
his parents were
ethnically Korean,

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.960
and his parents were
trying to figure

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.890
out why this would
happen, and they went

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.470
through his middle
school yearbook,

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:13.880
and his Japanese classmates
had written go back

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.830
to where you belong, I hate
you, and they wrote you smell

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:24.410
like kimchi, and they wrote
the words die, die, die.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:29.860
And I think it just moved
me in a different way,

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.400
because that was not my
experience of living in America,

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.260
because I was an immigrant.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.560
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Yeah.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.860
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: And
I grew up in Queens,

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.200
and I had so many people be
so incredibly kind to me,

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.510
and I know that's
not the experience

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.530
of all Asian-Americans in this
country, but because I grew

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.420
up in Queens and I
went to high school

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.540
in the Bronx, I was
really normal.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.840
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Yeah.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.790
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: So I was
really surprised by it,

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.810
and when I quit being a lawyer,
I started to work on this book.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.150
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Yeah, and you
had to do a lot of research.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.450
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Yeah.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:01.750
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: But
you interviewed a lot

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.050
of people, I mean I think.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.760
Tell us a little bit about
that part of the research?

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.150
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Well, you
know that what you read

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.390
versus what people
say are so different,

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.440
and the way people
present are so different.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.510
So I have -- I don't
know if you know this,

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.880
but I had a very
serious speaking issue

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.790
until I was almost
in high school.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.100
I didn't really talk to
people, and it wasn't

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.400
because I didn't know English.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.730
It's just because I had
all this social anxiety,

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:29.510
so I took all these classes
and all these things.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.660
Ones of the ways it allows me
to talk to people is if I feel

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.200
like I have a formal interview,

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.100
then I feel like I can ask
questions and it's not rude,

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.040
because I do have a billion
questions in my head,

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.340
but then I feel like well,

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.500
that doesn't seem quite
right, to just talk.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.990
So I started to interview all
these Korean-Japanese people

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.310
in Japan, and I learned
that all the books

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.360
that I had read were
statistically accurate

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.750
and factually correct,
especially all the history,

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.840
anthropology, and
sociology and law books,

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.340
because I read all those
like things, but the thing

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.950
that was not correct was that
most Korean-Japanese people

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.400
that I met, not all, but most,

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.590
they really don't see
themselves as victims.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.850
They don't see themselves as
some sort of like pathetic patsy

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:16.930
who really couldn't
figure out what to do.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:21.390
As a matter of fact, they
were so defiantly in charge

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:26.690
of their lives, and I was like
oh, I have to rethink this.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.660
So I had to throw away an entire
manuscript that I had written,

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:30.990
and I started all over again,

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:33.890
and Sunja was really
born in 2008.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.860
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Sunja is
the central character --

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.160
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Right.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.460
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: -- in this book.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:39.760
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Because
the first book,

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.060
the main character was Solomon.

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:42.360
So if you know the book,

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.810
Solomon's like this part
of the book now, so.

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:46.290
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: And Sunja, of
course, is this young woman

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:50.760
who falls in love with the wrong
guy, which a lot of us have done

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.650
over the years, right.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:53.950
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: I've done it.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.560
I've been dumped
by the wrong guy.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.260
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: But
then a very --

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.920
she's kind of rescued by another
man who's a very kind man,

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.220
a missionary.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.520
He's going to Japan.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.470
And I was just fascinated
in terms of the history,

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.750
because I didn't know
anything about it.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:13.920
I had no idea that so many
Koreans had immigrated

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.470
to Japan at one time.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:17.830
What caused that immigration?

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:19.130
I mean what was the --

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.430
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: So
the colonial history

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.220
of Korea is a really sad one.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:26.140
So from 1910 to 1945,
until the war ended,

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.880
the Koreans were
essentially a colony of Japan,

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.710
so Japan basically owned
Korea and acted as such,

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:35.530
and there's a lot of
revisionist historians

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:37.040
who have different
points of view about this,

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.000
but for the most part, it can be
agreed that most of the Koreans

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.640
who went to Japan were economic
migrants or forcible labor,

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.440
but there was definitely both.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.920
So in that time, because
the Japanese were coming

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:53.540
in as the colonizer, they
took over a lot of the land.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.690
Like a million Japanese
went to Korea,

00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:00.040
and over a million
Koreans went to Japan.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.830
But obviously the status
is different, right,

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:06.450
and then when they did a major
land tax, a lot of the farmers

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:10.010
as well as the peasants were
taken away from their land

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.330
and their sustenance, so a
lot of Koreans, if they wanted

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.630
to have any viability,
went to Japan.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.710
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Yeah,
and the other thing

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:22.350
that I found interesting just
historically was the realization

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.260
of how people got
caught in Japan,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.350
you know, in the Korean War.

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:30.710
It really brought to life the
realization of what happened

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.900
with the partition of
Korea at that point.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.730
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Right, because
in 1945, Korea gets partitioned,

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:40.000
and in 1950, you have the war,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.620
and as soon as Japan lost the
war, so many things happened

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.950
in Japan, but the first thing
that happened for the Koreans

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.090
in Japan is they lost
their citizenship,

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:51.130
so they were no longer
colonial members.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:52.990
They became stateless.

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.030
So they could have
gone back to South --

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.040
gone back to South Korea or
to North Korea at that point.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:03.130
However, they had
cholera in the country,

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.240
they had lost everything
that they had,

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.770
most of their family
members were dying,

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:11.330
and this incredible poverty, and
then you had the US government

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.140
that was in charge of Japan
saying you couldn't take more

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.730
than a certain amount
of property back.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:19.600
So imagine if you have a hundred
dollars' worth of something

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.960
and they tell you that can
only take two dollars back,

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.130
and then when you go there,
there's nothing there.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:26.430
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Yeah.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:27.730
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: So they stayed.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:29.220
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: So we're
talking about the history,

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.240
but this is a novel,
and it's one

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.150
of those great sprawling
family sagas.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:35.450
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Oh, thank you.

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:36.770
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: And you know,
I love those kinds of books,

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:39.100
and so they're the kind of
books you just sort of fall into

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.400
and get very engrossed.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.220
What is it about that kind
of a book, first of all,

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.950
that you like as a writer and a
reader, and why did you choose

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:47.290
to write that kind of novel

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.820
to tell this great
historical story?

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.880
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: I had no
intention of writing this book,

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:58.270
and I will never do this again.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.900
I turned 50 in November,
and I was like if I have

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:05.500
to do this again, it would
take another 30 years.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.860
So I guess, yeah, at 80 I might
have another book in me, but no,

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.480
the reason why I would
never do this again is

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.770
because I think I felt a
sense of responsibility

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.610
to the Korean-Japanese
because I'm Korean-American,

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:21.210
so I did an incredible amount
of research for this book,

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:25.070
and then I didn't realize having
to deal with that timeline

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:28.360
of 80, 90 years -- there's a
really serious reason why most

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.460
people don't write this kind of
book, and when I first started,

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.390
it was going to be like a
five-year book, and this ended

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:35.690
up becoming an 80-year book.

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:36.990
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Wow.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:38.540
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: And it's a
lot of wars, and there's a lot

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:42.880
of contentious history in
there, so I was really afraid

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.070
of being wrong, because
if I offended somebody,

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:50.790
then I would hear about it,
and most of all, I was afraid

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.770
of offending the Korean-Japanese
because they have been

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:59.050
so mistreated, and I would never
exploit this story for my gain,

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:02.880
and also, I didn't
expect this today.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.510
You guys are a surprise, so.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:12.400
[ Applause ]

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.070
But I do think that
the reason why I ended

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:18.270
up writing this book is
because I don't have an MFA.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:19.570
I majored in history.

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:25.290
I went to law school at
Georgetown, and then I thought

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:30.230
that the only books for me that
I kept on returning to over

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:33.210
and over again were 19th
century omniscient narration,

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:34.940
and I wanted to try that,

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.080
so my first book is also
omniscient narration,

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.380
and so is this one.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.930
Those are my books
that I really prefer

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:41.230
to read more than
any other time.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:45.350
I wanted to write a
social, realistic novel

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:47.080
about the troubles
but at the same time

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.440
to have a really strong human
story and a family story,

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.020
so I ended up writing
it this way,

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:56.180
but I did not know
how hard it was.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.480
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Yeah.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.780
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: I had no idea.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.080
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: When did
you realize pachinko had

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.300
to be not just part of the story
but like crucial, a crucial part

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.800
of the story, that this had to
be about pachinko in some way?

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.100
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Well,
I didn't --

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.040
I knew that there were some
Koreans involved in pachinko

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.920
in Japan, but when
I went to Japan,

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.280
and I lived there
from 2007 to 2011 --

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.580
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: And
we should say --

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:18.880
people might not know
what pachinko is,

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.290
so maybe you should explain
what pachinko is first.

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:21.590
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Oh, sure.

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:22.890
You're right.

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:25.730
Well, my publisher always goes
you talk about what pachinko is,

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.860
but I just sort of
assume that you guys know.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:32.970
So pachinko is a 203
billion-dollar industry.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.670
It's 4% of the Japanese
GDP, so it's a corner

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:37.970
of the Japanese economy.

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:39.270
So it's not like when you
and I think about going

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:40.680
to Las Vegas once
in our lifetime

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.340
and doing things
that are shameful.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:44.740
Not at all.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.120
Once a week, 11 Japanese
people --

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:53.310
I mean one out of 11 people
play pachinko once a week.

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:54.610
That's a lot.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:55.910
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: It's
a gambling --

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.210
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: It's
a gambling game.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:58.510
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Yeah.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:14:59.810
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: It's
an adult gambling game.

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:01.110
It's not for kids.

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:02.410
It's incredibly noisy.

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:03.710
I've never met a western
person who likes pachinko ever.

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:05.010
Like I've looked.

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:06.310
I really researched this.

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:07.610
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: And
they're very bright,

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:08.910
these parlors, as I recall.

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:10.210
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Yeah, they're
incredibly bright and garish,

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:11.510
and they're open all the time,

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:14.570
and yet because gambling
is illegal in Japan still,

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.920
there are all these different
workarounds that they do

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.990
in order to make
it a gambling game,

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.980
but people play it
regularly, not just as a sport,

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:26.240
but actually for income,
because you can sort of eke

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.420
out an existence from
playing pachinko.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:33.860
So those people are called
pachi pro, pachinko pros.

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.270
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: And
this is a way that --

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:39.560
this was an industry that
the Korean-Japanese --

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.990
they run it, don't
they, pretty much?

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:43.680
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: They're
incredibly involved in it.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.980
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Yeah.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:48.590
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: They're dominant
in it because people who --

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:51.390
unfortunately, due to the
colonial history and even

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:53.760
until today, even 2018,

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:58.140
the Korean-Japanese are not
considered full Japanese

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.810
citizens, and even if they
have been living there

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:06.590
for four generations, they're
not considered regular Japanese.

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:09.790
Consequently, there's a lot
of employment discrimination

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:12.320
against the Korean-Japanese,
and it has been historically

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.710
for over a hundred years.

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:15.830
Most Korean-Japanese,
even if they converted

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:19.720
to Japanese citizenship today,
face employment discrimination.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.140
So one of the industries
that really took them

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.560
in was pachinko, and
the other industry

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:28.140
that took women are barbecue
restaurants, Korean restaurants,

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.140
so that's where the women
would end up working,

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.360
and the men would
work on pachinko,

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:36.130
but because pachinko
is a gambling industry,

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.580
people in Japan, even
though it's so important,

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.880
believe that it's
very low-class.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.390
They consider it related
to criminal behavior

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:46.630
because it used to be,
about 40 years ago,

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.900
very heavily criminalized.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.370
There are parts of it
that were quite dangerous,

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:53.670
but it isn't anymore.

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:54.970
It really isn't anymore.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:56.770
There's very little wiggle room

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.290
because it's so heavily
regulated.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:01.480
However, even if you work in
pachinko today for like --

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.950
let's say you own an advertising
company, and you advertise

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:06.750
for people in the
pachinko industry.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:09.150
You're discriminated against
socially because people think

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:12.210
of you as somebody who's
vulgar, low-class and criminal,

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:15.880
and those people tend
to be Korean, and again,

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.450
I was really surprised
that even today that people

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:22.280
who are ethnically Korean
can face this discrimination.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.680
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: What was it
like for you as a Korean going

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:30.030
to Japan, having been raised
in this country, researching

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:31.850
and asking people
questions about what it was

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.720
like to be Korean-Japanese?

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.650
What was it like for you to --

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.910
did you experience
any discrimination?

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:39.210
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Oh, yeah.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:40.510
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Were you
uncomfortable in Japan?

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:42.760
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Yeah, I
was uncomfortable in Japan,

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.620
and I think the primary
reason why I was uncomfortable

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:52.280
in Japan is because I've never
been treated like that before,

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.650
and the model minority myth
is a very dangerous one

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.870
for Asian-Americans, but
in a way, nobody ever --

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:01.070
it's like if I walk
down the street,

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.560
and like let's say I stole
something from your purse.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.300
Most people will probably
not think it's me.

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.320
Most people will probably
think I'm good at math.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.530
There's a lot of
like these weird --

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:12.830
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Are you?

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:18.240
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: I'm not bad, and
I'm proud of it because I had

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.660
to really work at
it, but anyway,

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.930
but you have all these
model minority stereotypes

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:26.720
which are really quite
harmful to people.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.190
However, in Japan, what
was really strange is

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:34.860
that people thought that I
was argumentative and criminal

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.390
and aggressive, and
I was like wow,

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:39.760
no one's ever thought I
was aggressive before.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.440
That's interesting.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:46.260
But after the initial sort
of surprise wears off,

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:50.170
you realize that it intersects
every aspect of your daily life.

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:53.820
So for me, I was visiting, and
my husband is half-Japanese,

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.540
so I have Japanese
family, so I had kind

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.540
of an inside connection,
but at any point,

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:03.900
I could speak the most
important, unfortunately

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:07.370
or fortunately, language in
the world, which is English,

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:10.830
so the privilege that you
have as an English-speaker is

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:14.870
so incredibly powerful in
Asia, because all of a sudden,

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:16.880
you can just kind
of skip some things,

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.770
and also, it's not even money.

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:23.600
Education and language is
an incredible form of power,

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:28.090
so that was very helpful,
but I don't speak Japanese,

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:30.400
so in that sense,
I was disempowered,

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.180
and that was really hard for
me, but specific instances

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.920
of discrimination did occur.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.930
So for example, we are renting
this really beautiful apartment

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:41.800
that my husband's
company rented for us,

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.830
like a place I could never
afford to live by myself,

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:48.820
and one day, the toilet
upstairs was leaking,

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:51.920
so I had to call the management
company, and they came

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.770
and they fixed it, but
they created a huge hole.

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:56.200
And after they fixed it,
they said we're going

00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:00.680
to come the next day and
repair it, and I said well, --

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.070
-- I think you have
to wait a few days

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:06.110
because if you don't dry the
plaster, you'll get mold,

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:12.310
because I am neurotic, and I
said well, I'm happy to take off

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:15.980
from work, and in two days, I'll
meet you when it's fully dry,

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:18.650
and then you can
put the plaster on.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:19.960
And the management company said

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:25.720
to me you Koreans are always
complaining, and I was thinking

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.580
to myself like it's
not even my building.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.560
Like if there's mold,
it's your problem,

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.360
but I thought I was being nice.

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.660
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Yeah.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:36.960
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: And neurotic.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.260
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Maybe you
were being a New Yorker.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.060
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Right.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:43.520
[ Laughter ]

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.820
Point taken.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:46.780
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Well, I'm a New
Yorker today, so it's okay,

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.700
but I think that's
so interesting,

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.030
that you can be the same person
in two different cultures

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.630
and be perceived completely --

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:54.200
like to have that
experience of being --

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.500
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Yeah.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.800
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: -- perceived
completely differently.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.990
You're the same person,
and yet in one culture,

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:01.580
people will think of
you as -- I don't know.

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.170
Maybe they think of you
as shy and retiring.

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:05.410
I'm not sure that
would be right.

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:06.710
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Right.

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:08.010
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: But
certainly not aggressive,

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:09.550
but you know, aggressive
in Japan.

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:10.850
That's interesting.

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:12.150
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Well,
what's weird is

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:16.430
that I didn't really even learn
how to talk to regular people

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:17.730
until almost high school.

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:19.030
I had to take all these classes,

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:23.690
so my natural MO is always
actually to be very quiet,

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:26.880
and I always think that
if you're out in public --

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.900
and I have this Thomas
the Tank Engine theory.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.910
For those of you who don't know,

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:34.720
his whole thing --
it's a little train.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.020
It's a kid's story.

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.320
Do you know Thomas
the Tank Engine?

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.620
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Yes.

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:39.920
Yeah, yeah.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.220
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Okay.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:42.520
So what you want to be when
you're Thomas is that you want

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.770
to be a useful engine,
so whenever I'm invited

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:46.690
to do things like
this, I have to go

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:48.050
to the bathroom like 18 times.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:49.360
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Yeah.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.430
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: You
were there, so.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:56.220
And I tell myself I have to
be useful, so you have to talk

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:59.640
and you have to share things
that have use to the audience.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.240
Otherwise it's just vainglory.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:06.990
So it was really surprising to
me that if I had the courage

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:10.130
to speak in Japan that
people might think

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:14.340
that I was being
pushy or talkative,

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.780
which I think is
different than when you

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.010
and I think talking is service.

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:20.450
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Yeah, it is.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:21.750
So all right.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.050
So you're in Japan.

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:24.830
You're researching this
book for many years.

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:26.630
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Many years.

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:27.930
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: And
then you start to --

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:30.910
and then you start to write it,
and right from the beginning,

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:32.210
did you know pachinko was,

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:35.000
that this industry was
going to be sort of --

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.300
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: No.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:37.600
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: -- a
through line of this story?

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:41.110
Because eventually, Sunja's
sons both get into the business,

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:42.970
and I won't go into
details of how that happens

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:45.510
because it would give
some things away, I think,

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:49.280
but they both get into it, and
it gets them out of poverty,

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.590
but it doesn't get them out
of their situation or out

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:53.740
of the situation of being
discriminated against.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.330
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: No,
and you can't escape it

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:56.690
if you're Korean in
Japan even today.

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:58.170
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Yeah.

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:00.150
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: You might
be really careful even today

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:02.810
of telling people that
you're ethnically Korean,

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:05.190
and if you are in
Japan, any of you,

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:06.710
and you meet somebody
who's Asian

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:10.540
and they don't seem Japanese,
if you ask them are you Korean,

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.810
they could be incredibly
offended.

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:16.680
So please be careful, because
they have a sense of privacy

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:22.310
that is so intense, because
you may be entirely innocent

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:24.640
in your intentions of
asking where you're from

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.160
or who your people are, but
to them, they have faced

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:32.830
such extreme discrimination
that they may be more reticent

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:34.510
about saying who they are.

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:37.470
So I get letters, many,
many letters, every day now

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:41.030
from Korean-Japanese people
saying my name is, let's say,

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:46.490
Junia Tanaka, but then their
Korean name is something else,

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:48.490
and they'll say I've
never told anybody before,

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:51.860
and I think to myself
that must be exhausting,

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:56.420
to just always walk around
being somebody else and feeling

00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:00.040
like I can't say what I am,
and the analogue that I think

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:03.540
of in the US is really
your religion.

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:06.020
So like let's say you
are privately Muslim

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:08.170
or privately Jewish
and you have a reason

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:10.790
for being private about it.

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:15.100
I respect that, and I think
interestingly, in Japan,

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.630
you really have to be careful.

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:19.260
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: You know, I
was going to ask you about,

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:24.170
you know, what's going on with
the film Crazy Rich Asians right

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:27.870
now, where, you know, it's
this number-one film and based

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:29.900
on a book, based on a
series of books, actually,

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.380
and there will be
two more films,

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:34.320
because there are two more
books, but I was going

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.540
to ask you if something similar
is happening among writers,

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:41.220
that, you know, there's
a sort of --

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.400
Asian, particularly
Asian women writers,

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.700
seem to be having their moment.

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.390
We just met Celeste Ng recently.

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:47.840
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.330
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Her
book is doing so well.

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:51.210
First of all, is that happening?

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:54.400
But then before I want to ask
you that question, I want to --

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:59.760
it's making me rethink saying
Asian as a sort of descriptive

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:04.040
of anybody who looks like
you and who is a writer.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.340
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Right.

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:06.640
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Is that
the correct thing to say?

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.100
I mean because you're making
-- now we're hearing about,

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.170
you know, the Japanese and
the Korean being so different.

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:13.470
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Oh, absolutely.

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:16.010
Well, what's funny to me
is that, and my friends

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:19.890
who are Latinx explain it
as well, very beautifully,

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:23.800
which is that in America, you
have these enormous tents,

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.900
and Asian America
is a huge tent.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.490
It's huge, because you have
East Asian, and Southeast Asian,

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:33.280
and South Asians, and we have
such different experiences.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.800
So my friends who are South
Asian are always telling me

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.350
to be brown is different
than to be East Asian,

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:41.630
which is absolutely
true, and then, you know,

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:44.630
being Sikh versus Muslim versus
Hindu is incredibly different,

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:46.370
but somehow we're in this tent.

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:48.430
Australia once in a
while says we're Asian,

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:54.140
and we're like I
don't know, but okay.

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:57.150
I'm full of love.

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:02.960
You know, when you leave the US,

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.530
you're not going
to find this tent.

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:07.270
They think that you're silly
if you say you're Latinx,

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:10.740
because a person from Honduras
versus a person from Mexico have

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.100
such different experiences.

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.400
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Yeah.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.700
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: But I will say

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.110
that because I know
Asian-American history so well,

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:20.300
I get really upset when we think

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:23.330
about the way the Chinese are
being discriminated against.

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:25.010
I'm not Chinese, but
I'm Asian-American,

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:28.230
and therefore I feel very
connected to federal legislation

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:32.420
which barred the entrance
of the Chinese only

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.000
because they're ethnically
Chinese.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.820
That happened in the US,

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:37.810
and they built the
railroads in this country.

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:41.220
Or I get really upset about
the internment, right.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.280
So I'm Korean and here
I am being defensive

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:46.350
about the Japanese, but that's
because I'm Asian-American.

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:47.650
I'm in this tent.

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:51.550
I kind of think it's like a good
historical event, but going back

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:55.440
to your question of descriptor,
it's what we have, and labels

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.140
and terms are so limited, but
it's what we have right now.

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:01.500
When someone else comes up
with something better, --

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:02.800
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Yeah.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.100
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: -- I'll
think about it, too, yeah.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:05.400
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: So then
I can ask the question.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.700
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Sure.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.280
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Are Asian
writers having a moment now,

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:13.270
in the same way that
Asian actors are?

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:16.050
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: They're
related, right,

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:19.220
because I create IMPORTANT,
intellectual property,

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:22.590
which will end up becoming
translated into film or TV,

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:27.800
and I remember when my first
book came out in 2007, a very,

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:32.260
very famous Tony award-winning
writer went to Hollywood

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.680
and said could Free Food
for Millionaires be made,

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.210
and pretty much every
door was shut in his face

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:39.860
because they said
Asians need not apply.

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:43.260
That was the message, and
then recently, Pachinko,

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:49.410
it has been optioned
for an Apple TV show,

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:52.400
which I think is
going to happen.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.680
I was told.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.020
We'll see.

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.940
So to answer your question,
is it having a moment,

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:03.110
it could be having a moment, but
I have to say it's heartbreaking

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:05.290
to think about it
being a moment.

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:06.590
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: I know.

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:07.890
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Right?

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:09.190
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Okay.

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:10.490
Well, what other word
could we use, then?

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:11.790
You're the writer.

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:13.090
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: No, no.

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:14.390
No, no, but the thing
is no, you're correct.

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:15.690
You're correct to think it's a
moment, because it is a moment

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:19.030
in history, and actually, as we
study history, history's made

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:22.250
up of different moments,
and what does that mean?

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:23.550
Will it turn?

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:25.480
Like will the door
really be opened?

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.790
So all these Asian-American
actors are really freaking out,

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:32.300
rightfully so, that
this is Asian August.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:33.600
Did you know that?

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:37.870
That was Asian August, but
September -- what is it?

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:39.430
I don't know.

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:42.050
So a lot of Asian-American
actors and writers

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:43.390
and directors are thinking

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:47.620
if Crazy Rich Asians does not
do well, what does it mean

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:53.190
for all the others when the
last one was 25 years ago,

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:55.170
and there are many
Asian-Americans who have

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:58.040
to feel pretty mum about
speaking about Crazy Rich Asians

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.090
in any kind of negative
way because they feel

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:03.820
like if they did,
they'd be race traitors.

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:08.310
Now Crazy Rich Asians is in
many ways a very entertaining

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:09.800
romantic story.

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.580
It shouldn't have
to be the truth.

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:15.480
Like it should just be a
wonderful romantic story,

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.780
and it's limited.

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:18.080
Like there are a lot
of people in Singapore

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.380
who are upset about it.

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.680
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Right.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:23.020
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: And you can
follow it if you want to,

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:25.410
but I think you're kind of
allowed to be one thing.

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:26.710
Like I would like it if --

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:29.150
I remember when Spike
Lee came out,

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:30.450
people were really
critical of him.

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:31.750
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Yeah.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.050
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: And I think
he gave the right response,

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:34.350
which is we should have lots

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:37.340
of African-Americans
making film, and he's right.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.490
Like we should have many
different kinds of stories,

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:44.000
so I really hope this moment
does become an opening

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.970
of a huge path of
different kinds of work,

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:48.910
because I think that
we're global.

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:50.210
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Yeah.

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:51.510
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: We're
global citizens,

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:53.150
which means that we have
to understand each other

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:55.160
as fully human beings,
and that comes

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.970
through different
kinds of stories.

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:58.270
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Yeah.

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:00.270
What do you want
people to take away --

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:04.460
-- from the story
of Korean-Japanese

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:07.190
that you tell in Pachinko?

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:12.000
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: I wanted to
write a very specific story

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.620
about this community, but
above all, I wanted to talk

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:19.900
about what it's like to have
to forgive people who hate you,

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:24.690
and that's something that
all of us have experienced.

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:29.170
People have hated us, all of us,
for whatever arbitrary reason

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:31.510
or for a justified reason.

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:35.960
How do you forgive and
somehow maintain your humanity?

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.370
That was important to me.

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:45.670
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: And it is.

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:47.850
No, you're right, because it
is a book about forgiveness,

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:49.890
and I'm trying to -- I'm
trying to think about that now.

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:51.920
Well, it's hard to talk
about without talking

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:56.380
about what happens towards
the end of the book,

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:59.160
and there are two sons,
and one of them --

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:01.410
one of them, it seems to be
things are going to be okay,

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:03.720
and the other one,
things aren't okay.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.020
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Right.

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.450
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: But they both
have a pretty rough time.

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:09.750
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Yeah.

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:12.860
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: But still,
Sunja's story, from this young,

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:16.000
innocent girl who had no idea
what she was getting into to

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.170
where she ends up in Japan,
is just an amazing journey

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:24.300
that this one women has
taken, and then we have

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.870
to see the consequences for
her own family, which are,

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:29.960
in some cases, tragic.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:32.270
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: What I
really took away from all

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:34.350
of my interviews with
the dozens and dozens

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:36.800
of Korean-Japanese
people that I met were

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.760
that there was always
this one generation,

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:43.340
the first generation, of people
who were illiterate, usually.

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:48.010
So I'm not writing about
powerful, elite, rich people.

00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:53.000
They started out as illiterate,
unwanted people who were ashamed

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.300
of where they came from

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:57.060
and where people are
constantly saying

00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:03.670
that you're not acceptable for
who you are, and I was so struck

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:06.900
by so many women who are really
poor, who are illiterate,

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.500
who were the beasts of burden
for the next generation,

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.700
and I thought well, how
do I write that story?

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:14.000
That's a difficult story,

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.170
because they didn't leave
any primary documents behind,

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:19.080
and because I was trained in
history, I ended up having

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.380
to do all these interviews,

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:22.720
but the interviews were
constantly contradicting

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.500
everything that I was reading,

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:27.120
because human beings
are so contradictory.

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.420
We don't make any sense.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.740
Like I could intend
something, but then I end

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.040
up doing something else.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:35.030
Like I had no idea I
was going to cry today.

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:36.990
I'm sorry.

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:39.180
I'm full of feelings.

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:49.620
But I think I want to be open
to my intentions of writing

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:53.700
about this community and how the
Korean-Japanese should be seen,

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:57.520
but I also want all of us to
experience what it's like to be

00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:01.030
that character, and this
is what fiction does.

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:04.530
I think we can identify with
people who look nothing like us,

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:06.890
who don't have our experiences.

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:08.900
People have often asked me
do I identify with Sunja,

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:12.640
and I have to say
not really, right.

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.720
I mean you and I have
privileges that are

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:17.780
so extraordinary compared
to a person like this.

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.080
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Right.

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.070
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: And yet you
enter into another experience.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:24.110
Like as a parent, you enter
into it, or as a sister,

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:26.950
you enter into it, and I
think that's really important.

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:29.600
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Well, and I think
that's why making a historical

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.590
novel like this a family story

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:36.160
as well is what then makes it
possible for us to understand --

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.460
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: I hope so.

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:38.890
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: -- across
generations and across,

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:41.730
you know, historical eras
and across class lines

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:43.380
and race lines and
everything else,

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:47.480
because this is a woman who's
trying to make things work

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.490
for her family and
the people she loves,

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:52.070
and that's something we can
pretty much all identify with.

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:54.510
Now I'm going to cry.

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:55.870
So no, but I mean --

00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:57.980
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: You're
the one who made me cry.

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:00.700
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: I think that's
the whole idea of a family saga,

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:02.790
don't you think, of
this kind of a book

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:04.300
that tells a family story?

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.600
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: I think so.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:09.490
I feel foolish because I
wanted to write a family saga,

00:34:09.490 --> 00:34:13.330
in terms of craft, technically
well, but in my intention

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:16.150
as a writer, that wasn't
what I was going for in terms

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:20.280
of the story, but what I ended
up doing, because I do feel

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:25.600
like a minor character in
life, that I wanted so much

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.300
for the minor characters
in this book

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.960
to have a complete storyline.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.040
So every single one of my
characters, if you plotted it,

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:36.540
because I have, they will
have a beginning and a middle

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:40.820
and an end, and I wanted
them to experience this kind

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:45.190
of Aristotelian reversal
and to have a recognition,

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:48.490
and then for you to experience
a catharsis, because I needed

00:34:48.490 --> 00:34:49.880
to be free from this story.

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:53.340
Like I'm so glad
this book is done.

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:54.810
You have no idea.

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:57.080
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: So in
about five minutes,

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.500
we're going to open
the floor to questions,

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.680
but I want to just ask
you one quick question

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:02.980
about the minor characters,

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:04.730
because I think that's really
interesting, what you did

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:08.290
with the minor characters, and
in particular, as an example,

00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:12.600
two of the minor characters
you realize are going

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:16.750
to become comfort girls,
although they don't know it.

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:19.220
The last time you see
them, they're going off,

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.520
and if you know the history
and you know the history

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:24.740
of the Korean comfort girls,
you know these two young women,

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:27.210
that's that where they're
headed, and they don't know it,

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:29.180
and I thought that was
really fascinating.

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:32.540
You bring in Nagasaki that
way, where characters are going

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:34.950
into something that
we know happened

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:37.300
and they don't know that's
where they're headed.

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:38.640
Somebody's heading to Nagasaki.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.560
It hasn't happened
yet, and I thought

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:41.930
that was pretty fascinating,
what you did

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:43.810
with those minor characters.

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:47.010
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: I wanted all
these aspects of history to be

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:50.780
in this book, and my
ambitions were obscene.

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:53.150
I realize that now,
when I look back

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:55.000
and I go why did you
want all of it in there,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.210
but I thought it was 80 years.

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:59.260
It had to be in there,
because if I left it out,

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:02.650
then it would've been really
bad, and yet I have to go back

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:04.880
to this idea of telling
fiction --

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.220
is that now that I'm
judging this here and I look

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:10.420
at modern contemporary
literature,

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:14.830
I see why I didn't
understand what I was doing,

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:17.230
because I had been looking
at so many old books

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:20.630
and rereading them to understand
how they do it, and I realized

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:21.930
that oh, I guess I
could have just written

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:23.560
about one character.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.920
Why didn't I do that?

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:28.790
But I'm not going to,
but I do understand

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:32.830
that the contemporary
fiction mode isn't what I do,

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:37.980
so in that sense, I don't
really belong in this canon.

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:39.440
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Well, I know
that you can't read right now

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.940
because you're reading
one of the 377 books

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:44.770
or whatever it was you
said, but are you --

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:46.530
and I know that you've
been so busy.

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:48.050
This book is so successful.

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:49.910
Did it change your
life completely?

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:51.800
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: It's
changed my life completely.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.100
It has.

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:54.400
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: How so?

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.700
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: I
haven't seen the money

00:36:55.700 --> 00:37:00.410
for it yet, to be honest.

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:02.750
People keep thinking like
wow, your husband can retire.

00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:04.050
I'm like no.

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:06.450
No, as a matter of
fact, last year --

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:08.020
this is kind of a
funny/sad story,

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:11.540
but my husband lost
his job on my pub day.

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:12.840
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Oh, wow.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.450
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Can you imagine?

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:18.050
So in the morning of my pub day
on February 7th, he calls me,

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:19.540
and he'd never lost
his job before,

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:26.790
and he said I lost my job,
and I was like what the fuck.

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:28.090
Pardon me.

00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:30.130
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: We
can bleep that.

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:32.130
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Can
than be edited?

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:35.620
I was so upset, and then he
was such a prince, though,

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:38.070
because even at the book
party that our friends threw,

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:41.320
he was really gracious and
kind, but then we thought

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.300
that he'd get a job right away,

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:46.400
but then he got a job
nine months later.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:49.550
So in that time, whenever
someone asked me to do anything,

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:51.860
I was like okay, where do I go?

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:54.790
So I think I worked a lot
harder because I was terrified,

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:57.890
and we didn't have health
insurance, and that was just

00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:02.840
so scary to me, and in
a way, I did feel --

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.140
and I was really embarrassed.

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:06.600
I was really embarrassed
about the thing of being

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:09.620
in a situation again where
I couldn't afford things.

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.860
I was like oh, I thought that,
you know, I'm going to be 50.

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:14.620
I should be okay, and my
son's tuition bill came,

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:19.910
and it was so high, so
that was just like --

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:21.210
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: The
money's going to come.

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:22.510
Don't worry.

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:23.810
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Yeah.

00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:25.110
Well, yeah, for sure, but --

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:26.410
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: I have one last
question for you before we open

00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:27.710
up the floor, which is even
though it's changed so much

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:29.320
and you've been so busy,
are you going to write?

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.710
Do you have an idea
for another book,

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:32.120
maybe not quite as big as this?

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:34.640
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Oh, the next
book's going to be really big.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.510
So it's a trilogy.

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:40.140
[ Laughter ]

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:41.440
I know.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.960
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: I thought you
weren't going to do that again.

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.260
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: No.

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:45.910
It's not going to be a
historical novel, I don't think.

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:47.730
So the first book is Free
Food for Millionaires,

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:51.530
which is Koreans in America; the
second book is Koreans in Japan,

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:54.570
Pachinko; and the third one
is about the role of education

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:56.280
for Koreans all over the world.

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.130
So it's called American Hagwon,

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:01.460
and a hagwon is a tutoring
center, and you have billions

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:03.910
of tutoring centers
in Washington, DC,

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:05.210
Virginia, and Maryland.

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:07.490
So if you ever a Korean
sign and it says something

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:11.770
like IV Excellence SAT
tutoring, that's a hagwon,

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:14.720
and there are more and
more non-Koreans going

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:19.140
to Korean hagwons now, and I
wanted to write about that.

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:22.080
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Oh, that's
great, and now I'm going to open

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:25.020
up the floor if anybody's
interested in asking a question.

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.970
Right here.

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:29.760
&gt;&gt; Hi. Sorry I had to jump
to the front of the line.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:33.270
My name is Sue Young, and I took
notes because I'm so nervous,

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:36.740
so please bear with me.

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:38.730
Your book was incredible.

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:41.190
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Thank you.

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:45.000
&gt;&gt; It's the fourth book that
I've read by a Korean author,

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.300
and so thank you for that.

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.490
I really appreciate that.

00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:52.870
As somebody who was born
to a mother who's deaf --

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:56.120
she was born in 1945
in South Korea --

00:39:56.120 --> 00:40:00.050
it was interesting to see
the portrayal of the --

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:03.170
-- occupation of
Japan so differently.

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:06.690
So as my mother who, you
know, was able to tell me

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:10.630
about running, you know,
over dead bodies and hiding,

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:12.950
you know, like during the
Korean War and things like that,

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:15.190
and talking about the Japanese,

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:17.650
and like my grandmother still
speaks Japanese -- she's 96 --

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:20.500
because she was an educator
during the occupation,

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:23.240
but then to see like the
actual historical pieces

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:24.540
that you introduce.

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:27.660
The book was like so
crazy, mind-boggling,

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:28.960
so thank you for that.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.450
I mean as a Korean-American, I
really appreciated that history,

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:35.010
and so actually, one of my
questions is how did you access

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:36.550
that history, and you talked
about that a little bit,

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:39.560
but I also did want to
know how interviewing the

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:44.540
Japanese-Koreans or the
Korean-Japanese changed you

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:48.410
as a Korean-American and how
maybe you understood yourself

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:51.530
and your own history and
maybe your own identity

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:53.910
as it relates to,
you know, Korea,

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:56.640
the Korean peninsula
and all the things.

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:57.940
Sorry, that was long.

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.000
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: So thank
you for your generosity.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.300
I really appreciate that.

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:02.600
So you have two questions.

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.400
The first question is how
did I do the research.

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:09.110
So I really work as a
wannabe academic journalist,

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:14.820
so I start with the very serious
academic research always first.

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:16.620
I read everything
that's very academic,

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:18.090
stuff that's not mainstream,

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:21.760
and then I do secondary
mainstream written research,

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.560
and then in going --
and coterminously,

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:27.230
I also interview people
of different backgrounds

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:28.530
for whatever I'm doing.

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:31.080
So both of my books
involved over a hundred,

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.650
at least a hundred
people per book,

00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:36.280
and I even took classes
when I needed to.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:39.300
So I work in a really weird
way, but I really like it,

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.620
because it gives me a
great sense of authority

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:43.460
about what I speak about.

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:45.510
The second question
about in terms

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:49.040
of how did interviewing the
Korean-Japanese affect me a

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.960
Korean-American is
that I didn't realize

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.010
that I was an angry person,

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:56.660
and this anger I think
is incredibly healthy.

00:41:56.660 --> 00:42:03.940
I think we Americans have a
sense of self-righteousness

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:07.470
and indignation which
is incredibly healthful

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:10.480
to make change in civil
rights, and I think going

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.450
to law school was
really healthful for me,

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:16.190
because I believe that
even though the wheels

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:19.850
of justice take a really
long time, as they should

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:24.520
in some ways, because you can't
have laws changing all the time

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:28.140
-- but we do need to have
those changes, and I believe

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:31.120
that it's possible to seek
redress for an injustice,

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:34.450
and that's a very American idea.

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:37.830
It's a very optimistic idea,
whereas when I was in Asia,

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:40.000
whether I was in Japan or
Korea or even in China,

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.540
there was a greater sense
of just the way it is, --

00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:44.840
&gt;&gt; Right, right.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.290
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: -- so we
have to work around things.

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:49.930
So I understand when people
have to work around a situation,

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:52.300
but I also believe that you
can have direct redress,

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:55.140
and we should at least try,
and I think that's a good kind

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:57.990
of anger that Americans have.

00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:59.490
&gt;&gt; Speaking of minor characters,

00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:01.440
thank you for the
disabled father.

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:04.310
I appreciate that character,
even though he was very minor.

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:07.250
Just as somebody who is
born to somebody who's deaf,

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:09.140
it's nice to see
that in literature.

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:10.440
Thank you.

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:11.740
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Thank you.

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:13.040
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Thank you.

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.560
Maybe we'll go to this
mic next and then to you.

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:15.970
&gt;&gt; Hi. Nice to meet you.

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:17.590
Thank you again for speaking.

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:19.330
My mom is actually
Korean-Japanese,

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.460
and this is the first time
I've ever seen any sort

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:22.760
of literature like this.

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:25.490
I have to admit I'm only like
40 pages in, so I'm sorry,

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:27.710
but it meant a lot
as an Asian-American,

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:29.790
because my Korean-American
friend actually recognized

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:33.760
that as an important story for
me to know, and I would say

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:36.280
that my Korean-Japanese family
never really talked about it.

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.870
I didn't know until
I was like 18 or 19,

00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:41.040
like really understood, that
we were actually Korean.

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.930
It was sort of like a
family secret, I think,

00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:46.210
a societal secret,
and I really would

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:48.500
like to know your
experience with talking

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:51.130
to Korean-Japanese people
or also Japanese people.

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:53.690
Did you ever say I'm
writing this book

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:55.400
about Korean-Japanese
people, and what were sort

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.160
of their reactions, both
from the Korean-Japanese

00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.490
and Japanese themselves?

00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:01.740
You mentioned your
husband is half Japanese,

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:04.110
so how did his family react
when you said I'm going

00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:06.030
to uncover this part of society,

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:07.660
as I know that's not
something a lot of people

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:10.850
in Japanese society want
to talk about as an issue?

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:12.530
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Oh, it's
a really great question.

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:13.830
I think you really want

00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:15.870
to understand how I approached
speaking to the Korean-Japanese

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:19.210
about my task, and I
think that two things

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:21.680
that you should know is
that I write fiction,

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.300
so most people think that
I'm entirely harmless,

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:29.300
and you'll never
be quoted directly,

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:31.400
and I would always give
my interviewees the option

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:33.670
of being acknowledged or not,
and some people chose not

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:35.370
to be acknowledged because
they didn't want people to know

00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:36.870
that they had spoken to me

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:40.720
about their families,
which I respected.

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:42.020
So it's true.

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:44.490
I am harmless, because you'll
always be cloaked in fiction,

00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:48.040
and then secondly, I
think that they thought

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:52.330
that it was adorable
I was going to try,

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:54.790
because no one has actually
ever written a novel

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:58.250
about the Korean-Japanese
for adults in English ever.

00:44:58.250 --> 00:44:59.550
This is the first book.

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:01.680
I know because I've done the
research, and if you look

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:06.410
for it, it's not there, and
there are books in translation,

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:08.540
but there's nothing right
now that I could think

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:13.900
of that's an epic,
80-year-old family saga

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:16.900
about the Korean-Japanese,
but I don't know if you know,

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:18.200
but there's three
different kinds

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:21.190
of Korean-Japanese
people in Japan today.

00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:23.810
You could be a South
Korean passport-carrying

00:45:23.810 --> 00:45:25.110
Korean-Japanese.

00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:28.010
You could be a North
Korean card-carrying person.

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:31.080
So even today, there are
Korean-Japanese who identify

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:33.860
with North Korean government,
and they send their children

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:35.870
to school from Kindergarten
all the way

00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:38.830
up to university being
identified with North Korea,

00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:42.130
and those people cannot
travel outside the country

00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:43.830
because North Korea
and Japan don't have a

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:45.560
diplomatic relationship.

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:46.860
And the third kind

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:48.550
of Korean-Japanese
person is someone

00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:50.330
who becomes a Japanese
citizen in the way

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:52.920
that I've become an
American citizen.

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:55.510
And all those three
are very different,

00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:58.130
and I interviewed each
one of those groups,

00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:00.590
and their personalities
are totally different.

00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:05.660
It isn't like meeting a Korean
from LA and a Korean in Philly.

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:08.350
We're different, but
not that different.

00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:10.960
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:12.260
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Okay.

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:13.560
Thank you.

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:14.860
Sir?

00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:19.060
&gt;&gt; My supervisor at work is
Korean-American, and he spent

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:23.060
about four years at
Tokyo University in Japan

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:27.320
and did experience
discrimination there,

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:30.550
even at Japan's leading
university,

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:36.220
and the stories are very moving
that he told me, but yesterday,

00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:42.140
we had lunch, and the main topic
of discussion was the lawsuit

00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:46.190
against Harvard University
on the discrimination --

00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:47.490
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Oh, yeah.

00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:49.010
&gt;&gt; -- against Asian-Americans,

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:53.810
and he does feel there is
discrimination even at,

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:56.820
you know, America's leading
institutions, and I wanted

00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:00.510
to get your opinion on
that as an attorney.

00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:06.100
[ Laughter ]

00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:08.400
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Okay.

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.920
You know, they told
me that I don't have

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:14.640
to answer every question,
but this is a tough one,

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:16.870
and it's a really good question,
and I'm glad you asked it,

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:20.740
because discrimination comes
in many different ways.

00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:23.870
I'm going to tell you right
now that I do not agree

00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:26.800
with Edward Blum
and his lawsuit,

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.100
and the reason why
I don't believe

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:30.090
in what he is doing
personally is

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:32.560
because I don't think
he has good intentions.

00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.570
I think there's truth
and there's intentions,

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:38.330
and they both have to be aligned
for me, so I do not believe

00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:39.740
that Asian-Americans
are supposed

00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:41.040
to be fighting other people

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:43.190
who are beneficiaries
-- affirmative action.

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:47.190
I believe in affirmative action.

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:50.790
That said, I believe absolutely

00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:53.740
that these admissions offices
throughout this country are

00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:56.480
giving Asian-American
children lower scores.

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:58.470
That is truly happening.

00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:00.860
So if I had to fight,
I would say we need

00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:04.330
to have more transparency
in the admissions offices,

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:06.990
because what's happening right
now to Asian-American children

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:10.320
in this country is
truly diabolical.

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:13.090
So yes, I believe they've
been discriminated against.

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:17.170
However, I do not agree with
Edward Blum and his purposes.

00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:20.510
I believe that we should be
going after legacy admissions.

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:25.810
[ Applause ]

00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:27.590
And I went to a fancy-pants
school, too, so.

00:48:27.590 --> 00:48:30.600
And I also believe that we
need to be really thinking

00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:34.290
about how our kid gets
in, not because we're

00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:37.850
against that child getting in,
but because for that child,

00:48:37.850 --> 00:48:40.860
he or she needs to
understand how this all works,

00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:43.260
because children are
talking about it anyway.

00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:44.820
These are young adults.

00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:46.450
They know what's going on.

00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:47.750
However, I do believe

00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:50.670
that affirmative action
is incredibly important,

00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:54.300
and there's many different ways
we could understand this topic

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:56.800
without having Asian-Americans
being pitted

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.280
against African-Americans.

00:48:58.280 --> 00:48:59.580
I think that's reprehensible.

00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:00.880
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: All right.

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:04.380
We literally have
one minute left.

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:06.130
Do you have a short question
that requires a short answer?

00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:09.190
&gt;&gt; I have a short question, but
he has the book in his hand, --

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:10.490
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:11.790
&gt;&gt; -- so if he wants to --

00:49:11.790 --> 00:49:13.090
&gt;&gt; I hope mine is short.

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:16.670
I wanted to ask like what
subtleties of Korean language --

00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:22.420
or rather, in work that
I've done in translation,

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:25.030
I've found that there are some
things that are hard to render

00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:26.990
in English in their
full capacity.

00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:31.140
What were some of the
challenges you faced

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:34.510
when translating their
Korean voices into English?

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:35.810
&gt;&gt; Can I add a follow-up,

00:49:35.810 --> 00:49:37.460
just because my question
was very similar to that?

00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:39.330
I liked how you chose

00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:41.360
to use certain Korean
words throughout the book

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:43.180
without actually defining them,

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:46.080
but I felt that I knew what
they were when I reading them,

00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:48.300
and I thought that was an
incredible literary tool

00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:49.600
that you used.

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:50.900
I just --

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:52.200
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Okay, she's
got to answer it now.

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.500
&gt;&gt; -- wanted to know why
you chose those words

00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:54.800
and how you chose them.

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.100
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: You've
got 30 seconds.

00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:57.400
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: So those
questions are definitely paired.

00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:58.700
Thank you.

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:00.050
&gt;&gt; I have one on
a -- pachinko --

00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:01.710
-- as a game is a metaphor

00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:04.110
for how the Japanese
people have been treated.

00:50:04.110 --> 00:50:05.410
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: All right.

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:06.710
Okay.

00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:08.010
&gt;&gt; Koreans have been treated.

00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:09.310
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: You have
really given her a challenge,

00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:10.610
I have to say, because
we're actually out of time.

00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:11.910
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Yeah.

00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:13.210
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: But go ahead.

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:14.510
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: Just bring it.

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:17.610
Okay. So I found that
in my interviews,

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:20.490
I often try to replicate
the voices that I heard,

00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:23.420
but because I work like
a wannabe journalist,

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:26.000
I'm constantly trying to
understand the meter and rhyme

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.480
of the way people talk, so
that's one, and then secondly,

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:34.760
to answer your question, I
chose the words which I believe

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:37.870
that we global citizens
should know about Korean,

00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:39.570
in the same way when
I went to law school,

00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:42.680
I learned Latin phrases
like "res ipsa loquitor,"

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:48.060
or when I read 19th-century
novels, there are French phrases

00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:50.310
that I needed to learn
if I wanted to know

00:50:50.310 --> 00:50:54.100
that in the Russian court, the
diplomatic language was French.

00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:58.680
So in order to be an educated
person of a certain view,

00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:01.590
we had to know certain
phrases and European languages.

00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:04.750
I am positing, and in
almost an obnoxious way,

00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:09.140
with great audacity, that
you should know some Korean.

00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:12.630
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: That's great.

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:16.290
&gt;&gt; Min Jin Lee: And the last
question, about the metaphor,

00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:19.440
is that pachinko is a
gambling game, and as you know,

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:24.020
in Las Vegas or elsewhere,
the house always wins.

00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:27.810
Pachinko is rigged, because
the house will always win.

00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:32.150
Most of us, I would argue almost
all of us, are on the outsides

00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:34.200
of the world and in
terms of connections,

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:38.560
and yet we still have to play
a rigged game all the time,

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:41.760
and so I'm arguing that
pachinko is like life.

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.060
Thank you.

00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:44.360
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Okay.

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:46.380
Thanks so much.
