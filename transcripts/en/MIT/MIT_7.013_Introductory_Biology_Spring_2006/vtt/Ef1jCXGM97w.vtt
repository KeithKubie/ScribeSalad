00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
IT.edu.  Cancer is a disease that really needs no introduction.  

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It's a very familiar disease. It's a very common disease.  

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 The American Cancer Society predicts  

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
that there will be 1. million new cases of cancer in this  

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
country, and that excludes the common forms of skin cancer,  

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
squamous cell cancer, and basal cell cancer.  

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
There's about another million of those.  So, 1.  

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000
non-cutaneous skin cancers in the US this year.  Both wide numbers are  

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000
probably 10 to 15 times as many. In 2006, more than 550,000 people  

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:37.000
in the US --   

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
More than 550, 00 people in the US will die from  

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:50.000
this disease --=   

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
-- more than 1, 00 each day.  So,  

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
in today's, cancer takes as many lives as died in the World Trade  

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Center tragedy.  It's a very common disease.  

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
It's estimated that in their lifetimes, one half of all males --  

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 -- and a third of females will be  

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
diagnosed with cancer of one sort or another.  So the likelihood is that  

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
the person sitting next to you, or you yourself will be faced with a  

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
diagnosis of cancer in your lifetime.  

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 And in this country,  

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
a quarter of all deaths are due to cancer.  Soon,  

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
probably this year, cancer will be the leading cause of  

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
death in the United States. It will surpass heart disease as  

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the number one killer. So, it's a major disease.  

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And that sounds depressing. But by the end of this section on  

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
cancer, my hope is that you will actually feel optimistic about our  

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
prospects for dealing with the disease more effectively in the  

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
future, and I don't mean in the distant future.  

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I actually think that within the next several years,  

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
we'll have new methods, new agents to control cancer much,  

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
much more effectively.  We are already starting to see the first  

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
examples of these.  And I'll tell you about them.  

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And before long, we will have many more.  

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So hopefully by the time you guys are at the age where cancer is the  

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
greatest risk, these numbers will actually change  

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
dramatically.  OK, so although cancer is familiar based  

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
on its prevalence, it may not be so familiar.  

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And I hope that is not so familiar in detail.  So,  

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I thought I would show you a couple of slides which really give you a  

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
picture of the disease. Lung cancer is a common type of  

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
cancer.  We'll talk about it today. And it's diagnosed like many  

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
cancers are diagnosed through radiological methods,  

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
through imaging, in this case a chest x-ray or computed tomography,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
which is a serial chest x-ray basically.  And  

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
you can see this mass in the lung. This is lung cancer at a fairly  

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
advanced stage. Cancer is a disease of too many  

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
cells.  They often grow together in a mass, a lump,  

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and so this is an example of cancer diagnosis, a solid tumor.  

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
You can also have cancers of the blood, leukemias,  

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
as well as blood cell lymphomas. And here, you can, again, see an  

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
overabundance of cells. Here's a normal blood smear with  

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
red blood cells, these smaller guys which have no  

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
nuclei, and some white blood cells which are larger and do have nuclei.  

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And here, you can see a blood smear of a leukemia patient where there  

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
are way too many white blood cells, nucleated cells, and they also  

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
happen to look a little immature. They have been differentiated into  

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
their fully developed state. Too many cells, in this case,  

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
not in a lump but dispersed throughout the blood.  

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And leukemias, and some lymphomas, are diagnosed by doing a blood test  

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
of this sort.  Other cancers are detected through other imaging  

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
techniques like colonoscopy as shown here.  

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Colonoscopies are now fairly common. They are recommended for all people  

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
beyond the age of 50 because colon tumors are actually rather common.  

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And if they are caught early enough, there relatively easily treated.  

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And here's the normal colon viewed from the inside.  

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And here's an early colon tumor called a polyp.  

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And I'll give you a little more nomenclature in a minute.  

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
But this is an early stage tumor, probably not a malignant tumor.  

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
If you saw this tumor, you might not actually remove it  

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
because it might not progress to a full-scale cancer.  

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
But these days, because they're pretty easy to remove using very  

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
similar methods as this gentleman here with the colonoscopy,  

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
one would clip them out, and not risk the possibility that  

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
they could progress. If they do progress,  

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
they get larger.  And more importantly, they begin to invade  

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
through the wall of the colon. And this is very dangerous because  

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
now the cancer cells can spread throughout the body,  

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
taking up residence elsewhere and causing even greater problems  

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
for the patient. So, this would require surgery.  

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
A section of the colon would be removed as is shown here.  

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
This is a section of colon where the colon cancer is highlighted by  

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
this circle.  And this is a life sparing surgery.  

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Individuals can live just fine. So if colon cancer is caught even  

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
at this stage, an advanced stage,  

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
but before it has spread to other parts of the body,  

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
it's relatively treatable, even curable by surgical methods.  

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Now, this set of pictures gives you a sense that cancers progress.  

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
They progress from early-stage, relatively normal looking tissue  

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
through much more advanced cancers, including to the point of metastasis.  

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And we are beginning to understand this process in some detail both in  

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
terms of what the cells look like, the tissues look like, but also what  

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
the genes look like that are driving these processes forward.  

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And I'm now going to give you some examples, or introduce the concept,  

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
that cancer progression from normalcy to malignancy is associated  

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
with changes in genes. That's really going to be a major  

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
theme of today and in the following lectures.  But  

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
histologically, the process looks like this in cartoon form.  

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
One starts with a normal looking tissue.  All of your cells are  

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
organized in one way or another in tissues, where they have important  

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
interactions with their neighboring cells: so here,  

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
a series of, say, epithelial cells.  

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Maybe these are the cells that line your gut.  They are in normal  

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
juxtaposition with their neighbors. They are sitting atop what's called  

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
a basement membrane, proteins that are secreted by those  

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
cells and other cells to give the cell something literally to sit on  

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
it, attach to. And then there are other cells in  

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
their vicinity including the cells that give rise to these cells,  

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
the stem cells or precursor cells, of the tissue that will be called on  

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
to differentiate into these end stage cells when these cells are  

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
lost, sloughed off. At some frequency in all of us,  

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
alterations occur in these cells such that an abnormal cell arises.  

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
This is a cell which has acquired a change.  I'll tell you now that it's  

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
a genetic change which allows that cell to do things that its neighbors  

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
can't do.  And in particular, it allows those cells to grow,  

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
to divide inappropriately.  Your tissues are very carefully  

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
orchestrated systems with the appropriate numbers of cells.  

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And cancer is fundamentally a disease of too many cells.  

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And so one of the first things to go wrong in the cancer development  

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
process is this orderly cell division is disrupted such that now,  

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
too many cells are produced.  And this results in a phenomena known as  

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
hyperplasia, hyperplasia meaning too many cells.  

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
But importantly these cells look pretty normal.  

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
So to the pathologist, and I'll show you some pathology  

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
slides in a second, to the pathologist, they would say  

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
the abnormal cells in number have a normal morphology.  

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Their shape looks right. Their internal structures look  

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
right.  Their nuclei look right. This process can continue, and  

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
probably often does continue until there is a discernible mass at least  

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
when it comes to solid tumors, a discernible mass.  

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And here we refer to this as an adenoma.  And I'll show you these  

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
terms again in a minute on the board, in this case, an adenoma,  

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
a benign tumor.  And you heard that were before, benign,  

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
as opposed to malignant. And a benign tumor is a tumor in  

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
the sense that there are too many cells.  So it's a mass.  

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
But the cells look pretty normal. In a benign tumor, it's not  

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
considered to be life-threatening. The cells have not undergone  

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
sufficient changes that we know for sure that they're going to,  

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
for example, invade and spread throughout the body.  

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And oftentimes, benign tumors are left alone because  

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
they don't have the potential to spread or to become more aggressive.  

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
But some of them do.  And through additional changes within the cells,  

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
additional alterations take place such that now the cells really do  

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
look different from the neighbors. Their structures look different.  

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Their overall shape looks different. Their nuclei look different.  Their  

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
interactions with the neighboring cells look different.  

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And the structure of the tissue changes as well in the sense that  

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
now, new blood vessels have been recruited into this mass,  

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
which was important actually in feeding this growing tumor.  

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
This is true cancer.  It's called in C2 cancer because it's present  

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
at the original site where the process started in C2 cancer.  

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
And it's called cancer based on these various characteristics: how  

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
much the cells are growing, dividing, and also what the cells  

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
look like, their shape and their nuclear shape.  

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
That's a problem. But it's a bigger problem because  

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
it facilitates and usually leads to the development of these tumors into  

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
an invasive state. So now, the cells are no longer  

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
staying where they started. They are starting to move out into  

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
the surrounding tissue. They break down, degrade the  

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
extracellular matrix, and actually start to migrate away  

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
from the primary tumor into the surrounding tissue,  

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
into the surrounding musculature, and ultimately into the blood  

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
vessels. It can move into the blood vessels.  

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
And once there, they can move throughout the body,  

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
and escape the blood vessels, and take up residence elsewhere in a  

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
process known as metastasis. This process happens at some  

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
frequency once started. If it reaches this point,  

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
it's a very bad situation.  Most cancers that kill people,  

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
kill people because of this process of metastasis.  

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
90% of cancer deaths are attributable to metastasis.  

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And although we know many of the things that happened over the course  

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
of these earlier stages, we actually know this process  

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
relatively less well. And obviously, we need to  

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
understand it better if we are going to control mortalities  

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
due to cancer. This shows you some histology.  

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
These are slices through tumors and other tissue that a pathologist  

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
would look at, and kind of emphasizes the points  

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
that I was making on an earlier slide in cartoon form.  

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
So, here you have a lung. And in it is some abnormal cells in  

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
the red circle here. There are too many cells compared  

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
to the surrounding tissue. You can see them in this kind of  

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
dark blue depiction. And you'll see it easier on your  

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
computer screens later. But again, these cells look  

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
relatively normal. There are just too many of them.  

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
So we call this hyperplasia.  These can progress into small and benign  

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
tumors called, in this case, adenomas.  

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And you can see on the histology that they are rather homogeneous in  

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
their structure. The cytoplasm looks pretty much the  

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
same.  Cell to cell, the nuclei look pretty much the same  

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
cell to cell.  And they actually look pretty similar to the normal  

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
cells that surround them. So this is not true cancer.  

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
This is a benign tumor. But it can progress to a true  

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
cancer, adenocarcinomas. And you can see from the high  

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
magnification view that this looks very different from this.  

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
The cells don't look the same one to the other, and their nuclei don't  

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
look the same either. And what you can't appreciate is  

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
that these cells are also dividing at a much greater rate compared to  

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
these cells.  And so, this is true cancer.  And this has  

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
the potential, then, to spread to metastatic  

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
disease. OK, so I've given you,  

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
there, all bunch of terminology. Let me tell you a bit more about it.  

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 Hyperplasia: too many cells.  

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
That's all it means.  Hyper: too many.  Plasia: growth,  

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:03.000
too much growth.   

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Hyperplasias can result in benign tumors, which are non-aggressive --  

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 -- nondestructive --  

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 And they, at this moment at least,  

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
have not spread to nearby tissue, non-aggressive meaning that the  

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000
cells look pretty normal. They don't look different from  

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:43.000
their normal neighbors.   

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
These can give rise to malignant tumors.  And the word cancer is  

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.000
actually reserved for malignant tumors.  If you have a tumor that's  

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
benign, you don't have cancer. Cancer refers to malignant tumors.  

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And these are different in the sense that they are aggressive.  

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
The cells are much more active. They've changed their shape.  

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.000
They've changed their structures.   

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
They are destructive, that is, they secrete factors into  

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
the environment, which break down,  

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:29.000
for example, extracellular matrix.   

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
And they have the potential to spread.  They've begun to invade  

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
into the local environment, and can't access the blood supply.  

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
OK, there are cancers in many of your organs in many different cell  

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
types within those organs. In the cancers in different places  

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
in your body are referred to by different terms.  

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 For epithelial tissues,  

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:09.000
skin, intestines, breast, brain, lung, epithelial tissues,  

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:18.000
we call the tumors carcinomas.   

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Carcinomas, and depending on the particular cells that are affected,  

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.000
whether they are glandular cells or secretory cells,  

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000
we can give them additional names, for example, an adenocarcinoma.  

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
And that's a cancer that looks like the glands that give rise to the  

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000
tumor in adenocarcinoma. And there could be adenocarcinomas  

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000
in the different places that I mentioned previously.  

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000
And there are benign versions of this tumors.  And for  

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.000
adenocarcinomas, the benign version the adenoma.  

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 You can get tumors of connective  

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
tissues, and these are referred to as sarcomas.  And there could be  

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000
different sarcomas depending on where they are found,  

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
for example, various types of myosarcomas would be found in what  

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000
type of tissue? These are muscle tumors,  

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.000
rhabdomyosarcomas, leiomyosarcomas. Another example are chondrosarcomas  

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:51.000
--   

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
-- which are tumors of cartilage. In this class of tumors, which are  

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
called soft tissue tumors, were in the news just today as a  

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
matter of fact, front page of the Boston Globe if  

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
you happen to see it. There is a site, a former dye  

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
factory that was dumping pollutants into ponds and Ashland.  

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
And they've just determined that the exposure to those dyes greatly  

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
increased the risk of children to later develop soft tissue sarcomas.  

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Several children then turning into 20, 30 year olds developed tumors of  

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
this type which fits to the theme of the lecture in terms of exposures  

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:36.000
leading to cancers.   

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Tumors of the blood system are referred to by different  

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:55.000
names, leukemias --   

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
-- in which the tumor cells are in the blood, B cell leukemias,  

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.000
T cell leukemias, erythroleukemias, myeloid leukemias where the cells  

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000
are in the bloodstream like the one I showed you before,  

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
and lymphomas where the tumors are in the lymph organs like the spleen  

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.000
or the thymus or the lymph nodes. So, that gives you some terminology.  

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:29.000
And I'll be referring to some of this terminology as we go through  

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000
the remaining lectures. And it's just useful to know as you  

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:52.000
learn about and hear about cancers.   

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Now, cancer research, over the last several decades has  

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000
been dedicated to try to understand this process of normalcy to  

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
malignancy.  How does that happen? And the conclusion from all of this  

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
work, which I will review for you is that cancer is a genetic disease.  

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
What do I mean by that?  What do I mean by cancer is a genetic disease?  

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Does anybody want to hazard a guess? What do we normally think of when  

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
we talk about genetic diseases? Heritable diseases, predispositions  

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
to disease, we talked about several of them previously in the class like  

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
cystic fibrosis and many others. Cancer can be a genetic disease in  

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
that sense.  There can be inherited predispositions to certain cancers.  

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
And I'll mention some in later lectures.  But in fact,  

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
all cancers are genetic diseases. All cancers arise through  

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
alterations in your genes. Those alterations in most cases are  

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
not inherited from one of your parents but are acquired through  

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
your lifetimes through mistakes or exposures to things that  

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
cause such changes. Why do we believe this so strongly?  

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Well, firstly, and this has been known for some time,  

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000
cancer cells don't look normal chromosomally.  

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.000
If you look at the chromosomes of normal cells, they're all the same.  

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.000
All have 46 chromosomes.  The chromosomes have proper structures  

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:34.000
but when you look at cancer cells, that's not true.  

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
For most cancers, in contrast to the normal karyotype,  

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
the normal chromosomal number in architecture, and this is an image  

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
which highlights the different chromosomes by different colors.  

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
This technique allows us to distinguish one chromosome from the  

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
other based on the color that it stains with these dyes that are used  

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
here.  Anyway, this is a normal cell,  

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
46 chromosomes.  And here's a cancer cell.  And it's different  

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
in many ways. There are way too many chromosomes.  

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
So it's a defect in chromosome number.  But it's also a defect in  

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
chromosome structure. And you can see in the boxes a  

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
couple of alterations here. There is a chromosome 7, which is  

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000
lacking a little bit of its end. So it's got a truncation.  I think  

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
that's a seven. Actually, maybe that's not.  

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
Many that's chromosome 24.  Anyway, it doesn't matter.  And here, you  

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
can see, it looks like an ice cream cone: a little bit of paint on the  

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
bottom, a little bit of green on the top.  

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
This is a new kind of chromosome that has been fused by two different  

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
chromosomes coming together. So this is a translocation.  And  

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000
here's another translocation here. So, chromosomes and cancer cells  

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
are often abnormal in their structure.  They can have  

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
translocations. They can have deletions.  

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
They can have other kinds of rearrangements.  

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
And so, based on this, we know that cancer has defects in  

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
its genomes, and ultimately we know in its genes.  

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
We also know that agents that cause cancer --  

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 -- and we refer to these  

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:20.000
as carcinogens --   

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:29.000
-- cancer-causing agents, carcinogens are most often mutagens --  

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 -- agents that cause mutations.  

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Carcinogens are mostly mutagens. And therefore, it's likely that the  

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
reason they are carcinogens is because they lead to mutations in  

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
cellular genes. We believe that very strongly,  

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
and it's based on work from many groups over long periods of time  

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
that have established this kind of correlation.  To sort of prove the  

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
point, many, many agents, many, many things that have been  

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
suspected to be cancer-causing have been tested to see whether they are  

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000
mutation causing, to see whether carcinogens are  

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
mutagens.  And they are tested using assays --  

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 -- like carcinogenicity assays where  

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
the compound in question or the agent, might be a physical agent  

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
like radiation, is tested to see whether it will  

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
promote tumor formation. And this is typically done in  

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
laboratory animals. So, you expose, say,  

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
a mouse or a rate to the agents in question, and you ask the question,  

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:12.000
over time, does that promote the formation of a discernible tumor?  

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
If yes, then the agent is a carcinogen.  OK,  

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000
and then you ask the question, is the agent a mutagen --  

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 -- using mutagenicity assays.  

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
And these are typically done in bacteria because they can be done  

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
very, very rapidly. We can ask whether the agent is  

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
able to cause mutations in bacterial cells.  And the standard assay that  

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
has been developed, and is still in use,  

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
is to take this agent, drop it into a broth carrying  

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
bacteria, and not just any bacteria, but bacteria that have mutation in a  

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
gene required for histidine synthesis.  

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 They can't make their own histidine,  

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
the amino acid histidine.  And so, for them to grow,  

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
they require histidine in the medium here, or in the medium on the plate,  

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
the auger plate that you grow them. If you were to take some of these  

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
histidine minus bacteria, and plate them on a tissue culture  

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
plate, or rather a bacterial plate, that lacked histidine would any of  

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000
them grow? No, because they can make their own.  

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000
You have been given them any.  So they can't grow into colonies.  

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000
You would get zero colonies if you did that.  This is due to a mutation  

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
in a single gene. If you can create another mutation  

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
at that site and revert the abnormal gene into a normal gene,  

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000
now the cells can make their own histidine.  So,  

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000
if you can mutate these cells back to becoming competent to make  

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
histidine, then if you plate these cells on a histidine minus plate,  

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000
you might get colonies. You would get some colonies.  

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
For every bacterial cell that acquired a mutation at the right  

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
site, fixing the histidine synthesis gene, now that cell would be able to  

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
grow into a colony. And actually, the potency of the  

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
mutagen determines how many colonies you get.  So, you can have weakly  

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
acting mutagens or strongly acting mutagens.  And  

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
as I mentioned, most agents that pass this test will also  

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:43.000
pass this test, OK?   

00:28:43.000 --> 00:29:00.000
However --   

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
-- some known carcinogens fail that test.  They clearly are carcinogens.  

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
You paint them on the back of a mouse or feed it to an animal: the  

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000
animal will develop cancer. And yet, when you do the bacterial  

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000
reversion test, they don't show up as being mutagens.  

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Why is that so?  Anybody?  Yes?   

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000
They could be so mutagenic that they block the development of the  

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
bacteria at all. That's actually a very interesting  

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
idea, not what I was thinking of. But it's a good idea.  They are  

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
super mutagens. So they fail the test for that  

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
reason.  Anything else? What's different between this test  

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
of this mutagenicity, and what actually happens in the  

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
body?  Anybody? Yes?  That's good.  

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
And I'll actually come back to that. There is another good suggestion,  

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
but I'll come back to that answer in a second.  

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
The difference is metabolism. Your body metabolizes things that  

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
you get exposed to that you eat, or that you inhale, or that you  

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000
inject yourselves with. It metabolizes it oftentimes to  

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
detoxify it or to make it more water-soluble so that you can  

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:27.000
excrete it.  There is a lot of metabolism breaking down or changing  

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000
the things that you get exposed to. And so, it's been observed that  

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000
there are certain compounds which are not themselves mutagens but are  

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000
pro-mutagens.  They have the capacity to turn into mutagens.  

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000
And in the process of metabolic enzymes, they become mutagens.  

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000
And there are very important carcinogens that fall into this  

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
category.  And one of them is shown here.  This is a polycyclic  

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
hydrocarbon called benzoate pyrene. It's a very important ingredient in  

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
cigarette smoke as well as in barbecued beef.  

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
It's a very potent carcinogen. It passes this test with flying  

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000
colors.  But if you do the bacterial reversion test,  

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000
you don't see anything. And the reason is that in the body,  

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
many of these double bonds had to be broken and replaced ultimately by  

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
hydroxyl groups to make this compound more water-soluble so that  

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
it can be excreted. And an intermediate step in the  

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
detoxification, the hydroxylation,  

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
is the formation of epoxide. And these epoxides are actually  

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
highly reactive to DNA. And these molecules, these  

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
intermediates, are highly mutagenic.  

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
And so, when you make these in your body, thinking you're doing a good  

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000
thing, you're actually doing a bad thing by creating a mutagen.  

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
And it's this that's the mutagenic agent.  And so,  

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
now the simple bacterial reversion test has been replaced by something  

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
called the Ames test named after Bruce Ames from Berkeley in which  

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000
the compound in question is not just given directly to the bacteria.  

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000
Its first passed through an extract of the liver, usually rat liver,  

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000
and it's in the liver where these detoxifying enzymes do their job,  

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
these cytochrome P450's that are referred to here are present in  

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:39.000
abundance in your liver. And so if mutagens are going to be  

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:45.000
formed, they should be formed in this in vitro extract.  

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:52.000
And then, one takes the product of that and performs the bacterial  

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:58.000
mutation or reversion test. OK, and now the things that were  

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:04.000
carcinogens but not seen to be mutagens can be seen to be mutagens  

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:13.000
again.  OK, but --   

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:30.000
-- still --   

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:36.000
There are still some truly non-mutagenic carcinogens.  

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.000
And two examples are alcohol and asbestos.  

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 These do not pass any mutagenicity  

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
tests that I'm aware of. But both of them are clearly linked  

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
to cancer development: alcohol in the case of liver,  

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
cancer, and head and neck cancer, and asbestos in the case of  

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
mesothelioma, the lining of the lung.  

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
So these are not mutagens. So how did they promote cancer  

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000
formation?  Based on the mechanism that was suggested over here.  

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
These agents cause irritation in tissues --  

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 -- which results in tissue  

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:38.000
destruction, loss of cells --   

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:44.000
-- and their replacement of those cells, cell replenishment.  

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:50.000
So, it recruits a lot of cells to begin to divide when they normally  

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.000
wouldn't.  So it results in increased proliferation,  

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:02.000
and the increased potential for mutation because - 

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000
when cells divide. When they duplicate their DNA,  

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
there is an inherent risk of making mistakes.  It's not an error-free  

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.000
process.  So the more cell division there is, the more opportunity there  

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000
is for error, and therefore, the increased risk of acquiring  

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000
mutations and becoming ultimately a cancer.  OK, I want to take a couple  

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000
of minutes talking about one really important environmental carcinogen,  

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000
something that we get exposed to. And that is cigarette smoke.  

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
I mentioned that benzoate pyrene is one of the important ingredients in  

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
cigarette smoke, but it's actually not the only  

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000
mutagen.  There are actually hundreds of mutagens in cigarette  

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000
smoke.  And this is the most important environmental carcinogen  

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000
that we have in our environments. And it results in a large number of  

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
deaths per year. Tobacco smoke is responsible for a  

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000
high percentage of the 175, 00 people who die from lung cancer  

00:36:10.000 --> 00:37:35.866
in this country each year. About 150 were either smokers  

00:34:48.000 --> 00:36:27.000
or former smokers.   

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
And the association between lung cancer and cigarette smoking is  

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000
really striking. If you look here,  

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000
the green line represents cigarette consumption in males from the  

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
beginning of the century, the 1900s, through 1960.  And you  

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
can see it rapidly increased through availability and social acceptance  

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000
and social trends. Smoking was really rampant in the  

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000
society.  And shortly thereafter, with about a 20 year lag, you could  

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000
see that lung cancer risk increased dramatically as well,  

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
which is directly attributable to the cigarette smoke exposure.  

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
It took time because cancers don't develop right away.  

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
They develop over years, and so you need to get exposed to  

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
stuff over a long period of time. But eventually the lung cancer  

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000
started to rise. And you could see the shape of the  

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000
curves are virtually identical. You can also see that the smoking  

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
rate has dropped off a little bit in men, and actually has dropped off a  

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000
little bit starting about 15 to 20 years ago with respect to  

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000
lung cancers as well. So smoking cessation has an effect.  

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000
If you reduce the exposure, you can reduce your risk.  

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000
That's true of men. Women have not caught up yet.  

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000
Women started smoking later than men, about 20 years later,  

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000
and their lung cancer rates followed, then, their increases in cigarette  

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
smoking with about a 20 year lag, and you can see now that lung cancer  

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000
among women is still rising. And it recently passed breast cancer  

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:08.000
as the most common type of cancer deaths among women.  

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000
So lung cancer is a major disease and is directly related to smoking  

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000
and smoking history. Surprisingly, given that fact --  

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 -- still 47 million Americans smoke,  

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.000
in recent polls something like 26% of men and 22% of women,  

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:44.000
a remarkably high number. And if you go to other countries,  

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000
the numbers are worse.  So the message clearly has not been  

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000
adequately delivered. But what is even more surprising to  

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000
me was the results of a survey done in 2002 where high school students  

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:13.000
are asked whether they smoked.   

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000
What do you think? What percentage of American high  

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000
school students smoke? Anybody?  It was 28%; more than one  

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000
in four smoke. And I've heard recently that the  

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000
number is increasing since 2002. So, this very,  

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.000
very detrimental agent which one controls oneself is clearly not  

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
going away and will lead to, unfortunately, the deaths of many of  

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.000
these individuals because of lung cancer.  And by the way,  

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000
it's not just lung cancer that smoking is a problem for: emphysema,  

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000
heart disease, and other diseases as well.  I read a statistic which was  

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000
really shocking to me. Of that however many billions of  

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000
people are present on the planet today, the 500 million of them will  

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.000
die early because of complications of cigarette smoking.  

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000
500 million people will live less than their full lifespans because of  

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:22.000
cigarette smoke. So, if you learn nothing else from  

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:28.000
this class, if you currently smoke, stop.  And if you don't smoke, don't  

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000
start. OK, that was my little sermon.  

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Hopefully it had some effect.  And it provides a segue into --  

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:48.000
 -- the sources of the mutations that  

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000
occur in genes during cancer progression.  We've just been  

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000
discussing exogenous, or environmental mutagens,  

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000
cigarette smoke being one, some lead exposure being another,  

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000
dietary carcinogens I mentioned, environmental pollutants like the  

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:14.000
dyes in the ponds and ash land. They are common.  They do certainly  

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.000
have an effect, but there are probably somewhat  

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000
overblown except for some light and tobacco smoke,  

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000
and then these rare instances of high exposure to very,  

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:38.000
very toxic things.   

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000
A more common problem are replication errors,  

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
mistakes that your cells make in duplicating their DNA.  

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
They put in the wrong base or they skip a base, or other errors take  

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:58.000
place during DNA duplication.   

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.000
Your DNA can break inside of your cells as it gets moved around from  

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000
place to place or because of an exposure to certain things from the  

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:13.000
outside.  And then this can lead to translocations or deletions or other  

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000
rearrangements. And I'll tell you later about how  

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:24.000
those can lead to cancer-causing mutations.  

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 Defects in chromosome segregation,  

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000
dividing the number of chromosomes properly between cells,  

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
is another problem.  And I shown you an example of that.  

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000
Here you can see that the number of chromosomes is also wrong in  

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000
addition to their structure. So, defects in chromosome  

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000
segregation are a problem in cancer. Defects in DNA repair processes can  

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:25.000
then facilitate further mutations.   

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000
And various metabolic processes can produce mutagens insider cells like  

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000
super oxide molecules which are very reactive and very mutagenic.  

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000
Your cells have ways of detoxifying, but they're not always perfect.  You  

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
can also take antioxidants to try to reduce your risk of getting this  

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
kind of exposure. But nevertheless,  

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
these endogenously produced mutagens are another common source of  

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
mutations in cancer. So, we get exposed to things.  

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
We produce things, we make mistakes, and in our cells,  

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000
alterations occur in cellular genes which drive this process forward.  

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
And overall, therefore, we observe a clonal evolution of  

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000
more and more abnormal cells in the development of cancer.  

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000
And that's captured here. Clonal evolution from a normal cell,  

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000
a cell that acquires a single mutation, this cell now has  

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000
increased capacity to divide. So it divides more.  More of its  

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.000
progeny are produced. We are maybe in the stage of  

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000
hyperplasia here. And within this increased mass of  

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000
cells, another mutation occurs. Now the cell has even greater  

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.000
capacity to divide or begin to act abnormally relative to its neighbors.  

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000
It begins to grow. And within this increased  

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.000
collection of cells, yet another mutation occurs.  

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000
There is a clonal evolution of more and more abnormal cells.  

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000
And we know that cancers, in fact, have acquired many,  

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000
many changes in their DNA as evidenced by the chromosomes,  

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000
but also as evidenced by our knowledge of the sequence of key  

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:11.000
genes that are affected in cancer. Now, as we'll discuss,  

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:17.000
many of these genes affect proliferation --  

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 -- and cell death.  

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Again, cancer is a disease of cell number, too many cells.  

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000
And this process is normally very carefully balanced inside of your  

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000
bodies inside of your tissues. There is an equal balance between  

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:48.000
proliferation --   

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
-- and cell death so that in normal homeostasis --  

00:45:52.000 --> 00:46:00.000
 -- you have the appropriate members  

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000
of cells produced as die off, and so that ultimately you are in  

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000
balance.  But in cancer, the balance is shifted.  It's  

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000
shifted in the direction of proliferation,  

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:18.000
and away from cell death. And the consequences of that are  

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
that you've now produced too many cells for the tissue,  

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.000
too many cells in the gut, too many cells in the blood.  

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.000
And these cells, then, accumulate and acquire additional changes that  

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.000
imbue them with those qualities that advanced malignancies have.  

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
Increased proliferation is one thing, but importantly it's not the only  

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000
thing.  Increased proliferation and cell death are important qualities  

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
for sure.  But also as I mentioned, cancer cells develop in other ways  

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.000
that are important in the development of malignancies.  

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Today, for example, a recruit a blood supply.  They secrete factors  

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.000
that cause the blood vessels to grow into them, to feed the tumor.  

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000
They increased their motility. Cancer cells move around.  They  

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.000
move into tissue. They move into the bloodstream.  

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000
They move back out again.  And that's what this intravasation term  

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000
means, moving into the blood supply, and other characteristics as well,  

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000
how they remodel the extracellular matrix, or how they avoid the immune  

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.000
system, all sorts of things that cancer cells require in order to  

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000
survive to get bigger, to thrive, are acquired through  

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.000
alterations in cellular genes. Now, the final thing,  

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000
and I'll close with this and pick it up again next time,  

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.000
the final thing that convinces us that cancer is a disease of your  

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000
genes is that we've now sequenced the genes of cancer cells and have  

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.000
found alterations. Like in this gene here that you've  

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000
been exposed to, the RAS gene, in which in normal  

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.000
cells we see one sequence and in cancer cells we see a different  

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000
sequence, and we can understand that as a change in the activity of this  

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000
important signaling protein that causes cells to divide  

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.600
inappropriately.  And I'll stop there.
