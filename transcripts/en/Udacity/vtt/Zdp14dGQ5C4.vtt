00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.190
Let's take an actual segment of the ABO gene sequence here. From the coding

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:12.280
region, we're going to take all the sequence from position 793 to position

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.440
801. So we're in the ABO gene. There's sequence on either side of

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.280
this, but I want to focus in on this little snippet here. The TACCTGGGG.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.330
Now let's imagine that this is part of a

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.530
DNA coding region in the ABO gene, and that

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.020
it's going to be turned into protein, and the codons

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.560
would be red like this, where we're in frame, we're

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.270
reading along and we had a codon, a codon

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.060
and a codon. I want you to imagine that

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.020
you're a ribosome. An you were going to translate this

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.230
sequence. So what would be the amino acids produced from

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.000
this DNA sequence from the coding region of the ABO gene.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.850
I want you to use your genetic code, and look for

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.040
the one letter abbreviations of the amino acids, and put what

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.390
answer you think it would be in this text box here.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.000
Remember, this is something you're going to need to use your

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.070
genetic code for, which you can see in a miniaturized version

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.260
here. But, you can also get it in a link, located

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.420
in the instructor's notes on this page. It's probably a good idea

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.350
to go ahead and print this off and keep it handy somewhere, as we're going

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.430
to keep coming back to it throughout

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.140
other exercises in this lesson and other lessons.
