00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.820
Welcome back guys, I'm Nate, and thank you for joining me. today

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.580
We're going to be doing a few different experiments using proto puddy.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.090
In the past we have showed you how to make your own proto puddy and several cool

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.860
Experiments that you can do with it. today

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.170
We're gonna try out some experiments that a few people have asked about

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.119
We've got four different things that we're gonna try out with our proto puddy today. We're going to freeze some in liquid nitrogen

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.770
We're going to burn some in our furnace

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.239
We're going to try and make a mold using a proto putty and then we're going to see if we can cast liquid metal

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.029
in that mold. The purpose of our video today is to run our proto puddy through a gauntlet of tests to see how it holds

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.039
Up under different conditions, we have a whole previous video on how to make proto putty, but let's go over the process really quick

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.819
We've got here our three ingredients that we need for making proto putty silicone one caulking food coloring and cornstarch to get started

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.779
Let's mix up a few small batches of proto putty that we can use to test freezing and burning.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.780
Remember this stuff smells really strong so you're gonna want to make sure you have a well-ventilated area to mix it up

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.290
Remember when you're working with your proto potty as soon as it starts to stick to your hands add more cornstarch

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.049
All right, I've got my first batch of proto pudding mixed up. I'm gonna split it in two and try two different things

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.629
I'm gonna make a ball with one half and the other 1/2

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.440
I'm gonna spread out into a flat little plank that we can easily dip down into our liquid, nitrogen

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.099
Now mixing up a second small batch of proto putty, and I'm going to form it into two flat sticks to test in our furnace

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.718
Alright now. Let's mix up a little bit of blue proto putty and try to mold this 3d printed octopus

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.699
Doesn't even look blue. It looks black. It'll start looking blue as soon as I mix it

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.580
For this octopus

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.210
We're just doing a very basic press mold pushing our proto putty down all over the 3d print to give it a nice even coating

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.730
All right now we've got a couple of pieces of cured proto putty

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.339
And we're gonna see what happens when we dip them in liquid, nitrogen

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.180
You can see that the stuff is very flexible you can bend it you can squish it

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.459
You can twist it you can stretch it, and now we're gonna see if any of that changes once it freezes

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.769
So I'm gonna try two things the first is that I'm gonna

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:59.740
Let it sit in the liquid, nitrogen

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.320
Until it's good and cold then I'm gonna take it out and let it thaw and we'll see if anything has changed

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.889
After that I'm gonna take this piece of proto putty put it back in the liquid, nitrogen

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.490
Until its frozen solid and then I'm going to see if I can snap it in half

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.559
I also have a little ball of proto putty

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.790
Which is fairly bouncy, and I'm gonna see if it's still bouncy after it's been frozen in liquid, nitrogen

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.320
See it's boiling as it heats up from the proto putty but soon it will start all cooling off

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.080
Wow even the part of the proto Pete

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.400
Okay, that was unexpected it just shattered

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.579
problem the cold and fell entirely into the cup

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.469
Part of it was in the liquid nitrogen part of it wasn't while I was just trying to gently stir it around

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.739
It flopped and broke apart, and then the piece that wasn't in the liquid nitrogen fell down into the liquid nitrogen's

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.579
All right, I'm going to pour the liquid nitrogen off into this other Cup so I can take those pieces of proto putty out oh

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.360
That's weird it sounds like pieces of tile or ceramic in there you hear that

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.350
Alright, let's pour them out oh

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.850
my gosh

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.850
our protocol has

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:26.059
Just broken into pieces here. All right. Well. I'm doing this out of order, but because I have an extra piece

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.950
I'm gonna try snapping this. Yep, just like no resistance at all. That's very weak

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.249
It feels about like breaking a piece of chalk all right

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.980
Let's let these pieces warm back up and see what happens to them

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.520
I'm curious if they'll go back to being flexible and squishy like they were before

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.259
Right now obviously. They're not flexible at all and they just snap even if you don't do anything

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.499
They just break spontaneously from the cold which I did not see coming

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.750
While we're waiting for those pieces to warm back up let's drop our ball into the liquid nitrogen and see what happens to it

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.570
At this point I suspect it's gonna break into pieces

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.259
Bubbles are getting smaller so the proto putty is cooling down

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.080
Hmm, I wonder if the ball is gonna crack or not

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.059
That's a cool effect of liquid nitrogen fumes flow just barely over the lip of the cup

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.520
And then they run down the sides kind of sticking to it

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.039
You can see that the vapors go in with the incline of the cup all right

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.529
I think that's probably as cold as it's gonna get I heard one little crack sound but not much else so let's just pour off

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.320
The nitrogen and take the ball out and let's see what happens to it

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:31.880
Oh

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.420
And now it popped in my hand

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.999
Coming out of the nitrogen I wonder if it's just the the heat from my hand or the heat from the air or just that

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.950
It was ready to pop and it's just not it's moving now. Well. I was gonna see if it'll bounce now

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.920
I think I'm gonna see if it'll just shatter into a bunch of pieces. Let's try that

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.570
Well, actually that still bounced. It just didn't bounce like a bouncy ball

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.319
Nothing it's not really shattering. It's just breaking along the lines

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.559
Where it had already cracked in the liquid nitrogen so at this point?

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.060
Let's let it warm back up and see what happens to it. They almost look like little gummy candies

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.430
They will be gummy, but they aren't candy our first piece of proto putty has warmed back up now

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.389
Let's see what the texture is like and if it still has the same flexibility that it had before

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.960
Let tears really easily

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.219
Like it doesn't seem nearly as tough as it was

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.450
weird

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:32.770
so it tears and then there's this like white film on the very outside that kind of holds together the

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.670
Inside just breaks through really easily, but something on the outside

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:43.059
Really tough. All right. Let's try one of these bigger piece and see what happens if you break them oh

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.470
Those cracks

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.999
All through it I wonder if that's just something else that cracked from the pÃ¶lten. I couldn't see it, but

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.060
Yeah that stuff Wow

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.199
before I could twist this and

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:01.508
Pull it and squish it and now it just is like ripping to pieces immediately

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:08.019
Weird whoa? This one's even more broken pieces look at it. Okay. That's not even holding itself together

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.199
Okay, these pieces are mostly warmed back up

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:15.938
Let's see if they've got any bounce they aren't round so they certainly aren't going to bounce nice and up-and-down

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:19.149
But let's see if it will at least have some ricochet to it

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:23.379
That seems kind of bouncy

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:29.528
Kind of like bouncing an eraser, maybe it's not like a bouncy ball, but it definitely has some spring to it

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:37.778
Our octopus mold is ready. Let's peel it off and see how it's turned out there we go

00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:41.469
This is looking good

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:45.759
All right look at that that did pretty well

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:51.729
You can even see the details of the print lines from the 3d print as a mold making material

00:07:51.729 --> 00:07:52.839
I think this actually works pretty

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:57.099
Well it picks up a lot of good detail as long as you make sure to press the proto putty

00:07:57.229 --> 00:07:58.909
Carefully into all of the nooks and crannies

00:07:58.909 --> 00:08:03.909
I think if you have any sort of resin or casting plastic that should work really well in this silicone putty

00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:08.079
I do have to warn you should not ever use proto putty as a mold for food

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:12.519
There are a lot of chemicals coming off of proto putty that can make your food toxic in just a minute

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.879
We'll fire up the furnace and see if we can cast aluminum in the proto putty mold

00:08:15.879 --> 00:08:20.019
We've also got two pieces of proto putty. We're gonna throw right into the furnace and we'll see you it happens

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.020
Maybe they'll burn maybe they'll melt

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:33.209
Okay our furnace is heating up and starting to melt some aluminum and while it's getting hot enough

00:08:33.209 --> 00:08:37.139
We're going to try in this piece of proto putty to see what happens to it

00:08:37.209 --> 00:08:41.639
Before going in it's nice and flexible just like the other proto puddi was we'll see what happens when it's done

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.649
You might just burn up. I don't know Oh

00:08:45.399 --> 00:08:50.849
Immediately you see the edges start earning it starts getting all bubbly

00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:54.359
That looks like a badly burned marshmallow

00:09:00.329 --> 00:09:06.888
Yeah, that is on fire that's a cool fire vortex tornado thing going on there

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:18.589
Smells weird, but it almost has the tiniest hint of like a fruity smell like if you burn a pie

00:09:18.589 --> 00:09:21.469
I think that's the acetic acid from the silicone

00:09:29.859 --> 00:09:36.899
Now interestingly even though this stuff has been burned pretty badly. It's still quite flexible, so

00:09:37.419 --> 00:09:41.219
Burning it it retains a lot more of its properties than freezing it apparently

00:09:41.439 --> 00:09:45.959
It's a little bit sticky so maybe it did start melting a little bit as well as burning

00:09:45.959 --> 00:09:48.149
I'm gonna see if I can just tear it apart by pulling oh

00:09:48.669 --> 00:09:53.669
Yeah, that still tears pretty easily, so I'd say it did weaken it well there

00:09:53.669 --> 00:09:56.069
You go still red on the inside of the thicker areas

00:09:58.929 --> 00:10:04.798
All right my aluminum is nice, and hot I'm gonna pull out the crucible and then pour the liquid aluminum into our proto potting mold

00:10:11.499 --> 00:10:13.499
And it's on fire

00:10:14.769 --> 00:10:18.418
And it's spilling over the edge, and it's still on fire

00:10:20.679 --> 00:10:22.858
The proto putty mold is burning

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:30.899
Still pretty liquid, so I don't really want to get anywhere near it in case it decides to start popping and exploding oh

00:10:33.489 --> 00:10:36.659
It just I blew it out and the heat just lit it right back on fire

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:47.939
We poured the liquid aluminum into our pro to putty mold and the pro to putty mold quickly lit on fire

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:52.529
So I think that means that it's not gonna be a great mold material for liquid metal

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:58.380
We actually got a little bit of the shape of the octopus's head right there. It's not very clean

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:04.140
It didn't get any of the tentacles and it did light our mold on fire, but a little bit of octopus head did get cast

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:07.950
There you have it guys for different experiments with proto putty

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.850
We've tried freezing it in liquid, nitrogen

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:15.480
Burning in the furnace making a mold out of it and casting liquid metal into it we had some mixed results

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:17.140
freezing the proto putty in liquid, nitrogen

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.759
I thought it was going to freeze then it would thaw and it would return to its normal state

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:24.480
But in freezing it cracked and started breaking into pieces all on its own

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.079
And when I had thought it was very fragile and didn't hold itself together very well

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:30.960
Burning the proto putty did go about as I expected it

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.160
Just started charring and bubbling and burning it smelled bad lit on fire and in the end

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.889
It's not really good for anything it might still be a little bit flexible

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:41.460
But it's also gummy and burned and black and it smells weirder than normal

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:47.040
And I wouldn't recommend that you burn this for any reason. There's no advantage to it making a mold out of proto putty

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.150
I thought worked very well

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:51.209
We got a lot of detail pulled from our 3d printed octopus

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:55.170
And we had a mold that would have worked really well for most kinds of resins however

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:59.580
Pouring molten aluminum into that mold did not work very well the proto putty

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.250
Just lit on fire

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:05.700
Immediately and the metal casting didn't come out well at all so I can't recommend using proto potti as a mold for casting metal

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.929
Lots of things that we've learned about proto putty today if you've made something cool about proto putty

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:11.280
Tell me about it down in the comments

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.160
I want to know what things you've come up with thanks for joining us for this video today

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.160
And we'll see you in the next one talk to you then

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.040
Kind of looks like a giant stick of cinnamon gum

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:25.530
It's everywhere

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.740
Hey guys, I hope you're having a great day you are awesome

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:32.520
You are appreciated, and I know everyone over here my team is really grateful for you

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:36.179
Thanks so much for choosing to watch and support our videos. We'll see you in the next one
