00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.620
Let's take a closer look at how naming base

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.205
redirection works. In the example shown here, I've looked up

00:00:06.205 --> 00:00:11.020
symantec.com from two different locations. You can see that

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.570
when we look up the domain name, we don't get

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.860
an A record immediately, but rather we get a

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.210
CNAME or a canonical name. Which tells us to look

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.860
up the following domain name in Akamai. When we look

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.810
up that domain name, we see, two corresponding IP addresses.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.066
Notice that when we perform the same look

00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:30.660
up from Boston, we also get redirected to Akamai

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.150
through the CNAME, but we get, two different IP

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.040
addresses, that are presumably more local to the Boston

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.510
area. So depending on where the client looks

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.690
up the domain name, it recieves different IP addresses

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.050
at different locations in the network. This is how

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.298
operators use DNS to redirect clients to nearby replicas.

00:00:50.298 --> 00:00:54.098
As another example,you can see when I ping youtube.com,

00:00:54.098 --> 00:00:56.910
I get very low latencies. And when I do

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.380
a reverse lookup on this IP address, I in

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.100
fact see that the content was posted on Google CDN.
