00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.160
[Captions by Y Translator]
A Newton's Cradle
is a well-known apparatus

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.840
that demonstrates
Newton's Third Law of Motion.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.240
That for every action,
there's an equal and opposite reaction.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.620
Today, we're going to be building
a scaled-up Newton's Cradle

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.800
using billiard balls.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.740
You've probably seen and played
with those little desktop toys

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.520
made of like five silver marbles
that just swing back and forth

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.500
and they make pleasant clacking noises.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.900
They're used for stress relief
or just the background noise.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.500
Today, we're going to be
building a larger one of those,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.000
and instead of those small metal balls.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.600
We're going to be using billiard balls.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.800
Here's the building plan.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.500
We'll have two frame pieces
attached to the base and to each other.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.280
Near the top, we'll have some hooks
that we can run our lines through

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.880
along with some pegs that
will help us make adjustments.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.720
To start, we're going to
build two pieces of frame.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.940
And each one is going to be made
of three pieces of our 2 by 2.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.320
Each of those pieces is going
to be 18 inches long to start.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.820
So let's get cutting.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.220
One of these beams
will be the top piece,

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.680
and then we're going to have two legs

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.320
coming down on the sides of it.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.100
So it'll basically be like that.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.740
And what angle we have
this setup is pretty subjective.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.160
It can be kind of whatever you want.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.900
So I'm just going to take one measurement

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.820
and then cut all of the pieces to match.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.800
Beautiful.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.900
I just need to trim the bottoms

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.100
so that it will sit flush on the board.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.000
We've got all our pieces cut.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.160
Now, we're going to secure them together.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.780
We'll make 2 of this shape.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.700
Excellent.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.080
Each of our billiard balls is pretty much

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.920
exactly 2 and 1/4 inches in diameter.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.100
So what we need to do now is drill

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.780
some holes into the top
of each support beam.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.780
Five of them, because we're going
to have five different billiard balls,

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.080
and of course each hole needs to
be two and a quarter inches apart.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.600
These four dots and this one
cross point, is where we will

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.980
drill the holes to attach our hooks.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.380
Let's do the same thing on the other side.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.100
These holes we just drilled

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.380
are going to have these
eye hooks in them.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.160
However, when you're
making a Newton's Cradle,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.260
it's actually quite important
that all of the balls

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.080
in the Cradle line up perfectly
in all three dimensions.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.460
They can't be too far
apart from each other,

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.160
they can't have the strings
leaning toward each other

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.380
so that there's too much 
pressure holding them together

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.800
and that can be a really
tricky thing to do.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.660
However, the system I have devised

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.300
seems to work pretty well for being

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.080
able to adjust where they hang.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.840
So we're going to have these five hooks.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.960
But we're also going to have
five sort of tuning pegs

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.580
that will let us adjust
how the billiard balls hang.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.020
We're just going to be using
some pieces of dowel

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.380
as the little tuning pegs.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.860
We'll have the hook a little bit higher.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.060
The line will come from the
billiard ball up through the hook,

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.000
and then back down to the peg

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.720
which we'll install a little below the pegs.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.140
So that way, all of the pressure
should always be on the hook

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.000
regardless of where on
the swing angle the ball is.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.900
Now we want these to be sturdy

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.520
as they sit about eight inches apart.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.280
So what we're going to do is take
some of our scrap pieces of 2 by 2,

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.360
cut a couple of lengths
that are 8 inches long

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.380
and attach them on to the four corners.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.520
I think this needs to be black.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.460
We're gonna turn this black.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.480
To attach the billiard balls
onto the frame,

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.020
we're going to be using these even

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.980
smaller little eye hooks
and some fishing line.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.060
And to get these little eye hooks
attached to the billiard balls,

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.340
we're going to use a very small drill bit.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.000
We'll drill two holes into
each billiard ball

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.540
and then screw the hooks in

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.000
and then attach the wires onto those.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.000
We've got all of the hooks
installed onto the billiard balls.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.800
And now what we need to do is
attach the cords.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.100
And for that, we're using
some thin fishing line.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.460
The knot that I'm using is
called the palomar knot.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.540
And it's designed for attaching
fish hooks to the line.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.520
You start out by just
making a loop on one side.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.960
With, I've got plenty of extra here.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.100
If you're actually doing this on a hook,

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.780
you wouldn't need nearly that much extra.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.140
But you will on this you'll see why.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.780
So that loop pushes down through to eye.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.700
And we've got these two sides.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.180
That's where the end
of the doubled over portion is.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.020
And we're just going to tie
this in an overhand knot.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.760
Overhand knot right there.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.760
And what we need to make sure
is that the loop on this side

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.820
of the overhand knot is big
enough they can fit all the way

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.220
around the billiard ball.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.160
And then we pull it tight.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.780
And we can cut off all the extra.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.900
It gets a little bit more complicated

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.480
when you attach the second one

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.220
because you still have to fit it
all the way around the billiard ball.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.580
But you don't want to catch
the first line in you're knot.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.460
And so you have to
sort of feed it through.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.600
So, I'm going to take this loop,

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.400
wrap it all the way around the billiard ball.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.400
Then I also have to just 
pull that out of the way

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.140
before I tighten this one down.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.020
This is going to be part of our base.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.480
It's going to go on top
of this other piece of plywood.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.180
And that just is going to
give us a nice look to it.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.560
Let's go trim this down.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.480
Now we need 10 pegs to fit in these holes.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.940
Each one just about inch and a half.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.080
Maybe two inches long.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.900
Make it an even two.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.800
So that we can attach our fishing
line to these sort of tuning pegs,

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.820
we're just going to drill
a hole through each of them.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.940
Now we've got all of our frame
built and it's time to start

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.300
attaching the billiard balls.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.120
Not doing anything too fancy here.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.400
Just a knot on one side

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.060
and then a square knot
on the other side.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.520
Now by twisting that peg,

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.360
I can shorten or lengthen
the line on that side.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.740
And that moves the ball
hanging down below.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:35.400
Beautiful.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.020
Four more.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.660
It's not going to be perfect
but fortunately we have

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.080
the ability to adjust and get it closer.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.420
At this point, I think we
are ready to test it out.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.420
It seems properly calibrated.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.600
Let's see how well it works.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.500
The Newton's Cradle is wonderful
for demonstrating

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.280
Newton's third law of motion

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.220
which is that for every action,

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.520
there's an equal and opposite reaction.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.600
Billiard balls are not very
compressible and so all the energy

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.100
that enters into one side
of them tries to exit out

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.560
the other side if it can't move.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.560
If I pull back on the red ball,

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.100
the orange yellow and green balls

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.680
for the most part stay in place.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.060
And in the energy from the red ball,

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.000
is transferred over to the blue.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.260
The blue swings out,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.240
swings back and transfers its energy

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.640
back through the middle three

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.920
and into the red ball again.

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.260
This is not a perfect system.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.760
And in fact, there's no such
thing as a perfect system.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.740
So some energy is not transferred 
just the way we want it.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.580
That's why we start seeing
some swinging motion

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.920
and why it doesn't continue moving forever.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.720
Some of the motion is transferred
through the lines up into the frame,

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.860
into the base,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.100
onto the workbench,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.400
and it's lost there.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.460
A little bit of the energy is
actually turned into heat

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.560
as the billiard balls
collide with each other.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.100
In a truly perfect system,

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.600
the three billiard balls in
the middle would never move

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.060
and the two on the outsides

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.980
would keep bouncing 
back and forth forever.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.600
That would also require
there was no air resistance.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.900
The little desktop toys
usually use a metallic ball

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.040
which is even better at transferring
energy than these billiard balls.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.460
They're also often slightly magnetic
which helps hold them together

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.740
if the energy from a swinging
ball isn't pushing it out of line.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.020
You can make some really interesting
patterns by playing with this thing.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.660
If the line is swinging and then one
ball is pulled away and allowed to drop,

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.720
the line will keep swinging
but the outside balls

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.480
will bounce on and off.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.580
Random fact, the name
Newton's Cradle was coined in 1967

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.100
by the English actor Simon Preble.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.500
By shortening the strings,

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.700
we eliminate some of the play

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.360
so it should last a little bit better.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.960
But we also have a much shorter period

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.720
which is the length of 
time it takes the ball

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.440
to swing from one apogee to the other.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.320
Newton's Cradle, a fun
toy to build and use.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.400
I like to try and to figure out
interesting new bounce patterns with it.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.500
Overall, I really enjoyed building it.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.920
And it's a good example of Newton's
laws of motion and physics.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.800
Are there other things you
would like to see us build

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.880
demonstrating basic science principles?

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.800
Let us know down
in the comments as always.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.940
If we use your idea to make
a video, we will send you 25 bucks.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.120
The fun is not over.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.880
That box at the top will
transport you directly

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.660
to our last video and you
should check that out.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.380
The other box will show
you what YouTube thinks

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:19.400
you need to be watching next.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.800
And if you aren't subscribed to
our channel, hit this bomb in the middle

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.480
and that way you
never miss out on the fun.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:24.760
Don't forget to ring that bell

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.800
and we will see you in the next one.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.700
Talk to you then.
