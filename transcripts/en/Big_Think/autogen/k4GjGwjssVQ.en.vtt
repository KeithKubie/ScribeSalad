is what I'm really saying then you take

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629
is what I'm really saying then you take
 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.350

it with that subtlety and nuance and

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360
it with that subtlety and nuance and
 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.450
it with that subtlety and nuance and
even humor so all religious texts have

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460
even humor so all religious texts have

to be interpreted and the really
 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.530
to be interpreted and the really
dangerous thing is when someone says I'm

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540
dangerous thing is when someone says I'm
 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.299
dangerous thing is when someone says I'm
not giving you my opinion I'm just

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309
not giving you my opinion I'm just
 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.789
not giving you my opinion I'm just
telling you what it says because that's

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799
telling you what it says because that's
 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.150
telling you what it says because that's
actually their opinion if you deny human

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970
of oppression or exploitation so
 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.100
of oppression or exploitation so
everything gets way more interesting

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110
everything gets way more interesting
 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.530
everything gets way more interesting
when you start reading it literally

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540
when you start reading it literally
 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.340
when you start reading it literally
because you then don't have to do those

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350
because you then don't have to do those
 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.400
because you then don't have to do those
awkward explanations one of my one of

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410
awkward explanations one of my one of
 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.050
awkward explanations one of my one of
the greatest examples of this is there's

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060
the greatest examples of this is there's
 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.610
the greatest examples of this is there's
this anxious story about Jonah who gets

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620
this anxious story about Jonah who gets
 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.960

because it says in the ancient text and
so the question often becomes a debate

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150
so the question often becomes a debate
 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.430
so the question often becomes a debate
about whether or not a guy really got

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440
about whether or not a guy really got
 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.080
about whether or not a guy really got
swallowed by a fish and you have the

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090
swallowed by a fish and you have the
 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.580
swallowed by a fish and you have the
literalists going it says he got

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590
literalists going it says he got
 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.870
literalists going it says he got
swallowed by fish he got swallowed by a

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880
swallowed by fish he got swallowed by a
 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.460
swallowed by fish he got swallowed by a
fish and then you have the others going

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470
fish and then you have the others going
 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.730
fish and then you have the others going
no it's a larger metaphor but what's

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740
no it's a larger metaphor but what's
 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.850
no it's a larger metaphor but what's
interesting is the story begins the

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860

Assyrians were the worst neighbors they

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680
Assyrians were the worst neighbors they
 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.410
Assyrians were the worst neighbors they
were the cruel oppressors who had made

life miserable and so this man Jonah is

was the capital of Assyria so the story
 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.670
was the capital of Assyria so the story

runs away which I
 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.130
runs away which I
think the original audience would have

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140
think the original audience would have
 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.580

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.960
arguing about whether or not he was
swallowed by a fish I think the story

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970
swallowed by a fish I think the story
 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.540
swallowed by a fish I think the story
was told to a group of people to

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550
was told to a group of people to
 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.820
was told to a group of people to
confront them with how they cannot

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830

suffered define you and hold you back or
 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.610
suffered define you and hold you back or
can you forgive can you move towards

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620
can you forgive can you move towards
 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.150

your enemy not with violence but with
 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.550

love do the things that have happened to
 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.880
love do the things that have happened to
us define us or is there a love that can

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890
us define us or is there a love that can
 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.480

transcend even this so this would be a

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490
transcend even this so this would be a
 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.949
transcend even this so this would be a
classic example to me where there's an

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959
classic example to me where there's an
 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.990
classic example to me where there's an
ancient text in a story where you can in

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000
ancient text in a story where you can in
 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.480

interesting questions of the heart that
 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.500
interesting questions of the heart that
I think are the questions the

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510
I think are the questions the
 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.400
I think are the questions the

in our world to this day taking some of

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230
in our world to this day taking some of
 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.509
in our world to this day taking some of
these texts literally has caused so much

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519
these texts literally has caused so much
 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.780
these texts literally has caused so much
violence you read the ancient texts you

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790
violence you read the ancient texts you
 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.290
violence you read the ancient texts you
also use your mind you listen for what

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300
also use your mind you listen for what
 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.030
also use your mind you listen for what
new thing might be happening in the

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040
new thing might be happening in the
 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.199
new thing might be happening in the
world you read it as a fully orbed

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209
world you read it as a fully orbed
 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.090
world you read it as a fully orbed
experience and then it actually gets

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100
experience and then it actually gets
 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.340
experience and then it actually gets
quite inspiring

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350
 
 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.410
