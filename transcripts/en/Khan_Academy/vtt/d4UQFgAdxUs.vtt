DAVID GREGORY: Back now at 8:36
with Education Nation Today.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.290
This morning, how
technology is leading

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.720
to a new kind of learning.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.640
NBC's Craig Melvin
is here with a look

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.330
at the classroom of the future.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.940
Hey, Craig, good morning.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:11.930
CRAIG MELVIN: David,
good morning to you.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.555
Savannah, good morning
to you, as well.

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:15.680
From text books to
tablets, have you

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.210
ever wondered what
our classrooms

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.470
will look like 10, 20,
even 50 years from now?

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.480
Well, some innovative
thinkers are

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.400
unlocking new and powerful
ways to teach our kids,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.871
changing the way we look
at our education system

00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:28.495
in the process.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.225
The numbers alone
are staggering.

00:00:34.225 --> 00:00:36.350
JOSE FERREIRA: The thing
about the education system

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.320
is, it's a very
impersonal system.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.807
It's a factory model.

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:42.890
CRAIG MELVIN: One student
drops out of high school

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.820
every 26 seconds.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.160
Roughly 30% of kids
each year will not

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.930
graduate from high school.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.660
That's 1.3 million
in all, falling

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.050
through the cracks of
our education system.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.000
Worldwide, the numbers
grow exponentially.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.770
A whopping 80% of kids will
not get a high school diploma.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.170
Experts say each of those
kids is a lost opportunity.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.360
How many DaVincis and Einsteins
and Marie Curies and Michael

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.564
Jordans are we losing
every generation

00:01:10.564 --> 00:01:11.980
because we're just
not giving them

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.121
the opportunities
that some of us have.

00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:16.120
CRAIG MELVIN: But what
if that could be changed?

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.940
What if an internet
connection was the difference

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.080
in getting a world
class education.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.480
Today, education is having
that internet moment.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.725
And a chosen few are taking
some bold steps forward.

00:01:27.725 --> 00:01:29.600
JOSE FERREIRA: I'm Jose
Ferreira, the founder

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.470
and CEO of Newton.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.372
We're trying to revolutionize
education across the globe.

00:01:33.372 --> 00:01:35.580
CRAIG MELVIN: Newton is an
adaptive learning platform

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.810
that personalizes education
based on each kid's strengths

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:39.960
and weaknesses.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.450
In essence, students
go at their own pace

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.420
and the software continuously
adapts to their learning style.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.500
JOSE FERREIRA: If you learn
math best with medium difficulty

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.900
practice questions,
we know that.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.860
If you learn science best
in 24-minute bite sizes,

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:54.460
we know that.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.420
Everybody has a
learning experience

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.770
that is unique to them.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.900
CRAIG MELVIN: Ferreira
started the company in 2008,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.740
using his credit card.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.290
Since then, Newton has
grown by leaps and bounds.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.700
They currently reach almost
five million students,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.503
and that number is growing.

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:10.169
JOSE FERREIRA: We
want to end the access

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:11.400
problem for education.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.660
We want every kid, whether
you're in the inner city

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.330
or in the developing
world, we want

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.280
you to have the best possible
education you can get.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.850
SAL KHAN: My name
is Sal Khan and I'm

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.930
the founder of the Khan Academy.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.880
CRAIG MELVIN: In 2004, Sal
Kahn was tutoring his cousins

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.570
remotely from his
then home in Boston.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.610
The lessons started
over the phone,

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.390
until a friend
suggested he upload

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.790
educational videos to YouTube.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.700
SAL KHAN: And I
immediately said, no.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.430
Videos and YouTube, that's
for cats playing piano,

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.910
not serious mathematics.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.420
But I gave it a shot.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.210
And those videos took
on a life of their own.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.370
CRAIG MELVIN: Those videos
became the cornerstone

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.030
of Khan Academy,
a virtual library

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.450
of now more than 4,000
tutorials covering everything

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.850
from basic math to
college level chemistry.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.310
SAL KHAN: And our goal over
the next 5, 10, 50, 500 years

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.530
is to go from the six
million students that we're

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.721
serving every month now to 60
million, 600 million students.

00:03:06.721 --> 00:03:08.970
CRAIG MELVIN: One of those
students recently sent Khan

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.990
a video message from the
unlikeliest of places,

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.061
an orphanage in Mongolia.

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:15.811
STUDENT: Hey, Sal.

00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:21.930
Your lessons are so
interesting and funny.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.015
Make more lessons.

00:03:25.015 --> 00:03:26.640
SAL KHAN: That by
itself is pretty mind

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.340
blowing for us, this idea that
the work that we get to do

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.080
can reach people as far as
an orphanage in Mongolia.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.030
CRAIG MELVIN: Two companies
led by two visionaries, both

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.080
using the reach of
technology to reimagine

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.640
the future of education.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.700
And now Newton
recently partnered

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.840
with education publisher
Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.810
As a result, more
kids will have access

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.030
to their adaptive
learning platform.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.975
And we should note, Khan
Academy's mission statement,

00:03:51.975 --> 00:03:53.350
changing education
for the better

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.120
by providing a free, world
class education for anyone,

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.490
anywhere, that means all
of their tutorial videos

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.250
are free of charge.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.730
SAVANNAH GUTHRIE:
That is pretty cool.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:02.660
DAVID GREGORY: Great stuff.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.300
Great model.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.900
CRAIG MELVIN: Thank you.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.420
Good to see you.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.150
I'm looking forward to seeing
you dance in a few minutes,

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.650
too.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.300
DAVID GREGORY: Well,
you never know.
