00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.490
Ask any movie industry fan or studio executive,
and they’ll tell you the same thing: R-Rated

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.270
movies almost always make less money than
a PG blockbuster at the box office – and

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.560
if the movie you’re making CAN appeal to
fans of all ages, then it definitely SHOULD.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.470
At least, that’s what they used to say…
but Deadpool may have changed all that.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.730
The Merc with a Mouth’s road to reality
wasn’t easy, with the final rating one of

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.340
the most debated topics among fans.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.190
Would it play it safe at PG-13, and water
down the crudeness of the hero, or go for

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.070
the R, doing justice to the insane violence
and humor of the source material – but earning

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.850
less money?

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.449
Fox went with the latter, and boy did it pay
off.

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.030
Not only has Deadpool soared to become an
even faster money-maker than any Marvel solo

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.440
movie, but one of the most profitable R-Rated
movies of all time.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.210
And it hasn’t taken long for rumors of an
R-Rated revolution to start.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:09.390
From an R-Rated Wolverine movie to even an
R-Rated cut of Zack Snyder’s Batman V Superman,

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.560
fans are already worried that the success
of Deadpool is going to have some nasty side

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.560
effects.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.640
We’re breaking down the real reason Deadpool
succeeded, and why other studios should, and

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.619
shouldn’t take a lesson from the foul-mouthed
blockbuster in our latest docu video, How

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.600
R-Rated Superhero Movies Could Change The
Game.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.600
R-Rated Failures

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.340
First, a reality check: part of the reason
that Deadpool was such a surprise hit, is

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.680
because so many hardcore comic movies before
it were disappointments, or failures.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.640
The rise of comic book blockbusters in the
21st century may have implied that any comic

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.390
adaptation would be a hit, but studios soon
learned that stamping the words “based on

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.390
the graphic novel” on their movie wasn’t
enough.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.399
And as much as some might suggest today, over-the-top
violence and adult humor didn’t help, either.

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.149
Even movies with passionate fan bases, like
Marvel’s Punisher, or the ultra-violent

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.750
Dredd seemed to prove that cutting kids out
of the comic book equation sliced their profits

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:09.750
in half.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.120
And where The Punisher became a cult success,
but struggled among critics, even the critically

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.020
praised and stylish Dredd couldn’t break
out of its R-Rated shell.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.420
Deadpool is lonely among high-grossing R-Rated
features, so if studios think the facts have

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.740
changed, we’d bet they’re in for a rude
awakening, since Deadpool might be the exception

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.550
that proves the rule.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.190
What Actually Earns an R-Rating?

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.300
You’d think it would be common knowledge,
but the content that actually earns a movie

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.660
the R-Rating isn’t always clear.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.010
So fans might assume that Deadpool’s blood,
gore, violence, sex scenes, and mile-a-minute

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.620
adult humor is a good indicator.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.770
But even small moments and split-second shots
can make all the difference.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.290
For instance, Joss Whedon’s Avengers got
an initial R-Rating for the method and bloodiness

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.030
of Agent Phil Coulson’s death.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.230
A few cuts were made around it, and a wide
PG-13 release was in the bag.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.170
In other words: the difference between PG
and R CAN be a sizable one, but fans shouldn’t

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.380
assume the worst.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.450
In fact, the first trailer for DC’s Suicide
Squad seemed to guarantee an R-Rating.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.140
The fact that it was announced to be gentle
enough for PG-13 confirms that a movie’s

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.110
rating isn’t the whole story.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.700
What Does It Mean For The Movies?

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.820
In the short term, it’s hard to know just
how much interest there is in capitalizing

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.170
on the surprise success of Deadpool’s R-Rated
action and comedy.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.860
But fans probably don’t need to worry that
the integrity or plot of anticipated movies

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.510
will feel a difference – at this point,
a comic book adventure written and directed

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.100
for a mass audience isn’t guaranteed to
make MORE money by adding in any R-Rated content.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.260
That doesn’t mean studios aren’t eager
to capitalize on the R-Rated buzz, or the

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.750
assumption that an R-Rating might be just
as promising or “true to the character”

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:01.760
for its own story.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.670
In the wake of Deadpool, it was the third
Wolverine movie that gained attention, with

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.820
rumors that it could pursue the same rating.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.780
But that’s not the whole story.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.920
After all, the X-Man’s second solo movie
was filmed with an R-Rating in mind, too.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.750
The sequences, swearing and blood were all
filmed knowing that they might be cut for

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.860
a PG-13 rating – which they were – but
were added in for the Extended Cut home release.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.120
In other words, knowing that the next Wolverine
movie is aiming for R doesn’t say much,

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.610
since the last one did the same.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.430
But Deadpool’s success could convince Fox
that releasing the uncut, original version

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.460
of the movie wouldn’t cost them much.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.110
And the ticket sales they DID lose could be
offset by the added marketing, advertising

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:49.610
“Wolverine’s first R-Rated adventure,”
and the most faithful version fans have seen.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.699
But what stirred up even more controversy
was the idea that the Big Blue Boy Scout himself,

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:00.669
Superman, could be swallowed up by the R-Rated
fad, with Batman V Superman’s own home video

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:06.770
release earning an R. Again, things weren’t
as critics immediately assumed.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.360
Most elements of Superman’s origin in Man
of Steel went over kids’ heads, so in his

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.930
showdown with Batman, younger fans might see
two superheroes duking it out, but older viewers

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.560
would grasp the battle of politics, ideologies,
morality, and acceptable levels of violence

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.080
actually taking place.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.259
The marketing has promised the same themes
and ideas as any R-Rated film, not to mention

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:34.820
a brutal fistfight between the heroes, and
Bruce Wayne’s promise to make Superman bleed.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.039
Knowing that a bit of blood and gore earned
Marvel’s family-friendly Avengers an R-Rating,

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:43.240
it’s not crazy to think that Zack Snyder
crossed the same line.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.289
Possibly, more than once.

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:50.189
Theaters won’t see those scenes, but an
‘Unrated Cut’ like Wolverine’s seems

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:53.349
like a no-brainer (for older fans who are
actually intrigued).

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:57.379
Classifying the R-Rated cut in the wake of
Deadpool may be a clever marketing move on

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:03.699
DC’s part, and a win-win: allow a bigger
audience at the theater, and cash in on R-Rated

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:05.129
superhero fans months later.

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:09.000
But if Zack Snyder already had to cut the
scenes in question, like he did before releasing

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.210
the Unrated Cut of Watchmen, then an “R-Rated
Batman V Superman” was completed months

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.840
before Deadpool hit theaters.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.050
But that may be a sign that some old mistakes
are being repeated.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.930
More on that in a minute…

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.169
Repeating Past Mistakes

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:28.419
Sure, R-Rated heroes like Spawn, Deadpool
and The Punisher prove that some stories need

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:34.830
to be told to adults to be told right at all,
but the ugly truth is that those dark, brooding,

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.370
violent heroes came from a decade filled with
imitators.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.659
Alan Moore’s “Watchmen” and Frank Miller’s
“Dark Knight Returns” elevated the comic

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:48.270
book artform by going dark; and publishers
chased the success of dark, amoral, violent

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.610
stories overnight.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.710
The result was a mess of excessively grim,
adult, dark characters that almost killed

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:55.999
DC and Marvel.

00:06:55.999 --> 00:07:00.449
So even though there’s a chance, and a place
for dark, serious superhero movies to make

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:06.139
it big, movie studios chasing the same prize
that the publishers did could result in a

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:07.520
similar crisis.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.699
An R-Rated Batman V Superman cut may not be
copying anything but Zack Snyder and Warner

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:13.699
Bros.’ vision.

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:16.569
Which is a completely different conversation
to be had.

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:17.909
What Does The Future Hold?

00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:21.969
The good news is that instead of looking at
their superhero movies and asking how they

00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:28.219
can earn an R-Rating, studio executives may
give scripts and characters a second look,

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:31.759
when their adult content may have seemed like
a problem.

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:36.919
But if Deadpool can work by being a good story,
with ratings an afterthought, then why can’t

00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:37.919
Batman?

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:38.919
Or Lobo?

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:39.919
Or Moon Knight?

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:41.419
Or Carnage and Venom (Marvel characters)?

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:45.330
Hit movies won’t be any easier to make,
and studios will have to resist the mistakes

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.330
of the past.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:52.319
But after Deadpool, no comic book movie will
ever be written off because it will only appeal,

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:54.409
or be shown to adults.

00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:56.910
And that is good news for everyone involved.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:01.300
Those are our thoughts on the shocking success
of Deadpool’s big screen debut, and how

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.939
the movie industry could, and should, react.

00:08:04.939 --> 00:08:05.939
