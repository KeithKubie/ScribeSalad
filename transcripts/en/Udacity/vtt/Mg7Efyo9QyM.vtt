00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.150
Hi. I'm Brian Naughton. I'm Founding

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.370
Scientist at 23andMe. I'm from Dublin, Ireland.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.950
&gt;&gt; So after dropping the DNA sample in the mail,

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.460
we don't see anything until we get to our results.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.160
what happens to that sample once we drop it in

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.720
the mail? Where does it go? Where does it end up

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.090
&gt;&gt; So your sample actually gets shipped to our lab

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.520
in Los Angeles where it gets processed. there are four major

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.560
components to that, it starts with

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.270
DNA extraction, then amplification of the DNA,

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.020
then hybridization and finally, analysis of the data to make sure it's good.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.490
&gt;&gt; Okay, great. About how long does that

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.830
process take for, to do all those steps?

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.200
&gt;&gt; So if you take all of the steps and you

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.680
did end to end it would probably take three days or so.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.323
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:46.323 --> 00:00:50.680
&gt;&gt; a lot of the process is just waiting for the equipment to become

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.120
available because of volume.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.200
&gt;&gt; I see. What of all those sort of four processes,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.930
which of those is the most time intensive of all of them?

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.110
&gt;&gt; The most time intensive is the hybridization step, which happens

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.670
overnight, amplification also happens over night though. So there are two

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.570
major parts where we have to leave the DNA for a

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.730
while and come back to it, so it has time to

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.230
&gt;&gt; about what

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.890
what I mean, I'm curious what, what's the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.580
most expensive part of the of the process?

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.600
&gt;&gt; So the, the chip and the reagents are really the expensive part of

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.420
the process. When you buy the chip you also get the reagents those are

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.660
like the chemicals that you need to run the chip. the other expensive components

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.020
are probably labor, obviously because we actually

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.460
need to hire what's called high complexity

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.068
staff to run our process.

00:01:43.068 --> 00:01:43.740
[UNKNOWN]

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.840
staff and then the, the rest is actually fairly inexpensive.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.710
&gt;&gt; What are the are there

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.665
any international restrictions? Like obviously I'm guessing

00:01:54.665 --> 00:01:57.580
if the lab time only takes you, like you said, three days, but

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.320
you know longer if you're processing multiple samples you know does it take

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.990
a lot longer for any international people who want to have this service done?

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.980
&gt;&gt; So the lab process doesn't take

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.000
longer obviously the shipping is an issue and

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.730
shipping can be expensive if you're coming

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.040
from Asia to California. that's part of

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.940
the reason why we want to add another lab actually it's to help with that.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:18.450
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.230
&gt;&gt; There are also issues with exporting DNA from certain

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.800
countries so China and India specifically have laws around what DNA

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.790
you are allowed to export out of that country. So

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.370
that, that plus other regulations regarding biological specimens mean that it's

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.130
actually quite difficult to add another country to our list of countries.
