00:00:04.567 --> 00:00:06.801
Narrator: WE'RE IN A SUPERMARKET
IN HAARLEM, NETHERLANDS...

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:08.667
THIS WAS A CRACKING IDEA.

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:11.234
Narrator: ...WHERE HOME
EGG-SPERIMENTER OLWEN WILLS

00:00:11.234 --> 00:00:12.734
IS HATCHING A PLAN.

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:14.267
Ruben: THE ASTONISHING THING
ABOUT THIS CLIP

00:00:14.267 --> 00:00:16.667
IS NOT THAT A QUAIL
HATCHED OUT OF AN EGG.

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:19.901
IT'S THAT A QUAIL HATCHED OUT
OF A SUPERMARKET EGG.

00:00:19.901 --> 00:00:21.834
THAT DOES NOT USUALLY HAPPEN.

00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:24.634
Narrator: MEET ALBERT,
THE HOME-GROWN QUAIL CHICK.

00:00:24.634 --> 00:00:26.000
I WANT ONE.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.334
Narrator: BUT IF SUPERMARKET
EGGS DON'T NORMALLY HATCH,

00:00:28.334 --> 00:00:30.567
HOW DID ALBERT BEAT THE ODDS?

00:00:30.567 --> 00:00:33.200
WHEN OLWEN GOT THE EGGS HOME,
HE PUT THEM IN AN INCUBATOR

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.534
AT 37 DEGREES CELSIUS,
OR 99 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

00:00:36.534 --> 00:00:37.601
THE TEMPERATURE IS IMPORTANT.

00:00:37.601 --> 00:00:39.334
TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW

00:00:39.334 --> 00:00:42.701
AND THE EMBRYO INSIDE THE EGG
WILL DEVELOP ABNORMALLY.

00:00:42.701 --> 00:00:45.701
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO TURN
THE EGGS OVER REGULARLY

00:00:45.701 --> 00:00:47.701
TO KEEP THE EMBRYO
FROM STICKING TO THE SHELL.

00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:49.801
SO OLWEN DID THIS
WITH HIS 12 EGGS

00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:52.501
AND 19 DAYS LATER,
ONE OF THEM HATCHED

00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:54.801
AND OUT CAME
A JAPANESE QUAIL NAMED ALBERT.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.868
Narrator: BUT WHY DID
ONLY ONE EGG HATCH?

00:00:57.868 --> 00:01:00.601
FOR AN EGG TO HATCH, A ROOSTER
HAS TO MATE WITH A HEN

00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:03.534
PRIOR TO THE EGG BEING LAID
SO THE EGG CAN BE FERTILIZED.

00:01:03.534 --> 00:01:05.901
NOW IN MOST COMMERCIAL
EGG-LAYING OPERATIONS,

00:01:05.901 --> 00:01:07.400
THEY KEEP THE HENS AND ROOSTERS

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.868
COMPLETELY SEPARATE
TO AVOID FERTILIZATION.

00:01:09.868 --> 00:01:12.000
THERE ARE A COUPLE
OF POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.234
FOR WHY ALBERT WAS ABLE
TO DEFY THE ODDS.

00:01:15.234 --> 00:01:19.234
FIRST, A ROGUE MALE COULD HAVE
EITHER BEEN MISIDENTIFIED

00:01:19.234 --> 00:01:21.767
OR PERHAPS SNUCK INTO
WHERE SOME FEMALES WERE.

00:01:21.767 --> 00:01:26.200
ADDITIONALLY SOME FREE-RANGE
FARMS MAY KEEP ONE OR TWO MALES.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.901
AND IT'S FOUND THAT THIS CHANGES
SOCIAL STRUCTURE,

00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:30.133
REDUCES AGGRESSION,

00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:32.133
AND ACTUALLY KEEPS
THE FEMALES FEELING SAFE.

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:33.634
SO INEVITABLY, SOME OF THEM

00:01:33.634 --> 00:01:36.567
WILL BE CARRYING
FERTILIZED EGGS.

00:01:36.567 --> 00:01:39.167
YOUR SUPERMARKET EGGS ARE NOT
GONNA HATCH ON THEIR OWN.

00:01:39.167 --> 00:01:41.467
AND THEY ARE
PERFECTLY SAFE TO EAT.

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:42.834
Narrator:
AND HERE'S ALBERT NOW,

00:01:42.834 --> 00:01:45.801
ALL GROWN UP AND HAVING
A QUAIL OF A TIME.
