[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.260
RUCHI BEZOLES: Good
morning, everybody.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.060
I'm Ruchi, and this is Ben.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.540
And we are from the
Google Photos team.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.280
BEN GREENWOOD: We
built Google Photos

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.900
to help people
solve the problems

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.270
they were having
storing, organizing,

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.680
and sharing their memories.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.490
And now, three years in,
we're delighted that hundreds

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.410
of millions of people
around the world

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.369
call the product home for
their photos and videos.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.100
Here at I/O, we're
announcing a new way for you,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.130
as developers, to be
able to use this platform

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.340
to build photo and video
experiences that are smarter,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.345
faster, and easier to use.

00:00:44.345 --> 00:00:45.720
In the session
today, we're going

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.390
to dive into some of
those new technologies

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.630
and show how you can use them to
bring the best of Google Photos

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.360
into your own apps.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.220
Now, we designed
Google Photos and we

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.600
built the app for the way people
use photos and videos today.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.970
This means users get
unlimited storage,

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.830
so, yes, we can
do the inevitable

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.790
and take 15 photos to
capture the perfect sunset,

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.470
or automatic backup, so we
never lose our memories,

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.130
even as we change
devices over time.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.810
And of course, we've
built the product

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.330
with machine
learning at its core.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.040
And you heard Sundar
speak yesterday

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.260
in the keynote about
the ways in which we're

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.650
applying AI to help
people organize and bring

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.619
their memories to life.

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.910
And one of my favorites that
the team's been working on

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.730
is what we call Color Pop.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.280
What this means is the
Google Photos Assistant

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.377
can help you automatically
create images like this.

00:01:44.377 --> 00:01:45.960
And you can see how
this effect really

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.220
elevates the subject in vivid
color, fading the background.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.190
And if you look closely,
the AI has even identified

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.530
and segmented the flower
that this little girl

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.850
has in her hair.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.070
It's pretty neat.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.320
Now, these are just
a few examples.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.690
But of course, we all
use our photos and videos

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.010
in different ways.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.310
When we look across the
apps and devices that

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.410
are important to
people, we see a lot

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.550
of workflows that are difficult
and tedious, like if you've

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.220
ever tried to set up
a digital photo frame

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.890
and you're moving
files between devices.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.920
It's a real chore just
to keep up to date.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.440
Or how after you go
on a holiday trip,

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.210
your family memories
are handed to you

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.360
on a USB drive or even a DVD.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.630
Like, what do I
even do with that?

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.810
And we're all constantly
downloading and re-uploading

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.850
content between services.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.100
Maybe you're posting about
your latest adventures,

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.110
and you have some
awesome drone footage

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.790
that you want to include.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.310
But it's in 4K, and
you have to download

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.170
and re-upload over mobile data.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.580
And so we think it should
be much easier for people

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.160
to seamlessly use
their photos and videos

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.070
across all the apps and devices
that are important to them.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.220
But to solve these problems,
we can't do it alone.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.850
And that's why, today, we're
announcing the Google Photos

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.640
partner program and
giving you, as developers,

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.640
the tools and the
APIs you need to build

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.510
amazing photo and video
experiences for your users.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.350
Now, as a developer, we know you
want to make your apps engaging

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.760
and user friendly.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.040
And look, photos are a
great way to do that.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.830
But often, this involves
complex infrastructure

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.130
for serving and having
to pay for storage just

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.890
to duplicate the
user's own content.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.110
So we think that
should be easier, too.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.420
And so at the core of
the partner program

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.590
is what we call the
Google Photos Library API.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.160
This makes available some of
our best technology to you

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.820
to be able to bring the
best of Google Photos and AI

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.550
to help solve real
problems for your users.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.630
And here's Ruchi
to tell you more.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.210
RUCHI BEZOLES: Thank you, Ben.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.434
All right.

00:03:56.434 --> 00:03:57.850
Now, I'm going to
show you how you

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.030
can use the API to build
more engaging experiences

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.830
for your users.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.450
There are three
main functionalities

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.490
that the API enables.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.070
The first is that it
will allow your users

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.880
to access their library of
photos in your products.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.029
The second is that you will
be able to upload photos

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:19.779
to a user's Google
Photos library.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.880
And third, it will
provide the infrastructure

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.870
you need to enable sharing
of photos within your apps.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.700
It goes without
saying, but all of this

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.030
requires explicit user consent.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.220
So let's hone in on connect.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.115
One of the main things we wanted
to solve when building this API

00:04:36.115 --> 00:04:38.770
is to make it incredibly
simple for users

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.460
to access and experience their
photos in their favorite apps

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.090
and devices, many
of which you build.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.670
This could be in Timehop,
where once you've

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.030
integrated your library and
given permission to use it,

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.120
you'll get more personalized and
creative reminders of memories

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.430
to look back on,
or on HP Sprocket.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.330
It's a really cute,
portable printer

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.840
that will let you print
photos from your own library

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.260
as stickers on the go.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.070
While this functionality
is fantastic,

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.730
to provide your users access to
their library in your products,

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.510
we also want to help developers
surface the right photos

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.080
a user might need in context.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.940
And you can do this thanks
to the filters functionality.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.290
There are four ways you can
filter a library of photos.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.290
The first is content
categories, and that's

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.460
categories of photos
that a user has,

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.630
whether it's pet photos,
selfies, landscape photos,

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.180
landmark photos, so on.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.940
Then there's the date of
when the photos were created,

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.370
so the time period
of photos and videos.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.530
And then there's the date--

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.154
then there's the
media type, excuse me.

00:05:47.154 --> 00:05:49.760
So that's whether it's a photo
or a video or something else.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.840
You can pull those out, too.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.930
And finally, a
personal album a user

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.070
already has created
in their account.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.010
OK.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.970
Time for a question.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.290
How many of you here have
ever had to do expenses?

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.000
Raise your hands.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.529
OK, full room.

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:08.070
Keep them up.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.210
Keep them up.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.530
How many of you would say that
you have loved doing expenses?

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:14.230
OK, sad state.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.730
Yeah.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.470
Nobody really likes
doing expenses.

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.240
Neither do I.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.210
But Xero, an app that
helps us do expenses,

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.600
is now integrating
with the Library API.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.120
So what this means is they
can apply these filters

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.410
I referenced earlier, and
they can pull receipt images

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.070
in a certain time range and
surface them as suggestions

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.440
of expenses I should do.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.350
So completing expenses
is as simple as viewing

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.630
the suggestion and
hitting Tab to submit.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:45.880
BEN GREENWOOD: Pretty amazing.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.640
Thanks, Ruchi.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.750
RUCHI BEZOLES: Yeah.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.670
BEN GREENWOOD: So using
these smart filters

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.140
is a really powerful
way that you

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.760
can make it easier
for your users

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.180
to find just the content
they're looking for.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.500
And I'm going to show
you a few code examples.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.310
And as the library
API is a RESTful API,

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.370
you can play along whether you
are a mobile, back end, or web

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.070
developer.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.560
The first category--
or the first filter,

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.750
excuse me, that we
were most excited about

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.310
are content categories.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.950
And as Ruchi mentioned, these
use Google's computer vision

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.140
to figure out what
an image is about

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:23.280
so you can filter and narrow
down results in your app.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.130
The API offers many
categories to choose from.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.480
And as you can see
from this example,

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.020
I can also exclude
categories that might not

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.630
make sense for my use case.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.730
For example, an
app like Timehop,

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:39.310
which is there to really remind
me of my fondest memories,

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.990
may not want to include pictures
of old bills and receipts

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.420
and other documents
from years ago.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.950
And filters are
a great way to be

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:50.770
able to exclude this content.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:55.170
Another way that users explore
their content is based on time.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:58.110
And sometimes, you'll want to
present photos chronologically

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.270
so you can scroll back in time.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:01.860
But there are other
use cases where

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.050
being able to just jump
to the right moment

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:08.800
can make it much easier for your
users to find their content.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.390
As you can see, you can filter
by specific dates or date

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:16.140
ranges, and you can also
combine filters together

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.730
to be even more expressive.

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:22.680
Say I wanted to find all of my
birthday photos from years past

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.900
and put them together
in a collage.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.930
I could sit there and scroll
through decades of photos

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:30.420
to try and find
just the right pics,

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:34.020
or I could combine a
date and content category

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.169
filter like this.

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:40.419
You can see how we've
emitted the year here

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:42.240
and left it as a
wildcard so it'll

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:47.580
match any days on my birthday
and included a content category

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.580
filter to find those
great selfies and birthday

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.310
celebration moments.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:55.080
It's pretty neat.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.380
Of course, you can also
filter by other kinds

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.390
of media types,
so photos, videos,

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.410
or other kinds of
content, like VR.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.380
And you can select photos
that are already in an album

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.610
that a user has curated
for some purpose.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:14.160
But regardless of
the filters you use,

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.890
you'll get back a list of what
we refer to as media items.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.850
And here's what one looks like.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.240
Google Photos supports a wide
variety of media formats,

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.450
from the obvious photos
and videos to animations

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:31.960
and even complex VR
and 360 degree images.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.740
So for each media item, you'll
get back this consistent JSON

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.170
object.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.960
And there are a couple of
interesting attributes here.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.750
The first is the
base URL, and this

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.330
is what your application
uses to access

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:49.650
the image bytes themselves so
you can show them in your app.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:53.340
A subtle but really
powerful feature of this URL

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.700
is that it has
built-in resizing.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.630
So with a simple
parameter, you can

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.140
ask Google Photos to return an
image that fits the dimensions

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.930
or aspect ratio for
your device, saving you

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:06.700
a lot of boilerplate code.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.850
It also makes it really
easy to reduce data

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.680
transfer for users on mobile.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.080
The second URL here
is a product URL.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.130
And what this is is a deep
link back into Google Photos.

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:21.690
This can be really
helpful if you

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:25.110
want to provide a complete
and comprehensive UX

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:29.640
with common tasks like cropping,
rotating, and even viewing

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.520
complicated formats, such as VR.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.800
You can just link
out to Google Photos

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.770
rather than rebuilding all
of that code in your own app.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.000
And then, of course,
there's other metadata,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.450
depending on the media
format you're dealing with.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.400
And what's powerful
about this is

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.640
Google Photos will extract
this from a variety of media

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.180
formats, so you don't have to go
through and parse it yourself.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:00.880
You'll have it returned in
this consistent JSON object.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.110
And so with all of
this data together,

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:05.890
you're able to build and
include the user's content

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.880
inside of your user experience
and make it seamless and fast

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.540
for them to bring photos and
videos into your application,

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.581
just like the examples
we showed earlier.

00:11:16.581 --> 00:11:17.830
RUCHI BEZOLES: Thank you, Ben.

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:23.030
All right.

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:26.090
So Ben talked about how users
can access their library

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.250
of photos in your products.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.550
Now, what about when you need
to send users their photos?

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:34.820
The upload functionality
can help you do this.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.980
So with the Library
API, developers

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.920
will be able to send
full-resolution photos

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.850
and videos to a user by adding
a directory into their Google

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.840
Photos account.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.110
Let me walk you through
how this would work.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:51.020
So this is actually
one of my photo albums

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:54.320
that I have at home, but
accessing all my albums

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.600
can be extremely
difficult. They're

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.180
buried in dusty
cupboards in my house,

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.090
or they are thousands of miles
away at my parent's home.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:03.860
They live in
Germany, so it's not

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.530
going to be very frequent
when I get to see them.

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.410
But I decided to get this fixed.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:13.040
I gathered my albums and
sent them to Legacy Republic.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.970
They specialize in digitizing
physical albums and old media

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.070
formats, like VHS tapes.

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:21.950
I hope people have heard
about VHS tapes in the room.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.540
OK.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:27.320
So once they had digitized
it and it was ready,

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.680
Legacy Republic was able
to use the Library API,

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.880
create an album, and upload
more than 600 photos they just

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.990
digitized into my
account almost instantly.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:40.800
That means at the
end of the day,

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.550
I had access to all of
my childhood memories

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:46.520
and some embarrassing photos
that I won't pull up here.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.560
But they were all in
the palm of my hands,

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.530
right in the Google Photos app.

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:54.360
One thing my physical
albums do have,

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.090
and this is a scrapbook that
I had from when I was younger,

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:59.760
is a rich amount of information.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.400
They don't just hold photos,
but they tell stories, at least

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.660
for me.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.960
I scribbled little descriptions
of things I would think of,

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.790
the places where the
photos were taken,

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:10.920
or when they were captured.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.800
With the Library
API, Legacy Republic

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.900
was able to take
this information

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:19.150
and bring it into a digital
album in Google Photos.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:24.390
So a scrapbook like what
you saw turned into this.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:28.320
So having hundreds of photos
in one place is really great,

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.230
but we also want to help users
find that exact photo they're

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:33.630
talking about in a story.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.630
And thanks to the machine
intelligence in Google Photos,

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.402
we can do that, too.

00:13:38.402 --> 00:13:40.110
So let's say I want
to show you my photos

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:41.730
from the last few weeks.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.220
I'll just type in "me"
in the search bar,

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.151
and I'll get photos of me.

00:13:46.151 --> 00:13:47.400
You don't look that impressed.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.770
I guess, yes, those photos
are in the top of my grid,

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:52.567
so doesn't seem as hard.

00:13:52.567 --> 00:13:54.900
But let's say I wanted to
tell you I was a little chubby

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.550
toddler when I was a baby.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.050
I won't tell you
how many years ago,

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:01.770
but the next example will
tell it to you anyway.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:06.630
I could type in "me in 1990"
and, in less than a second,

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.754
get photos of me as a baby.

00:14:08.754 --> 00:14:10.170
So I think, Ben,
it's time for you

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:12.310
to show some of your
embarrassing photos.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.310
BEN GREENWOOD: I don't
think anyone wants to see

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.371
those, Ruchi.

00:14:16.371 --> 00:14:17.970
Now, I'm going to
show you how we

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:21.240
can create our own rich
albums using the API.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.360
But before we do
that, a quick poll.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.970
How many of you out
there have a friend

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:28.890
who's an outdoors person?

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:30.120
Go ahead and raise your hand.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.667
You know, the type to go
camping and running and hiking.

00:14:33.667 --> 00:14:36.000
And you'll know they're an
outdoors person, because they

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.205
will absolutely tell you about
it at every waking moment.

00:14:40.205 --> 00:14:42.330
You'll come back into the
office on Monday morning,

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.820
and they'll regale
to you the epic miles

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:49.039
they covered and cliffs
and snakes and bears

00:14:49.039 --> 00:14:51.580
that they had to fight with just
to get in for Monday morning

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.610
standups.

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:54.810
I have a confession to make.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:59.500
In my team, that guy is me.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.230
And so to prove this
to my colleagues,

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:03.840
a few months ago,
I went for a hike

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.170
in central Outback Australia.

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:09.690
It was a pretty memorable
trip, so I built a little app

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:13.350
to track my progress and take
a few notes along the way.

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:18.300
And now, we're going to try and
save it all in Google Photos.

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:19.970
So the first thing
we'll do with the API

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:22.560
is go ahead and create an album.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.840
Simply send a POST request--

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:29.550
excuse me-- and you can
specify the title of the album.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:31.080
And in the response,
you'll get back

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.990
an ID, which we'll
use in just a second,

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:36.270
and a product URL,
which is, again,

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:40.740
a deep link so you can show
the content in Google Photos.

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.420
As you can see, the
album's empty for now.

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:44.170
So let's fix that.

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:49.740
Second step is to
upload the actual image

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.990
bytes to Google servers.

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:55.200
Because we support a wide
variety of media formats,

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.870
you typically won't need
to worry about transcoding

00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:59.250
between formats.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:02.130
You just upload the bytes, and
the service will give you back

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:04.680
an upload token.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:08.490
And we'll use it here in
the Create Media Item call,

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:10.950
as you can see.

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:14.677
We'll also fill in the album
ID that we just created.

00:16:14.677 --> 00:16:17.010
And at this point, you're
probably thinking, OK, thanks,

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:17.610
Ben.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:19.820
We've talked a lot,
done a lot of plumbing,

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.030
moved some IDs around.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.580
How about you show me
something interesting?

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:26.670
Well, a big benefit of Google
Photos is being able to search

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:28.980
by what you remember.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.110
Some of this happens
automatically, thanks to AI.

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:34.140
So I could search
for the Eiffel Tower

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.020
and find pictures I've
taken of the Eiffel Tower.

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:41.820
But there are some things that
only you or your app knows.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.340
In this case, I'm taking
a photo of an area

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:47.250
my friends told me to go and
look at called "the pound."

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:48.210
And it's colloquial.

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:51.450
It's not on the maps,
so only I remember it.

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:53.490
But I can put it
in the description

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.500
with a few extra
details, and you'll

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.680
see that this, then, becomes
searchable in Google Photos.

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.900
And all that context is
stored right with the image,

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.839
so I can see it again
in years to come.

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:07.020
This is a great tool you
can use in your apps.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.790
Maybe you're building
a game, and you

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:11.520
want players to be able to
save their favorite moments

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:15.150
and include the player's
name or the level

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:17.270
that their character was at.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:20.229
Or maybe you're just delivering
marathon finish line photos

00:17:20.229 --> 00:17:22.770
and want to be able to remind
the user of the great time they

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:24.510
got.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:26.339
But let's be honest,
individual photos

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:28.920
aren't all that
interesting on their own.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:33.984
So through the power of this
clicker, we'll add a few more.

00:17:33.984 --> 00:17:35.400
Now, we mentioned
earlier that you

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.800
can create rich
albums that contain

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:41.820
text headings, locations, maps,
and even control the album

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:42.762
layout.

00:17:42.762 --> 00:17:44.220
And in Google
Photos, we call these

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:47.820
features album enrichments.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.490
Because there's not a whole
lot else to do in the desert,

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:53.190
each day I took a few
notes about the track.

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.020
And now, using
album enrichments,

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:59.820
I can group together my photos
to tell a meaningful story.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.600
To do this, we'll go ahead
and call Add Enrichment

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:08.340
and create a text enrichment.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:11.390
And finally, specifying the
position for the enrichment

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:14.780
to be displayed in the album,
maybe after the last photo

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:15.570
I took each day.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:21.460
And as you can see, this
creates headings and dividers,

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:25.080
and our album's really
starting to come together now.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:29.000
There are other kinds of
enrichments you can add, too.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.410
I could add individual
locations or even

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.020
maps that describe the journey.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.990
And this can be useful for
all sorts of applications.

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:38.850
Maybe you're an
amusement park, and you

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:41.220
want to be able to deliver
photos from the rides

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:44.330
that someone's just
taken in the park.

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.020
Or maybe you're just
trying to document

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.410
the progress of a project,
like building your first home

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:52.110
or seeing your child's
art project progress

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.660
throughout the school term.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.360
But for my hiking app,
the finished product

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.200
looks a little bit like this.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.490
You can see it's nicely laid
out with all the context safely

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:05.310
stored in my Google
Photos library.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.320
And hey, now I can
easily share it

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.271
with all of my friends and
colleagues back in the office.

00:19:10.271 --> 00:19:12.270
RUCHI BEZOLES: Yeah, I
think we've seen too many

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:13.680
of Ben's hiking photos.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.170
But Ben did cue up
the perfect segue

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:18.390
to talk about the
sharing capabilities

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:21.350
that the Library API offers.

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:24.370
Did any of you go to the
I/O block party last night?

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.890
So you may recall--
yes, I see some of you.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:29.880
You may recall seeing
this arcade photo booth.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.290
Now, the photo booth
was really fun.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:34.470
But what Ben and I
were most excited about

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:38.010
was that it was integrated
with our Library API.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.140
So what this meant is you
didn't have to fight over

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:42.510
who gets that one physical
copy of that token

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:44.320
from your photo booth.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.150
Instead, an attendee would
get a one-time shared album

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:49.890
where they can gather
all their photos

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:52.530
and videos that have
just been captured right

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:54.900
on the device they're using.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.820
And something to
note is the attendee

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:00.390
doesn't have to have the photo
booth app or Google Photos

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:02.730
to get this link.

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:04.890
You can also bring the
sharing functionality

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:07.590
and make it work inside
of your mobile apps.

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.610
So let's take a look.

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:12.030
Here's an app for a soccer club.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:15.480
Players are discussing where
to meet up, sharing scores

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.920
from the latest games.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.910
But to share photos today,
they have to close this app,

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.280
open another app,
and then invite

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.830
the same group to share photos.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:28.350
This doesn't seem
that efficient.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:31.200
And so with the Library
API, these players

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.270
will be able to
upload photos as they

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:36.870
happen in the same conversation,
so everything can finally

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:39.250
happen in your app.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:42.560
Let's take a look at this code.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.310
With shared albums,
you'll have the option

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:48.390
to turn on or off comments or
allow users to collaborate,

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:51.900
so add their own
photos into the album.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:54.450
In the response, they'll
get a sharable URL.

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:57.330
These are deep links that
open to Google Photos

00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:58.715
and work across any platform.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.112
And you get back a share token.

00:21:03.112 --> 00:21:04.570
This is what you
will use to invite

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:07.170
people to join the shared
album from within your app.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:10.060
It's what I showed you
in the soccer example.

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:14.110
Now, you need to show your
album in your app, right?

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:16.480
And to do this, you
send a GET request.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.370
And you'll get back a
list of shared albums

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:21.020
that a user has joined.

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:22.660
So I'll pause on this screen.

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.960
The list you also get will
show attributes, like the title

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:31.980
and cover photo, which you will
be able to build into your UI.

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:36.580
This sharing
functionality really

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.620
comes together in
this final use case

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.640
I'd like to walk you through.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.930
But first, let me tell
you a little story.

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.960
A few years ago, I decided
to gift my grandfather

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.760
a digital photo frame.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.300
I felt like a really good
granddaughter, and he loved it.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:56.500
Grabbed a USB drive, put in
10 photos, and there it was.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.980
But years later, as many
of you have experienced,

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:04.630
my poor grandpa is watching
the same 10 photos on rotation

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:08.150
over and over and over again.

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:11.290
Now, Nixplay, they create
beautiful digital photo frames,

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:13.860
and they're integrating
with the Library API

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:16.660
to hopefully help
me fix this issue.

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:20.260
Let me show you how it would
work in this context now.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.690
To get started, we would
create a shared album

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:23.961
in the Nixplay app.

00:22:23.961 --> 00:22:25.960
And they can do this,
because they're integrated

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.180
with the Library API.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.890
You can also pick
an existing album

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:32.890
you have in Google Photos, but
let's go through a new album

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:35.650
creation flow.

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:38.050
So you can invite people,
your friends and family,

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:41.500
to collaborate in this album.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:42.970
And then you can
select that album

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:46.720
to be the main one you want
displayed on the frame.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.480
After that, it's simple.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:52.600
As friends and family
add photos to that album,

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.210
they'll automatically be
displayed on the Nixplay frame

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:57.220
you have in your home.

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.500
So I did put this
to the test, and I

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.650
connected my grandfather's
Nixplay app to my shared album

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:05.444
that I already had with him.

00:23:05.444 --> 00:23:07.360
I put photos in there
when I'm thinking of him

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.280
or missing him as
I travel the world

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.070
or just sitting at
home in San Francisco.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:16.480
So once we connected it up,
as I decided to share photos

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.450
with my grandfather,
he has a front row seat

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:22.510
to these moments in his
home all the way in Delhi

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:24.590
without having to
do any extra work.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.840
BEN GREENWOOD: Thanks, Ruchi.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.980
So we've shown you
today three great ways

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:36.400
that you can use the Library
API to bring the magic of Google

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.650
Photos into your apps.

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:41.800
We showed how you can create
seamless connections that

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.620
allow users to bring their
content into your product

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:47.860
and service and use smart
filters to help them find

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.500
just what they're looking for.

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.710
We've talked about how you can
use the upload functionality

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:57.130
to create more mobile-friendly
ways of delivering content

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:58.970
to your users.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.670
And finally, we
talked about how you

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:04.450
can build deep, engaging
sharing experiences right

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:07.300
into your apps.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.520
We've also aimed to
take a lot of the hassle

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.520
out of building a
seamless UX with features

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.910
like automatic
thumbnailing and deep links

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:19.620
that allow you to focus on
what makes your app unique.

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:25.030
And all the APIs services
we've talked about today

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:28.000
are available right now in
Developer Preview, which

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.580
means you can activate the API
and start building right away.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:36.700
You can head over to
developers.google.com/photos,

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.890
which has full documentation.

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:43.100
And we have samples on GitHub
to help you get started.

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:46.390
Now, we've been working with
some amazing early partners,

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:50.480
and the demos we've shown are
a preview of things to come.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.240
But if you're inspired
by what you've seen,

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.940
you can also find a
link on our website

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.190
to express interest
in joining the partner

00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:00.790
program for your own product.

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:03.100
Now, I do want to
point out that we

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.620
care very deeply
about the experience

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:07.720
that Google Photos users have.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.060
And that's why every
company we work with

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:13.720
is expected to meet certain
app quality guidelines,

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.000
and we also have strict
privacy provisions

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.710
that govern how you can use the
data that users agree to share.

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:23.290
We take those rules
very seriously.

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:25.360
And so as your
app grows, you can

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.490
expect a few chickens
from time to time

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:28.750
with the Google Photos team.

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:34.940
Finally, we really value your
suggestions as developers.

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.610
And so as you start
to explore the API,

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:39.890
please get in touch through
our developer channels

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:41.940
and give us your feedback.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:45.260
You can also come along to the
Photos Office Hours here at I/O

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:50.220
and meet with the team directly
to talk about your app.

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.160
But that's it for
this morning session.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.410
We're really excited
about the road ahead

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:55.910
and look forward
to working with you

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:59.090
to develop great products
that work with Google Photos.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.679
We've been Ben and Ruchi.

00:26:00.679 --> 00:26:02.220
You've all been a
wonderful audience.

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:02.850
Thanks very much.

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:03.589
Have a great I/O.

00:26:03.589 --> 00:26:04.089
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:04.089 --> 00:26:08.692
[MUSIC PLAYING]
