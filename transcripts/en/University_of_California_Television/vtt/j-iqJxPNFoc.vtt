00:00:00.513 --> 00:00:03.096
(techno sound)

00:00:05.684 --> 00:00:08.184
(piano music)

00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:12.512
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:15.012
Bipedal, naked, large brained.

00:00:17.652 --> 00:00:21.756
Long the master of fire,
tools and language,

00:00:21.756 --> 00:00:26.000
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.167
Aware that death is inevitable,
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:34.994
We grow up slowly, we hand down

00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:37.994
knowledge, we empathize and deceive.

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:42.137
We shape the future from our

00:00:42.137 --> 00:00:44.887
shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.497 --> 00:00:50.151
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:54.318
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.377 --> 00:00:57.785
An exploration made possible by

00:00:57.785 --> 00:01:00.618
the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:20.804 --> 00:01:23.387
(techno music)

00:01:35.051 --> 00:01:37.271
- It is a pleasure and an honor to be here

00:01:37.271 --> 00:01:39.665
and to have the opportunity
to talk with you

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:42.915
about our work integrating genes, brain

00:01:45.904 --> 00:01:48.792
and behavior in a truly extraordinary

00:01:48.792 --> 00:01:52.209
human condition called Williams Syndrome.

00:01:53.426 --> 00:01:56.335
An important point of
departure for this talk

00:01:56.335 --> 00:02:00.252
is that fact that brain
function or dysfunction

00:02:01.575 --> 00:02:05.621
can be observed at multiple
levels of neuronal organization.

00:02:05.621 --> 00:02:09.293
The most basic of course
is gene expression,

00:02:09.293 --> 00:02:13.535
which works through cellular
and brain circuitry mechanisms

00:02:13.535 --> 00:02:16.629
to produce the complex emergent phenomena

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.772
that make us who and what we are,

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:22.580
conferring complex behaviors, and,

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.163
in some cases,
susceptibility to disorders.

00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:30.184
There's been a tremendous impetus to,

00:02:31.093 --> 00:02:33.557
in our research portfolios, to understand

00:02:33.557 --> 00:02:37.724
the genetic determinants
of this cascade of events.

00:02:38.948 --> 00:02:42.356
And it's really easy to
understand why this is the case,

00:02:42.356 --> 00:02:45.143
because genes are entry
points to molecular pathways

00:02:45.143 --> 00:02:49.103
that can lead us to new
treatments, to early detection

00:02:49.103 --> 00:02:52.452
and possibly to prevention of diseases,

00:02:52.452 --> 00:02:54.654
and to teach us about our variability

00:02:54.654 --> 00:02:57.910
and what makes us who and what we are.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.318
And I'm going to be telling
you about Williams Syndrome,

00:03:00.318 --> 00:03:04.531
which is a truly extraordinary
model of phenotype

00:03:04.531 --> 00:03:07.581
genotype relationships and it allows us

00:03:07.581 --> 00:03:11.318
to make inferences across
these multiple levels

00:03:11.318 --> 00:03:16.239
of neuronal organization and
sometimes disorganization.

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.364
So let me tell you first about

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:20.197
the genetics of Williams Syndrome.

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.186
This is a rare disorder,
it exists in somewhere

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:31.396
between one in 7,500 and
one in 20,000 live births,

00:03:33.212 --> 00:03:36.060
depending on whose
statistics one believes.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.399
And it is caused by the
removal, the hemideletion

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:43.302
of one copy of a number of
genes, about 25 of them,

00:03:43.302 --> 00:03:46.829
on chromosome seven in this locale,

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.654
this is about 1.6 megabases
of genetic material.

00:03:51.654 --> 00:03:55.613
And this is a very
active part of our genome

00:03:55.613 --> 00:03:59.217
and the reason is that this segment of DNA

00:03:59.217 --> 00:04:02.612
is flanked on both sides
for everyone in this room

00:04:02.612 --> 00:04:05.112
by low copy repeat sequences.

00:04:06.245 --> 00:04:07.301
This means that there are similar

00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:09.634
DNA sequences here and here.

00:04:11.798 --> 00:04:13.660
It's thought that these
are of recent origin

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.827
and rapid evolution that play
a role in hominid speciation.

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:23.981
And this causes mistakes
during recombination,

00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:26.534
these two ends can get mixed up.

00:04:26.534 --> 00:04:30.404
And this leads to either
the removal of one copy,

00:04:30.404 --> 00:04:34.113
which is what causes Williams Syndrome,

00:04:34.113 --> 00:04:39.004
or Duplication, which
causes three copies of genes

00:04:39.004 --> 00:04:41.747
to be present in this region,
and at the end of my talk

00:04:41.747 --> 00:04:45.914
I'll tell you about this
fascinating Duplication Syndrome.

00:04:47.284 --> 00:04:49.725
But first about Williams Syndrome.

00:04:49.725 --> 00:04:53.492
So I and my colleagues, we
were drawn to Williams Syndrome

00:04:53.492 --> 00:04:56.516
because this is a very well defined,

00:04:56.516 --> 00:05:00.244
circumscribed cognitive behavioral profile

00:05:00.244 --> 00:05:04.340
in human beings, which I'll
tell you about in a moment.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.044
Moreover, the affected genes are known,

00:05:07.044 --> 00:05:10.603
unlike many of the complex
disorders that we study,

00:05:10.603 --> 00:05:13.973
schizophrenia, autism,
etc, many of the ones

00:05:13.973 --> 00:05:16.640
that Dr. Gershwin showed before.

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:21.459
We hoped that by studying
Williams Syndrome,

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:24.724
this gold standard
phenotype genotype link,

00:05:24.724 --> 00:05:29.005
that we would be able to
uncover neurogenetic mechanisms

00:05:29.005 --> 00:05:33.924
that underlie complex human
behaviors and disorders.

00:05:33.924 --> 00:05:36.948
And our goal has been,
and our strategy has been

00:05:36.948 --> 00:05:40.839
to very carefully define
the brain phenotype,

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:44.127
the brain features that
characterize Williams Syndrome

00:05:44.127 --> 00:05:46.445
and to use this information to bridge

00:05:46.445 --> 00:05:50.708
the knowledge gap between
genes and behavior.

00:05:50.708 --> 00:05:54.051
So let me tell you a little
bit about the syndrome.

00:05:54.051 --> 00:05:56.236
People with Williams Syndrome have

00:05:56.236 --> 00:05:58.403
facial features that are very similar.

00:05:58.403 --> 00:06:00.587
This is an old picture, very famous,

00:06:00.587 --> 00:06:04.004
from one of Dr. Bellugi's seminal papers,

00:06:04.965 --> 00:06:06.920
and you can see how much these unrelated

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.764
children with Williams Syndrome look.

00:06:09.764 --> 00:06:12.947
But it was really two hallmark
neurobehavioral features

00:06:12.947 --> 00:06:16.578
that caught our interest, one
in the domain of personality

00:06:16.578 --> 00:06:19.052
and one in the domain of cognition,

00:06:19.052 --> 00:06:21.756
and I'll be speaking about each of these.

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:24.420
Let's talk about the
cognitive profile first.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.347
This is a distinctive pattern of

00:06:27.347 --> 00:06:29.930
peaks and valleys in abilities.

00:06:31.205 --> 00:06:35.358
Language is very good, face
recognition is preserved,

00:06:35.358 --> 00:06:40.302
but visuospatial construction
is markedly impaired.

00:06:40.302 --> 00:06:42.972
Visuospatial construction
is the ability to visualize

00:06:42.972 --> 00:06:45.622
an object or picture as a set of parts,

00:06:45.622 --> 00:06:49.477
and construct a replica of
the object from those parts.

00:06:49.477 --> 00:06:53.348
This is the classic neuropsychometric test

00:06:53.348 --> 00:06:57.515
that's used to access visuospatial
constructive abilities.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.662
This is the block design
test, people are shown

00:07:00.662 --> 00:07:02.308
a model like this and they're given

00:07:02.308 --> 00:07:05.275
some blocks and asked to reconstruct it.

00:07:05.275 --> 00:07:06.435
And you can see how poorly folks

00:07:06.435 --> 00:07:09.428
with Williams Syndrome
do, even compared to folks

00:07:09.428 --> 00:07:13.355
with Downs Syndrome with the same IQs.

00:07:13.355 --> 00:07:16.143
Another way that this can
be accessed is by drawing,

00:07:16.143 --> 00:07:18.309
which Dr. Gershwin was talking about.

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:21.420
And this is a nine and
a half year old child

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.835
drawing a bicycle and we would
not know at all that this

00:07:24.835 --> 00:07:27.756
was a bicycle, if the parts
weren't labeled for us,

00:07:27.756 --> 00:07:32.028
so a dissolution of this
information in space.

00:07:32.028 --> 00:07:34.030
And I love this example, again from a work

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.196
of Dr. Bellugi's, this is an elephant,

00:07:37.196 --> 00:07:40.613
and we would not know that
if this weren't labeled.

00:07:40.613 --> 00:07:42.698
This is a pretty impoverished picture,

00:07:42.698 --> 00:07:45.020
and compare it to this rather rich

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.937
depiction in the verbal domain from

00:07:49.036 --> 00:07:51.782
the same teen with Williams Syndrome,

00:07:51.782 --> 00:07:53.431
and I'll read some of it to you.

00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:56.037
It lives in the jungle, it
can also live in the zoo.

00:07:56.037 --> 00:07:58.179
It has long, gray ears, fan ears,

00:07:58.179 --> 00:08:00.555
ears that can blow in the wind.

00:08:00.555 --> 00:08:02.404
If they're in a bad
mood it can be terrible,

00:08:02.404 --> 00:08:04.067
it could stomp, it could charge.

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:07.461
They have big, long tusks,
they can damage a car.

00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:09.236
You don't want an elephant as a pet,

00:08:09.236 --> 00:08:11.413
you want a cat, a dog, or a bird.

00:08:11.413 --> 00:08:14.110
(audience laughter)

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.547
So pretty rich and very lyrical almost

00:08:16.547 --> 00:08:18.956
compared to this impoverished drawing.

00:08:18.956 --> 00:08:21.434
So domain specificity of the peaks

00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:24.312
and valleys in Williams Syndrome.

00:08:24.312 --> 00:08:26.359
My colleagues and I
over the years have done

00:08:26.359 --> 00:08:28.204
a number of studies trying to understand

00:08:28.204 --> 00:08:32.942
the brain features that go
along with that inability.

00:08:32.942 --> 00:08:36.432
This is a posterior
back view of the brain,

00:08:36.432 --> 00:08:41.167
and we and others now have
found a structural anomaly.

00:08:41.167 --> 00:08:43.266
This is not a lesion, it
would not be read as such

00:08:43.266 --> 00:08:46.991
by any radiologist, but this
is a statistical finding,

00:08:46.991 --> 00:08:49.033
a reduction in gray matter volume,

00:08:49.033 --> 00:08:50.765
the gray matter of our brains,

00:08:50.765 --> 00:08:53.534
right here early in the dorsal stream

00:08:53.534 --> 00:08:57.034
that processes where objects are in space.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.424
We also found functional deficits

00:09:00.424 --> 00:09:04.604
that emerge from this structural anomaly.

00:09:04.604 --> 00:09:07.816
And this has been a very well replicated

00:09:07.816 --> 00:09:11.431
and reliable brain phenotype
for mapping gene effects

00:09:11.431 --> 00:09:12.663
and that of course was our goal

00:09:12.663 --> 00:09:15.716
in starting up these studies.

00:09:15.716 --> 00:09:17.153
And we have found, I
don't have time to talk

00:09:17.153 --> 00:09:18.935
about this today, although perhaps we will

00:09:18.935 --> 00:09:21.345
in the question and answer part,

00:09:21.345 --> 00:09:24.550
but we found this to be
linked to one particular gene

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:28.808
in the Williams Syndrome
region, the LIMK1 gene.

00:09:28.808 --> 00:09:31.687
I'd like to turn to the
Williams Syndrome profile now,

00:09:31.687 --> 00:09:34.161
because this is, in many ways,

00:09:34.161 --> 00:09:36.182
the most immediately apparent and

00:09:36.182 --> 00:09:40.099
captivating aspect of
folks with this syndrome.

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.741
They are highly and overly
social, they're empathic,

00:09:43.741 --> 00:09:46.535
outgoing, loquacious, charming,

00:09:46.535 --> 00:09:49.550
unusually friendly, even with strangers,

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:50.733
however they're anxious in some

00:09:50.733 --> 00:09:54.733
non-social situations,
never social, non-social.

00:09:57.774 --> 00:10:00.695
So, increased sociability,
increased number

00:10:00.695 --> 00:10:03.479
of social contacts, increased empathy

00:10:03.479 --> 00:10:06.630
that can be measured experimentally.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.030
They don't observe social distance,

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:10.287
unless they're taught to.

00:10:10.287 --> 00:10:12.617
They're socially
fearless, even in infancy,

00:10:12.617 --> 00:10:16.342
but there is this strong
increase in non-social anxiety.

00:10:16.342 --> 00:10:18.790
My colleagues and I have also
searched for brain features

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.950
underlying this aspect
of Williams Syndrome,

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:25.231
and we've become very
interested in an area

00:10:25.231 --> 00:10:28.206
called the insula and
convinced that it's important.

00:10:28.206 --> 00:10:31.658
So this is an area of
the brain that integrates

00:10:31.658 --> 00:10:35.015
cognitive, affective
and social information.

00:10:35.015 --> 00:10:37.184
It plays a crucial role in empathy,

00:10:37.184 --> 00:10:40.368
in interoception,
thinking about ourselves,

00:10:40.368 --> 00:10:43.222
and in social function,
so it's a great candidate.

00:10:43.222 --> 00:10:47.389
And we have found that the,
both the structural size

00:10:48.431 --> 00:10:51.192
and the function of
this region of the brain

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:53.934
predicts the degree to which this

00:10:53.934 --> 00:10:57.510
Williams Syndrome personality
profile is expressed

00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:00.277
in individual patients,
and we've replicated this

00:11:00.277 --> 00:11:03.110
in a large number of children now.

00:11:04.294 --> 00:11:06.960
And we have linked this
to a general transcription

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:11.159
factor gene that is in the
Williams Syndrome region.

00:11:11.159 --> 00:11:12.973
I'd like to turn now to talk to you about

00:11:12.973 --> 00:11:16.245
children with Duplications,
so these folks have

00:11:16.245 --> 00:11:19.328
three copies of these relevant genes.

00:11:20.198 --> 00:11:22.681
And they provide a remarkable opportunity

00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:26.445
and are extraordinarily interesting also.

00:11:26.445 --> 00:11:28.654
So people with the deletion were

00:11:28.654 --> 00:11:32.272
described first, about a decade ago,

00:11:32.272 --> 00:11:35.430
by my colleague Carolyn Mervis and others.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.158
And you can see right away that
people with the Duplication

00:11:38.158 --> 00:11:40.285
have similar facial features, as do those

00:11:40.285 --> 00:11:43.415
with Williams Syndrome, but
they're quite different.

00:11:43.415 --> 00:11:45.877
And they differ in other very

00:11:45.877 --> 00:11:48.569
important and interesting ways.

00:11:48.569 --> 00:11:50.213
Williams Syndrome, as I've told you,

00:11:50.213 --> 00:11:52.293
has a weakness in spatial skills,

00:11:52.293 --> 00:11:53.991
whereas there's a relative strength

00:11:53.991 --> 00:11:56.815
in spatial skills in the Duplication.

00:11:56.815 --> 00:11:58.702
And you can see this in examples from

00:11:58.702 --> 00:12:03.137
two of our children
patients, child patients.

00:12:03.137 --> 00:12:05.665
This is a 12 and a half year
old with Williams Syndrome

00:12:05.665 --> 00:12:08.335
drawing a bike, a little impoverished.

00:12:08.335 --> 00:12:11.263
This is a 10 year old with a Duplication

00:12:11.263 --> 00:12:13.014
drawing a bike, and you can clearly see

00:12:13.014 --> 00:12:14.910
the contrast in the level of detail and

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.743
spatial integration in this image.

00:12:21.223 --> 00:12:24.498
Folks with Williams
Syndrome have a strength

00:12:24.498 --> 00:12:26.791
in expressive language,
they're very personable

00:12:26.791 --> 00:12:29.624
and good language, relative to IQ.

00:12:31.102 --> 00:12:35.102
People with the Duplication
have a marked speech

00:12:36.752 --> 00:12:39.968
and language delay and
this is often why they come

00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:44.285
to the attention of clinicians,
so a contrast there.

00:12:44.285 --> 00:12:46.580
People with Williams Syndrome
are excessively social,

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.406
however people with the Duplication have

00:12:49.406 --> 00:12:53.453
problematic and reduced social function.

00:12:53.453 --> 00:12:55.542
And in fact there was a
very influential paper

00:12:55.542 --> 00:12:58.709
from UCSF showing that the duplication

00:13:00.621 --> 00:13:04.513
of Williams Syndrome genes is formally

00:13:04.513 --> 00:13:08.680
and statistically associated
with a diagnosis of autism.

00:13:09.808 --> 00:13:13.079
And we've actually shown
this experimentally,

00:13:13.079 --> 00:13:15.414
using a personality questionnaire

00:13:15.414 --> 00:13:19.414
in which we found a factor,
a sociability factor

00:13:21.071 --> 00:13:23.708
comprised of cheerfulness, gregariousness,

00:13:23.708 --> 00:13:25.989
people orientedness, visibility,

00:13:25.989 --> 00:13:29.656
affectionateness and
responsivity that had a

00:13:31.199 --> 00:13:34.692
step wise function, according
to the number of genes.

00:13:34.692 --> 00:13:36.348
One copy, in Williams Syndrome,

00:13:36.348 --> 00:13:39.109
here's their sociability score,

00:13:39.109 --> 00:13:41.741
two copies in typically
developing children,

00:13:41.741 --> 00:13:46.310
around zero, and three in
the Duplication Syndrome.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:48.062
And we're using these values to search for

00:13:48.062 --> 00:13:52.229
brain features that may
correlate with this gene dosage.

00:13:54.389 --> 00:13:56.739
And we believe that these
brain features exist

00:13:56.739 --> 00:13:58.662
and we will find them,
and we actually have

00:13:58.662 --> 00:14:02.222
some preliminary evidence
that I want to share with you.

00:14:02.222 --> 00:14:05.150
So, with regard to total brain volume,

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.589
and relative cerebellar volume,

00:14:07.589 --> 00:14:10.661
we see opposite but step wise functions,

00:14:10.661 --> 00:14:14.502
one copy, two copies, three
copies of these genes.

00:14:14.502 --> 00:14:17.882
One copy, two copies, three
copies of these genes.

00:14:17.882 --> 00:14:20.557
And what's interesting about
this is that the findings

00:14:20.557 --> 00:14:25.509
in the Duplication Syndrome
are also evident in autism,

00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:29.389
although there is some
controversy about this.

00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:31.945
So it will be such a privilege to continue

00:14:31.945 --> 00:14:34.816
this work and to continue to see

00:14:34.816 --> 00:14:37.149
these children longitudinally over time,

00:14:37.149 --> 00:14:40.229
which we're doing at the NIH right now.

00:14:40.229 --> 00:14:43.368
So contrasting behaviors
and brain features

00:14:43.368 --> 00:14:46.317
associated with step wise alterations

00:14:46.317 --> 00:14:49.484
in these particular genes, in 7q11.23,

00:14:51.967 --> 00:14:54.758
one copy of affected genes
in Williams Syndrome,

00:14:54.758 --> 00:14:57.133
two copies in the general population,

00:14:57.133 --> 00:15:00.005
three in the Duplication Syndrome.

00:15:00.005 --> 00:15:02.725
So this is a very clear road to uncovering

00:15:02.725 --> 00:15:06.765
neurogenetic mechanisms and
an extraordinary opportunity

00:15:06.765 --> 00:15:09.615
to understand what makes
us who and what we are,

00:15:09.615 --> 00:15:11.983
and what biological mechanisms confer

00:15:11.983 --> 00:15:14.650
our wonderful human variability.

00:15:16.149 --> 00:15:19.758
It's an extraordinary syndrome
and a privilege to study it.

00:15:19.758 --> 00:15:22.439
I'd like to take a moment
to thank our families

00:15:22.439 --> 00:15:26.645
and our participants and I'd
like to thank Dr. Bellugi

00:15:26.645 --> 00:15:28.789
for her continuing inspiration throughout

00:15:28.789 --> 00:15:32.600
my career and you for your attention.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.850
(applause)

00:15:41.513 --> 00:15:44.180
