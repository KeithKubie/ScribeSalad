I don't have precise um bright-line
thing there and obviously obviously if

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230
thing there and obviously obviously if
 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.570
thing there and obviously obviously if
you say that we should just get rid of

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580
you say that we should just get rid of
 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.520
you say that we should just get rid of
everything all together and the people

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:19.530
everything all together and the people
 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.710
everything all together and the people
have you know everybody have their own

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720
have you know everybody have their own
 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.470
have you know everybody have their own
nuclear bombs and stuff like that and

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480
nuclear bombs and stuff like that and
 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.330
nuclear bombs and stuff like that and
let people solve things by themselves

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340
let people solve things by themselves
 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.179
let people solve things by themselves
that's obviously not the right the right

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189
that's obviously not the right the right
 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.840
that's obviously not the right the right
answer either I think that something

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850
answer either I think that something
 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.710
answer either I think that something
like a state about you know a government

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720
like a state about you know a government
 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.110
like a state about you know a government
that has that spends maybe 10 to 15

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120
that has that spends maybe 10 to 15
 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.970
that has that spends maybe 10 to 15
percent of GDP is about the right number

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980
percent of GDP is about the right number
 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.120
percent of GDP is about the right number
so you know and I think we can have

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.130
so you know and I think we can have
 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.190
so you know and I think we can have
political debates as to where that money

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200
political debates as to where that money
 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.110
political debates as to where that money
best be spent countries like Hong Kong

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120
best be spent countries like Hong Kong
 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.460
best be spent countries like Hong Kong
you know number the emerging markets

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470
you know number the emerging markets
 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.130
you know number the emerging markets
have done really well seem to have been

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140
have done really well seem to have been
 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.770
have done really well seem to have been
stable they've had institutions that you

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780
stable they've had institutions that you
 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.540
stable they've had institutions that you
know have protected people from crime

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550
know have protected people from crime
 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.610
know have protected people from crime
and it was protected property rights and

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620
and it was protected property rights and
 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.750
and it was protected property rights and
have you know they've not been

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760
have you know they've not been
 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.140
have you know they've not been
completely chaotic unstable places and

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150
completely chaotic unstable places and
 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.880
completely chaotic unstable places and
they've achieved tremendous our rates of

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890
they've achieved tremendous our rates of
 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.469
they've achieved tremendous our rates of
growth and I think I think one of the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479
growth and I think I think one of the
 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.969
growth and I think I think one of the
one of the perspective that's always

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979
one of the perspective that's always
 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.390
one of the perspective that's always
very important is a long time horizon

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400
very important is a long time horizon
 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.380
very important is a long time horizon
because I think you know one of these

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390
because I think you know one of these
 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.690
because I think you know one of these
debates is always that on a short time

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700
debates is always that on a short time
 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.489
debates is always that on a short time
horizon of course you get all sorts of

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:19.499
horizon of course you get all sorts of
 

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:21.830
horizon of course you get all sorts of
different priorities but if the question

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840
different priorities but if the question
 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.870
different priorities but if the question
is how do we create the best world in

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880
is how do we create the best world in
 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.789
is how do we create the best world in
the next 50 years the next hundred years

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799
the next 50 years the next hundred years
 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.789
the next 50 years the next hundred years
or or beyond I think you get two very

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799
or or beyond I think you get two very
 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.219
or or beyond I think you get two very
different answers from if you ask what

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229
different answers from if you ask what
 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.080
different answers from if you ask what
do we do that's the best for the next

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090
do we do that's the best for the next
 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.849
do we do that's the best for the next
two years the next four you know the

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859
two years the next four you know the
 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:40.319
two years the next four you know the
next political election cycle

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329
 
 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.349
 
obviously is a very significant tension

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:42.359
obviously is a very significant tension
 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:45.389
obviously is a very significant tension
and the security problem you know is a

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399
and the security problem you know is a
 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.090
and the security problem you know is a
difficult one for libertarians to tackle

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100
difficult one for libertarians to tackle
 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.139
difficult one for libertarians to tackle
I mean it's probably this you know

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149
I mean it's probably this you know
 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:50.850
I mean it's probably this you know
children are problem for libertarians

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860
children are problem for libertarians
 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.319
children are problem for libertarians
crazy people are problem for

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329
crazy people are problem for
 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:54.059
crazy people are problem for
libertarians and you're criminals are a

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069
libertarians and you're criminals are a
 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:55.620
libertarians and you're criminals are a
problem and I consider you know

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630
problem and I consider you know
 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.059
problem and I consider you know
terrorists are sort of a probably a

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069
terrorists are sort of a probably a
 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:00.300
terrorists are sort of a probably a
subset of crazy people and and criminals

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310
subset of crazy people and and criminals
 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.679
subset of crazy people and and criminals
at the same time but but that but that

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689
at the same time but but that but that
 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.609
at the same time but but that but that
being said I do think that there there

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619
being said I do think that there there
 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.960
being said I do think that there there
there should be ways to to to to address

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970
there should be ways to to to to address
 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.940
there should be ways to to to to address
this that there's obviously um there's

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950
this that there's obviously um there's
 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.949
this that there's obviously um there's
there's one set of arguments on I

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959
there's one set of arguments on I
 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.020
there's one set of arguments on I
wouldn't say the panacea at all but

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030
wouldn't say the panacea at all but
 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.880
wouldn't say the panacea at all but
there is definitely a one-one line of

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890
there is definitely a one-one line of
 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.350
there is definitely a one-one line of
analysis that that it is that terrorism

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360
analysis that that it is that terrorism
 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.620
analysis that that it is that terrorism
tends to arise most in parts of the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630
tends to arise most in parts of the
 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.630
tends to arise most in parts of the
world that are very disconnected from

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640
world that are very disconnected from
 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.660
world that are very disconnected from
the rest and so that if we have a more

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670
the rest and so that if we have a more
 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.569
the rest and so that if we have a more
connected world in which people feel

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579
connected world in which people feel
 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.479
connected world in which people feel
they have a stake in what happens in

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489
they have a stake in what happens in
 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.240
they have a stake in what happens in
different places in different countries

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250
different places in different countries
 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.340
different places in different countries
that will create some you know some some

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350
that will create some you know some some
 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.410
that will create some you know some some
incentives to to basically to do that

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420
incentives to to basically to do that
 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.509
incentives to to basically to do that
will mitigate against against sort of

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519
will mitigate against against sort of
 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.870
will mitigate against against sort of
the kind of runaway hostility that that

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880
the kind of runaway hostility that that
 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.949
the kind of runaway hostility that that
is very very dangerous I don't think

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959
is very very dangerous I don't think
 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.750
is very very dangerous I don't think
that's a panacea I think that certainly

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760
that's a panacea I think that certainly
 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.309
that's a panacea I think that certainly
is a partial things I think

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319
is a partial things I think
 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.440
is a partial things I think
globalization is not the whole answer

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450
globalization is not the whole answer
 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.300
globalization is not the whole answer
but it is probably a partial answer to

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310
but it is probably a partial answer to
 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.680
but it is probably a partial answer to
some of the things that are that are

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690
some of the things that are that are
 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.720
some of the things that are that are
driving I'm driving things towards

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730
driving I'm driving things towards
 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.580
driving I'm driving things towards
towards terrorism and then of course you

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590
towards terrorism and then of course you
 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.379
towards terrorism and then of course you
know I do think there are they're pieces

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:10.389
know I do think there are they're pieces
 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:11.879
know I do think there are they're pieces
of it that could be dealt with in a

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:11.889
of it that could be dealt with in a
 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:13.890
of it that could be dealt with in a
variety of ways so you know I think if

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900
variety of ways so you know I think if
 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.990
variety of ways so you know I think if
you could reduce the energy dependency

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000
you could reduce the energy dependency
 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.720
you could reduce the energy dependency
in the US this would be a very important

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730
in the US this would be a very important
 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.599
in the US this would be a very important
step in in effect defunding a lot of the

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609
step in in effect defunding a lot of the
 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.150
step in in effect defunding a lot of the
terrorist organizations if you could

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160
terrorist organizations if you could
 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.729
terrorist organizations if you could
there probably are a whole set of

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739
there probably are a whole set of
 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.430
there probably are a whole set of
security measures one could take that

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440
security measures one could take that
 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.280
security measures one could take that
don't necessarily are not necessarily

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290
don't necessarily are not necessarily
 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.000
