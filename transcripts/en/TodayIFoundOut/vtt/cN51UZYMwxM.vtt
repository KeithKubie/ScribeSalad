00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.070
In 1936, the crew of the British gunboat HMS
Gnat lacked a mascot, and the captain and

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.950
crew decided to remedy that situation before
starting patrols on the Yangtze River.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.490
Their sister gunboats, the Bee, Cicada, and
Cricket already had mascots of their own.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.300
So Lieutenant Commander J. Waldergrave and
Chief Petty Officer Charles Jefferey purchased

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.610
an English Pointer puppy they named Judy from
a kennel in Shanghai, China, intending for

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.550
her to both serve as mascot and as a gundog
for hunting when the crew went ashore.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.110
The ship’s cook, Jan “Tankey” Cooper,
was assigned the responsibility of caring

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.150
for her.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.940
Fast-forward to the start of WWII and the
HMS Gnat was recalled to port where Judy joined

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.229
the crew members who transferred to the HMS
Grasshopper in June of 1939.

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:59.790
Three years later, the Grasshopper was struck
by a torpedo and the crew abandoned ship.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.530
Judy proved her worth when she joined the
crew on an uninhabited island off of Sumatra.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.970
At first, the men were unable to find freshwater,
but Judy’s sensitive nose led her to a point

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.540
in the sand near the shoreline when the tide
was low.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.550
She then began to dig until ultimately uncovering
an underground freshwater spring, providing

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.520
clean drinking water to herself and the survivors.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.860
A few days later, the crew managed to “commandeer”
a Chinese junk and set off to Sumatra.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.300
Once there, they began a 200 mile trek to
the British-held Pedang; Judy, of course,

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.300
went with them.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.450
They hoped to arrive in time to join the British
evacuation of the area, but they missed the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.570
final boat and instead walked right into a
Japanese-controlled village on their way.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.060
Now captured, the bedraggled soldiers were
transported to the Gloergoer POW camp.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.340
Not wanting to leave their mascot behind,
the crewmen hid Judy beneath empty rice sacks

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.420
during the journey.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.570
Royal Air Force Leading Aircraftman Frank
Williams was among the POWs housed at the

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.800
camp located in Medan, Indonesia.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.229
With food scarce in the camp, Williams observed
Judy sniffing around and snatching up maggots

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.190
tossed from rations for a few days; the hungry
dog pulled at his heartstrings.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.090
He later stated, “I remember thinking what
on earth is a beautiful English Pointer like

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.599
this doing here with no one to care for her.

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.390
I realised that even though she was thin,
she was a survivor.”

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.780
So one afternoon, he laid his entire ration
of rice on the ground for Judy to eat.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.420
She wolfed it down before laying herself at
his feet.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.580
From then on, she was his constant companion
and the rest of the prisoners soon referred

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.060
to her as his dog.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.140
Judy’s position at the camp was a treacherous
one, however.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.020
She often interfered whenever the Japanese
guards began beating a prisoner, snapping

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.020
and growling at them, which just resulted
in the guards focusing their attention, and

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.550
aggression, on her.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.980
Needless to say, Williams and the other prisoners
feared for Judy’s safety.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.290
They believed it was only a matter of time
before the guards followed through on their

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.630
frequent promises to kill the dog.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.480
So Williams came up with a plan.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.069
Knowing that the commander of the Gloergoer
camp would often get drunk, and become quite

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.000
friendly when he was in that state, Williams
waited for such an occasion before approaching

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.569
him and convincing the commandant to give
Judy official POW status.

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.640
He sealed the deal by offering the commander
one of Judy’s puppies as a gift for his

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.819
local mistress.

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:08.890
The plan worked.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.000
Judy became the only official canine POW during
World War II- Prisoner of War 81A Gloergoer,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Medan.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.319
From there on out, while guards could, and
did, still occasionally beat her when she

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.540
interfered with them, they were reluctant
to kill a POW.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.849
The Japanese transferred Williams and other
members of the Grasshopper’s crew to Singapore

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.650
in June of 1944.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.540
Before the move, Williams spent several days
training Judy to stay completely silent and

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.220
still inside a rice bag.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.850
In this way, Judy was again smuggled with
them, lying in a rice bag for three hours

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.800
while Williams stood with other prisoners
on the deck of the SS Van Warwyck before they

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.800
set off.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.900
The ship never made it to Singapore, however.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.740
At 12:42 p.m. on June 26th, it was torpedoed
by the British submarine HMS Truculent.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.209
After the torpedoes struck, chaos reigned
among the prisoners and crew.

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.970
According to Williams, the only one that kept
her head was Judy.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.620
“[She] was incredibly calm and was motionlessly
waiting for me to move.”

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.040
Thinking quickly, Williams grabbed Judy and
pushed her out of a small porthole on the

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.540
rapidly sinking ship.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.200
Before dropping to the water about 15 feet
below, Williams stated, “[She] looked down

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.110
and back at me with a sad look.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.100
I immediately understood her: She thought
I was nuts!

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.190
Then she wrenched herself with curled up rear
paws through the porthole.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.340
The hole was just wide enough and with a last
push she disappeared from sight.”

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.370
Williams couldn’t fit through, but managed
to find another way off the boat and then

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.610
swam around looking for Judy for some time.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.659
He later recalled, “As far as the eye could
see, the sea was filled with wreckage being

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:34.919
dragged away by the fast currents.

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.909
Somewhere in there, Judy was swimming.”

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:40.839
After unsuccessfully being able to locate
Judy, he eventually made it back to land,

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:43.629
but was recaptured and sent to another prison
camp.

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:48.270
While being recaptured and once again finding
himself in a POW camp wasn’t exactly a good

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.860
thing, this time there was a silver-lining.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.370
When he reached the POW camp in Sumatra, he
stated

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.590
I couldn’t believe my eyes.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.169
As I entered the camp, a scraggy dog hit me
square between the shoulders and knocked me

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:00.169
over!

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:01.749
… I’d never been so glad to see the old
girl.

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:04.050
And I think she felt the same!

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.949
Williams and Judy managed to survive a backbreaking
year in Sumatra before the war ended in 1945.

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.300
Upon being released, however, another problem
arose.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.909
The ship that was to carry them back to Britain,
the S.S. Atenor, did not allow animals.

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:21.439
Unwilling to leave her behind, Williams smuggled
Judy aboard while a few other POWs distracted

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:22.439
the guards.

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:25.979
Her arrival in Britain wasn’t initially
as anticipated either, as she was immediately

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:30.669
seized by officials from the Ministry of Agriculture
and spent her first six months on British

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.159
soil in quarantine.

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:36.020
During that time, Judy’s story spread and
for her work in the war, she ultimately received

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.169
the PDSA Dickin Medal, the animal equivalent
of the Victoria Cross, awarded to animals

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.039
who demonstrate “conspicuous gallantry or
devotion to duty while serving or associated

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:50.309
with any branch of the Armed Forces or Civil
Defence Units.”

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:54.249
Besides the medal, she was also the recipient
of a serious amount of fanfare that included

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:57.819
being “interviewed” by the BBC and having
a ceremony held honoring her service on May

00:05:57.819 --> 00:05:58.819
3, 1946 in Cadogan Square.

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:00.030
Her official medal citation read,

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.849
For magnificent courage and endurance in Japanese
prison camps, which helped to maintain morale

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:10.680
among her fellow prisoners and also for saving
many lives through her intelligence and watchfulness.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.630
Judy spent the rest of her life with Williams
and continued her globetrotting by traveling

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.180
with him around Africa.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.939
She was ultimately “put to sleep” on February
17, 1950 at the age of 13 as her health had

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:23.630
declined significantly due to a mammary tumor.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.559
Williams buried her in an RAF coat he’d
made specially for her, as well as erected

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:46.960
a small memorial in her honor.
