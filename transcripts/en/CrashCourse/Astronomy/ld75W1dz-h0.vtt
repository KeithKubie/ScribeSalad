00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:08.480
Twinkle, twinkle little star. Oh. I know who
you are.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.220
At first glance, stars pretty much all look
alike. Twinkly dots, scattered across the sky.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.480
But as I talked about in episode 2, when you
look more closely you see differences.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.440
The most obvious is that some look bright and
some faint. As I said then, sometimes that’s due

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.240
to them being at different distances, but it’s also
true that stars emit different amounts of light, too.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.520
If you look through binoculars or take pictures of
them, you’ll see that they’re all different colors, too.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.420
Some appear white, some red, orange, blue, and
for a long time, the reason for this was a mystery.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.540
In the waning years of the 19th century,
astrophotography was becoming an important

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.180
scientific tool. Being able to hook a camera
up to a telescope and take long exposures

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.060
meant being able to see fainter objects,
revealing previously hidden details.

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:07.100
It also meant that spectroscopy became a force,
say it with me now, for science.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.220
A spectrum is the result when you divide the
incoming light from an object into individual

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.440
colors, or wavelengths. This reveals a vast
amount of physical data about the object.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.910
But in the late 1800s, we were only just starting
to figure that out.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.079
Interpreting stellar spectra was a tough problem.
The spectrum we measure from a star is a combination

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:29.020
of two different kinds of spectra. Stars are
hot, dense balls of gas, so they give off

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.600
a continuous spectrum; that is, they emit
light at all wavelengths.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.420
However, stars also have atmospheres, thinner
layers of gas above the denser inner layers.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.109
These gases absorb light at specific wavelengths
from the light below depending on the elements

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:47.270
in them. The result is that the continuous
spectrum of a star has gaps in it, darker

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.030
bands where different elements absorb different
colors.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.249
At first, stars were classified by the strengths
of their hydrogen lines. The strongest were

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:59.759
called A stars, the next strongest B, then
C, and so on. But in 1901, a new system was

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.219
introduced by spectroscopist Annie Jump Cannon,
who dropped or merged a few of the old classifications,

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.069
and then rearranged them into one that classified
stars by the strengths and appearances of

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.470
many different absorption lines in their spectra.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.790
A few years later, physicist Max Planck solved
a thorny problem in physics, showing how objects

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.040
like stars give off light of different colors based
on their temperature. Hotter stars put out

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.040
more light at the blue end of the spectrum, while cooler
ones peaked in the red. Around the same time, Bengali

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.940
physicist Meghnad Saha solved another tough problem:
how atoms give off light at different temperatures.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.100
Two decades later, the brilliant astronomer
Cecelia Payne-Gaposchkin put all these pieces

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.420
together. She showed that the spectra of stars
depended on the temperature and elements in

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.959
their atmospheres. This unlocked the secrets
of the stars, allowing astronomers to understand

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.580
not just their composition but also many other
physical traits.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.400
For example, at the time, it was thought that stars
had roughly the same composition as the Earth,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.299
but Payne-Gaposchkin showed that stars were
overwhelmingly composed of hydrogen, with

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.519
helium as the second most abundant element.

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.329
The classification scheme proposed by Cannon
and decoded by Payne-Gaposchkin is still used

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:13.019
today, and arranges stars by their temperature,
assigning each a letter. Because they were

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.269
rearranged from an older system the letters
aren’t alphabetical: So the hottest are

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:23.659
O-type stars, slightly cooler are B, followed
by A, F, G, K, and M. It’s a little weird,

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:27.909
but many people use the mnemonic, “Oh Be
A Fine Guy, Kiss Me,” or “Oh Be A Fine

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:32.060
Girl, Kiss Me,” to remember it — which
was dreamed up by Annie Jump Cannon herself!

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.219
Each letter grouping is divided into 10 subgroups,
again according to temperature. We’ve also

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:42.059
discovered even cooler stars in the past few decades,
and these are assigned the letters L, T, and Y.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.879
The Sun has a surface temperature of about
5500° Celsius, and is a G2 star. A slightly

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.680
hotter star would be a G1, and a slightly cooler 
star a G3. Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky,

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.140
is much hotter than the Sun, and is classified as an
A0. Betelgeuse, which is red and cool, is an M2.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.620
Stars come in almost every color of the rainbow.
Hot stars are blue, cool stars red. In between

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:07.789
there are orange and even some yellow stars.

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:10.469
But there are no green stars.

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:14.460
Look as much as you want, and you won’t
find any. It’s because of the way our eyes

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:19.740
see color. A star can put out lots of green
light, but if it does it’ll also emit red,

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:25.190
blue, and orange. And our eyes mix those together
to form other colors. A star can actually

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.880
emit more green light than any other color,
but we’ll wind up seeing it as white!

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.700
How do I know? Because if you look at the
sun’s spectrum, it actually peaks in the green!

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.960
Isn’t that weird? The Sun puts out more
green light than any other color, but our

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.090
eyes see all the mixed colors together as
white.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.240
Wait, what? White? You may be thinking the
Sun is actually yellow.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.860
Not really. The light from the Sun is white,
but some of the shorter wavelengths like purple

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.800
and blue and some green get scattered away
by molecules of nitrogen in our air. Those

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.190
appear to be coming from every direction but
the Sun, which is why the sky looks blue.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.630
The Sun doesn’t emit much purple, so the sky doesn’t
look purple, and the green doesn’t scatter as well as

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.270
blue. That gives the Sun a yellowish tint to our
eyes, and looking at the Sun is painful anyway,

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.460
so it’s hard to accurately gauge what color
it appears. That’s also why sunsets look

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.030
orange or red: You’re looking through more
air on the horizon to see the Sun, so all

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.030
the bluer light is scattered away.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.720
So we can use spectra to determine a lot about
a star. But if you combine that with knowing

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.760
a star’s distance, things get amazing.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.080
You can measure how bright the star appears
to be in your telescope, and by using the distance

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.280
you can calculate how much energy it’s actually
giving off — what astronomers call its luminosity.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.690
An intrinsically faint light looks bright
if it’s nearby, but so does a very luminous

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.430
light far away. By knowing the distance, you can
correct for that, and figure out how luminous the

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:52.440
objects actually are. This was, no exaggeration,
the key to understanding stars.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.660
A lot of a star’s physical characteristics are related:
Its luminosity depends on its size and temperature.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.760
If two stars are the same size, but one is
hotter, the hotter one will be more luminous.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.040
If two stars are the same temperature, but one
is bigger, the bigger one will be more luminous.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.680
Knowing the temperature and distance means
knowing the stars themselves.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:16.590
Still, it’s a lot of data. A century ago,
spectra were taken of hundreds of thousands

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.690
of stars! How do you even start looking at
all that?

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.110
The best way to understand a large group of
objects is to look for trends. Is there a

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.950
relationship between color and distance? How
about temperature and size? You compare and

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.330
contrast them in as many ways possible and
see what pops up.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.430
I’ll spare you the work. A century ago astronomers
Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:42.190
made a graph, in which they plotted a star’s
luminosity versus its temperature. When they

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.790
did, they got a surprise: a VERY strong trend.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:50.500
This is called an HR Diagram, after Hertzsprung
and Russell. It’s not an exaggeration to

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.060
call it the single most important graph in
all of astronomy!

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.460
In this graph, really bright stars are near
the top, fainter ones near the bottom. Hot,

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.480
blue stars are on the left, and cool, red
stars on the right.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.920
The groups are pretty obvious!

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:08.290
There’s that thick line running diagonally
down the middle, the clump to the upper right,

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.500
and the smaller clump to the lower left. 
This took a long time to fully understand,

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.280
but now we know this diagram is showing
us how stars live their lives.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.760
Most stars fall into that thick line, and
that’s why astronomers call it the Main

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.530
Sequence. The term is a little misleading;
it’s not really a sequence per se, but as

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.300
usual in astronomy it’s an old term and
we got stuck with it.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.860
The reason the main sequence is a broad, long
line has to do with how stars make energy.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:38.300
Like the Sun, stars generate energy by fusing
hydrogen into helium in their cores.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:42.410
A star that fuses hydrogen faster will be
hotter, because it’s making more energy.

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:47.020
The rate of fusion depends on the pressure
in a star’s core. More massive stars can

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.920
squeeze their cores harder, so they fuse
faster and get hotter than low mass stars.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.460
It’s pretty much that simple.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.660
And that explains the main sequence!

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.840
Stars spend most of their lives fusing hydrogen
into helium, which is why the main sequence

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:05.450
has most of the stars on it; those are the ones merrily
going about their starry business of making energy.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:10.020
Massive stars are hotter and more luminous,
so they fall on the upper left of the main

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:14.900
sequence. Stars with lower mass are cooler
and redder, so they fall a little lower to

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.280
the right, and so on. The Sun is there, too,
more or less in the middle.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:23.100
What about the other groups? Well, the stars
on the lower left are hot, blue-white, but

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:28.540
very faint. That means they must be small
and we call them white dwarfs. They’re the

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.920
result of a star like the Sun eventually
running out of hydrogen fuel.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.740
We’ll get back to them in a future episode.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:39.080
The stars on the upper right are luminous
but cool. They must therefore be huge. These

00:08:39.089 --> 00:08:43.849
are red giants, also part of the dying process
of stars like the Sun. Above them are red

00:08:43.849 --> 00:08:48.740
SUPERgiants, massive stars beginning their
death stage. You can see some stars that are

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:53.350
also that luminous but at the upper left;
those are blue supergiants. They’re more

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.620
rare, but they too are the end stage for some
stars, and again we’ll get to them soon

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.320
enough in a future episode.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.980
But I’ll just say here that it, um, doesn’t
end well for them.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:06.550
But, on a brighter note, we literally owe
our existence to them.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:11.879
And this implies something very nifty about
the HR diagram: Stars can change position

00:09:11.879 --> 00:09:17.720
on it. Not only that, but massive stars versus
low mass stars age differently, and go to

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:23.029
different parts of the HR diagram as they
die. In many ways, the diagram allows us to

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:26.409
tell at a glance just what a star is doing
with itself.

00:09:26.409 --> 00:09:31.180
This difference between the way low mass stars
like the Sun and higher mass stars age is

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:36.110
actually critical to understanding a lot more
about what we see in the sky… so much so

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:40.370
that they’ll be handled separately in later
episodes. I’m sorry to tease so much about

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:44.960
what’s to come, but this aspect of stars
— finally understanding them physically

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.900
— was a MAJOR step in astronomy, leading
to understanding so much more.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.459
And don’t you worry: we’ll get to all
that.

00:09:51.459 --> 00:09:56.269
Today you learned that stars can be categorized
using their spectra. Together with their distance,

00:09:56.269 --> 00:10:00.790
this provides a wealth of information about
them including their luminosity, size, and

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:05.970
temperature. The HR diagram plots stars’
luminosity versus temperature, and most stars

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:09.300
fall along the main sequence, where they live
most of their lives.
