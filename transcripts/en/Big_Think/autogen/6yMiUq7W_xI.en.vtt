is elapsed we notice that because things

little while ago that's what we mean by

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650
little while ago that's what we mean by

time elapsing but is time some

fundamental quality of reality or is it

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949
fundamental quality of reality or is it
 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.820
fundamental quality of reality or is it
something that our brains impose on our

something that our brains impose on our
 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.669
something that our brains impose on our
perceptions to organize our experience

perceptions to organize our experience
 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.950
perceptions to organize our experience
into some coherent framework that allows

into some coherent framework that allows
 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.459
into some coherent framework that allows
us to survive I mean I can well imagine

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469
us to survive I mean I can well imagine
 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.400
us to survive I mean I can well imagine
that we have been under evolutionary

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410
that we have been under evolutionary
 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.180
that we have been under evolutionary
pressure over the millennia to organize

the next meal plan for the future all of
that would seemingly require that we

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750
that would seemingly require that we
 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.439
that would seemingly require that we
have a conception of time that we apply

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449
have a conception of time that we apply
 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.010
have a conception of time that we apply
to what we experience out there but that

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020
to what we experience out there but that
 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.500
to what we experience out there but that
doesn't mean time as we experience it is

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510
doesn't mean time as we experience it is
 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.779
doesn't mean time as we experience it is
real it doesn't mean that time as we

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789
real it doesn't mean that time as we
 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.270
real it doesn't mean that time as we
experiences how the world is actually

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280
experiences how the world is actually
 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.670
experiences how the world is actually
structured I mean there are many ideas

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680
structured I mean there are many ideas
 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.890
structured I mean there are many ideas
that people put forward the possibility

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900
that people put forward the possibility
 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.440
that people put forward the possibility
for instance that you know we all know

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450
for instance that you know we all know
 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.719
for instance that you know we all know
that matter is made of molecules and

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729
that matter is made of molecules and
 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.010
that matter is made of molecules and
atoms could it be the time is also made

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020
atoms could it be the time is also made
 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.300
atoms could it be the time is also made
of some kind of ingredient a molecule of

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310
of some kind of ingredient a molecule of
 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.870
of some kind of ingredient a molecule of
time an atom of time is that really what

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880
time an atom of time is that really what
 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.810
time an atom of time is that really what
time is at a fundamental level and what

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
time is at a fundamental level and what
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.240
time is at a fundamental level and what
if you had one of these ingredients in

if you had one of these ingredients in
 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.740
if you had one of these ingredients in
time a constituent of time all by itself

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750
time a constituent of time all by itself
 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.160
time a constituent of time all by itself
would there be any hint of time as we

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170
would there be any hint of time as we
 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.560
would there be any hint of time as we
experience it or do you need many of

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570
experience it or do you need many of
 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.370
experience it or do you need many of
these ingredients in order to fill out

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380
these ingredients in order to fill out
 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.560
these ingredients in order to fill out
time as we know it I mean if I handed

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570
time as we know it I mean if I handed
 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.310
time as we know it I mean if I handed
you a molecule of h2o you wouldn't know

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320
you a molecule of h2o you wouldn't know
 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.740
you a molecule of h2o you wouldn't know
that it's wet that it can quench your

that it's wet that it can quench your
 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.870
that it's wet that it can quench your
thirst right I mean the ingredient

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880
thirst right I mean the ingredient
 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.330
thirst right I mean the ingredient
doesn't necessarily bear a direct

qualities that many of those ingredients

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310
qualities that many of those ingredients
 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.490
qualities that many of those ingredients
when put together will yield like your

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500
when put together will yield like your
 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.680

glass of water time could be the same

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690
glass of water time could be the same
 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.660
glass of water time could be the same
thing there might be ingredients of time

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670
thing there might be ingredients of time
 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.970

that bear no resemblance

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980
that bear no resemblance
 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.430
that bear no resemblance
the time as we experience it and yet

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440
the time as we experience it and yet
 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.530
the time as we experience it and yet
that might be the more fundamental way

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540
that might be the more fundamental way
 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.880
that might be the more fundamental way
that time is injected into the makeup of

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890
that time is injected into the makeup of
 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.630
that time is injected into the makeup of

time travel is absolutely possible and

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379
time travel is absolutely possible and
 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.680
time travel is absolutely possible and
this is not some sort of weird sci-fi

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690
this is not some sort of weird sci-fi
 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.449
this is not some sort of weird sci-fi
thing that I'm talking about here Albert

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459
thing that I'm talking about here Albert
 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.600
thing that I'm talking about here Albert
Einstein taught us more than a hundred

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610
Einstein taught us more than a hundred
 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.050
Einstein taught us more than a hundred
years ago that time travel is possible

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060
years ago that time travel is possible
 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.320
years ago that time travel is possible
if you're focusing upon time travel to

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330
if you're focusing upon time travel to
 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.900
if you're focusing upon time travel to
the future and I'm not referring to the

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910
the future and I'm not referring to the
 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.089
the future and I'm not referring to the
silly saying that we all age right we're

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099
silly saying that we all age right we're
 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.470
silly saying that we all age right we're
all going into the future sure I'm

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480
all going into the future sure I'm
 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.710
all going into the future sure I'm
talking about if you wanted to leapfrog

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720
talking about if you wanted to leapfrog
 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.390
talking about if you wanted to leapfrog
into the future if you wanted to see

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400
into the future if you wanted to see
 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.640
into the future if you wanted to see
what the earth will be like a million

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650
what the earth will be like a million
 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.190
what the earth will be like a million
years from now Albert Einstein told us

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200
years from now Albert Einstein told us
 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.190
years from now Albert Einstein told us
how to do that in fact he told us two

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200
how to do that in fact he told us two
 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.990
how to do that in fact he told us two
ways of how to do it you can build a

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000
ways of how to do it you can build a
 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.110
ways of how to do it you can build a
spaceship go out into space near the

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120
spaceship go out into space near the
 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.240
spaceship go out into space near the
speed of light turn around and come back

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250
speed of light turn around and come back
 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.039
speed of light turn around and come back
imagine you go out for six months and

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049
imagine you go out for six months and
 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.509
imagine you go out for six months and
you turn around you come back for six

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519
you turn around you come back for six
 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.539
you turn around you come back for six
months you'll be one year older but he

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549
months you'll be one year older but he
 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.180
months you'll be one year older but he
taught us that your time is elapsing

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190
taught us that your time is elapsing
 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.599
taught us that your time is elapsing
much slower than time back on earth so

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609
much slower than time back on earth so
 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.610
much slower than time back on earth so
when you step out of your ship you're

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620
when you step out of your ship you're
 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.360
when you step out of your ship you're
one year older but Earth has gone

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370
one year older but Earth has gone
 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.670
one year older but Earth has gone
through many many years it can have gone

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680
through many many years it can have gone
 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.170
through many many years it can have gone
through ten thousand hundred or a

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180
through ten thousand hundred or a
 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.990
through ten thousand hundred or a
million years depending on how close to

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000
million years depending on how close to
 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.780
million years depending on how close to
the speed of light you traveled and he

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790
the speed of light you traveled and he
 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.960
the speed of light you traveled and he
also taught us if you go and hang out

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970
also taught us if you go and hang out
 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.349
also taught us if you go and hang out
near the edge of a black hole time again

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359
near the edge of a black hole time again
 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.960
near the edge of a black hole time again
will elapse more slowly for you at the

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970
will elapse more slowly for you at the
 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.580
will elapse more slowly for you at the
edge of the black hole then back on

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590
edge of the black hole then back on
 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.110
edge of the black hole then back on
Earth so you hang out there for a while

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120
Earth so you hang out there for a while
 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.840
Earth so you hang out there for a while
you come back and again you get out of

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850
you come back and again you get out of
 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.960
you come back and again you get out of
your ship and it will be any number of

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970
your ship and it will be any number of
 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.210
your ship and it will be any number of
years into the future whatever you want

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220
years into the future whatever you want
 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.190
years into the future whatever you want
all depending on how close you got to

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200
all depending on how close you got to
 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.569
all depending on how close you got to
the edge of the black hole and how long

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579
the edge of the black hole and how long
 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.330
the edge of the black hole and how long
you hung out there that is time travel

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340
you hung out there that is time travel
 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.750
you hung out there that is time travel
to the future now of course if people

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760
to the future now of course if people
 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.539
to the future now of course if people
really want to know about getting back

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549
really want to know about getting back
 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.930
really want to know about getting back
can you travel back to the past I don't

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940
can you travel back to the past I don't
 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.170
can you travel back to the past I don't
think so we don't know for sure no one

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180
think so we don't know for sure no one
 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.420
think so we don't know for sure no one
has given a definitive proof that you

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430
has given a definitive proof that you
 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.759
has given a definitive proof that you
can't travel to the past

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769
can't travel to the past
 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.089
can't travel to the past
in fact some very reputable scientists

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099
in fact some very reputable scientists
 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:24.409
in fact some very reputable scientists
have suggested ways that you might

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419
have suggested ways that you might
 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.089
have suggested ways that you might
travel to the past but every time we

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099
travel to the past but every time we
 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.399
travel to the past but every time we
look at the proposals in detail

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:28.409
look at the proposals in detail
 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:31.100
look at the proposals in detail
it seems kind of clear that they're

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110
it seems kind of clear that they're
 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.770
it seems kind of clear that they're
right at the edge of the known laws of

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780
right at the edge of the known laws of
 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.110
right at the edge of the known laws of
physics and most of us feel that when

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120
physics and most of us feel that when
 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.540
physics and most of us feel that when
physics progresses to a point that we

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550
physics progresses to a point that we
 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.980
physics progresses to a point that we
understand things even better these

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990
understand things even better these
 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.809
understand things even better these
proposals just will be ruled out they

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:41.819
proposals just will be ruled out they
 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:43.939
proposals just will be ruled out they
won't work but I guess I would say

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949
won't work but I guess I would say
 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.520
won't work but I guess I would say
there's a longshot possibility based on

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530
there's a longshot possibility based on
 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.339
there's a longshot possibility based on
what we know today that time travel to

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:49.349
what we know today that time travel to
 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.439
what we know today that time travel to
the Past might be possible but most of

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449
the Past might be possible but most of
 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.449
the Past might be possible but most of
us wouldn't bet our life on it
