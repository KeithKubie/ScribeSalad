[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.840
So what you're looking
at right here is

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.910
my brand new game--

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.890
ready to hit the charts-- called
"Guess My Number." This

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.170
is a fascinating,
thrill-a-minute game where the

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.106
computer thinks of a number and
I try to guess what it is.

00:00:19.106 --> 00:00:21.840
Along the way, it gives me hints
as to whether the number

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.760
should be higher or lower than
my previous guesses.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.990
So you might be thinking
to yourself as I'm

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.340
playing this, wow.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.960
This looks really boring.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.650
Well, it might be.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.344
But what if it looked a little
something like this?

00:00:38.344 --> 00:00:39.580
Eh?

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.410
I've got a little personalized
welcome message here on the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.560
front screen.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.270
I've got some achievements
now, that I can earn.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.180
As you can see, I'm already
earned my first time

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.880
achievement.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.640
And I am 22% of the way towards
completing my 100

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.110
guesses achievement.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.850
And when I play a game, you'll
notice that it's telling me

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.150
the number of games I have
played so far on this

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.390
difficulty level.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.420
And this is being loaded
from the cloud--

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.180
ooh.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.330
So I can play on different
devices, and I can see this

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.360
number carry over from
device to device.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.940
In addition, I have leaderboards
now for each

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.220
difficulty level.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.900
Here we can see that I am in
first place out of all the

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.000
people in my circles to
play this game, which

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.650
is really just me.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.930
But I'm also second place in
the public leaderboard.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.460
And all this, by the way,
is cross platform.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.100
So on the Android version of
"Guess My Number," I could

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.000
earn progress towards these
very same achievements.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.120
And I could compare leaderboard
scores against my

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.310
friends no matter what
device they're on.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.310
And when I'm all done playing
a game, I have a brag button

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.756
that I can click which will
share my score on Google+.

00:01:45.756 --> 00:01:48.290
And anybody that clicks this
little Play button here in my

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.720
post will be taken to the very
same game, on the very same

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.610
difficulty level, with the very
same secret number, to

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.870
see if they can guess it in
fewer moves than I did.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.490
So clearly, now we've gone from
a boring old guessing

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.330
game to what I am sure is going
to win several game of

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.880
the year awards in the category
of games where you

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.220
have to guess a random number.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.960
So let's look at adding
these features--

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.630
achievements, leaderboards, save
game in the cloud, adding

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.085
interactive posts on Google+--

00:02:15.085 --> 00:02:17.370
to your own iOS game.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.690
And we can start by taking this
very same sample game--

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.490
and yes, I'm going to share this
awesome source code with

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.130
you-- and build it up from
the very beginning.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.870
So stick around.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.000
This is going to be fun.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.820
And hopefully when we're all
done, you'll have learned a

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.850
little something about
adding play game

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.410
services to your own game.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.230
So I will see you in
the next lesson.
