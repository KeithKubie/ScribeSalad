00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640
&gt;&gt; What companies, governments, countries
individuals can do to make the world a better

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.099
place - is be honest. That's the first step
 - to actually be honest. It's fine to make

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.499
commitments, it's fine to make pledges, it's
fine to say we'll do this and that, but unless

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:18.300
it's actually executed - unless the promise
is made real, then it, it's kind of pointless.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.359
I mean it's very easy to make pledges - it's
very easy to, to say we'll do this and that

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:28.499
and never do it. But ideally, I'd like people
to be honest - and I think that works from

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:32.180
governments and corporations up, down to the
individual. If people say I'm going to do

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.000
something positive - and it could be something
really simple, like you know - be more environmentally

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.890
conscious. Or, uh for governments to say actually
if we say we're going to do this, we go ahead

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.910
and execute it and make sure there is some
sort of follow-up. Uh, I think the time for

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.670
empty promises is gone and people should focus
on honesty.
