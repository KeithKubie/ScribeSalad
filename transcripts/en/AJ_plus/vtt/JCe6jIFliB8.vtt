00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.660
What causes much of the world's
conflicts?

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.700
Well, if you agree with these guys,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.020
they'd say religion is the catalyst
for almost all of the world's violence.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.740
I think faith based religion is the mother lode of bad ideas.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.360
People will kill each other's children for ancient books and caves and relics.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.940
There is a logical pathway leading from religion to the committing of atrocities.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.060
Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens, and Richard Dawkins are considered to have launched a strain

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.560
of thought called "New Atheism".

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.820
It's a small but incredibly vocal group.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.760
But how accurate are the New Atheists in their broad claims about religion and its

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.260
role in global strife?

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.360
"It's also the case that people do violence on behalf of nation-states and flags

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.220
and kings and oil and the list goes on and on."

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.300
Hey guys, I'm Omar. And this Sunday we're talking about the New Atheists,

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.460
their problem with religion, and how that
impacts how we talk about faith.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.480
There are many different types of
atheists.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.660
Atheism is the lack of belief in the existence of a God or divine power

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.460
and it's been around forever.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.360
But in the United States, the number of people who say they're atheist

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.000
has doubled since 2007.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.280
A new political movement among atheists burst onto the scene in the years following 9/11.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.840
And they were everywhere.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.801
I'm an atheist with respect to the
Judeo-Christian God

00:01:23.801 --> 00:01:26.400
We are absolutely at war with Muslims..

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.500
You as a level-headed guy who understands..

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.240
Journalist Gary Wolf coined the term "New Atheists" a movement among non-believers

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.820
who are united by what they believe are
rationalist anti-God claims.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.500
The New Atheists believe that religion threatens progress and ultimately breeds conflict.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.980
They also believe that if religion were
eliminated many of the world's problems

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.340
would disappear.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.680
They're very confrontational as Professor Bill Cavanaugh explains.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.500
It's an atheism with a certain kind of a polemical edge,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.880
creating a distance between people who
believe and people who supposedly don't believe.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.680
So, the idea is that, "I have facts
but you have mere beliefs."

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.600
In fact, the way the new atheist aggressively challenge religion is what they're most known for.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.860
They even mock faith and believers.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.540
Because if you believe something without
evidence then that justifies anything.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.220
But their ideas don't necessarily
represent those of most atheists.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.180
The vast majority of them - 65% - say they
rarely or never discuss their views on

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.540
religion with religious people.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.860
And some atheists like humanist chaplain Greg Epstein see New Atheist rhetoric as problematic.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.800
There are a lot of people in this world who see religion as their

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.800
culture, their community, their family

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.700
their ancestors. And when we openly mock every aspect of it

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.140
in a way that is very likely to be interpreted as disrespectful,

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.080
then we are driving a wedge between ourselves and them.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.720
Writer Luke Savage says New Atheists use a facade of rational arguments

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.480
to legitimize Western military interventions.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.980
They're people that see a
lot of illiberal and anti-enlightenment

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.660
tendencies in kind of modern society and
culture and foremost among those is religion.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.100
One of the New Atheist central
arguments is that religion is inherently violent.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.760
They also believe that religion
is behind much of the world's violence

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.700
in both the past and the present.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.680
And the religion they happen to be most critical of is......Islam.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.660
But we'll talk more about that later.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.380
Right now, let's discuss where New Atheists claim to get some of their ideas:

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.560
The Enlightenment.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.540
The Enlightenment was a period between the 17th and 19th centuries

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.300
where the idea emerged that human beings didn't need an institution

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.800
like the church to live a good moral life -

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.420
human rationality should be at the forefront of that.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.160
These ideas emerge during a period when political corruption and tyranny were rampant

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.840
across many European monarchies. And they were propped up by the church which many

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.460
even argue was used as an instrument of
oppression.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.180
It takes on a particular sort of

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:54.060
polemical edge in the current context
because it's really establishes divide

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.280
between social orders in a lot of ways.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.829
One of the main critiques directed at

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.370
the New Atheists is that they examine
so-called "religious violence" in a vacuum.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.389
Critics say their arguments completely
ignore the role that land, resources,

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.840
money and power playing getting two
sides to use violence as a means of

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.780
achieving their goals.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.010
The New Atheists
also dismiss, ignore, and erase centuries

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.699
of history and simplistically pit
complicated conflicts as simply faith

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:18.820
versus reason.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.190
We never go to war for a
single reason. Military historians tell

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.310
us that there are always multiple
factors involved: Military, territorial,

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.819
and above all economic as well as
political and social.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.820
That's religious scholar and former nun Karen Armstrong

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.300
and in her 2014 book "Fields of Blood"

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.980
she argues religion is used as much to
promote violence as it is a sanctuary

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.580
from violence.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.860
This hasn't stopped New
Atheists from having a list of go-to

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.240
conflicts that they repeatedly provide
as examples that religion is synonymous

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.280
with violence.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.540
Like the Crusades.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.400
And then in Ireland there were "The Troubles" which

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.580
pitted Irish Catholics who wanted to
reunite Northern Ireland with the

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.140
Republic of Ireland against Irish
Protestants who were loyal to the United Kingdom.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.640
New Atheist Christopher Hitchens
said it was a conflict where religion

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.700
spurred much of the violence which
resulted in more than 3,500 dead.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.920
400 years and more, 400 years and more

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.820
in my own country of birth of people killing each

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.380
other's children depending on what kind
of Christian they were.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.920
And sending each other's children in rhetoric to hell.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.640
But Savage says that argument is flawed.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.550
The conflict in Northern Ireland which he'd
actually personally observed

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:35.070
kind of omitting or overlooking at least
you know really the the central element

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.080
in the Northern Irish conflict which was
British involvement in Northern Ireland.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.620
There's one other thing we need to highlight in this debate about religious violence:

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.120
The number of conflicts that
haven't involved religion at all.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.420
If you ask the question, "Who has killed more people in the last hundred years, Muslims

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.620
or atheists?" The answer is atheists and
it's not even close.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.980
Let's explore one the most infamous ones of our time the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, which

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.180
allegedly pits Muslims against Jews.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.160
But how true is that statement?

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.740
Jewish atheists led the Zionist movement that created the State of Israel.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.820
They argued for a Jewish nation state as a response to European anti-semitism.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.740
Meanwhile, Muslim and Christian Palestinians live under Israeli occupation

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.460
in the West Bank and Gaza and protest Israeli efforts to claim Jerusalem together.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.440
It's not hard to see how Israel's
displacement of and occupation over

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.980
the indigenous Palestinian population rather than the differences of faith

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.020
are the sources of the strife.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.540
And here's what Hitchens said shortly before his death in 2011

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:35.380
on the conflict.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.460
Because of the divine promises made about this territory,

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.100
there will never be peace, they
will not be compromise,

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.060
there will instead be misery.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.140
I think that religious ideas are often used to legitimize violence.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.560
I think often a more useful
framework for thinking about, you know,

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.280
the sources of conflict is nationalism.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.538
There's one more example than New Atheists often use

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.060
to make their anti religion points: ISIS.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.860
Isis is the militant group
that took over parts of Iraq and Syria,

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.770
spreading its violent messianic version
of the Islamic faith.

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.740
The group killed all who stood in its
path,

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.743
whether they were Sunni, Shia, Christian or otherwise.

00:07:09.743 --> 00:07:13.890
Isis is behaving in a way that is sanctioned by a literal

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.080
reading of the Quran and the hadith.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.030
But Isis and Islam may not be as closely

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.320
aligned as Harris presents.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.180
I can't think of a better illustration of this than

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.720
the two young men, they were from
Birmingham, and they went to join the

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.490
Islamic State. And they quite literally
bought a copy of Islam For Dummies from

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.320
Amazon before they left.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.480
ISIS' creation is a side effect of the

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.830
2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, which created a
political and security vacuum that

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.100
allowed such groups to flourish.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.680
According to Savage, it's pretty common for people

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.400
to look at conflicts and tie them to some ancient disagreement,

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.016
instead of Western military involvement, which actually creates those modern conflicts.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.540
New Atheists emerged
after the September 11th, 2001 attacks in

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.158
the United States and have consistently
attacked Islam.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.760
I regard Islam as one of  the great evils in the world

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.760
The idea that Islam is inherently violent

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:09.820
is a really widespread idea that's not just
limited to the New Atheists, but they've

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:13.660
given it a particularly sharp, polemical
edge.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.060
In 2017, a Pew Research Center study

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.100
found that 41% of US adults

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.259
believe that, "Islam encourages violence more than

00:08:20.259 --> 00:08:21.140
other faiths."

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.960
Half also thought Islam was not a part of mainstream

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.902
American society, with 44% saying

00:08:25.902 --> 00:08:28.600
that Islam and democracy are incompatible.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.380
But many New Atheists consider themselves

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.740
true liberals or guardians of liberal values

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.760
In fact, 69% of the atheists in the U.S. lean Democrat and are more likely to

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.140
hold liberal values. Yet, the New Atheist
views are illiberal.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.680
And that's why Sam Harris and others believe

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.760
there's a crisis of liberalism because much of the

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.560
left in the U.S. would criticize them.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.700
What we're seeing on the left is a kind

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.160
of censoriousness and

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.780
really

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.600
kind of an authoritarian moment.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.640
The New Atheists' ridicule of Islam has made them allies of the

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.740
neoconservative right.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:07.500
The New Atheist affinities for the right and for the neo-cons in particular

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.740
are really quite explicit.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.880
There are a lot of people who are followers of New Atheism

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:18.880
that don't entirely realize that, you know, the
politics of it are often rooted largely

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.560
on the right and might be appalled.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.040
So, why is it so important to examine the New Atheists ideas?

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.160
Well, these guys are an influential bunch.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.000
They've had books on the New York Times bestsellers list

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.360
and they've had large platforms to broadcast their ideas.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.880
It's because the
New Atheists' abrasive approach to

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.269
religion is seen as driving a wedge
between religious folks and non

00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:39.620
believing ones, instead of finding common ground.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.019
So, when influential people like

00:09:41.019 --> 00:09:45.040
Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins make
statements like, "Islam is the mother lode

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:45.920
of bad ideas"

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.640
or "I regard Islam as one of the great evils in the world,"

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.100
Does that make bigotry more acceptable in our society?

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.560
I don't think there's any way to

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.480
kind of answer this in theory

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.660
that belief in God either does or doesn't produce violence.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.000
It all depends on the context.
