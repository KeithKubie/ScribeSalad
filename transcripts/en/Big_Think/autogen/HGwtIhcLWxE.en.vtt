phenomenon I think is sort of three

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:08.219
phenomenon I think is sort of three
 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:11.449

parts good one part bad maybe I mean the

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:11.459
parts good one part bad maybe I mean the
 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:14.150
parts good one part bad maybe I mean the
bad part is simply that the American

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160
bad part is simply that the American
 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.269

culture of celebrity was inevitably

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279
culture of celebrity was inevitably
 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.730

gonna hit architecture and and have its

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740
gonna hit architecture and and have its
 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.970
gonna hit architecture and and have its
way with it and so we're I think have

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980
way with it and so we're I think have
 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.250
way with it and so we're I think have
taken at least some architects and made

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260
taken at least some architects and made
 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.680
taken at least some architects and made
them into celebrities about whom we owe

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690
them into celebrities about whom we owe
 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.680

work and think about it thoughtfully but

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420
work and think about it thoughtfully but
 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.540
work and think about it thoughtfully but
that's a risk in art in music and

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550
that's a risk in art in music and
 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.090
that's a risk in art in music and
literature it happens everywhere to some

literature it happens everywhere to some
 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.620
literature it happens everywhere to some
extent the good side of this all is that

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630
extent the good side of this all is that
 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.080
extent the good side of this all is that
it there is a far greater interest in

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090
it there is a far greater interest in
 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.790
it there is a far greater interest in
architecture today than there has been

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800
architecture today than there has been
 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.380

at any time I think in our lifetimes
 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.770
at any time I think in our lifetimes
really you know architecture is now part

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780
really you know architecture is now part
 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.319
really you know architecture is now part
of a general cultural dialogue what I

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329
of a general cultural dialogue what I

was starting my career it wasn't you

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420
was starting my career it wasn't you
 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.429
was starting my career it wasn't you
know it was kind of this little thing

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439
know it was kind of this little thing
 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.139
know it was kind of this little thing
off to the side even though it

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149
off to the side even though it
 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.969
off to the side even though it
influenced everybody everybody dealt

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979
influenced everybody everybody dealt
 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.199
influenced everybody everybody dealt
with architecture every day of their

00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:09.209
with architecture every day of their
 

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:10.849
with architecture every day of their
lives people didn't pay that much

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:10.859
lives people didn't pay that much
 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:12.679
lives people didn't pay that much
attention to it generally and didn't

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689
attention to it generally and didn't
 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.389
attention to it generally and didn't
think of it as something that influenced

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399
think of it as something that influenced
 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.389
think of it as something that influenced
their daily lives and so they would

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399
their daily lives and so they would
 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:19.249
their daily lives and so they would
maybe talk about music they would talk

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259
maybe talk about music they would talk
 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.499
maybe talk about music they would talk
about art they talk about books but

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509
about art they talk about books but
 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.199
about art they talk about books but
architecture wasn't on that radar screen

00:01:24.199 --> 00:01:24.209
architecture wasn't on that radar screen
 

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.449
architecture wasn't on that radar screen
with the others now it is in a very

00:01:26.449 --> 00:01:26.459
with the others now it is in a very
 

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:29.660
with the others now it is in a very
different way and so inevitably that's

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670
different way and so inevitably that's
 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.719
different way and so inevitably that's
going to create more interest in more

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729
going to create more interest in more
 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.160
going to create more interest in more
buildings that will get people engaged

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170
buildings that will get people engaged
 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.980
buildings that will get people engaged
and excited and so the more people see

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990
and excited and so the more people see
 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.789
and excited and so the more people see
of buildings that arouse their passions

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799
of buildings that arouse their passions
 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.919
of buildings that arouse their passions
whether positively or negatively the

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929
whether positively or negatively the
 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.589
whether positively or negatively the
more they kind of want more and because

00:01:45.589 --> 00:01:45.599
more they kind of want more and because
 

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:47.599
more they kind of want more and because
we are a more visual culture than we

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:47.609
we are a more visual culture than we
 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:49.940
we are a more visual culture than we
used to be which i think is also

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950
used to be which i think is also
 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.949
used to be which i think is also
basically good or more good than not

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:51.959
basically good or more good than not
 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:57.249
basically good or more good than not
good we're doing more to accentuate that

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259
good we're doing more to accentuate that
 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.539
good we're doing more to accentuate that
so of course you know the art museum

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549
so of course you know the art museum
 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.550
so of course you know the art museum
it's not an original observation to say

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560
it's not an original observation to say
 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.929
it's not an original observation to say
that the art museum is kind of the

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939
that the art museum is kind of the
 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.169
that the art museum is kind of the
secular cathedral of our time and in in

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179
secular cathedral of our time and in in
 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.780

so many cities now the art museum is the

so many cities now the art museum is the
 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.790
so many cities now the art museum is the
physical symbol of the

physical symbol of the
 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.190
physical symbol of the
the statement this community is making

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200
the statement this community is making
 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.050
the statement this community is making
to the world that it has a certain kind

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060
to the world that it has a certain kind
 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.340
to the world that it has a certain kind
of stature in the very same way that

once building a cathedral was that

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620
once building a cathedral was that
 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.670
once building a cathedral was that
statement to the world and even if the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680
statement to the world and even if the
 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.350
statement to the world and even if the
art museum isn't the tallest thing in

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360
art museum isn't the tallest thing in
 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.560
art museum isn't the tallest thing in
town it's often now the most important

the building over which the most care

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300
the building over which the most care
 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.180
the building over which the most care
has been lavished the most attention the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190
has been lavished the most attention the
 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.630
has been lavished the most attention the
most time the most money and so you know

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640
most time the most money and so you know
 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.750

all that is is mostly to the good but in

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760
all that is is mostly to the good but in
 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.660
all that is is mostly to the good but in
life you know an architecture as in life

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670
life you know an architecture as in life

lunch we pay a price for that but it's

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850
lunch we pay a price for that but it's
 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.420
lunch we pay a price for that but it's
still mostly a positive thing

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430
 
 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.270
 
I think inevitably you would have to say

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280

Frank Gehry has had the most profound
effect because he's the architect who

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.369
way within that world and popular
culture and there are very few examples

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379
culture and there are very few examples
 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.460

in history of an architect being that
