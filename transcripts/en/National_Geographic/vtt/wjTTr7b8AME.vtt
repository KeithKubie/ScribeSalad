00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:01.800
[music playing]

00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:07.967
CUTTER HODIERNE: It's not
possible to get a Western film

00:00:07.967 --> 00:00:10.834
crew into Iran at the moment.

00:00:10.834 --> 00:00:12.767
So I've asked a local
journalist called

00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:15.100
Afsin to search on my behalf.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.333
[non-english speech]

00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:23.633
I'm hoping someone will
recognize the victim's boat,

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:25.600
or better still, their faces.

00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:43.266
CUTTER HODIERNE: This is a
potential lead, an Iranian boat

00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:46.266
that disappeared off
the coast of Somalia

00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:48.100
in the same timeframe
as the video.

00:02:33.934 --> 00:02:36.367
CUTTER HODIERNE: There's only
a handful of Iranian boatyards

00:02:36.367 --> 00:02:41.133
that use fiberglass and
wood to make their dhows.

00:02:41.133 --> 00:02:44.166
And one of them is
based in Konarak,

00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:47.100
a fishing port that
acts as Iran's gateway

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.867
to the Indian Ocean.

00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:51.166
If the victim's
boat is from Iran,

00:02:51.166 --> 00:02:52.867
it may have been built here.
