00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.900
Well, after a film as nineties as 'A Goofy Movie',

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.320
we can go even MORE nineties-ies-er...

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.080
with An Extremely Goofy Movie!

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.900
Yup, because everything in the nineties was EXTREME!

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.500
...Actually I'm surprised I didn't spell this with an 'X', because...

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.100
...well, we'll get to that in a minute.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.400
In a sense this is exactly what I think of when I hear "Direct-to-DVD sequels",

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.060
or, at least... what I thought they were gonna be before they started doing the big popular movies.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.400
'Goofy Movie' was... a modest success, and it did pretty well on VHS,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.180
so it kind of figured to do a direct-to-DVD movie

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.020
- that's just kinda what they did back then.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.720
Aand honestly you get what you'd expect a movie like this would offer.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.180
It opens with Max and his friends getting ready to go off to college.

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.179
Goofy once again is having a hard time, as a loving parent, letting go of his kid.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.200
To its credit, while it is cramming a lot of the 'cool stuff' at the time in your face,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.060
it does take some time to... aactually be a little emotionally considerate.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.100
But things go south when Goofy is fired from his job and has to find another one.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.930
He's told that the majority of jobs require college degrees nowadays...

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.380
...soo enter exactly what ya think is gonna happen:

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.460
Goofy goes to college with Max.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.880
...Aaand enter pretty much every other thing you think is gonna happen:

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:22.639
Max enters a competitive sport,

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:24.259
there's a bully that makes fun of him,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.320
they're preppy cheaters who make fun of the fact that his father is there,

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.900
who of course makes things worse...

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.969
Max is embarrassed, their relationship is pulled apart again...

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.460
...and of course it ends with some sort of big sports event.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.819
...Oh, did I say "some sort of event", like I forgot what it was?

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:40.879
No no! I remember, you couldn't forget for the life of you!

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.360
It's the 'X Games'!

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.400
Because they pound it. The hell. Into you.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.800
It's beyond obvious that Disney owns ESPN, because they plaster that everywhere, too!

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.360
Max's whole goal in this thing is to enter the X Games, and win it.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.700
It's so weird to see that logo without some sort of parody or satire in there!

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.640
But no! It's all just one obvious commercial!

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.700
It's... really weird.

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:06.739
So, okay. The story is about as recycled as it can get.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.820
Is there anything good in it?

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.460
Nyyeah, there's a couple things.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.180
Like I said, there's one or two emotional moments, that are... brief, but effective.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.800
I feel like the animation is trying to be funnier than it's allowed.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.840
Like the bully character: he's animated funny, he's voiced by a funny voice actor...

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.080
...but he's just not given any dialog or scenes that are very funny.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.960
But at the same time: look at him!

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.260
You kinda wanna laugh at him a little bit.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.800
Goofy also starts a bit of a romance with this librarian who's also a little quirky and awkward,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.500
and again, look at how she's animated - you do kinda wanna laugh at her...

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.380
...But the key word is "want".

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.300
As in, they "want" you to laugh, they want to get a reaction out of you...

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.609
...but there's just not that much substance there.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.380
Some scenes I don't even get!...

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.540
Like, Max and the bullies are in this beatnik coffee house, which...

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.580
...do those even exist anymore...?

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.520
I mean I know there's coffee houses but... come on, these people look like they're outta the 50s, not the 90s.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.100
And they all start snapping.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.480
That... for some reason scares the bullies away!

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.760
I don't get it!

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.780
This whole movie feels like a really good joke being set up, but...

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.280
...for whatever reason we never quite get the punchline.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.880
It kinda holds back and never becomes anything,

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.720
and just sorta falls into that mesh of typical college movies, except now for kids.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.660
Hell, did this inspire 'Monsters U'?

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.140
Oh, I'm so thankful for that...!

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.240
I don't think these are as entertaining as Disney thinks they are.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.640
It just kinda feels like opportunities that are never fully taken advantage of.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.700
...And speaking of which, I'm just gonna say it:

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.100
I miss Roxanne!

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.860
...I mean, I know, high school, going to different colleges, puppy love, separation, all that stuff, but...

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.540
I'm sorry!

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.000
They were a really cute couple!

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.480
Couldn't the movie have been about that, maybe about them breaking up, or

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.980
deciding whether or not they want to stay together or going to different schools...

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.160
You know, actual interesting stuff?

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.060
Stuff that some kids may need to know when going to college?

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.820
But nope!

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.960
It's all about being the sports star and trying not to be embarrassed by your 'wacky parents'!

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.540
*sigh...* ...I'd see this only if you're a die-hard Goof Troop fan, or...

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.140
...I don't know, an example of a movie TRYING to save itself, despite a bad script...

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.240
But, if none of that interests you, it's exactly what you think a direct-to-DVD movie's gonna be.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.000
Take it for what it's worth and see 'The X Games' yourself.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.920
--I mean 'An Extremely Goofy Movie' yourself.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.180
...Gah, stupid tie-in...!
