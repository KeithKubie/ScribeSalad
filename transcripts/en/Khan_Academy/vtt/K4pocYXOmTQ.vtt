00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.820
Ten of us have been abducted by
aliens because they view us

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.500
as being representative
of the human race.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.690
And what they're going to do is
they're going to test us to

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.910
see if the human race is
worthy of joining the

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.280
intergalactic council
of planets.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.180
And if we're not, they're going
to kill us all and and

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.090
turn Earth into a mushroom
farm, because

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.720
that's their oil.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.200
So they take us together in
their spaceship and they say,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.870
you ten represent all of
humanity, and the fate of

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.090
humanity rests in your hands.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.320
And we'll give you a test.
And the test is tomorrow.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.820
24 hours from right now, we're
going to put you all in a

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.640
completely dark room,
and line you all up

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.720
one behind the other.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.960
So if this is one guy-- let me
see if I can draw-- so if this

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.370
is the guy in the front.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.070
He's looking a little worried.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.710
Someone described me as the
Bob Ross of mathematics.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.300
So I'll attempt to do a little
Bob Ross work right here.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.530
So this would be the
first of us.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.100
He has a business tie
on, and whatever.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.200
He's facing in this direction.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.460
And then there's ten
more of them.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.890
So instead of redrawing them,
let me just copy and paste it.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.580
We all look mysteriously
similar to each other.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.290
That's the second one.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.400
And the third one.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.690
There's ten of us like this.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.940
I'll do one more.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.160
Oh that's good enough.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.530
There's ten of us, and we're
essentially lined up front to

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.560
back, so that this guy, all
he sees is the back

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.360
of this guy's head.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.380
And he can also see the back
of this guy's head.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.530
Maybe there's a slight
incline, maybe the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.070
floor is like this.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.960
Let me see if I can draw it.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.880
The floor is at a slight
tilt, so one guy is

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.370
standing right here.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.030
Another guy is standing
right here.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.170
Another guy's standing
right here.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.660
There's ten of us in a line.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.130
We're all facing in
that direction.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.050
All this guy right here
can see is the wall.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.780
This guy can see the two
guys in front of him.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.260
This guy can see the one
guy in front of him.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.920
There's ten of them.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.810
It goes all the way
back to ten

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:02.830
So what they tell us
is we're going to

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:03.950
line you up like this.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.900
They even draw a nice diagram
like this, because they want

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.900
to give us a fair chance of
preventing Earth from turning

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.080
into a mushroom farm.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.700
And they say, while the room
is completely pitch dark,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.040
we're going to place a hat
on each of your heads.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.960
And the hat will either
be mauve-- so this

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.450
would be a mauve hat.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.260
Or they'll be green.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.970
So they either get a mauve
or a green hat on the

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:36.720
back of your head.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.230
And the hat will be designed
in such a way, it

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.210
won't have a big rim.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.800
So that you can't look
up and see your hat.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.000
This is alien technology, so it
is completely impossible to

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.740
see the hat on your own head.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.040
And the distribution of the
hats will be random.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.570
It could be all green hats.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.690
It could be all-- well, I'll say
purple-- because I'm not

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.720
quite sure how to
pronounce mauve.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.500
So it could be all purple hats,
it could be half purple,

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.050
half green.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.900
It could be nine green
and one purple.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:03.410
They don't know.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.000
It could be any combination
of hats.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.760
And what they're going to do--
and they tell us all of this--

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.520
is that they're going to start
with the person in the back.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:17.790
So this is the front wall,
this is the floor.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.960
This is the first guy right
here, second guy, third guy,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.400
fourth guy, fifth guy, sixth
guy, seven, eight, nine.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.270
So there's the tenth guy.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.200
They're all faced in
that direction.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.170
They're going to start with
this guy right here.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.460
And say, what color is
the hat on your head?

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:43.550
And he'll answer, either
purple or green.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:44.790
He can only say purple
or green.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.770
I have to be exact here.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.720
He can only say purple
or green.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.120
And he can say it as
loud as he wants.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.940
But he has to say it at an even
tone, so that not more

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.060
information can be conveyed,
other than the fact that he

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.410
thinks his hat is
purple or green.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.780
Although this guy is close
enough that he can hear it.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.030
Everyone's going to hear what
everyone's going to say.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.540
But there's no intonation.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.330
And if you're right, if you say,
my hat is purple and you

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.750
are wearing a purple
hat, you will live.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.410
And the 600 million
people that you

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.339
represent will also live.

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:18.709
And where they live
will not be turned

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.339
into a mushroom farm.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:26.560
And if you're wrong, then they
will immediately-- what is

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.720
that Star Trek weapon?

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.610
Displace you.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.920
And they'll also do it to all
the people you represent.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.970
And turn all of their land
into mushroom farms. So

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.140
there's this huge incentive
to try to get this right.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.240
So they say, we're going
to do this tomorrow.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.940
And your goal, obviously, is to
try to save as many lives

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:45.940
as you can.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.390
And so we're going to put you
in a room, and you guys can

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.880
discuss this for the next 24
hours, to come up with a

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.470
system so that when we put you
in the dark room and we put

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.265
the hats on each
of your heads.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.890
I shouldn't be drawing
brown hats.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.730
We'll put the hats
on your head.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:05.670
And then turn on the lights.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:06.860
I forgot to tell you that.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.430
They're going to put us in a
dark room, you can't see

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.970
anything, we're all lined up.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.570
Then they're going to
turn on the lights.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.640
And so then they'll ask this
guy, what color is

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.300
the hat on your head?

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.240
He obviously can't look at his
own head, but he'll see

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.030
everyone else's hats.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.890
And likewise this guy, he can't
see his own hat, and he

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.320
can't see the guy behind him.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.720
But he'll hear what this guy
says, and he can see all of

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.740
the hats in front of him.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.015
So they'll turn on the lights,
and then after this guy-- if

00:05:31.015 --> 00:05:33.700
he's right he lives, if he's
wrong he'll be displaced.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.170
And then they'll go
to the next guy.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.950
And then ask him.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.300
If he's right he lives,
and all the people

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.230
he represents lives.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.800
If he's wrong he also
will get displaced.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.150
And they'll keep going all the
way up to the first guy.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.310
So our goal to essentially save
civilization, or at least

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.750
human civilization, is to come
up with a system to save as

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.900
many of us as possible.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.340
So that's the first take
of the brain teaser.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.690
So if you want to kind of
pause it right here.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.790
And actually before you pause
it, let me just clarify.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.650
All you can say is either
purple or green.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:11.600
No intonations.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.060
You can't say "pur-puuul" or
"purp-l" to kind of convey any

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.220
type of information.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.830
All you can say is
purple or green.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.890
Or pronounce it in
some weird way.

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:24.780
And there's no weird trick where
you can kind of look

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.770
with the side of your eyes
or anything like this.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.850
You have to do it completely
based on what you hear and

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:32.750
what you say.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.260
And if the aliens catch
any hint of you

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.570
guys trying to cheat.

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:38.350
Or all of us.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.570
I'm one of us.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.690
To cheat this, they'll just
evaporate everything and turn

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.950
everything into mushroom
farms.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.580
So that's the problem
statement.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.940
How do you save as many
people as possible?

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.800
And if you want to pause now,
feel free to do so.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.850
And now I'll give you kind of
a small hint, because this

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.100
doesn't help you.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.070
It's easy to think of a lot of
solutions that might save a

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.580
couple of people.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.370
But there's actually a solution
that will guarantee

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.410
saving nine people.

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.160
So that's the solution that
you have to come up with.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.490
And for the rest of this video
I'm just going to keep giving

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.140
hints, and then eventually
give you the solution.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:18.770
So the goal is actually really
to save nine people.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.840
And you can which nine people
it's going to be.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.090
And so once again, pause it if
you don't want any more hints.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.630
It's going to be these
nine people.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.570
These nine people are guaranteed
to be saved.

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.720
And this guy obviously is just
going to be guessing.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.590
He is the first guy to be asked
what color his hat is.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:35.790
He has no information.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.620
He can see the people in front
of him, but he has absolutely

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.390
no information as to what
color this hat is.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:41.310
So he just guesses.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:45.520
So there's a 50% chance
that he's right.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.700
Without any other information,
we assume that there's a 50-50

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.970
chance that the hat on the
top of your head is a

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:53.480
purple or a green one.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.650
So your expected number of
people you're going to save is

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.470
nine and a half.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:58.600
With the system.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:05.400
So these people are guaranteed
to be saved.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.100
And so, there's a couple
of things that are more

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.760
probabilistic that don't
quite get you there.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.630
That might come to
mind immediately.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.140
And once again, stop
this video.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.660
Because it's fun to think
of these yourself.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:22.180
But this guy might just see,
OK how many green hats are

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.630
there, and how many purple
hats are there?

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.500
And then whichever there are
more of, he might say, oh my

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.960
hat is-- let's say there's six
purple and three green in

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.740
front of him-- he might
say my hat is purple.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.620
And he's either right
or wrong, and

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:37.740
he might get displaced.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.700
But at least he'll have conveyed
that information to

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.480
the rest of the group.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.159
That hey, the majority of the
hats are purple, so you're

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:47.030
better off guessing purple than
green, and it'll save at

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.330
least six of these
people because

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:49.630
they'll all guess purple.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:53.000
And that's OK, and in this
situation you're guaranteed to

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.320
save more than half of these
nine people, so you're

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.490
guaranteed to save at least
five of these nine people.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:08:59.880
And then probablistically
maybe you can get

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.360
up to seven or eight.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.620
Then there's the other method.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.055
Well, there's a ton of them.

00:09:09.055 --> 00:09:10.040
I don't go into them because
I realize I don't

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:10.860
have a lot of time.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.820
So here is the real
deal solution.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.900
So really pause it and wait and
watch it tomorrow, unless

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.390
you don't want the solution.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:24.510
The guy in the back,
what he does.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.670
So there are a bunch
of people.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:31.610
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven,

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.220
eight, nine, ten people.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.780
And they're all wearing hats.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.590
And remember, we have 24 hours
to come up with a system.

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:40.870
So everyone has the system.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.100
And we don't know who's going
to be in what order also.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:43.770
That's the other thing.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:47.500
But that actually doesn't help
or hurt you much anyway.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:52.320
So the guy in the back, what
he does is he counts the

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:58.280
number of green or
purple hats.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.770
Right?

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:01.560
This is the system we've
come up with.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.300
And so this is true of whoever's
in the back.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.960
Whoever's in the back has
to do this, right?

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:13.810
So if he counts that the number
of green-- let's say

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:15.460
this is our system.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:18.080
He counts the green
actually only.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.270
So count the green.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:22.050
And he determines that
the number of

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:26.650
green is an odd number.

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:29.840
If he determines that the number
of green that he sees

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.600
in front of him is an odd
number, then he is

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.065
going to say green.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:41.690
For the guess on the
top of his head.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:49.190
If the number of green is
an even number, he's

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:52.000
going to say purple.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.500
And of course, he doesn't know
what his hat color is, but at

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.190
least, well, one,
he has a 50-50

00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.530
chance of saving himself.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:02.100
But now, what happens?

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.260
Now, by giving this information
to the rest of the

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.520
group, by screaming
green or purple.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.790
If this guy screams,
my hat is green!

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:15.690
Then this guy, who's the next
guy in line, the next guy to

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:20.370
be quizzed, knows that the
person behind him saw an odd

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:21.805
number of green hats.

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.890
Now this is interesting.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:32.030
If he counts the number of green
in front of him, and he

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:37.160
also sees an odd number of green
hats, then that means

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.020
that he was not one of the green
hats that this guy saw.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:45.210
So he must be a purple hat.

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:47.840
So he'll just say, I
have a purple hat.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.390
And he will live.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.050
Right?

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:53.210
And then you'll go
to this guy.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:55.300
And let's go the other
situation.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.560
Let's say that this guy,
he screamed green.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.180
Which means that he saw
an odd number of green

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.000
hats in front of him.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.160
If this guy counts the green
hats of the eight people in

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.010
front of him, and he says wow,
there's only an even number of

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:12.000
green hats, he could say, wow
I must have a green hat.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.950
And so then he'll say green.

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.200
And then he'll be right.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:22.645
Likewise, this guy-- let's say
it's the first situation that

00:12:22.645 --> 00:12:25.030
I said, this guy has
a purple hat on.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.810
So this guy saw an odd
number of green hats.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:29.640
He screamed green.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.010
And so this guy, he also sees
an odd number of green hats,

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.000
because he's not one
of the green hats.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.190
So he says purple, he lives.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:44.290
This guy all of a sudden,
because this guy said purple.

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:45.140
And he lived.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.760
I mean, you didn't
hear any buzzer.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.360
Actually you know he's going
to live, because

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.820
the system will work.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:56.080
He knows that there must be an
odd number of green hats from

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.410
him down forward, right?

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.700
Because this guy didn't
say green.

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:03.190
So if he knows that there's an
odd number of green hats from

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:07.770
him down forward, and if he sees
an even number of green

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:11.800
hats, he knows that he must be
one of the green hats, so

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.250
he'll say green.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:18.030
And in that situation, if this
guy screamed green then that

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:23.460
means that if this guy saw an
odd number of green hats from

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:28.860
here on down, and one of these
guys behind him, or every time

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:33.010
someone behind you says green
after that, then the number of

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:40.270
green hats that are odd or even
in front of that person

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:41.250
will change.

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.410
And so they have to keep track
of that in their minds to

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:46.820
figure out if the hats in front
of them are going to be

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:47.430
green or purple.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:48.900
Actually let me give an
example because that's

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:49.840
probably the easiest way.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:56.120
So there's one, two-- Actually
let me just do it in a neutral

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.200
color so I don't waste time.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.770
So let's say the hats are green,
purple, purple, green,

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:05.020
green, purple, green, green.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:05.440
How many is that?

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:12.540
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.280
So you go to the first
guy right here.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.210
And so he counts.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:18.660
He says, OK, how many
greens are there?

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:23.270
There's one, two, three,
four, five.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:24.950
There are five greens.

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:28.590
So the greens are odd.

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:31.830
Which says that he is
going to say green.

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.000
That's the system we've
come up with.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.650
So when they go up to this
guy, he says green.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:36.510
And he's wrong.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:39.530
So he actually gets
eliminated.

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:41.870
And maybe the aliens were
willing to give us a pass on

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:44.070
the first guy, but let's
say he gets eliminated.

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:48.750
But he said green, so then this
guy on down knows that in

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.960
front of that guy there was an
odd number of green hats.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.680
Now, this guy, he looks forward
and he counts one,

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.800
two, three, four,
five green hats.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.040
So he also sees an odd number
of green hats, so he knows

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.070
that he must not have a green
hat, because if he had a green

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.750
hat, then it would turn the
number of green hats that he

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:09.760
saw into even.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.360
So he doesn't have
a green hat.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.400
He says, I have a purple hat.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.650
And he lives.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.600
Now this guy, he counts
the number of green

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.470
hats in front of him.

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:25.230
One, two, three, four
green hats.

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:28.910
He says, well gee, I only see an
even number of green hats.

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:32.850
Up until this guy, he saw an
odd number of green hats.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:34.360
I must be a green hat.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.150
So he says green.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:37.740
Check.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.030
Now this guy's turn.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:44.400
So first of all, he knows how
many green hats this guy saw.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.240
He knows that this guy saw
exactly four green hats.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.950
Because if this guy had seen
five green hats, he would have

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:51.910
said purple.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.810
So this guy knows that this
guy saw four green hats.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:58.590
But he sees only one, two,
three green hats.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:59.220
Right?

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:03.160
So he knows that he must be
one of the green hats.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.710
So he screams green.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:06.530
So check.

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.770
So then this guy knows, wow
there must be only three green

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:11.560
hats from him on down.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.430
Because this guy must have
seen three green hats.

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:15.480
If he saw four, he would
have said purple.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:19.050
So that guy uses that same logic
to say OK, there must be

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:21.140
three green hats from
me on down.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.080
I see three green hats, so I
must not have one of them.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.220
I must be purple.

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.820
And you just keep on going
down all the way until

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.110
everyone answers correctly.

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:31.850
And you save at least
nine people.

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:33.340
And the bulk of humanity.

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.890
And if you gave a pass
on the first guy,

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:37.880
you save all of humanity.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.520
Anyway, I hope you found
that one enjoyable.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.760
This is one of my favorite
brain teasers.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.030
And I apologize because I
realize when I was trying to

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:48.060
explain it without the example,
it might have gotten

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:48.740
a little confusing.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:52.130
But hopefully this example
explains things

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:52.890
a little bit better.

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:55.410
Although it might be confusing
to see green and purple

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:56.480
written in blue.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.200
See you in the next video.
