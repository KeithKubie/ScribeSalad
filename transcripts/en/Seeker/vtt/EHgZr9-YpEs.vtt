00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.330
Man, I’m so tired.

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.910
Should I drink some coffee, or take a nap?

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.740
Why not both?

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.219
Hi guys, Catie Wayne here for DNews and there
are few things in life that I appreciate more,

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:16.360
than a good nap.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.590
Research shows that a short 20 to 30 minute
nap can improve alertness, memory, boost productivity

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.840
and all kinds of good stuff.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.270
But, research also shows that if you drink
a cup of coffee before your snooze, the quality

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.900
of your nap will improve drastically.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.720
I know, this feels like a trick, but hang
in there.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.410
We’re taught not to consume caffeine before
sleep and with good reason.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.640
Caffeine is disruptive for long periods of
sleep and makes the quality of that sleep

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.640
less than stellar.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.190
But a nap is a whole other situation!

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.960
It works like this: when you’re awake a
chemical compound called adenosine (uh-den-uh-seen)

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.610
is produced to make you sleepy.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.940
Throughout the day, your adenosine levels
rise higher and higher and reach a peak in

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.830
the evening, when most people fall asleep.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.590
While asleep, your body will break down adenosine
and then when you wake up in the morning feeling

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.790
refreshed and then wash rinse repeat.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.280
Meanwhile, the effects of caffeine reach their
peak at around 30 minutes.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.259
So the idea is that if you, very quickly drink
a good amount of coffee and immediately take

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.820
a 20 minute nap, you will wake up just when
the caffeine is kicking in and the drug will

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.310
have much less adenosine to compete with because
some of it dissipated during your power nap.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.740
You should try to drink the coffee as quickly
as you can so you can sleep while it’s going

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.109
through your gastrointestinal tract and into
your bloodstream.

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:23.509
20 minutes or so is the perfect amount of
time because longer naps lead to deeper stages

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.490
of sleep that can be difficult for your brain
to recover from.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.840
Short naps don’t do that, but still naturally
clears away some of that pesky adenosine.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.189
Tea drinkers like myself might be wondering
about other forms of caffeine.

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.000
You could technically consume some other form
of caffeine but because there is significantly

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.210
less caffeine in tea or soda than there is
in coffee, you’d have to drink a lot more

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.109
of it to feel the same effects.

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:45.109
Damn.

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:48.460
Caffeine pills are an option, but because
the capsule has to be broken down before the

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.229
caffeine can even begin to be absorbed into
the bloodstream it takes about an hour for

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.420
the effects to be felt.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.390
So be sure to take that into account when
planning for a coffee nap.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.759
Of course, nothing is quite as effective for
combating tiredness than a good nights sleep.

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.060
How do you feel about naps?

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.539
Do you take them, or do you prefer to just
power through your sleepiness?

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:06.539
Lemme know in them comments.

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.930
Thanks for joining me on DNews, and I’ll
see you next time.
