Boyd:
Hi, my name's Ryan Boyd

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.334
and this is
Jonathan Terleski.

00:00:05.334 --> 00:00:08.234
I am an engineer in our
developer relations group

00:00:08.234 --> 00:00:10.667
working on OpenSocial
and Google Friend Connect,

00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:12.801
and Jonathan
is the lead designer

00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:14.767
on Google Friend Connect.

00:00:14.767 --> 00:00:17.634
We're here today to talk
about Friend Connect Gadgets,

00:00:17.634 --> 00:00:21.200
both design and implementation
of the code.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.300
And if you have
any questions that come up

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.133
during the talk,

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:27.601
feel free to submit them
to the URL that you see

00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:28.767
at the bottom there.

00:00:28.767 --> 00:00:32.868
It's
tinyurl.com/gfc-questions.

00:00:32.868 --> 00:00:34.767
And that's Google Moderator,

00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:36.400
and we'll go
through those questions

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.133
at the end of the session.

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.868
At that time,
you also have the option

00:00:39.868 --> 00:00:42.734
to come up to the microphone
and ask any additional questions

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:48.400
in person
if that's what you prefer.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.267
Okay, so getting a little bit
into the agenda

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:52.801
and how we're gonna
spend our time here today.

00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:58.334
But first,
why are you all here?

00:00:58.334 --> 00:01:02.133
There are 5 million sites
around this world

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.067
which have Google
Friend Connect on them.

00:01:04.067 --> 00:01:06.567
This is everything from
traditional content sites,

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:09.834
to big, major web sites,
to blogs.

00:01:09.834 --> 00:01:12.767
So keep that in mind--
there's this huge audience

00:01:12.767 --> 00:01:17.334
for any gadgets that you develop
for Google Friend Connect.

00:01:17.334 --> 00:01:20.267
Those sites are also
very quickly growing.

00:01:20.267 --> 00:01:24.400
100,000 new people join
those sites every single day.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.868
So not only is your audience
pretty huge,

00:01:26.868 --> 00:01:30.400
but it's growing as well.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.901
So here's the agenda.

00:01:31.901 --> 00:01:33.767
We're gonna start off with
a little bit of an introduction

00:01:33.767 --> 00:01:35.167
to Friend Connect

00:01:35.167 --> 00:01:37.367
for those of you that aren't
very familiar with it.

00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:39.534
And then we're gonna go into
some of the things

00:01:39.534 --> 00:01:41.701
around design
and who you're building for

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:43.667
and what types
of things to build.

00:01:43.667 --> 00:01:46.234
And then we're gonna go back
and talk a little bit

00:01:46.234 --> 00:01:49.000
about the code
and the differences between

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.934
building Google
Friend Connect gadgets

00:01:50.934 --> 00:01:53.100
and building gadgets
for other platforms.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.968
And lastly,
we're gonna end up

00:01:54.968 --> 00:01:58.767
with the question and answers
that I talked about.

00:01:58.767 --> 00:02:02.501
So introduction
to Google Friend Connect.

00:02:02.501 --> 00:02:05.667
Google Friend Connect--
the reason it was created

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:08.534
was to allow you to instantly
awaken and strengthen

00:02:08.534 --> 00:02:10.367
the communities
on your site.

00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:13.234
Basically what this means
is out of the box

00:02:13.234 --> 00:02:16.834
you can take
some copy and paste code--

00:02:16.834 --> 00:02:20.367
like Vic demo-ed in the keynote
with the elements--

00:02:20.367 --> 00:02:22.834
to a little bit more advanced
copy and paste code

00:02:22.834 --> 00:02:24.400
with Google Friend Connect,

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.634
and plug that
into your web site

00:02:26.634 --> 00:02:29.200
and instantly
allow people to log in

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.467
using the identities
of their choice

00:02:31.467 --> 00:02:34.167
done through
the OpenID protocol

00:02:34.167 --> 00:02:37.033
and also bring
their friends with them

00:02:37.033 --> 00:02:40.234
from social networks
that support OpenSocial.

00:02:40.234 --> 00:02:43.934
So after they're there and
they bring their friends in,

00:02:43.934 --> 00:02:46.133
they can then interact
with other members of the site,

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:47.934
make new friendships,

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:50.868
and then send
their activities on that site

00:02:50.868 --> 00:02:54.734
else--out elsewhere
on the web.

00:02:54.734 --> 00:02:56.567
So here's a little bit
of a demonstration

00:02:56.567 --> 00:02:57.834
of Google Friend Connect.

00:02:57.834 --> 00:03:00.601
Two-minute run-through:
this is the Earth Hour web site.

00:03:00.601 --> 00:03:03.968
This was for the Earth Hour
which happened

00:03:03.968 --> 00:03:05.400
a little bit ago.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.167
The idea is everyone
shuts off their life--

00:03:07.167 --> 00:03:08.801
lights for an hour.

00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:10.334
And we visited this site.

00:03:10.334 --> 00:03:12.100
We go and say
we're gonna log in.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.267
We can choose from a number
of different providers

00:03:14.267 --> 00:03:15.601
or choose in OpenID.

00:03:15.601 --> 00:03:17.067
So since this is
Google I/O,

00:03:17.067 --> 00:03:19.434
I'm demonstrating with
my Google account here.

00:03:19.434 --> 00:03:22.434
And I'm logging in.

00:03:22.434 --> 00:03:24.267
And after I log in,

00:03:24.267 --> 00:03:25.868
you can see I'm using
my Twitter profile--

00:03:25.868 --> 00:03:27.300
the little icon
at the bottom there.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.801
But I can go here
and choose to use

00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:31.167
in the advanced options

00:03:31.167 --> 00:03:33.534
any other profile that
I've linked up to this account,

00:03:33.534 --> 00:03:35.801
which includes a variety
of social networks

00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:37.334
listed at the bottom there.

00:03:37.334 --> 00:03:39.701
I can also make
my activities on this site

00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:41.434
published elsewhere
on the web--

00:03:41.434 --> 00:03:43.467
other social networks
that support this

00:03:43.467 --> 00:03:46.200
as well as other
Google Friend Connect sites.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.734
Now you can see
a list of all the members

00:03:48.734 --> 00:03:50.734
and my friends
from those other networks

00:03:50.734 --> 00:03:53.200
and a friend request
up at the top there.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.400
I can click on
any of the people

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.167
and find more information out

00:03:57.167 --> 00:03:58.601
about their profile,

00:03:58.601 --> 00:04:00.133
what other sites
they're members of,

00:04:00.133 --> 00:04:02.868
who their friends are.

00:04:02.868 --> 00:04:04.534
And after I do that,

00:04:04.534 --> 00:04:06.634
I can go over here
and invite new people

00:04:06.634 --> 00:04:08.067
to come join the site.

00:04:08.067 --> 00:04:09.400
I can invite friends

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.434
from a variety
of different social networks--

00:04:11.434 --> 00:04:13.934
Google, Orkut, Plaxo here

00:04:13.934 --> 00:04:15.501
that I have linked up to.

00:04:15.501 --> 00:04:16.901
And I can also invite people

00:04:16.901 --> 00:04:18.968
from a number
of other different services.

00:04:18.968 --> 00:04:21.100
So we're gonna go
back here to Google

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.000
and click on
the user Canoe

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.801
and write him
a short little note.

00:04:24.801 --> 00:04:27.300
This message is customizable
by the app developer

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.067
in a more advanced
integration,

00:04:29.067 --> 00:04:31.801
but here I'm just inviting him
to join the site

00:04:31.801 --> 00:04:36.133
and come support the earth.

00:04:36.133 --> 00:04:39.133
I send the invitation

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:42.133
and go back to the site.

00:04:42.133 --> 00:04:44.267
And hopefully
he comes and joins.

00:04:44.267 --> 00:04:46.901
But now I'm going to share
my thoughts to the world

00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:48.968
and tell everyone
how much I love the earth,

00:04:48.968 --> 00:04:51.334
and they should all
participate next year

00:04:51.334 --> 00:04:53.701
in Earth Hour.

00:04:53.701 --> 00:04:57.267
Gonna do that, and then I will
hit "Post" here in a second

00:04:57.267 --> 00:05:00.501
after I type
my long-winded message.

00:05:00.501 --> 00:05:02.934
And you can see my message
is available

00:05:02.934 --> 00:05:04.400
for everyone on the site
to see.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.367
Also, if you clicked
on my profile,

00:05:07.367 --> 00:05:10.434
you can see at the bottom--
my activities,

00:05:10.434 --> 00:05:13.100
and it says that I posted
that message on this site.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.434
And not only is that viewable
on my profile here,

00:05:15.434 --> 00:05:17.801
but in all other
of the 5 million

00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:22.367
Google Friend Connect
enabled web sites.

00:05:22.367 --> 00:05:24.200
Now, this demonstration

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.000
is primarily using
an out-of-the-box integration

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.367
of Google Friend Connect.

00:05:28.367 --> 00:05:32.067
You can also do a little bit
of a deeper integration

00:05:32.067 --> 00:05:33.534
with Google Friend Connect.

00:05:33.534 --> 00:05:37.133
You notice here nothing really
looks like gadgets per se.

00:05:37.133 --> 00:05:39.300
This is the Chow Down
example web site

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.200
that you can find linked off
of code.google.com.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.300
And what it is is basically
a restaurant directory

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.000
that then I can click
on a restaurant and bookmark it,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.667
and invite my friends out.

00:05:49.667 --> 00:05:53.133
And it all uses
the REST and RPC APIs

00:05:53.133 --> 00:05:54.634
to do
that sort of integration.

00:05:54.634 --> 00:05:57.334
There's another session
tomorrow, I believe,

00:05:57.334 --> 00:06:00.100
on Google Friend Connect
and deep integration

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.167
run by Arne Roomann-Kurrik

00:06:02.167 --> 00:06:03.767
that you guys
should all go to

00:06:03.767 --> 00:06:08.200
if you're interested in that
side of Google Friend Connect.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.234
So with the deep integration,
you can integrate

00:06:11.234 --> 00:06:14.300
directly into the flows
of your application,

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.434
directly into
the existing login systems.

00:06:17.434 --> 00:06:18.834
But today we're here

00:06:18.834 --> 00:06:20.868
to talk about
Google Friend Connect gadgets.

00:06:20.868 --> 00:06:23.133
And social gadgets
with Google Friend Connect

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:26.334
basically allow you to create
some modular functionality

00:06:26.334 --> 00:06:28.567
that you can install
on your own site

00:06:28.567 --> 00:06:31.033
but can also be used

00:06:31.033 --> 00:06:33.467
by many other of those
5 million web sites

00:06:33.467 --> 00:06:36.467
around the world that have
Google Friend Connect on them.

00:06:36.467 --> 00:06:39.234
So think about ideas
about modular functionality,

00:06:39.234 --> 00:06:41.701
and Jonathan's going to
give you some frameworks

00:06:41.701 --> 00:06:43.868
for doing
that thought process soon.

00:06:43.868 --> 00:06:46.400
But first let's demonstrate
a couple gadgets here.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.467
This is a poll gadget done
by a third party developer,

00:06:49.467 --> 00:06:51.167
Alex.

00:06:51.167 --> 00:06:53.167
And basically
I'm going through here

00:06:53.167 --> 00:06:56.901
and voting on a--
what smartphone I use,

00:06:56.901 --> 00:06:59.400
and then going through
and voting

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.534
on my favorite
programming languages.

00:07:02.534 --> 00:07:05.834
And I click "Vote,"
and after I vote

00:07:05.834 --> 00:07:10.133
I can see all the different
votes that were taken.

00:07:10.133 --> 00:07:11.868
I can actually--
I don't demonstrate this here,

00:07:11.868 --> 00:07:13.234
but I can actually
click on one of those

00:07:13.234 --> 00:07:14.734
and see the pictures
of all the people

00:07:14.734 --> 00:07:16.467
that have voted for,
you know,

00:07:16.467 --> 00:07:18.133
say, Python
as their favorite language

00:07:18.133 --> 00:07:22.367
if I wanted to establish
a relationship with them.

00:07:22.367 --> 00:07:25.067
So this is a gadget.

00:07:25.067 --> 00:07:26.868
This is also a gadget.

00:07:26.868 --> 00:07:28.801
This is a gadget
developed by Google,

00:07:28.801 --> 00:07:30.334
its Events Gadgets.

00:07:30.334 --> 00:07:32.400
This web site
basically represents

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.734
a...advertisement
for a concert.

00:07:34.734 --> 00:07:37.000
And on the side
is the Events Gadget

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.400
where you indicate
whether or not

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.267
you're interested
in attending that concert.

00:07:40.267 --> 00:07:42.000
And you can see pictures

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.167
of all the people
that are attending

00:07:43.167 --> 00:07:44.734
and that sort of thing.

00:07:44.734 --> 00:07:47.267
You can see this gadget
is pretty deeply integrated

00:07:47.267 --> 00:07:48.501
into the web site.

00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:49.868
So you could have everything

00:07:49.868 --> 00:07:52.767
from things that look like,
you know, modular boxes

00:07:52.767 --> 00:07:55.467
that anyone can
plug into their site

00:07:55.467 --> 00:07:58.400
or you can have things that
are really deeply integrated

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.234
but are still gadgets
and use things like skinning,

00:08:02.234 --> 00:08:03.868
which we'll talk about
here later,

00:08:03.868 --> 00:08:06.701
to make the look
and feel of the gadget

00:08:06.701 --> 00:08:10.834
be very similar to the look
and feel of the web site.

00:08:10.834 --> 00:08:13.434
Jonathan?

00:08:13.434 --> 00:08:15.601
Terleski:
Um...

00:08:15.601 --> 00:08:17.000
[laughter]

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.200
[applause]

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.934
Hi. My name's Jonathan.

00:08:22.934 --> 00:08:26.400
I'm going to be talking
about some of the opportunities

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.167
and challenges
for designing for Google--

00:08:29.167 --> 00:08:30.567
gadgets for
Google Friend Connect.

00:08:30.567 --> 00:08:32.634
So while I'll be
talking specifically

00:08:32.634 --> 00:08:34.200
about Friend Connect gadgets,

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.767
there's also, you know,
obviously implications

00:08:35.767 --> 00:08:38.501
for designing OpenSocial
gadgets and stuff like that.

00:08:38.501 --> 00:08:41.534
So to start off, I think
what you really need to do

00:08:41.534 --> 00:08:44.601
is you need to come up
with an idea that makes sense--

00:08:44.601 --> 00:08:46.434
and, you know,
a good idea that makes sense

00:08:46.434 --> 00:08:48.934
in the frame
of Google Friend Connect.

00:08:48.934 --> 00:08:51.300
So I want to start out
with a little bit of metaphor

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.667
just to kind of get, you know,
your minds in the right places.

00:08:53.667 --> 00:08:56.200
So let's start off
with a pitch black room.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.901
You know, nobody
can see each other.

00:08:58.901 --> 00:09:01.300
You know, no one has any idea
that anyone else is there.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.567
People are just toiling away
doing their own thing.

00:09:03.567 --> 00:09:05.467
Sounds like a few web sites,

00:09:05.467 --> 00:09:06.934
you know,
that I've visited.

00:09:06.934 --> 00:09:09.367
So if we take that room
and we...

00:09:09.367 --> 00:09:13.100
throw the Google Friend Connect
Members gadget on it,

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.267
we basically are turning
the lights on in that room.

00:09:15.267 --> 00:09:17.100
Right? We're letting people
start to look around,

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.701
see each other.

00:09:18.701 --> 00:09:20.601
You know, they can, you know,
walk up to somebody,

00:09:20.601 --> 00:09:22.434
you know...

00:09:22.434 --> 00:09:24.801
they can't really
do much yet.

00:09:24.801 --> 00:09:27.767
And so that's where you
as, you know, developers

00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:29.868
creating
Google Friend Connect gadgets,

00:09:29.868 --> 00:09:31.234
you really come in,
right?

00:09:31.234 --> 00:09:33.767
So...

00:09:33.767 --> 00:09:35.000
gadgets are really out there

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.868
to help members
start to communicate

00:09:36.868 --> 00:09:39.267
with one another
on the site.

00:09:39.267 --> 00:09:41.267
With--without the gadgets
that we create,

00:09:41.267 --> 00:09:43.200
without the gadgets
that you'll create,

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.167
you know, there's not
a whole lot that--

00:09:45.167 --> 00:09:46.534
of functionality
we're offering.

00:09:46.534 --> 00:09:49.868
So on the left
we have our comments gadget,

00:09:49.868 --> 00:09:52.667
which just basically
enables very simple discussion

00:09:52.667 --> 00:09:56.033
between--
between site members.

00:09:56.033 --> 00:09:58.567
On the right, we have
the recommendations gadget,

00:09:58.567 --> 00:10:00.934
and what that does
is it just allows--

00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:04.300
you basically put buttons
around content on your site.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.501
So, like, in this example,

00:10:05.501 --> 00:10:06.868
the buttons were on photos,

00:10:06.868 --> 00:10:09.067
and members could click on
those recommendation buttons

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:10.400
to basically
recommend that content

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.868
to other visitors
of the site.

00:10:11.868 --> 00:10:13.534
And then you put
this aggregation gadget,

00:10:13.534 --> 00:10:16.067
like, on your home page
or something like that.

00:10:16.067 --> 00:10:17.334
So that's a gadget
we developed.

00:10:17.334 --> 00:10:19.067
And then in the middle
is a gadget

00:10:19.067 --> 00:10:20.567
developed by
a third-party developer,

00:10:20.567 --> 00:10:22.200
and it's a question
and answers gadget

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.601
that basically lets people
ask questions

00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:27.801
and get answers from
other members on the site.

00:10:27.801 --> 00:10:30.100
And so, again,
you know, fundamentally,

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.501
gadgets are enabling people
to communicate

00:10:32.501 --> 00:10:35.434
with one another
on the site.

00:10:35.434 --> 00:10:39.267
So now I want to talk
about some of the similarities

00:10:39.267 --> 00:10:41.367
and differences
between Friend Connect

00:10:41.367 --> 00:10:44.067
and a traditional network
or OpenSocial container.

00:10:44.067 --> 00:10:46.767
You know, some of you here
might be currently developing

00:10:46.767 --> 00:10:51.267
OpenSocial gadgets for...
for traditional containers

00:10:51.267 --> 00:10:52.601
that are out there.

00:10:52.601 --> 00:10:53.767
Friend Connect's
a little bit different

00:10:53.767 --> 00:10:55.601
because--
because of two things.

00:10:55.601 --> 00:10:57.801
The first thing's audience.

00:10:57.801 --> 00:10:59.100
And so audience, you know,

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.367
while you still want
to pay attention to, you know--

00:11:01.367 --> 00:11:03.133
the end user
ultimately is your goal--

00:11:03.133 --> 00:11:04.601
you know, these guys.

00:11:04.601 --> 00:11:06.501
There's a new audience
involved in Friend Connect

00:11:06.501 --> 00:11:09.267
that if you're doing
a traditional...

00:11:09.267 --> 00:11:13.033
OpenSocial gadget
you might not be aware of.

00:11:13.033 --> 00:11:14.601
It's a very powerful audience.

00:11:14.601 --> 00:11:16.167
And that's
the site administrator.

00:11:16.167 --> 00:11:18.200
So people who, you know--
sites that come along

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.601
and decide to use
Friend Connect

00:11:19.601 --> 00:11:21.968
are people who, you know,
get a Blogger blog

00:11:21.968 --> 00:11:24.267
and want to use Friend Connect
gadgets on their Blogger blog.

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:26.501
This is the individual
who is ultimately

00:11:26.501 --> 00:11:27.767
making the decision

00:11:27.767 --> 00:11:30.601
to install the gadget
on their site.

00:11:30.601 --> 00:11:32.634
So it's no longer
this kind of game

00:11:32.634 --> 00:11:35.467
around, you know,
how many community members

00:11:35.467 --> 00:11:36.701
can you get
to install this gadget,

00:11:36.701 --> 00:11:37.901
'cause they're not the one

00:11:37.901 --> 00:11:39.534
actually installing
the gadget anymore.

00:11:39.534 --> 00:11:41.133
They're just coming to a site
that's offering functionality,

00:11:41.133 --> 00:11:42.467
and that functionality
is functionality

00:11:42.467 --> 00:11:44.501
that you happen
to be providing.

00:11:44.501 --> 00:11:46.601
And that's very different
than needing to, like,

00:11:46.601 --> 00:11:49.167
you know, virally spread
your app as much as possible.

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:51.434
Now, you do need to,
you know,

00:11:51.434 --> 00:11:53.501
kind of get in front
of site administrators,

00:11:53.501 --> 00:11:55.033
and so when you
do create a gadget--

00:11:55.033 --> 00:11:57.667
and Ryan'll
talk about this later--

00:11:57.667 --> 00:11:58.801
is you can list it

00:11:58.801 --> 00:12:00.601
in the Friend Connect
Gadget Gallery.

00:12:00.601 --> 00:12:02.067
And that's part of,
you know,

00:12:02.067 --> 00:12:03.634
a site administrator's
core experience

00:12:03.634 --> 00:12:04.901
when they sign up
for Friend Connect--

00:12:04.901 --> 00:12:06.567
there's a gallery
that's in the admin site

00:12:06.567 --> 00:12:08.234
that they can access
that will have

00:12:08.234 --> 00:12:10.334
third-party gadgets in it.

00:12:10.334 --> 00:12:12.334
And so the powerful part here

00:12:12.334 --> 00:12:13.968
is that, you know,
a single administrator

00:12:13.968 --> 00:12:15.167
can basically
take your gadget,

00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:16.434
put it on their site,

00:12:16.434 --> 00:12:17.834
and the distribution
of your gadget

00:12:17.834 --> 00:12:20.200
can literally go from zero
to hundreds, thousands,

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.567
you know, millions,
whatever,

00:12:21.567 --> 00:12:24.434
depending on
the traffic of their site.

00:12:24.434 --> 00:12:26.267
But what that also means
is that the bar has been raised.

00:12:26.267 --> 00:12:28.834
So, you know, your gadget
needs to be more relevant,

00:12:28.834 --> 00:12:30.667
more reliable.

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:32.801
If somebody's gonna trust
to put this on, you know,

00:12:32.801 --> 00:12:34.067
the home page
of their site

00:12:34.067 --> 00:12:36.300
or on every news story
page on their site

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.234
if they want to put comments at
the bottom of all their stories

00:12:38.234 --> 00:12:41.367
or something--some other
equivalent functionality...

00:12:41.367 --> 00:12:43.300
a site owner
really needs to be, you know,

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.067
comfortable and confident
taking your gadget

00:12:45.067 --> 00:12:46.634
and putting it alongside
their brand.

00:12:46.634 --> 00:12:49.868
So it needs to look good and
it needs to fit into the site.

00:12:49.868 --> 00:12:52.133
And, you know,
a way to think about it

00:12:52.133 --> 00:12:54.267
is, you know, how can you
as gadget developers

00:12:54.267 --> 00:12:56.167
really create assets
for these sites?

00:12:56.167 --> 00:12:59.033
How can you be something
that site owners depend on?

00:12:59.033 --> 00:13:01.000
You know, that's
a good position to be in

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.434
as a--as a software developer.

00:13:03.434 --> 00:13:05.634
So--and as
I mentioned earlier,

00:13:05.634 --> 00:13:07.100
because of this new audience,
you know,

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.033
there's that--
there's less need to, you know,

00:13:09.033 --> 00:13:11.234
try and spread your app
virally between people

00:13:11.234 --> 00:13:12.567
while Friend Connect
has that--

00:13:12.567 --> 00:13:13.767
as he showed some
of the invite stuff

00:13:13.767 --> 00:13:15.400
around inviting to sites--

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.234
and more need to just
communicate the value

00:13:17.234 --> 00:13:19.801
to--to site administrators.

00:13:19.801 --> 00:13:22.100
So again, you're ultimately
creating, you know,

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.434
an experience with
the end user, but, you know,

00:13:23.434 --> 00:13:25.300
the site administrators
kind of hold the keys

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.767
to distribution.

00:13:26.767 --> 00:13:28.934
And you really need
to be focusing on relevance.

00:13:28.934 --> 00:13:31.234
So create something useful
that makes sense on a web site.

00:13:31.234 --> 00:13:33.234
And I'll talk about that
a little bit more

00:13:33.234 --> 00:13:34.400
in a minute.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.200
And also focus
on reliability.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.868
Like, if your gadget is,
you know,

00:13:37.868 --> 00:13:39.868
down 10% of the time
and it doesn't load,

00:13:39.868 --> 00:13:41.934
like, that's probably
not gonna be on many sites

00:13:41.934 --> 00:13:44.100
for very long.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.267
So one last point
about audience

00:13:46.267 --> 00:13:49.567
before I kind of
go into my next point

00:13:49.567 --> 00:13:50.767
is that really
Google Friend Connect

00:13:50.767 --> 00:13:52.501
is about making
the web more social.

00:13:52.501 --> 00:13:53.968
And so,
this is a huge opportunity,

00:13:53.968 --> 00:13:56.367
I think, for you
as gadget developers

00:13:56.367 --> 00:13:57.834
to really light up
these latent communities--

00:13:57.834 --> 00:13:59.167
as Ryan mentioned--

00:13:59.167 --> 00:14:02.133
that already exist on millions
of existing web sites.

00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:03.701
And I think
the key thing to remember

00:14:03.701 --> 00:14:05.601
is that some of these users
will be the same users

00:14:05.601 --> 00:14:07.267
that you're used to seeing
on social networks,

00:14:07.267 --> 00:14:08.534
but there's also gonna be
a lot of people

00:14:08.534 --> 00:14:10.300
who, you know,
you've never seen before.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.734
There's gonna be
people out there

00:14:11.734 --> 00:14:13.634
that, you know, don't care
to join a social network,

00:14:13.634 --> 00:14:15.133
haven't joined a social network
yet, you know,

00:14:15.133 --> 00:14:17.133
don't like the idea
of social networks.

00:14:17.133 --> 00:14:19.667
But, like, you know, everybody
likes to be social.

00:14:19.667 --> 00:14:21.901
So you really--
I think there's the ability

00:14:21.901 --> 00:14:24.634
to reach kind of
that broader audience here.

00:14:24.634 --> 00:14:26.934
So the second big idea,

00:14:26.934 --> 00:14:29.200
I think, to think about
is context.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.701
You know, as I
just mentioned, right--

00:14:30.701 --> 00:14:32.467
you're out there
on the web.

00:14:32.467 --> 00:14:34.067
And it means that--
what that means

00:14:34.067 --> 00:14:36.133
is that the context
for a gadget

00:14:36.133 --> 00:14:37.801
is not a traditional
social network,

00:14:37.801 --> 00:14:39.567
you know,
profile page anymore.

00:14:39.567 --> 00:14:42.434
You're now in the sidebar
of a web site.

00:14:42.434 --> 00:14:44.801
You're now at the bottom
of every, you know,

00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:46.300
blog post on this site.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.234
You're really in--
in, number one,

00:14:48.234 --> 00:14:50.100
places that are
probably more visible,

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.834
but number two,
just places that are different.

00:14:52.834 --> 00:14:54.834
So, you know, the...

00:14:54.834 --> 00:14:57.100
things that kind of
worked in one context

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.267
might not work in--in this
Google Friend Connect context

00:15:00.267 --> 00:15:01.701
and vice versa.

00:15:01.701 --> 00:15:05.901
So let's talk about some
UI stuff really quick here.

00:15:05.901 --> 00:15:07.501
I am a designer.

00:15:07.501 --> 00:15:09.367
So this is a--
a screenshot

00:15:09.367 --> 00:15:10.834
of the Google
Social Web Blog--

00:15:10.834 --> 00:15:12.033
kind of simplified
a little bit,

00:15:12.033 --> 00:15:13.901
but this is
the basic gist.

00:15:13.901 --> 00:15:16.100
And so you see on the right
they've got the--

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.567
just the default skinned Google
Friend Connect Members gadget

00:15:18.567 --> 00:15:20.467
embedded on there.

00:15:20.467 --> 00:15:22.133
But let's say
that the site administrator

00:15:22.133 --> 00:15:24.400
actually, you know,
really wanted a black--

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.734
black background
and white text.

00:15:25.734 --> 00:15:28.467
And all of a sudden,
their web site looks like this.

00:15:28.467 --> 00:15:30.234
So content on the left

00:15:30.234 --> 00:15:31.901
kind of, you know...

00:15:31.901 --> 00:15:33.167
looks a little bit drab

00:15:33.167 --> 00:15:34.734
just 'cause I didn't do
a whole lot of hackery.

00:15:34.734 --> 00:15:36.767
But the thing on--
the pointer notices that

00:15:36.767 --> 00:15:38.033
that gadget really now
doesn't feel

00:15:38.033 --> 00:15:39.367
like part of the site.

00:15:39.367 --> 00:15:40.601
It's really standing out.

00:15:40.601 --> 00:15:41.901
And that's kind of
not what you want.

00:15:41.901 --> 00:15:43.667
That's gonna--
if there's no flexibility

00:15:43.667 --> 00:15:45.567
in your gadget,

00:15:45.567 --> 00:15:47.133
once I put this on here,

00:15:47.133 --> 00:15:49.000
I might find the functionality
neat for a little while

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.467
but I'm just
gonna get used to it--

00:15:50.467 --> 00:15:51.868
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna start to see it

00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:54.367
as, like, kind of the wart
on my site, right?

00:15:54.367 --> 00:15:56.234
And so, you know,
you can fix that

00:15:56.234 --> 00:15:57.834
by, you know, adding
skinning to your gadget.

00:15:57.834 --> 00:15:59.200
And this stuff--
this is stuff

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.200
that Ryan'll
talk about later.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.801
But, you know, so this is what
an administrator might do.

00:16:04.801 --> 00:16:06.734
So this is using
just our admin site.

00:16:06.734 --> 00:16:09.367
You can change the--
the options, the colors on--

00:16:09.367 --> 00:16:11.634
on our default gadgets

00:16:11.634 --> 00:16:13.534
to kind of make it
feel a little bit more--

00:16:13.534 --> 00:16:15.567
like, more part of the site.

00:16:15.567 --> 00:16:18.067
This is also a good way
just to mention to--

00:16:18.067 --> 00:16:19.267
if you are
creating a gadget,

00:16:19.267 --> 00:16:20.834
and you really--
and you need to add skinning

00:16:20.834 --> 00:16:22.467
and you want to add skinning,
take your gadget,

00:16:22.467 --> 00:16:23.734
throw it onto a site

00:16:23.734 --> 00:16:25.968
with a black background
and white text,

00:16:25.968 --> 00:16:27.367
and that'll pretty much
tell you,

00:16:27.367 --> 00:16:28.968
you know,
help you along the way

00:16:28.968 --> 00:16:30.434
on what is--what's the stuff
on my gadget

00:16:30.434 --> 00:16:32.200
that's not yet skinnable
and needs to be?

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.267
Because that will pretty much
make any element of your gadget

00:16:34.267 --> 00:16:36.367
stand out in a bad way.

00:16:36.367 --> 00:16:38.234
And so,
dropping it on this

00:16:38.234 --> 00:16:39.400
and really figuring out,
"Oh, yeah,"

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.734
like, "I forgot to make
the border skinnable."

00:16:40.734 --> 00:16:42.000
Like, "I need to do that."

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.200
Or, "The inner borders
aren't skinnable."

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.534
Like, "I need
to think about that."

00:16:44.534 --> 00:16:46.133
And obviously
that's how we came a lot of--

00:16:46.133 --> 00:16:47.667
across some
of our skinning options.

00:16:47.667 --> 00:16:50.634
We added some
as we went on.

00:16:50.634 --> 00:16:53.601
So, you know,
another thing

00:16:53.601 --> 00:16:57.601
to...think about
with regard to context,

00:16:57.601 --> 00:17:00.567
in addition to just the fact
that you're on the web site,

00:17:00.567 --> 00:17:03.000
is that, you know,
existing applications

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.367
that some of you
may have written--

00:17:04.367 --> 00:17:05.834
so if you have
written applications

00:17:05.834 --> 00:17:07.300
for OpenSocial containers--

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.701
they might not make sense
out on the web.

00:17:08.701 --> 00:17:11.400
So--or at least not
for all Friend Connect sites.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.067
So, you know, I don't like
to pick on people

00:17:13.067 --> 00:17:15.067
but, like, the zombie biting
app, for example.

00:17:15.067 --> 00:17:16.501
You know, the--
you know.

00:17:16.501 --> 00:17:17.834
The church that wants to add

00:17:17.834 --> 00:17:19.234
Google Friend Connect
to their site

00:17:19.234 --> 00:17:21.367
is not going to be interested
in the zombie biting app.

00:17:21.367 --> 00:17:22.734
And probably
not a lot of sites

00:17:22.734 --> 00:17:24.167
are going to be interested
in a zombie biting app

00:17:24.167 --> 00:17:25.667
I think is my larger point.

00:17:25.667 --> 00:17:27.467
There might be a few,
like the Halloween site--

00:17:27.467 --> 00:17:28.934
that's gonna love it.

00:17:28.934 --> 00:17:30.167
But you really have
to think about, like,

00:17:30.167 --> 00:17:31.767
the context
that you're in now.

00:17:31.767 --> 00:17:34.300
It's not...you know,

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.968
little apps that users
can just pick up

00:17:36.968 --> 00:17:38.367
and play with
with their friends.

00:17:38.367 --> 00:17:39.667
I mean, this is something
that's really gonna be

00:17:39.667 --> 00:17:42.234
on the front of someone's--
someone's site.

00:17:42.234 --> 00:17:44.834
And so you just need
to just keep that in mind.

00:17:44.834 --> 00:17:46.601
So just to wrap up
this section

00:17:46.601 --> 00:17:48.601
and to get into
some design stuff,

00:17:48.601 --> 00:17:51.501
again, audience--
continue to focus on the user

00:17:51.501 --> 00:17:53.000
and all else will follow.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.100
But remember
that administrators,

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.000
you know,
are your distributors.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.467
So be useful,
provide relevant functionality,

00:17:59.467 --> 00:18:01.100
and be reliable.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.701
And then context--
your application

00:18:02.701 --> 00:18:04.200
is part
of someone else's site.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.901
You need to think about,
again,

00:18:06.901 --> 00:18:08.300
the skinning options.

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:11.200
I'll get a little bit into
size options in a minute.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.834
But also think
about creating something

00:18:12.834 --> 00:18:14.567
that, like,
lots of sites can use.

00:18:14.567 --> 00:18:16.033
You know,
the good example

00:18:16.033 --> 00:18:17.601
I think that Ryan
gave to me

00:18:17.601 --> 00:18:19.901
was the example
of the real-time chat app

00:18:19.901 --> 00:18:21.167
that maybe
didn't work so well

00:18:21.167 --> 00:18:22.400
in a traditional
social network

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.334
because, you know,
the overlap of--

00:18:24.334 --> 00:18:25.567
if I have, you know,

00:18:25.567 --> 00:18:27.501
Jonathan's chat
and that's on my profile,

00:18:27.501 --> 00:18:29.300
you know, the number of
people visiting my profile

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.133
at any one time
is probably small.

00:18:31.133 --> 00:18:32.868
Probably me.

00:18:32.868 --> 00:18:34.567
But the, you know,
the overlap

00:18:34.567 --> 00:18:37.100
of if I put real-time chat
on, you know,

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:38.501
the front page of something

00:18:38.501 --> 00:18:40.567
that's getting hundreds
of thousands of visitors a day--

00:18:40.567 --> 00:18:42.834
or even thousands
or hundreds of visitors a day--

00:18:42.834 --> 00:18:44.467
there's--there's at least
a higher chance

00:18:44.467 --> 00:18:46.067
of there being overlap
and it being useful.

00:18:46.067 --> 00:18:50.334
So just think about that.

00:18:50.334 --> 00:18:52.734
All right.

00:18:52.734 --> 00:18:54.300
Whoa.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:59.300
I think that, you know,
once you have that good idea

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.667
that you need to give it

00:19:00.667 --> 00:19:02.167
kind of the good UI
that it deserves.

00:19:02.167 --> 00:19:03.934
And so my goal is
when you walk out of here

00:19:03.934 --> 00:19:06.000
to basically have
the basic gadget--

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.868
the basic structure of gadget
as I see it,

00:19:07.868 --> 00:19:09.968
and then also
just the tools to get started

00:19:09.968 --> 00:19:12.501
thinking about,
if you have an idea,

00:19:12.501 --> 00:19:14.868
how you might start
just sketching out

00:19:14.868 --> 00:19:16.667
what that might look like.

00:19:16.667 --> 00:19:18.634
And so we've created
a few gadgets ourselves,

00:19:18.634 --> 00:19:19.868
and I have
some experience there,

00:19:19.868 --> 00:19:21.033
so I just wanted
to kind of walk through

00:19:21.033 --> 00:19:22.868
some of this stuff.

00:19:22.868 --> 00:19:24.167
So, you know,
first you have,

00:19:24.167 --> 00:19:25.934
you know,
the gadget itself.

00:19:25.934 --> 00:19:28.567
Some of our gadgets
look like this.

00:19:28.567 --> 00:19:29.801
But they can also
look like this.

00:19:29.801 --> 00:19:31.167
They can be wide.

00:19:31.167 --> 00:19:32.467
And the point here
is just that

00:19:32.467 --> 00:19:33.801
there is no default size.

00:19:33.801 --> 00:19:36.133
So on traditional
social networks,

00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:37.501
you'll often have a size

00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:39.634
or set of sizes
for the profile view.

00:19:39.634 --> 00:19:41.767
You know,
the size is whatever--

00:19:41.767 --> 00:19:44.467
you know, IFRAME
or whatever div,

00:19:44.467 --> 00:19:46.734
like, the administrator
dumps it into, right?

00:19:46.734 --> 00:19:50.467
And so that
can be configurable through--

00:19:50.467 --> 00:19:52.467
we offer configuration
options for that,

00:19:52.467 --> 00:19:54.000
that you can expose
to the administrator

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.968
so you can adapt to that.

00:19:55.968 --> 00:19:58.133
But you need to make sure
that you're kind of

00:19:58.133 --> 00:19:59.567
building that into your app.

00:19:59.567 --> 00:20:02.467
And so, you know,
a good example here

00:20:02.467 --> 00:20:04.667
is the--
the comments gadget.

00:20:04.667 --> 00:20:08.667
And so, you know, it works
well in this smaller size

00:20:08.667 --> 00:20:11.267
and, you know, text expands
as you open it up.

00:20:11.267 --> 00:20:12.767
Just stuff
you expect it to do.

00:20:12.767 --> 00:20:14.534
But if I take
the comments gadget

00:20:14.534 --> 00:20:15.834
and maybe, you know,

00:20:15.834 --> 00:20:18.467
make some intentionally bad
design decisions--

00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:19.601
you could see, like,

00:20:19.601 --> 00:20:20.901
maybe you wanted to be
super descriptive

00:20:20.901 --> 00:20:22.234
and we wanted to call it

00:20:22.234 --> 00:20:23.801
the "Comments
&amp; Conversations" gadget.

00:20:23.801 --> 00:20:26.300
But, you know, that's
not gonna work in sidebars

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.934
that are less
than 200 pixels,

00:20:27.934 --> 00:20:29.467
which is a lot of sidebars.

00:20:29.467 --> 00:20:31.834
Or, you know,
if you look closely,

00:20:31.834 --> 00:20:33.234
you can see--
it's hard to see up here,

00:20:33.234 --> 00:20:35.400
but a lot of the comments
are actually getting cut off.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.734
And maybe that's
because there was a div

00:20:36.734 --> 00:20:38.067
that was floating
over on the right

00:20:38.067 --> 00:20:39.734
that's now been brought over
and is overlapping

00:20:39.734 --> 00:20:41.734
some of the text.

00:20:41.734 --> 00:20:43.934
Down in the footer,
where we've got some navigation,

00:20:43.934 --> 00:20:45.501
we also wanted to put
a big call to action

00:20:45.501 --> 00:20:47.133
that says, "Leave a comment."

00:20:47.133 --> 00:20:49.367
You know, again, now that
that size has come down,

00:20:49.367 --> 00:20:51.868
that text is starting
to overlap and not look so nice.

00:20:51.868 --> 00:20:54.601
So you really need
to think about

00:20:54.601 --> 00:20:56.033
kind of how size--

00:20:56.033 --> 00:20:59.667
what role size
is going to play in your app.

00:20:59.667 --> 00:21:03.434
And I'll go into what I think
a good minimum size is,

00:21:03.434 --> 00:21:04.968
but one thing
I want to mention first

00:21:04.968 --> 00:21:07.033
is just that text
can often be the long pole.

00:21:07.033 --> 00:21:10.033
So, you know,
the two examples here--

00:21:10.033 --> 00:21:11.868
the title and the footer.

00:21:11.868 --> 00:21:13.167
But if you're
going into a sidebar

00:21:13.167 --> 00:21:15.734
that's going to be
160, 180, 200 pixels,

00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:17.200
you really need
to be thinking about,

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.467
"Oh, can I actually
fit in navigation

00:21:19.467 --> 00:21:20.667
and a call to action here?"

00:21:20.667 --> 00:21:22.667
Can I fit in, you know,
all these, you know--

00:21:22.667 --> 00:21:24.434
What's my longest case?

00:21:24.434 --> 00:21:25.901
Like, when I navigate
into a collection

00:21:25.901 --> 00:21:27.267
and I have previous,
and next,

00:21:27.267 --> 00:21:29.133
and then I want to offer
some, you know,

00:21:29.133 --> 00:21:30.868
navigation to get
back up the hierarchy--

00:21:30.868 --> 00:21:32.634
like, are those
all going to fit?

00:21:32.634 --> 00:21:35.534
And then think about
that for German

00:21:35.534 --> 00:21:38.234
or think about that for--
if you want to localize, right,

00:21:38.234 --> 00:21:39.667
like, double it.

00:21:39.667 --> 00:21:42.400
So it's--it's not--
it's not an easy problem.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.601
It's just something
to be aware of,

00:21:43.601 --> 00:21:45.033
and I don't have
a super good answer for you

00:21:45.033 --> 00:21:46.400
about how to avoid it,

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.968
except for to go through
the states of your app

00:21:47.968 --> 00:21:49.601
and see, like--
what are the, you know,

00:21:49.601 --> 00:21:50.901
what are those complex cases

00:21:50.901 --> 00:21:52.234
that really might
load up an area

00:21:52.234 --> 00:21:54.434
with either navigation or--

00:21:54.434 --> 00:21:56.501
or something you might be
doing in your content area

00:21:56.501 --> 00:21:58.133
of your app.

00:21:58.133 --> 00:22:00.167
So I mentioned I'd give you
a good minimum size

00:22:00.167 --> 00:22:01.968
to focus on.

00:22:01.968 --> 00:22:04.100
This is kind of what I--
what I...

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.067
have been following
in most of my design.

00:22:06.067 --> 00:22:08.100
And the reason is
is that most sidebars

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.100
kind of fit in here.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.033
And designing any smaller
is really, really hard

00:22:12.033 --> 00:22:13.734
and annoying.

00:22:13.734 --> 00:22:15.534
And so, for example--

00:22:15.534 --> 00:22:18.334
but it really matters,
I guess...

00:22:18.334 --> 00:22:19.701
on the audience
that you're targeting.

00:22:19.701 --> 00:22:22.067
So if you're targeting,
you know, bloggers

00:22:22.067 --> 00:22:23.901
that use Blogger,

00:22:23.901 --> 00:22:27.100
and you want them
to be people

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.300
that are going
to adopt your gadget,

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:29.434
well, there's a lot
of Blogger templates

00:22:29.434 --> 00:22:31.267
that are 160-pixel-wide
sidebars.

00:22:31.267 --> 00:22:34.167
And so you better make sure
that your gadget looks good

00:22:34.167 --> 00:22:36.033
in those templates.

00:22:36.033 --> 00:22:37.501
And the same goes
for any other thing.

00:22:37.501 --> 00:22:40.400
Like, you know, WordPress
has sets of templates.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.267
There's content kind of
management things

00:22:43.267 --> 00:22:45.067
that a lot of sites use that--
to throw sites up

00:22:45.067 --> 00:22:46.634
that have
a lot of standards.

00:22:46.634 --> 00:22:48.868
I've found that, you know,
if you're designing, you know,

00:22:48.868 --> 00:22:50.567
180 pixels is probably--

00:22:50.567 --> 00:22:52.167
you're gonna hit
most people there.

00:22:52.167 --> 00:22:55.901
But again, some of the blogs
go down to 160.

00:22:55.901 --> 00:22:59.000
So let's talk about some
of the--some more structures.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
So there's the header.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.834
What I'm kind of showing here
is that, you know,

00:23:03.834 --> 00:23:07.000
the header hopefully
should be optional.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.601
What we're finding
as we go on

00:23:09.601 --> 00:23:10.834
is that, you know,
a lot of sites

00:23:10.834 --> 00:23:12.968
already have, you know,
systems in place

00:23:12.968 --> 00:23:14.434
either in their--
I had mentioned templates

00:23:14.434 --> 00:23:15.901
and Blogger
is one example.

00:23:15.901 --> 00:23:18.033
But there's other web sites
that already have

00:23:18.033 --> 00:23:20.834
systems for basically
blocking off their content

00:23:20.834 --> 00:23:22.400
and presenting it.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.000
And so you kind of
have to think about, you know,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
making that--that header,
you know, toggleable.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.234
So the--the takeaway
is not to put...

00:23:28.234 --> 00:23:30.767
you know, mandatory
functionality up in your header

00:23:30.767 --> 00:23:32.734
and to make that
basically toggleable

00:23:32.734 --> 00:23:35.200
by the--
by the site administrator.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.868
The next piece
is the footer

00:23:37.868 --> 00:23:41.000
where we commonly
throw navigation.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.234
And I think--

00:23:42.234 --> 00:23:44.067
if there was something
I was going to recommend

00:23:44.067 --> 00:23:45.534
as a principle
to stick to,

00:23:45.534 --> 00:23:47.200
this would be one of them,
which is--

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.434
a lot of the gadgets
we've made

00:23:48.434 --> 00:23:50.200
and I think
all of the gadgets

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.901
that we have seen
third-party developers make--

00:23:52.901 --> 00:23:54.467
at least everyone I've seen--

00:23:54.467 --> 00:23:56.501
have been putting navigation
down in the footer like this.

00:23:56.501 --> 00:23:58.400
And I think it's something
that's worked really well

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.067
as far as
users can expect

00:24:00.067 --> 00:24:01.901
that when they're
in the middle of a collection

00:24:01.901 --> 00:24:03.234
that they can look down there

00:24:03.234 --> 00:24:04.868
and go through
the navigation like that.

00:24:04.868 --> 00:24:06.434
And so that's one--

00:24:06.434 --> 00:24:07.834
one thing I would
be recommending.

00:24:07.834 --> 00:24:10.868
So here's an example of--
I'm--maybe I was in--

00:24:10.868 --> 00:24:13.634
I was looking
at the Members gadget

00:24:13.634 --> 00:24:15.667
at was looking
at a set of my friends.

00:24:15.667 --> 00:24:17.467
And maybe
I clicked in on that

00:24:17.467 --> 00:24:20.534
and what I got was--
got to this collection,

00:24:20.534 --> 00:24:22.033
so now I can page through it.

00:24:22.033 --> 00:24:23.868
But you'll also
notice now

00:24:23.868 --> 00:24:25.300
there's a link
to go back in there.

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.801
Because not only have I started
navigating hierarchically,

00:24:27.801 --> 00:24:30.434
but now I'm paging
through a collection.

00:24:30.434 --> 00:24:32.067
And if somebody
pages into a collection

00:24:32.067 --> 00:24:33.701
five, six, seven pages deep,

00:24:33.701 --> 00:24:35.300
do you really want
to have them--

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.868
have to have them page
all the way back out

00:24:37.868 --> 00:24:39.634
to just get back
to the previous screen?

00:24:39.634 --> 00:24:40.934
So you need
to start thinking about

00:24:40.934 --> 00:24:44.467
how is the user--
how is the user navigating?

00:24:44.467 --> 00:24:49.534
And then one piece
that isn't really, you know,

00:24:49.534 --> 00:24:52.167
part of, I guess,
a gadget proper--

00:24:52.167 --> 00:24:53.834
it's kind of the other view
of it--is the Canvas mode.

00:24:53.834 --> 00:24:55.200
And it's
the same type of mode

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.067
if you're used to developing
OpenSocial gadgets

00:24:57.067 --> 00:24:59.534
that you'll--
that you'll recognize.

00:24:59.534 --> 00:25:02.934
It's basically
a larger view of a--

00:25:02.934 --> 00:25:05.100
of a guaranteed
view size.

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.667
And so, kind of
the recommendation I have

00:25:07.667 --> 00:25:09.701
is to basically take users
there when it makes sense.

00:25:09.701 --> 00:25:11.834
So a good example is

00:25:11.834 --> 00:25:14.801
you are, you know, an app
that does photo tagging.

00:25:14.801 --> 00:25:17.634
And you have--
a user is trying to--

00:25:17.634 --> 00:25:18.968
to tag photos,

00:25:18.968 --> 00:25:21.634
and the site administrator
has graciously given you

00:25:21.634 --> 00:25:25.234
160 pixels wide by, you know,
300 pixels tall,

00:25:25.234 --> 00:25:27.434
and they're trying to tag
faces in a photo.

00:25:27.434 --> 00:25:29.334
So you can either
give them, you know,

00:25:29.334 --> 00:25:30.968
a 50x50 photo

00:25:30.968 --> 00:25:32.300
and have them
try and tag faces--

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.133
which probably won't
be very successful,

00:25:34.133 --> 00:25:36.367
'cause each face will be
about 6 pixels big--

00:25:36.367 --> 00:25:38.501
or you can take them
off to Canvas mode,

00:25:38.501 --> 00:25:40.234
where you might have
a larger view of that photo.

00:25:40.234 --> 00:25:42.901
And then it will allow them
to work in that space,

00:25:42.901 --> 00:25:45.334
and then when they're done,
you know, bring them back.

00:25:45.334 --> 00:25:48.667
And so, again, when thinking
about Canvas mode,

00:25:48.667 --> 00:25:49.934
thinking about using it

00:25:49.934 --> 00:25:51.801
kind of as a place
to take people

00:25:51.801 --> 00:25:54.701
when they really need
to kind of stretch their legs

00:25:54.701 --> 00:25:56.367
and get a little bit deeper--

00:25:56.367 --> 00:25:57.868
for the Members gadget,
for example, one thing we do

00:25:57.868 --> 00:26:00.701
when you go into--
but Canvas mode is we, you know,

00:26:00.701 --> 00:26:02.434
show the names of the members
next to the photo,

00:26:02.434 --> 00:26:03.767
'cause we have
that extra space.

00:26:03.767 --> 00:26:05.033
So if you're looking
for someone in particular,

00:26:05.033 --> 00:26:07.701
you can--
you can get to that.

00:26:07.701 --> 00:26:09.200
Cool.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.434
So those are just some of the
basic structures of a gadget,

00:26:11.434 --> 00:26:14.200
and now I just want to give you,
in closing here,

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.601
just a framework to kind of
maybe start thinking about,

00:26:16.601 --> 00:26:18.868
you know, how--
how do I take the idea

00:26:18.868 --> 00:26:21.634
that, you know, I have now--
I know the basic structure.

00:26:21.634 --> 00:26:23.067
How do I actually start,
you know,

00:26:23.067 --> 00:26:26.033
filling that content area
with stuff?

00:26:26.033 --> 00:26:30.167
So...

00:26:30.167 --> 00:26:32.901
I guess the framework
I want to present is this.

00:26:32.901 --> 00:26:36.133
So if you think
about your gadget

00:26:36.133 --> 00:26:38.167
as having kind of
three key components to it--

00:26:38.167 --> 00:26:39.934
so you think about objects,

00:26:39.934 --> 00:26:41.601
you think about
user contribution,

00:26:41.601 --> 00:26:43.033
and think about
user consumption.

00:26:43.033 --> 00:26:45.367
And I'll explain this
with some examples.

00:26:45.367 --> 00:26:47.400
So first you start
with objects.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.067
So this is the--
the comments gadget.

00:26:49.067 --> 00:26:50.901
So the object
in our comments gadget

00:26:50.901 --> 00:26:52.767
is the comment itself.

00:26:52.767 --> 00:26:55.234
The user contribution
is kind of the posting UI

00:26:55.234 --> 00:26:59.133
for--for the user to post--
for users to post a comment.

00:26:59.133 --> 00:27:01.734
And then the consumption
is just, you know,

00:27:01.734 --> 00:27:04.300
that collection of comments

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:08.601
that members can
page through to--to view.

00:27:08.601 --> 00:27:10.334
The Members gadget--

00:27:10.334 --> 00:27:12.100
the object is the member.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.000
The user contribution
side of it

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.234
is the joining of the site,

00:27:15.234 --> 00:27:16.567
the becoming a member
of that site,

00:27:16.567 --> 00:27:18.267
adding yourself
to that collection.

00:27:18.267 --> 00:27:20.234
And the user consumption
piece of it

00:27:20.234 --> 00:27:21.767
is just that, you know,

00:27:21.767 --> 00:27:23.701
viewing that collection,
paging through that collection.

00:27:23.701 --> 00:27:26.901
And of course this
is an oversimplification.

00:27:26.901 --> 00:27:28.567
Both of these gadgets do more.

00:27:28.567 --> 00:27:30.300
You can reply
to individual comments

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.734
and those are different.

00:27:31.734 --> 00:27:34.234
You can click on someone's
face, view their profile.

00:27:34.234 --> 00:27:35.667
But again--
those are all objects

00:27:35.667 --> 00:27:37.601
that have user contribution
pieces to them

00:27:37.601 --> 00:27:39.367
and user consumption
pieces to them.

00:27:39.367 --> 00:27:41.067
So just starting off,
thinking about,

00:27:41.067 --> 00:27:42.434
"Okay, here's the idea I have

00:27:42.434 --> 00:27:45.200
for my--
for my gadget."

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.534
And just starting to determine--
what are the objects?

00:27:47.534 --> 00:27:48.901
How do I let users
contribute those?

00:27:48.901 --> 00:27:50.400
How am I going
to display those to users?

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.267
And just start, you know,
kind of sketching that out

00:27:52.267 --> 00:27:54.133
will be a big help in,
I think,

00:27:54.133 --> 00:27:57.267
getting you on the road to
creating a really good gadget.

00:27:57.267 --> 00:28:01.667
So one example that--
that I came up with that I like

00:28:01.667 --> 00:28:04.133
is to show that
this kind of can apply

00:28:04.133 --> 00:28:05.434
to things
that maybe just aren't,

00:28:05.434 --> 00:28:07.868
you know, kind of
the gadgets we've made,

00:28:07.868 --> 00:28:09.434
the comments gadgets,
stuff like that--

00:28:09.434 --> 00:28:14.200
is let's imagine that you've
written an interactive game

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.834
where, you know,
the main...

00:28:16.834 --> 00:28:18.868
the main interaction
the user has

00:28:18.868 --> 00:28:20.601
is with
an interactive game itself--

00:28:20.601 --> 00:28:24.634
not, you know,
something you're doing...

00:28:24.634 --> 00:28:27.000
in the, or, sorry,
not--not in the gadget,

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.300
but it's with a game
where you're not

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:32.067
interacting with normal
kind of UI components,

00:28:32.067 --> 00:28:33.801
that you're actually,
you know, you've got a custom UI

00:28:33.801 --> 00:28:35.067
and stuff like that.

00:28:35.067 --> 00:28:37.467
The stuff that comes out
of that game, right, are scores.

00:28:37.467 --> 00:28:38.901
And so, I think about--

00:28:38.901 --> 00:28:40.267
when you think about
a score object,

00:28:40.267 --> 00:28:42.133
in that model that
I just was talking about,

00:28:42.133 --> 00:28:44.400
you kind of get the--
the idea

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.601
that, you know, users
are generating these objects,

00:28:47.601 --> 00:28:49.601
that they're--want to be able
to contribute to these objects,

00:28:49.601 --> 00:28:51.667
that they want to be able to
share these with their friends,

00:28:51.667 --> 00:28:52.934
other people on the site,

00:28:52.934 --> 00:28:54.801
contribute it to our
leaderboard, whatever it is.

00:28:54.801 --> 00:28:56.834
And then
the consumption side--

00:28:56.834 --> 00:28:58.167
somebody's who's just
gotten the high score

00:28:58.167 --> 00:28:59.834
wants to be able
to compare against other people

00:28:59.834 --> 00:29:02.267
and see where they fall
kind of in the ranks.

00:29:02.267 --> 00:29:04.100
And so just by thinking
about, you know,

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:07.934
that basic idea of, "Okay, what
are the objects in my game?"

00:29:07.934 --> 00:29:09.801
You know, okay, well,
the score comes out at the end

00:29:09.801 --> 00:29:11.367
when they die,
et cetera.

00:29:11.367 --> 00:29:13.167
You know, you come up
with a concept of leaderboards,

00:29:13.167 --> 00:29:15.467
and I think that's...

00:29:15.467 --> 00:29:18.100
I don't--it was
interesting to me, I guess.

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:21.334
So figuring out kind of
what your base object will be,

00:29:21.334 --> 00:29:23.434
how you're going
to display those objects,

00:29:23.434 --> 00:29:25.100
and how users will
contribute to those objects

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.000
is really one of
the first things you should do

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.801
when trying to sketch out
your particular gadg--

00:29:29.801 --> 00:29:31.033
the gadget you want to make.

00:29:31.033 --> 00:29:32.501
So did the user
just draw a picture?

00:29:32.501 --> 00:29:33.667
You know,
let 'em post it.

00:29:33.667 --> 00:29:36.267
Did the user just make
a donation to that site?

00:29:36.267 --> 00:29:38.367
Let them be featured
as the latest contributor.

00:29:38.367 --> 00:29:40.868
It's not always
just taking what they took

00:29:40.868 --> 00:29:42.300
and spitting it
right back at them.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.767
You can take what they took,

00:29:43.767 --> 00:29:45.334
mash it up
with other stuff,

00:29:45.334 --> 00:29:46.734
do some other things to it,

00:29:46.734 --> 00:29:48.634
and--or present it
back to them in a unique way

00:29:48.634 --> 00:29:50.334
that's different that the way
they contributed it.

00:29:50.334 --> 00:29:52.868
But, again,
thinking about

00:29:52.868 --> 00:29:54.868
just those pieces
of, you know--

00:29:54.868 --> 00:29:56.534
you get the--
kind of the nouns

00:29:56.534 --> 00:29:57.968
and then you start
to get the verb for

00:29:57.968 --> 00:29:59.434
"how did they give it to you,"

00:29:59.434 --> 00:30:00.734
and the verb for "how do you
give it back to them"

00:30:00.734 --> 00:30:02.968
by thinking about it
this way, I think.

00:30:02.968 --> 00:30:05.334
And I think also
when you think about,

00:30:05.334 --> 00:30:07.234
you know, kind of
each object or each action

00:30:07.234 --> 00:30:09.701
in this framework,
you start to think about

00:30:09.701 --> 00:30:11.334
each object or each action

00:30:11.334 --> 00:30:13.534
as a potentially
shareable moment.

00:30:13.534 --> 00:30:15.367
And I think, you know,
what this--

00:30:15.367 --> 00:30:17.000
this helps you not only
get a better idea

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.234
of what your gadget
should be about,

00:30:18.234 --> 00:30:20.167
but it helps just make
your gadget more social

00:30:20.167 --> 00:30:21.501
because of that.

00:30:21.501 --> 00:30:22.634
You're always thinking about,

00:30:22.634 --> 00:30:23.934
"Oh, what are users
creating in my gadget?"

00:30:23.934 --> 00:30:25.701
"Oh, what could users
potentially consume

00:30:25.701 --> 00:30:27.267
that other users
are creating?"

00:30:27.267 --> 00:30:29.434
And so you really start to,
I think--

00:30:29.434 --> 00:30:31.000
social features
start to pop out

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.567
kind of
of your gadget, you know?

00:30:32.567 --> 00:30:34.033
By thinking about
stuff in this way, I've--

00:30:34.033 --> 00:30:35.901
there's a few features
that I'm building

00:30:35.901 --> 00:30:37.501
into some of our upcoming
gadgets, I think,

00:30:37.501 --> 00:30:38.767
that are going to be exciting

00:30:38.767 --> 00:30:40.567
because I started
thinking about it in this way.

00:30:40.567 --> 00:30:42.267
And things I wouldn't have
normally thought to be,

00:30:42.267 --> 00:30:43.501
"Oh, that should be social,"

00:30:43.501 --> 00:30:45.334
all of sudden, I was like,
"Ah, yeah.

00:30:45.334 --> 00:30:48.634
That could be social and
that could be kind of neat."

00:30:48.634 --> 00:30:51.167
So at the beginning
of this presentation,

00:30:51.167 --> 00:30:52.467
I told you
we would talk about

00:30:52.467 --> 00:30:53.868
kind of the opportunities
and challenges

00:30:53.868 --> 00:30:57.167
for designing similarities
and differences

00:30:57.167 --> 00:30:58.834
and basically talk about
the basic building blocks.

00:30:58.834 --> 00:31:01.868
We talked about, you know,
remembering the right audience.

00:31:01.868 --> 00:31:04.334
You know, you've still got
your end users out there,

00:31:04.334 --> 00:31:06.801
but you've also got this new
site administrator audience

00:31:06.801 --> 00:31:07.968
that can really kind of

00:31:07.968 --> 00:31:09.634
unlock a lot
of doors for you, potentially.

00:31:09.634 --> 00:31:10.901
So you have to be, again,

00:31:10.901 --> 00:31:12.767
communicating
your value to them.

00:31:12.767 --> 00:31:15.267
And then we talked about
this framework

00:31:15.267 --> 00:31:16.534
that can kind of--
starting--

00:31:16.534 --> 00:31:18.133
start and get you going.

00:31:18.133 --> 00:31:20.000
So at the very least,
I hope I've caused you

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.033
to kind of think
about the potential

00:31:22.033 --> 00:31:24.501
for reaching out
onto the broader social web.

00:31:24.501 --> 00:31:27.067
And at best, maybe
you've started writing code.

00:31:27.067 --> 00:31:28.667
But probably not, 'cause Ryan
hasn't talked to you yet.

00:31:28.667 --> 00:31:30.634
But I'll hand it
back to him now

00:31:30.634 --> 00:31:32.801
and he'll talk about
some of the code implications

00:31:32.801 --> 00:31:34.300
for all this.

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:38.067
Cool.

00:31:38.067 --> 00:31:42.534
[applause]

00:31:42.534 --> 00:31:43.701
Boyd:
Well, thanks, Jonathan

00:31:43.701 --> 00:31:46.033
for a much better transition
than I gave you.

00:31:46.033 --> 00:31:47.467
But--
[laughs]

00:31:47.467 --> 00:31:50.501
OpenSocial--you've heard us
mention it a couple times.

00:31:50.501 --> 00:31:52.467
All the gadgets
for Google Friend Connect

00:31:52.467 --> 00:31:55.801
are built based on
the OpenSocial standard.

00:31:55.801 --> 00:31:57.968
So what are
the OpenSocial APIs?

00:31:57.968 --> 00:32:01.200
What is the standard?
Where did it come from?

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.167
It came from the idea
that the web is good,

00:32:04.167 --> 00:32:05.868
that social is good,

00:32:05.868 --> 00:32:08.434
but the social web can be
even better than that.

00:32:08.434 --> 00:32:10.767
So where can you
use these APIs?

00:32:10.767 --> 00:32:12.133
You can use these APIs

00:32:12.133 --> 00:32:15.434
on 25+ social networks
around the world.

00:32:15.434 --> 00:32:17.868
Here's a few examples

00:32:17.868 --> 00:32:19.667
of the different
social networks

00:32:19.667 --> 00:32:22.100
and other sites
which support

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.601
the Google Friend Connect
APIs.

00:32:24.601 --> 00:32:27.400
And so there are
set networks here

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.701
that are things like
traditional social networks

00:32:29.701 --> 00:32:31.667
that you go to
to interact with your friends.

00:32:31.667 --> 00:32:34.400
There are also sites here
such as LinkedIn

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.767
which is more of a business
network that you go to

00:32:36.767 --> 00:32:38.634
to establish
business relationships.

00:32:38.634 --> 00:32:42.133
And not only are the--these
25+ networks around the world,

00:32:42.133 --> 00:32:44.734
but keep in mind
the 5 million web sites

00:32:44.734 --> 00:32:47.834
which are also
OpenSocial containers

00:32:47.834 --> 00:32:52.033
built on top
of Google Friend Connect.

00:32:52.033 --> 00:32:55.467
There are, however,
some technical differences

00:32:55.467 --> 00:32:58.434
between what you do
to build a gadget

00:32:58.434 --> 00:33:00.801
for a traditional
social network

00:33:00.801 --> 00:33:02.701
and what you would do
to build a gadget

00:33:02.701 --> 00:33:04.133
for Google Friend Connect.

00:33:04.133 --> 00:33:06.567
So I'm going to try to untangle
a little bit of that mess

00:33:06.567 --> 00:33:08.467
in the next couple
of slides here.

00:33:08.467 --> 00:33:11.234
Maybe it's not a mess,
but anyway,

00:33:11.234 --> 00:33:12.501
there's some differences.

00:33:12.501 --> 00:33:14.834
So first of all,

00:33:14.834 --> 00:33:16.467
the types of data--

00:33:16.467 --> 00:33:17.634
with Google Friend Connect,

00:33:17.634 --> 00:33:19.167
and with all
OpenSocial containers,

00:33:19.167 --> 00:33:20.834
you have some basic
types of data:

00:33:20.834 --> 00:33:22.634
profiles and friends,

00:33:22.634 --> 00:33:24.934
which have,
in Friend Connect, an I.D.,

00:33:24.934 --> 00:33:26.567
a name,
a thumbnail URL,

00:33:26.567 --> 00:33:29.868
activities and messages,
and application data

00:33:29.868 --> 00:33:32.400
that is specific
to your individual gadget

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.000
or application.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.567
You can access all of this
using a couple different ways.

00:33:37.567 --> 00:33:41.033
You can access it
using client-side functionality,

00:33:41.033 --> 00:33:42.501
things like JavaScript,

00:33:42.501 --> 00:33:46.467
or in the new 0.9
implementation of OpenSocial--

00:33:46.467 --> 00:33:48.968
which Friend Connect,
as of today, supports.

00:33:48.968 --> 00:33:52.801
You can also access it
using OSML and Templates,

00:33:52.801 --> 00:33:54.534
which are
some different ways

00:33:54.534 --> 00:33:56.067
of developing applications.

00:33:56.067 --> 00:33:57.701
All three of these
allow you to do

00:33:57.701 --> 00:33:58.968
pretty much the same things,

00:33:58.968 --> 00:34:01.133
but the OSML and Templates

00:34:01.133 --> 00:34:03.634
allow you to do a little bit
easier development

00:34:03.634 --> 00:34:05.934
and make it a little bit
more performant.

00:34:05.934 --> 00:34:07.901
And then there's
the server-side access

00:34:07.901 --> 00:34:12.200
using REST
and RPC libraries.

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:13.968
So who are the people

00:34:13.968 --> 00:34:16.601
that are involved
in your Friend Connect gadgets

00:34:16.601 --> 00:34:18.501
or in any OpenSocial gadget?

00:34:18.501 --> 00:34:24.033
Basically you have the viewer
and you have the owner.

00:34:24.033 --> 00:34:25.734
The viewer--

00:34:25.734 --> 00:34:27.601
in traditional
social networks,

00:34:27.601 --> 00:34:29.701
the viewer is
the authenticated user

00:34:29.701 --> 00:34:31.701
who is using your app.

00:34:31.701 --> 00:34:34.400
When--when
they're viewing it,

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.367
it's the person
that's using it.

00:34:36.367 --> 00:34:37.701
In Google Friend Connect,

00:34:37.701 --> 00:34:39.367
the authen--
it's the same thing.

00:34:39.367 --> 00:34:40.601
It's the authenticated user

00:34:40.601 --> 00:34:42.300
who is viewing
your application.

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:45.801
However, you need to really
remember the anonymous user.

00:34:45.801 --> 00:34:47.367
So on those, like,

00:34:47.367 --> 00:34:49.934
5 million Google Friend Connect
enabled sites,

00:34:49.934 --> 00:34:53.767
they each get, you know,
tons and tons of page views.

00:34:53.767 --> 00:34:55.701
And of those
tons and tons of page views,

00:34:55.701 --> 00:34:57.868
a lot of them
are actually going to be

00:34:57.868 --> 00:35:00.767
logged out users.

00:35:00.767 --> 00:35:03.234
You're hoping that--
and, you know,

00:35:03.234 --> 00:35:05.300
keeping in mind when
you're designing your gadgets

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:08.367
that the logged in users
are the ones

00:35:08.367 --> 00:35:10.400
that are building the data

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.901
for the logged out
users to view

00:35:11.901 --> 00:35:14.100
and making it interesting
even for the logged out users.

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:16.968
So keep in mind
that the anonymous viewer

00:35:16.968 --> 00:35:18.467
is something special here

00:35:18.467 --> 00:35:19.701
with Google Friend
Connect gadgets.

00:35:19.701 --> 00:35:21.234
Usually
with traditional networks

00:35:21.234 --> 00:35:24.467
you don't have to worry
about that too much.

00:35:24.467 --> 00:35:27.200
So what information--when
you do have a logged in viewer,

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.667
what information
do you have?

00:35:28.667 --> 00:35:32.000
You have the I.D.,
ABOUT_ME,

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.033
PROFILE_URL,
and THUMBNAIL_URL.

00:35:34.033 --> 00:35:36.167
these are the core bits
of information

00:35:36.167 --> 00:35:39.934
that you need to use
to make a gadget more social.

00:35:39.934 --> 00:35:42.801
The I.D. is simply
a long string of numbers,

00:35:42.801 --> 00:35:47.501
the ABOUT_ME is a string
that the user defines

00:35:47.501 --> 00:35:49.267
to describe,
like, you know,

00:35:49.267 --> 00:35:52.167
in a Twitter sort of
140 characters or less usually

00:35:52.167 --> 00:35:54.667
string about
who the person is,

00:35:54.667 --> 00:35:56.701
a PROFILE_URL,

00:35:56.701 --> 00:35:58.868
which allows you
to link off to their profile,

00:35:58.868 --> 00:36:03.100
and a THUMBNAIL_URL,
which is their picture.

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:05.200
In traditional
social networks,

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.400
you have some additional
profile data.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.901
So you can see
some listed here.

00:36:09.901 --> 00:36:11.734
The darker ones are ones

00:36:11.734 --> 00:36:13.968
that aren't currently available
in Google Friend Connect

00:36:13.968 --> 00:36:17.501
but are available on some
traditional social networks.

00:36:17.501 --> 00:36:21.667
But things like, you know,
SMOKER or DRINKER--

00:36:21.667 --> 00:36:23.501
are those things
that you really care about

00:36:23.501 --> 00:36:24.767
when you're building
your gadgets?

00:36:24.767 --> 00:36:26.367
Probably not,

00:36:26.367 --> 00:36:30.133
unless you're trying
to advertise tobacco products

00:36:30.133 --> 00:36:32.801
or advertise alcohol.

00:36:32.801 --> 00:36:34.801
Those are things
that you just don't care about.

00:36:34.801 --> 00:36:37.234
So Friend Connect
does allow you access

00:36:37.234 --> 00:36:39.868
to the core bits of data,
which are available

00:36:39.868 --> 00:36:44.334
regardless of what site
the user is connected to

00:36:44.334 --> 00:36:47.000
for their profile
in Friend Connect.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.868
So in addition
to the viewer,

00:36:48.868 --> 00:36:50.234
you have the owner.

00:36:50.234 --> 00:36:51.834
In traditional networks,

00:36:51.834 --> 00:36:54.267
the owner is the user
who installed the app

00:36:54.267 --> 00:36:57.100
that is currently
being viewed.

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:59.667
It's really the same thing
with Friend Connect

00:36:59.667 --> 00:37:01.300
but there's a little bit
of a difference here.

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:04.868
The user that installed the app
is really the site.

00:37:04.868 --> 00:37:07.234
So in the example of,
you know,

00:37:07.234 --> 00:37:08.434
a traditional
social network,

00:37:08.434 --> 00:37:10.801
you don't have
an I.D. number

00:37:10.801 --> 00:37:12.033
that represents a web site.

00:37:12.033 --> 00:37:13.400
In Friend Connect, you do.

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.334
So this long number here

00:37:15.334 --> 00:37:19.334
is the I.D. for
the chatbotc.com web site.

00:37:19.334 --> 00:37:22.467
That's a web site that
has a blog and all on it

00:37:22.467 --> 00:37:25.400
from one of our other
developer advocates.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.100
And in addition to that,

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:29.534
you have a PROFILE_URL
for that site.

00:37:29.534 --> 00:37:31.934
So if you look
at that site's friends,

00:37:31.934 --> 00:37:34.734
it's actually
all the members of the site.

00:37:34.734 --> 00:37:36.667
And that's--so that's
some interesting information

00:37:36.667 --> 00:37:40.067
that you can get by looking
at the friends of a user,

00:37:40.067 --> 00:37:43.901
which in this case
is the web site.

00:37:43.901 --> 00:37:47.100
So I'm going to talk to you
about a couple different ways

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:49.467
to use the page context

00:37:49.467 --> 00:37:51.834
to build better gadgets.

00:37:51.834 --> 00:37:54.267
Just as you wouldn't expect
to see a toilet

00:37:54.267 --> 00:37:55.801
sitting out
in the middle of the street,

00:37:55.801 --> 00:37:58.033
you also probably
wouldn't expect to see

00:37:58.033 --> 00:38:00.334
a Tetris game
on a stock blog

00:38:00.334 --> 00:38:01.901
or, you know,
something like that.

00:38:01.901 --> 00:38:03.767
So you need
to keep that in mind

00:38:03.767 --> 00:38:05.934
as you're building
your gadgets.

00:38:05.934 --> 00:38:07.267
You can keep in mind

00:38:07.267 --> 00:38:10.033
the content of the page
or the blog.

00:38:10.033 --> 00:38:11.567
In this case,
I'm going to show you

00:38:11.567 --> 00:38:14.434
some APIs
that exist in Blogger.

00:38:14.434 --> 00:38:17.067
So Blogger implements
Google Friend Connect

00:38:17.067 --> 00:38:19.868
for many, many blogs
and it's by--

00:38:19.868 --> 00:38:23.000
implemented by default
for new blogs.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.167
And Blogger
provides some APIs

00:38:25.167 --> 00:38:26.868
for Friend Connect gadgets

00:38:26.868 --> 00:38:28.767
which allow you
to get access

00:38:28.767 --> 00:38:31.167
to the content
of the posts in the blog

00:38:31.167 --> 00:38:33.634
and the content of
the comments in the blog.

00:38:33.634 --> 00:38:37.834
Why might you
want to use this?

00:38:37.834 --> 00:38:40.667
So imagine this--
you have a blog.

00:38:40.667 --> 00:38:43.434
You only have
a couple of followers

00:38:43.434 --> 00:38:44.901
and you have some friends

00:38:44.901 --> 00:38:48.300
that are also
following your blog.

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.467
And your blog has
pictures of your puppy.

00:38:50.467 --> 00:38:52.501
Think about
this conversation here.

00:38:52.501 --> 00:38:56.334
You know, someone comments,
"Digit is so cute."

00:38:56.334 --> 00:38:58.234
If you haven't figured it out,
Digit's my dog.

00:38:58.234 --> 00:39:00.734
But some people were commenting,
"Digit is so cute."

00:39:00.734 --> 00:39:03.968
John says, "Too girly.
I want a real dog."

00:39:03.968 --> 00:39:06.868
And believe me,
people have told me this.

00:39:06.868 --> 00:39:08.901
And Jane says,
"Awww, John is nuts."

00:39:08.901 --> 00:39:11.267
And then there's a conversation
that goes back and forth

00:39:11.267 --> 00:39:12.601
in the blog on the comments.

00:39:12.601 --> 00:39:14.300
But what do you
really care about?

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:17.734
In this case, you know,
I have a very popular blog

00:39:17.734 --> 00:39:20.234
with, I don't know,
420-some--

00:39:20.234 --> 00:39:24.501
420--4 mill--
thousand comments on it.

00:39:24.501 --> 00:39:27.033
You really care about
filtering that information

00:39:27.033 --> 00:39:29.901
down to what
is interesting to you,

00:39:29.901 --> 00:39:31.734
and oftentimes,
what is interesting to you

00:39:31.734 --> 00:39:34.400
is the comments that
were made by your friends.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.567
So I care that Jane said,
"Digit is so cute,"

00:39:37.567 --> 00:39:39.567
and I care that she said,
"John is nuts."

00:39:39.567 --> 00:39:42.367
But I really don't care
that John said

00:39:42.367 --> 00:39:45.133
Digit is "too girly"
and he wants "a real dog,"

00:39:45.133 --> 00:39:47.801
because I like my dog
perfectly fine.

00:39:47.801 --> 00:39:51.901
All right, so here's
some code that does this.

00:39:51.901 --> 00:39:55.534
This is using the content
of the comments

00:39:55.534 --> 00:40:00.100
and allowing you
to build up a gadget like that.

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:03.300
So I apologize I'm not
going line by line through this,

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:04.834
but basically
what we're doing

00:40:04.834 --> 00:40:07.167
is we're looping through
all the comments,

00:40:07.167 --> 00:40:09.400
we're looking at the author,

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.100
and we're checking to see

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:13.901
if the author is
in my array of friends.

00:40:13.901 --> 00:40:16.000
And if the author is
in my array of friends,

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.067
then I highlight
that comment.

00:40:18.067 --> 00:40:22.267
So now I don't have to look
at all 424,000 comments

00:40:22.267 --> 00:40:23.567
on my blog,

00:40:23.567 --> 00:40:27.334
I can just look
at the ones I care about.

00:40:27.334 --> 00:40:30.033
So--skinning your gadgets.

00:40:30.033 --> 00:40:32.567
Jonathan brought this up
a little bit earlier,

00:40:32.567 --> 00:40:35.400
but basically
I want to stress the point

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.434
that you need
to really fit your gadgets

00:40:37.434 --> 00:40:40.267
into the design
and style of the web site--

00:40:40.267 --> 00:40:43.534
and not only the design
and style of your web site,

00:40:43.534 --> 00:40:46.167
but the design and style of
every single web site out there

00:40:46.167 --> 00:40:48.901
that wants
to use your gadget.

00:40:48.901 --> 00:40:50.601
Jonathan
gave an example earlier,

00:40:50.601 --> 00:40:52.000
but I'll give you
another one,

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.267
showing some more pictures
of my dog here.

00:40:54.267 --> 00:40:57.734
Number one is a gadget

00:40:57.734 --> 00:40:59.734
that is installed by default

00:40:59.734 --> 00:41:02.100
when you create a new blog,

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:04.300
and that's
the Followers gadget.

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.334
And you can see
how well integrated

00:41:06.334 --> 00:41:07.734
it is into the page--

00:41:07.734 --> 00:41:11.133
uses the same colors
and the same style.

00:41:11.133 --> 00:41:14.868
But number two here is one
of the Friend Connect gadgets

00:41:14.868 --> 00:41:17.200
that I just copied
and pasted the code here

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.901
using the default colors.

00:41:19.901 --> 00:41:22.000
As a gadget developer,

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.934
I would hope that I would
allow site administrators

00:41:24.934 --> 00:41:28.067
to build gadgets
a little bit better

00:41:28.067 --> 00:41:30.501
or to install gadgets

00:41:30.501 --> 00:41:31.934
that are built
a little bit better

00:41:31.934 --> 00:41:34.067
and integrate well
into their sites.

00:41:34.067 --> 00:41:36.234
So we do allow that.

00:41:36.234 --> 00:41:38.634
Basically every time
a site administrator

00:41:38.634 --> 00:41:40.400
goes and installs a gadget

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.767
on a Friend Connect
enabled web site,

00:41:42.767 --> 00:41:46.334
they get prompted for a list
of a bunch of things here.

00:41:46.334 --> 00:41:48.367
And that list
of a bunch of things

00:41:48.367 --> 00:41:52.667
includes preferences
like, you know--

00:41:52.667 --> 00:41:54.567
you know,
what should I call this

00:41:54.567 --> 00:41:56.267
or what time zone are you in
and things like that.

00:41:56.267 --> 00:41:58.234
But it also includes styles.

00:41:58.234 --> 00:42:00.067
The styles
that are included

00:42:00.067 --> 00:42:02.267
are things like the colors

00:42:02.267 --> 00:42:04.667
for various parts
of the gadget.

00:42:04.667 --> 00:42:07.334
So you have colors
for the top of the gadget,

00:42:07.334 --> 00:42:09.000
the end caps
as we call them,

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.300
you have colors
for the borders

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:12.834
and the font text
and all that.

00:42:12.834 --> 00:42:15.534
At the time a site administrator
fills this out,

00:42:15.534 --> 00:42:17.300
it gen--generates code

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:20.400
that they copy and paste
into their site.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:24.200
And that code
includes the style preferences

00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:25.701
that they've set here.

00:42:25.701 --> 00:42:27.067
And in things like Blogger,

00:42:27.067 --> 00:42:29.868
these values
are automatically applied

00:42:29.868 --> 00:42:32.334
based off of what template
the user has

00:42:32.334 --> 00:42:34.234
or the site administrator
has chosen.

00:42:34.234 --> 00:42:36.868
They don't have to manually
select the colors.

00:42:36.868 --> 00:42:39.033
But as a gadget developer,

00:42:39.033 --> 00:42:40.801
how do you
use this information?

00:42:40.801 --> 00:42:43.033
Basically there
are a set of properties.

00:42:43.033 --> 00:42:44.834
You can read through
the list here.

00:42:44.834 --> 00:42:46.534
I'm not going to go
into each of them,

00:42:46.534 --> 00:42:48.033
but they are
a set of properties

00:42:48.033 --> 00:42:50.334
that represent
the colors and the font faces

00:42:50.334 --> 00:42:52.033
and things like that.

00:42:52.033 --> 00:42:54.868
And those properties
are all accessible

00:42:54.868 --> 00:42:58.367
from within a gadget.

00:42:58.367 --> 00:43:00.200
So here's a list
of some more properties,

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.267
but again,
you can see these slides

00:43:02.267 --> 00:43:05.901
after I/O online.

00:43:05.901 --> 00:43:08.701
So after those properties
are defined--

00:43:08.701 --> 00:43:10.434
so the site administrator

00:43:10.434 --> 00:43:12.100
defines the values
of each of those colors

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:14.434
and they, you know--
becomes passed into the gadget

00:43:14.434 --> 00:43:15.767
as properties.

00:43:15.767 --> 00:43:17.467
You can then,
as a gadget developer,

00:43:17.467 --> 00:43:19.000
get those properties out

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.367
by declaring that you're
using the optional feature skins

00:43:22.367 --> 00:43:24.801
and then,
in your JavaScript,

00:43:24.801 --> 00:43:26.701
going through
and setting the style

00:43:26.701 --> 00:43:31.400
on various CSS elements.

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.801
So after we do that,

00:43:33.801 --> 00:43:36.133
after we make
our gadget skinnable,

00:43:36.133 --> 00:43:38.267
then a site administrator
can make the gadget

00:43:38.267 --> 00:43:41.634
integrate well
into their site as you see here.

00:43:41.634 --> 00:43:46.501
So we've talked about fitting
into the content of the site,

00:43:46.501 --> 00:43:50.167
and we've talked about fitting
into the style of the site.

00:43:50.167 --> 00:43:53.167
You also need to keep in mind
language,

00:43:53.167 --> 00:43:54.868
like Jonathan
alluded to earlier.

00:43:54.868 --> 00:43:57.400
So in traditional
social networks,

00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.901
you go and develop a gadget
and you say,

00:43:59.901 --> 00:44:03.934
"I want to make that a gadget
available on MySpace."

00:44:03.934 --> 00:44:05.367
And I know MySpace

00:44:05.367 --> 00:44:07.567
has a primarily
English-speaking audience,

00:44:07.567 --> 00:44:11.667
so you really only care
about the English speakers.

00:44:11.667 --> 00:44:13.767
And your gadget
is only in English,

00:44:13.767 --> 00:44:15.133
and that's fine with you.

00:44:15.133 --> 00:44:17.100
And you're getting the audience
that MySpace gives you.

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:18.667
With Google Friend Connect,
your--

00:44:18.667 --> 00:44:21.501
the site administrators
can actually be

00:44:21.501 --> 00:44:22.767
all throughout the world,

00:44:22.767 --> 00:44:24.801
speaking in all sorts
of different languages,

00:44:24.801 --> 00:44:27.367
and audiences in all sorts
of different languages.

00:44:27.367 --> 00:44:30.334
So when you go
and submit your gadget

00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:33.367
to the Friend Connect
Gadget Gallery--

00:44:33.367 --> 00:44:35.100
which I'm going to give you
a preview of

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:36.567
here in a second--

00:44:36.567 --> 00:44:38.534
when you go and submit
your gadget to that,

00:44:38.534 --> 00:44:40.901
you don't know what the--

00:44:40.901 --> 00:44:43.434
what
the site administrators are,

00:44:43.434 --> 00:44:45.033
what language they're speaking,
and what the--

00:44:45.033 --> 00:44:47.400
the audience that
they're trying to attract is

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:48.901
and what language
they're speaking.

00:44:48.901 --> 00:44:50.567
So you want
to keep into account

00:44:50.567 --> 00:44:52.100
that information.

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:54.033
There's--localization
is possible

00:44:54.033 --> 00:44:55.267
with Google Friend Connect

00:44:55.267 --> 00:44:57.601
using the standard
OpenSocial APIs.

00:44:57.601 --> 00:44:58.968
There is nothing new here.

00:44:58.968 --> 00:45:01.367
This is just standard
vanilla OpenSocial,

00:45:01.367 --> 00:45:03.000
so I'm not going to dive
into the details.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.467
But basically
you define message bundles,

00:45:05.467 --> 00:45:08.400
and those message bundles
represent the strings

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:10.033
for different languages.

00:45:10.033 --> 00:45:11.767
And then in your gadget,

00:45:11.767 --> 00:45:13.467
you point
to those message bundles.

00:45:13.467 --> 00:45:15.367
But keep that in mind
with Google Friend Connect

00:45:15.367 --> 00:45:17.868
specifically.

00:45:17.868 --> 00:45:20.501
So now if we rewind
a little bit here

00:45:20.501 --> 00:45:23.467
and give you a recap of what
we've talked about here today--

00:45:23.467 --> 00:45:28.234
we talked about how
to design applications.

00:45:28.234 --> 00:45:31.000
Jonathan talked
in more detail about that.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.801
We also talked about
how to develop code.

00:45:33.801 --> 00:45:38.100
We talked about the 5 million
Google Friend Connect sites

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:39.367
out there.

00:45:39.367 --> 00:45:42.968
But the key question is:

00:45:42.968 --> 00:45:45.367
What's the growth look like?

00:45:45.367 --> 00:45:48.467
And we also talked about
the 100,000 new members

00:45:48.467 --> 00:45:50.767
of these sites every day.

00:45:50.767 --> 00:45:53.367
But how do you
reach your users?

00:45:53.367 --> 00:45:56.100
You're not going to go out
and list your application

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:57.367
inside the Yellow Pages.

00:45:57.367 --> 00:45:58.734
That would be silly.

00:45:58.734 --> 00:46:01.033
I don't know many people
that look to the Yellow Pages

00:46:01.033 --> 00:46:03.167
for figuring out
what gadgets to install

00:46:03.167 --> 00:46:04.601
on their web sites.

00:46:04.601 --> 00:46:07.968
But you can list
your application

00:46:07.968 --> 00:46:10.067
in the Google Friend Connect
Gadget Gallery.

00:46:10.067 --> 00:46:11.934
So up until now

00:46:11.934 --> 00:46:14.767
this has been
a pretty static gallery

00:46:14.767 --> 00:46:16.734
that we have manually
added some gadgets to.

00:46:16.734 --> 00:46:19.133
There's a couple external
contributed gadgets

00:46:19.133 --> 00:46:21.067
but there's something
like ten gadgets in here.

00:46:21.067 --> 00:46:24.400
Today we're announcing
that everyone can go out there

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:26.467
and build Google
Friend Connect gadgets

00:46:26.467 --> 00:46:29.267
and then have them
listed in the Gadget Gallery.

00:46:29.267 --> 00:46:31.434
So you have
those 5 million sites to--

00:46:31.434 --> 00:46:34.501
to have as your audience
for your gadget.

00:46:34.501 --> 00:46:37.234
There's 100,000 new people
on those sites every day.

00:46:37.234 --> 00:46:38.834
You can go to this form,

00:46:38.834 --> 00:46:41.133
fill out--
pass your gadget URL

00:46:41.133 --> 00:46:42.634
and accept
the terms of service,

00:46:42.634 --> 00:46:45.767
and submit your gadget
to be included in a directory

00:46:45.767 --> 00:46:49.400
that everyone
as a site administrator can use

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.467
to then install your gadget.

00:46:51.467 --> 00:46:53.467
Keep in mind,

00:46:53.467 --> 00:46:56.834
like, time is a really
valuable thing here.

00:46:56.834 --> 00:47:01.501
And right now is really
the best time for you out there

00:47:01.501 --> 00:47:03.234
and--develop
Friend Connect Gadgets.

00:47:03.234 --> 00:47:04.601
And the reason that is

00:47:04.601 --> 00:47:07.067
is there are ten gadgets
or something like that

00:47:07.067 --> 00:47:09.567
in the directory
right now.

00:47:09.567 --> 00:47:10.834
So you can get out there

00:47:10.834 --> 00:47:12.300
and get a little bit
of the first mover advantage

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:14.167
and get a lot of users
right away

00:47:14.167 --> 00:47:17.400
if you submit
to the Gadget Gallery soon.

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:20.834
Now there's also
the Blogger Gadget Gallery.

00:47:20.834 --> 00:47:23.968
So I mentioned that Blogger
installs Google Friend Connect

00:47:23.968 --> 00:47:26.133
on all sites
by default now.

00:47:26.133 --> 00:47:28.601
And there are many,
many blogs out there

00:47:28.601 --> 00:47:30.100
with Google Friend Connect
on them.

00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.467
They do have
a separate gallery currently,

00:47:32.467 --> 00:47:35.367
but the submission process
is very similar

00:47:35.367 --> 00:47:37.033
and you can see
the screenshots

00:47:37.033 --> 00:47:38.400
don't really change
that much.

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:41.167
And you can go out there
and submit your gadget

00:47:41.167 --> 00:47:43.567
both to the Friend Connect
Gadget Gallery

00:47:43.567 --> 00:47:45.067
and the Blogger Gadget Gallery

00:47:45.067 --> 00:47:47.033
provided it
fits that audience.

00:47:47.033 --> 00:47:49.901
So for more information
about Google Friend Connect,

00:47:49.901 --> 00:47:52.000
you can visit this URL.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.868
This URL will allow you
as a site administrator

00:47:54.868 --> 00:47:56.968
to get Friend Connect
installed on your web site

00:47:56.968 --> 00:48:00.167
super, super quickly
with some copy and paste code.

00:48:00.167 --> 00:48:01.968
It will also link off
to our presence

00:48:01.968 --> 00:48:03.801
on code.google.com,

00:48:03.801 --> 00:48:06.667
which has a lot more
detailed information

00:48:06.667 --> 00:48:09.200
for developers
to build gadgets

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:11.234
and also to integrate
Friend Connect

00:48:11.234 --> 00:48:14.200
deeply into their site.

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:16.968
And now I'm going to ask
Jonathan to come back up here

00:48:16.968 --> 00:48:19.300
and we're gonna take
questions and answer and--

00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:21.367
well, we're gonna take questions
and we're gonna give answers.

00:48:21.367 --> 00:48:22.934
[Terleski giggles]

00:48:22.934 --> 00:48:26.033
You can post your questions
at the Google Moderator page

00:48:26.033 --> 00:48:27.667
listed at the bottom here.

00:48:27.667 --> 00:48:29.133
And I'm gonna open it up
here in a second.

00:48:29.133 --> 00:48:31.834
You're also--feel free
to come up to the microphones

00:48:31.834 --> 00:48:34.801
and ask questions
in person.

00:48:34.801 --> 00:48:36.868
So I'll leave this up here
for just a second

00:48:36.868 --> 00:48:38.901
before I pull into Moderator.

00:48:38.901 --> 00:48:41.400
Terleski:
Go ahead.

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:42.968
man: Hi,
I was just wondering--

00:48:42.968 --> 00:48:44.501
wondering if you could
talk a little bit about

00:48:44.501 --> 00:48:47.267
the intersection between
Web Elements and Friend Connect,

00:48:47.267 --> 00:48:48.934
and if there's any.

00:48:48.934 --> 00:48:50.367
Boyd:
So one of the elements

00:48:50.367 --> 00:48:52.567
that Vic demonstrated
earlier today

00:48:52.567 --> 00:48:54.267
was the Conversations
element.

00:48:54.267 --> 00:48:58.868
And the Conversations element
is actually built

00:48:58.868 --> 00:49:01.267
on top of some of the similar
infrastructure at Google

00:49:01.267 --> 00:49:03.000
as Friend Connect.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.534
And, you know, is--
basically allows you

00:49:04.534 --> 00:49:06.200
to do that commenting
sort of gadget.

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:08.033
The idea behind Elements

00:49:08.033 --> 00:49:10.334
is that you can
just copy and paste

00:49:10.334 --> 00:49:11.701
a tiny bit of code

00:49:11.701 --> 00:49:14.267
and put that
into your web site

00:49:14.267 --> 00:49:15.767
and get up and running,

00:49:15.767 --> 00:49:17.901
and that's what you can do
with the Conversations element.

00:49:17.901 --> 00:49:21.234
With Friend Connect, there's
one little tiny bit more

00:49:21.234 --> 00:49:23.868
you have to do to have a full
Friend Connect implementation,

00:49:23.868 --> 00:49:26.767
and that's upload two files
to your web server right now.

00:49:26.767 --> 00:49:29.133
But we give you those files
and it's really easy to do.

00:49:29.133 --> 00:49:32.501
So, you know,
it basically depends on how--

00:49:32.501 --> 00:49:34.434
how much work
you're planning on doing.

00:49:34.434 --> 00:49:36.100
If you can upload
two files to your server,

00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:38.567
then you can up--
then you can go

00:49:38.567 --> 00:49:40.868
for the full
Friend Connect installation,

00:49:40.868 --> 00:49:42.133
and that allows you

00:49:42.133 --> 00:49:43.968
to have some more
social conversations and all

00:49:43.968 --> 00:49:45.234
on your site

00:49:45.234 --> 00:49:46.701
and allow the users
to interact back and forth,

00:49:46.701 --> 00:49:48.701
and you can install
other Friend Connect gadgets.

00:49:48.701 --> 00:49:51.400
But if you're looking for just
that commenting sort of gadget

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:54.234
then the element that Vic
talked about at the keynote

00:49:54.234 --> 00:49:57.100
works fine for you.

00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:59.567
man: Can I ask
is there any impact

00:49:59.567 --> 00:50:01.467
that these Google Gadgets--

00:50:01.467 --> 00:50:03.434
if they're proliferated
to other sites--

00:50:03.434 --> 00:50:05.734
will have
on the Google ranking

00:50:05.734 --> 00:50:07.834
for the page for which
they're referenced to?

00:50:07.834 --> 00:50:09.033
Boyd:
Absolutely none.

00:50:09.033 --> 00:50:11.334
I mean, the--the gadgets
have nothing to do

00:50:11.334 --> 00:50:14.300
with our web search
ranking algorithms.

00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:16.634
All right, let's go
to the question here.

00:50:16.634 --> 00:50:19.167
"What Android release

00:50:19.167 --> 00:50:21.467
"will these types
of Google Gadgets land on?

00:50:21.467 --> 00:50:23.367
"Will they be rendered
via webkit

00:50:23.367 --> 00:50:24.968
"on the Android home screen?

00:50:24.968 --> 00:50:27.400
"Are there additional design/
development considerations

00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:28.868
that come into play
for Android?"

00:50:28.868 --> 00:50:30.634
I can't really speak to that.

00:50:30.634 --> 00:50:32.634
Right now
Google Friend Connect

00:50:32.634 --> 00:50:35.434
is a product
that's targeted at web sites

00:50:35.434 --> 00:50:38.501
and to allow you to easily
have that social interaction

00:50:38.501 --> 00:50:40.000
on your web site.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.968
We don't have--or I don't
have any information

00:50:42.968 --> 00:50:44.801
on how this
would impact Android.

00:50:44.801 --> 00:50:47.501
Terleski:
Yeah, I think the...

00:50:47.501 --> 00:50:50.667
again, the context is--
is for web sites.

00:50:50.667 --> 00:50:53.067
And so I think kind of
how you would end up

00:50:53.067 --> 00:50:54.634
seeing them on Android,
right,

00:50:54.634 --> 00:50:56.200
is you'd be launching your
browser and going to a web site

00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:57.634
and that would render,

00:50:57.634 --> 00:50:59.067
and you would be interacting
with the gadget

00:50:59.067 --> 00:51:00.334
just like you would if
you were on a desktop machine.

00:51:00.334 --> 00:51:02.801
Again, these gadgets
are kind of about

00:51:02.801 --> 00:51:04.634
letting site owners
imbue their sites

00:51:04.634 --> 00:51:06.334
with social functionality,

00:51:06.334 --> 00:51:08.334
not so much, you know,
breaking out gadgets

00:51:08.334 --> 00:51:11.000
as a type of
a dashboard-y type thing.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.901
Boyd: But I can give you
a little bit of a plug

00:51:12.901 --> 00:51:14.434
for a session
I'm doing tomorrow

00:51:14.434 --> 00:51:17.968
on using OpenSocial
on mobile devices,

00:51:17.968 --> 00:51:20.467
and that dives into more
using the raw APIs

00:51:20.467 --> 00:51:22.133
of OpenSocial--
not Friend Connect,

00:51:22.133 --> 00:51:23.767
but the raw APIs
of OpenSocial

00:51:23.767 --> 00:51:25.701
to make mobile apps

00:51:25.701 --> 00:51:28.200
a little bit more
interactive and social.

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:30.334
woman:
Hi, I was wondering--

00:51:30.334 --> 00:51:32.467
Boyd: Oh, actually, Sami--
Sami here

00:51:32.467 --> 00:51:35.367
is the tech lead
for Google Friend Connect,

00:51:35.367 --> 00:51:37.434
so welcome, everyone,
to Sami.

00:51:37.434 --> 00:51:38.868
[applause]

00:51:38.868 --> 00:51:40.334
Terleski: [laughs]
Whose mic do you want?

00:51:40.334 --> 00:51:41.501
Boyd:
You can just--

00:51:41.501 --> 00:51:43.534
Shalabi: One additional
point about mobile,

00:51:43.534 --> 00:51:46.701
I mean, we do have
a restful API to the service

00:51:46.701 --> 00:51:48.667
which means you can
still build mobile apps

00:51:48.667 --> 00:51:52.467
that leverage
that restful API.

00:51:52.467 --> 00:51:54.901
Boyd:
Thanks, Sami.

00:51:54.901 --> 00:51:56.300
[chuckles]

00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:58.834
woman: So I was wondering
if there is any infrastructure

00:51:58.834 --> 00:52:00.767
in which...

00:52:00.767 --> 00:52:03.534
the gadgets can communicate
among each other,

00:52:03.534 --> 00:52:05.167
like a selection in a gadget

00:52:05.167 --> 00:52:07.200
would control the content
in another gadget

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.934
or something similar.

00:52:08.934 --> 00:52:12.467
So we don't currently have
cross-gadget communication

00:52:12.467 --> 00:52:14.167
built into
Google Friend Connect.

00:52:14.167 --> 00:52:17.334
However, a lot of gadgets
with OpenSocial

00:52:17.334 --> 00:52:20.000
do have back-end servers.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.467
So, you know,
some of the apps

00:52:21.467 --> 00:52:22.968
that I'll show in
the mobile session or whatever--

00:52:22.968 --> 00:52:24.200
I use App Engine
as a back end.

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:26.934
And there are a lot of different
OpenSocial gadgets

00:52:26.934 --> 00:52:28.167
which would do that.

00:52:28.167 --> 00:52:29.868
So you could easily,
in a gadget,

00:52:29.868 --> 00:52:31.968
ping your back-end server
with some information

00:52:31.968 --> 00:52:34.734
and have it--that affect
another gadget.

00:52:34.734 --> 00:52:36.934
But right now,

00:52:36.934 --> 00:52:38.868
primarily
the way security works

00:52:38.868 --> 00:52:40.767
between IFRAMEs--

00:52:40.767 --> 00:52:43.834
there is no way to communicate
between the gadgets.

00:52:43.834 --> 00:52:45.968
woman: Can I ask another
short question?

00:52:45.968 --> 00:52:47.400
Boyd:
Sure.

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:50.634
woman: So I--I didn't get,
I think, the first part.

00:52:50.634 --> 00:52:54.167
So the Google Friend Connect--

00:52:54.167 --> 00:52:56.234
does it have, like,
the whole infrastructure

00:52:56.234 --> 00:52:57.868
where you place
the gadget that--

00:52:57.868 --> 00:52:59.234
does it remember those things

00:52:59.234 --> 00:53:00.968
or is it just--
it's not that much?

00:53:00.968 --> 00:53:04.801
It's like if you
place two gadgets

00:53:04.801 --> 00:53:07.534
somewhere, I don't--
on a web site,

00:53:07.534 --> 00:53:11.467
does it somehow
store that configuration?

00:53:11.467 --> 00:53:14.434
Or is it
like a portal in a way?

00:53:14.434 --> 00:53:16.267
Or is it not so much?

00:53:16.267 --> 00:53:18.033
Boyd:
So...

00:53:18.033 --> 00:53:20.667
there's no,
like, templates defined

00:53:20.667 --> 00:53:22.133
that say, like, you know,

00:53:22.133 --> 00:53:24.267
"When you install one gadget,

00:53:24.267 --> 00:53:25.868
install these three others
with it."

00:53:25.868 --> 00:53:27.167
There's nothing like that.

00:53:27.167 --> 00:53:29.234
From a site administrator's
viewpoint,

00:53:29.234 --> 00:53:32.133
they're choosing individually
what gadgets to install.

00:53:32.133 --> 00:53:35.567
So you could easily
make a web site

00:53:35.567 --> 00:53:38.868
that is kind of like a portal

00:53:38.868 --> 00:53:40.667
using Google Friend Connect
gadgets.

00:53:40.667 --> 00:53:43.000
But you as a site administrator
right now

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.534
would be choosing what gadgets
to embed on that page.

00:53:45.534 --> 00:53:47.133
There might be some,
you know,

00:53:47.133 --> 00:53:49.667
ways to--
to do it differently

00:53:49.667 --> 00:53:50.968
and have your users
choose it,

00:53:50.968 --> 00:53:52.667
but that's not
available by default.

00:53:52.667 --> 00:53:53.934
woman:
Okay, thanks.

00:53:53.934 --> 00:53:55.234
Terleski: It might have been
good for us to show

00:53:55.234 --> 00:53:57.334
an actual snippet up here
of what it looks like,

00:53:57.334 --> 00:53:58.734
what the site
administrator's grabbing.

00:53:58.734 --> 00:54:01.033
But they're essentially
grabbing, you know,

00:54:01.033 --> 00:54:03.501
what amounts to an IFRAME
and dropping it on their site.

00:54:03.501 --> 00:54:05.868
To give you some idea of--

00:54:05.868 --> 00:54:10.000
man:
About the Canvas view,

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.968
that works really awesome
on iGoogle

00:54:12.968 --> 00:54:15.334
so that we can design
things that then float out.

00:54:15.334 --> 00:54:19.434
But it seems that
we have to design our own--

00:54:19.434 --> 00:54:22.033
like we can't use
the Google Gadget container

00:54:22.033 --> 00:54:24.734
on other sites, 'cause
it's stuck in an IFRAME,

00:54:24.734 --> 00:54:26.234
so it can't Canvas out.

00:54:26.234 --> 00:54:29.400
Am I just wrong about that,
or is there a simple way to...

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.267
Boyd: So one of those--
one of those two files

00:54:32.267 --> 00:54:34.234
that you upload
that I was referring to in--

00:54:34.234 --> 00:54:36.467
in the difference between
the Conversation element

00:54:36.467 --> 00:54:37.934
and Google Friend Connect--

00:54:37.934 --> 00:54:39.934
one of the two files with
Friend Connect that you upload

00:54:39.934 --> 00:54:41.534
is a Canvas page,

00:54:41.534 --> 00:54:43.467
which is like canvas.html.

00:54:43.467 --> 00:54:45.834
By default
it's configured with a style

00:54:45.834 --> 00:54:49.033
that, you know,
is just a default style.

00:54:49.033 --> 00:54:50.601
But you can go in
as a site administrator

00:54:50.601 --> 00:54:52.434
and customize
the style of that page.

00:54:52.434 --> 00:54:55.000
And then anytime you go
to the Canvas view

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.133
on a gadget
that's on your site,

00:54:57.133 --> 00:54:59.501
it redirects over
to that page

00:54:59.501 --> 00:55:01.367
and then, you know,
brings the gadget

00:55:01.367 --> 00:55:02.901
into full size there.

00:55:02.901 --> 00:55:04.467
man: I see,
so if someone else

00:55:04.467 --> 00:55:06.467
installs your gadget
on their site,

00:55:06.467 --> 00:55:08.567
and you're using
that feature...

00:55:08.567 --> 00:55:12.267
Boyd: If someone else installs
your gadget on their site,

00:55:12.267 --> 00:55:14.834
it will redirect
over to their Canvas page

00:55:14.834 --> 00:55:17.767
with the Gadget
at full size.

00:55:17.767 --> 00:55:20.234
Then they can configure
how that Canvas page looks.

00:55:20.234 --> 00:55:22.801
If you come up afterwards,
I can give you a demonstration

00:55:22.801 --> 00:55:24.133
of that too.

00:55:24.133 --> 00:55:25.701
Terleski: I think we're
being told to wrap it up.

00:55:25.701 --> 00:55:26.968
Boyd: All right.
We're actually about--being--

00:55:26.968 --> 00:55:28.400
Terleski: So if you
have questions, come on up.

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:29.834
And we can chat some more.
Boyd: Yep.

00:55:29.834 --> 00:55:33.767
[applause]
