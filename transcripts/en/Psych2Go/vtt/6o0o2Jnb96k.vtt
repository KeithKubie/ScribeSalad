00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.769
Hello, today I'm Psych2Go's volunteer. My
name is Maykol, I'm 17 and I enjoy long romantic

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.420
walks down the beach. Today's article is about
people who tend to sleep late have a higher

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.099
IQ by Risha Maes. Risha Maes got to
study with Psychologist Satoshi Kanazawa

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:29.880
made a survey for people in their late 20s
as the survey showed right here. Kanazawa showed

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.410
that those with an IQ of over 125 tended to
go to bed at 12:30am and wake up around 8am

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.610
on the weekdays and go to bed around 1:45am
and wake up around 11am on the weekends. Those

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.940
of normal intelligence tended to go to sleep
from 12am to 7:30am on the weekdays and from

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:57.010
1:15am to 10:15 am on the weekends. Those
of below normal intelligence tended to go

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:05.150
sleep from 11:45am to 7:20am on the weekdays
and from 12:35 am to 10am on the weekends.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.530
As you can see that's a pretty big difference.
Now, that doesn't mean because you go to sleep

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.010
later you're more intelligent than those who
don't. There's plenty of factors to consider

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.830
like some studies show that the more intelligent
people, women in particularly tend to have

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.710
children later on and have fewer children.
Which allows them to sleep in later on more

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.920
than the friends or family members. Another
important factor is that the type of jobs

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.030
that people tend to hold which is also a big
contribution to when it comes to a person's

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.880
intelligence. The point of the study is that
smarter people can adapt more quickly to changing

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.360
conditions and can sometimes adapt habits
that don't really make sense. While people

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.370
of lower IQ tend to restrict their activities
to mostly the day time. But everything does

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.260
have it's up and downside. Having less sleep
is not really that healthy for the body. Nightowls

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.979
can be more prone to sickness like depression
or heart failures. They can also be less reliable,

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.400
more emotionally unstable and more likely
to have an addiction or an eating disorder.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.619
Some addictions can be like alcohol or smoking.
While on the upside for early risers they

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.739
can be more conscientious, persistent and
can co-operate better. They can also cope

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.349
better with academic requirements and receive
better grades which would sort of explain

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:24.900
why staying up until 2 am playing pokemon
would not give you good grades. Hypothetically

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:34.450
speaking of course not from experience I swear.
Some questions for you guys, is it better

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.239
to be a night owl or an early riser? Do you
tend to sleep late or wake up early and how

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.959
does this affect you in the morning? And do
you go to sleep late sometimes because it's

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.909
hard to fall asleep for you? Don't forget
to subscribe to the YouTube channel if you

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:54.200
enjoyed and also make sure to follow them
on Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr. Well, until

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.000
next time. See you guys.
