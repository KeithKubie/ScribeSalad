00:00:03.736 --> 00:00:05.338
- [Male Voiceover] Hey,
this is Moshe Kasher.

00:00:05.338 --> 00:00:07.206
- [Female Voiceover]
And Natasha Leggero.

00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:08.675
- [Moshe] And we just got
married six months ago.

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:09.675
- [Natasha] Which we think

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:10.877
pretty much makes us qualified

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:12.511 align:start size:84% position:16%
to give love advice
to strangers.

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:14.013
- [Moshe] So that's what we did.

00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:15.682
We packed up the
car, hit the road,

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.349
and spread the love.

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.687 line:0%
- [Both] This is
The Honeymoon Tour.

00:00:23.422 --> 00:00:25.124
- How's breakfast?

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:26.459 line:0%
- Luxurious.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.064 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I've been down
there for two hours.

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:32.364
I found a cave down there

00:00:32.364 --> 00:00:33.633
where there was a
sea urchin living.

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:34.600
- Why do you pretend like

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.035
you don't like luxury, Mosh?

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:37.536
You're clearly having fun here.

00:00:37.536 --> 00:00:40.540 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You know what
that sea urchin was?

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:42.542
My pussy?

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.310
(Moshe laughing)

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.311
- Hell yeah.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.047
I do like luxury,

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:50.784
I just don't like
the price point.

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:53.419 align:start size:94% position:6%
I would rather spend more
money on the vacation

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:55.088
and less money on...

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:57.657
Anyway.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.326
I'm having a good time.

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:02.128 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I think we really
helped people last night.

00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:03.162
- You really do?

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:04.097
- Uh-Huh.

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:04.997
- Yeah, what's your name?

00:01:04.997 --> 00:01:05.832
- Maureen.

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:06.966
- Maureen, and?

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.167
- Russel.

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:08.968
- [Moshe] Do you have
something specific

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:10.503
you'd like to address?

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:13.305
- So, he doesn't like when
my dogs sleep in the bed?

00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:14.574
- How many dogs do you have?

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:15.841
- Two, but they're tiny.

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:17.176
- Okay.

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:18.411
- And it doesn't matter.

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:19.245
- That's fair.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:20.446
No, I think that's fair.

00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:21.647 align:start size:84% position:16%
It doesn't matter
because it's not about

00:01:21.647 --> 00:01:23.850 align:start size:84% position:16%
the size, it's about
the idea, right?

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.084
- Correct.

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:26.752
It's the idea, it's
the fact that they...

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:29.822 align:start size:84% position:16%
Bring in all this
stuff from their feet,

00:01:29.822 --> 00:01:31.757
and they lick their own ass,

00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:33.259
and then they're in the bed,

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.595 align:start size:94% position:6%
and then I'm just expected
to sleep there, and...

00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:39.098 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So you have like,
anal-retentive issues?

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:40.433
(Audience laughing)

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:41.534
- OCD kind of thing.

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:42.801
- I am very OCD.

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:45.772
- I happen to sleep with
three chihuahuas, but,

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:47.440
he shouldn't be expected.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.707
- You sleep with
three chihuahuas?

00:01:48.707 --> 00:01:50.109
- I do sleep with
three chihuahuas,

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:51.044
yeah, I do.

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:53.145
Don't hug me, I like dogs.

00:01:53.145 --> 00:01:54.379
I'm not your ally here,

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:56.115
I'm the opposite, I'm anal...

00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:57.283
(Mumbling)

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.284
I like anal.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.887
Whatever the opposite is.

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:03.489
- Moshe is the opposite
like he's kind of messy,

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:04.456
so he doesn't care.

00:02:04.456 --> 00:02:05.991
- [Moshe] I'm a bit of a slob.

00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:07.460
Like if Moshe makes a mess,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.995
he runs away from it.

00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:13.332
- We've been together
for over a year now,

00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:14.300
and just...

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.635
I'm very committed to her,

00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:19.138
but she doesn't like
the idea of commitment

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:20.472
to one person.

00:02:20.472 --> 00:02:22.241
- Anyways about the dogs, right?

00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:23.743
- No, no, no, no.

00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:25.411
It doesn't work like that.

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:28.681
(Audience laughing)

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:29.648
Wait.

00:02:29.648 --> 00:02:30.816
But that's interesting that

00:02:30.816 --> 00:02:33.719
you're a little a bit
commitment-phobic,

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:35.155
but what your asking of him

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:37.189 align:start size:97% position:3%
is for him to become
incredibly intimate with you

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:39.024
by subverting his own desires,

00:02:39.024 --> 00:02:41.528
and let these dogs in the bed.

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:44.764
Yes? No comment?

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:48.534
- You don't like the idea
of committed to one person.

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:49.768
- Correct.

00:02:49.768 --> 00:02:52.405 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Are you saying
you want to be open?

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:53.672
- I did, but.

00:02:53.672 --> 00:02:55.241 align:start size:84% position:16%
- But now you've found
someone you love.

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:56.509
That's the same with me.

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:57.943
And now I don't
want that anymore

00:02:57.943 --> 00:02:59.745
because I love her so
much more everyday,

00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:01.513
and the way in was to allow her

00:03:01.513 --> 00:03:05.084 align:start size:84% position:16%
three dogs to sleep
in bed with me.

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:06.786
Here's my suggestion.

00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:09.021
I have a suggestion.

00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:10.023
For a month,

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:12.225
buy a sheet,

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:13.459
the dog sheet.

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:14.694
Okay?

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:16.462
Put the dog sheet
over the comforter,

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:18.530
while you guys are laying
in bed watching movies,

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.133 align:start size:84% position:16%
bring the dogs, they
get to hang out,

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:21.266
no restrictions,

00:03:21.266 --> 00:03:23.035
then when it's time for sleep,

00:03:23.035 --> 00:03:23.870
- And sex!

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.104
- Sleep and sex,

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:28.240
you bring the dogs, you
let them lick your ass.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.542
- No, you let the dogs,

00:03:30.542 --> 00:03:32.411 align:start size:84% position:16%
so the dogs stay up
like what he's saying,

00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:34.213
that's good, during movie time,

00:03:34.213 --> 00:03:35.614
and then "go to your spot"...

00:03:35.614 --> 00:03:36.815
- Our dogs by the way,

00:03:36.815 --> 00:03:38.884 align:start size:84% position:16%
they know the sound
of our orgasms.

00:03:38.884 --> 00:03:39.719 align:start size:81% position:19%
Like we're like
"go to your spot,"

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.220
they're like "okay,"

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.122
and they go down there, and
we're like (cartoon noises)

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:44.790
Which is what it sounds
like every time I come,

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.091
and then they just
like jump back up,

00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:49.562 align:start size:88% position:13%
they're like like "Okay,
cool, it's on again."

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:50.763
Can you deal with that?

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:51.898
- I can deal with that.

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:52.832
- That sounds good.

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:53.766
- But would you be willing

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:55.134
to not sleep with your dogs?

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:56.970
- Or any other people.

00:03:58.937 --> 00:04:00.273
- [Natasha] It is weird
that we're in a time,

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:01.474
cus like, I relate to it,

00:04:01.474 --> 00:04:03.576 align:start size:84% position:16%
where you wanna like,
sleep with a dog.

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:04.410
- [Moshe] Wait.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.911
You think that...

00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:07.479
That we're at the era

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:08.915
of dogs sleeping in your room?

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:09.849
- I think we're at the era

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.584
where dogs replace children.

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:12.752
For a lot of

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:13.853 align:start size:84% position:16%
people in their
thirties and forties,

00:04:13.853 --> 00:04:15.087
and above.

00:04:15.087 --> 00:04:16.155
- But I mean the
reality of that was

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:17.990 align:start size:88% position:13%
she wanted a polyamorous
relationship.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.626
(Natasha laughing)

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:20.826
- That's true.

00:04:20.826 --> 00:04:23.996 align:start size:84% position:16%
- The dogs represented
"everybody else".

00:04:23.996 --> 00:04:26.332
You know what I mean?

00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:28.267 align:start size:97% position:3%
- So you think that woman
wants to sleep with her dogs

00:04:28.267 --> 00:04:29.102
because of her

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.636
dream of polyamory.

00:04:30.636 --> 00:04:31.971
- I think it's like a metaphor.

00:04:31.971 --> 00:04:34.273
You know? If she's
afraid of intimacy,

00:04:34.273 --> 00:04:36.275
then keeping the dogs
there is a kind of

00:04:36.275 --> 00:04:37.777
furry wedge between her,

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:39.445
and her furry wedge.

00:04:40.846 --> 00:04:41.680
It's like,

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.614
you know what I mean?

00:04:42.614 --> 00:04:43.616
Psychologically helpful for her.

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:44.550
I bet.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.052
That would be my guess.

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:48.120
But that's so deep
in her subconscious

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.890 align:start size:84% position:16%
that only a really
brilliant psychologist

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.825
like me could see
that, you know?

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:54.360 align:start size:84% position:16%
- What's your name?
- I'm Erin.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.461
- Erin. This is Aaron.

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:56.295
And?

00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:57.229
- Cameron.

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:58.164
- [Erin] So, we've been together

00:04:58.164 --> 00:04:59.365
the last two years,

00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:00.633 align:start size:81% position:19%
and lived together
the last year.

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.501 align:start size:84% position:16%
But now I'm going
to UCLA in the fall,

00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:04.970
and he's going back
to the East Bay area,

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.705
I don't know we just
kind of want, like.

00:05:06.705 --> 00:05:08.474
Ideas or suggestions for making

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:10.977 align:start size:81% position:19%
a long distance
relationship work.

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:12.978
- Okay. And why are you
going back to San Ramon?

00:05:12.978 --> 00:05:15.548 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I didn't do great
in school here,

00:05:15.548 --> 00:05:17.583
so I'm gonna like,
get my shit together,

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:18.517
back home.

00:05:18.517 --> 00:05:19.652
- Okay, you're at City College,

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:20.552
you party too hard,

00:05:20.552 --> 00:05:21.487
and now you're going back home

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:23.022
to get your shit together.

00:05:23.022 --> 00:05:23.989
- Yes.

00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:25.658
- And you're going to UCLA...

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:27.392
- To meet a different dude.

00:05:27.392 --> 00:05:31.997
(Audience laughing and oohing)

00:05:31.997 --> 00:05:33.399
- That's what I'm worried about.

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:34.733
- Alright.

00:05:34.733 --> 00:05:37.436 align:start size:84% position:16%
You know this
thing, Sleeper Bus?

00:05:37.436 --> 00:05:39.538 align:start size:88% position:13%
It's this new thing
where you pay 60 bucks,

00:05:39.538 --> 00:05:42.007
and you leave Oakland at like,

00:05:42.007 --> 00:05:43.443
11 at night,

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:44.910
and you get into LA at
like four in the morning,

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.212 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm gonna suggest
Sleeper Bus commitment

00:05:47.212 --> 00:05:50.516
for three out of four
weekends, for love.

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:52.685
That's what I think.

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:54.387 align:start size:84% position:16%
- That's a good idea.
- I can do that.

00:05:54.387 --> 00:05:57.289
- And don't get a job where
you have to work weekends

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:58.691
you can have those weekends off,

00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:01.527
and you know, you
might want to...

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:04.297
Ask her to marry you
so she feels guilty,

00:06:04.297 --> 00:06:07.399
so she'll never...
(Audience laughing)

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:08.601
- I mean honestly,

00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:09.868 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm not sure that's
the right idea for you,

00:06:09.868 --> 00:06:12.605
but homie that is a
great idea for you.

00:06:12.605 --> 00:06:13.972
One thing I will say is

00:06:13.972 --> 00:06:16.743 align:start size:97% position:3%
that long distance
relationships over too long,

00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:18.444
it starts to...

00:06:18.444 --> 00:06:21.480
That whole absence makes
the heart grow fonder...

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.315
Nah.

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:26.586
No, UCLA makes the
pussy grow wetter.

00:06:28.254 --> 00:06:30.723
The cute couple that
came up last night,

00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:31.724
I felt bad for 'em.

00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:32.925
- Right, because like.

00:06:32.925 --> 00:06:34.760 align:start size:84% position:16%
They both clearly
moved to Santa Barbara

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.396
to try to go to school.

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:38.730 align:start size:94% position:6%
- They both went to Santa
Barbara City College,

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.732 align:start size:84% position:16%
he decided to major
in malt liquor.

00:06:40.732 --> 00:06:43.268
And she decided to
do her schoolwork,

00:06:43.268 --> 00:06:44.603
she got into UCLA.

00:06:44.603 --> 00:06:46.405 align:start size:84% position:16%
He's moving home to
go be with his family,

00:06:46.405 --> 00:06:48.174
probably go into
rehab or something.

00:06:48.174 --> 00:06:50.910
And she's going to UCLA
to go join a real school

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.278
and like.

00:06:52.278 --> 00:06:53.512 align:start size:94% position:6%
Meet her her intellectual
equals and stuff,

00:06:53.512 --> 00:06:56.315 align:start size:88% position:13%
while he like moves back
in with his parents.

00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:57.983
This is too mean.

00:06:57.983 --> 00:06:59.084
- I mean.

00:06:59.084 --> 00:07:00.620
It's the reality.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.121
- Reality sucks.

00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:03.956
Reality bites, I'm gonna
write a movie called that.

00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:07.260 align:start size:81% position:19%
Seriously, I'm
thinking about it.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.495 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Who was your favorite
couple last night?

00:07:09.495 --> 00:07:10.596
- You and me.

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:13.599
(Laughing)

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:16.469
(Light jazz music)

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:18.337
- Moshe?

00:07:18.337 --> 00:07:19.171
- Yeah?

00:07:19.171 --> 00:07:22.041
(Natasha laughing)

00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:24.944 align:start size:81% position:19%
- [Moshe] Let's
hit the road, bro.

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:27.213 align:start size:94% position:6%
We gotta drive all the
way to Palm Springs today.

00:07:27.213 --> 00:07:28.781
That's a four and
half hour drive.

00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:29.615
- I know.
