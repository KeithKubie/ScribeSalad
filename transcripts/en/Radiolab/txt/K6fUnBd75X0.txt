Speaker 1:          00:02          Okay, now it's my left ear. Hello Soren. How are you? Good. How are you doing? I'm good. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab. And so far we've been talking about the value of our lives and then the value of other people's lives. Next up, the value of

Speaker 2:          00:19          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:20          everything, all of it. Everything. Re think I'm by everything. Of course. We mean the value of nature. That's Carl Zimmer, science writer, regular blower of minds. So we think of ecosystems as just kind of sitting there. Um, actually they're doing things. They weren't doing them for us. We would have to pay to do them artificially. For example, cotton farms in south Texas. So you know, the farmers are doing their thing. Like this Guy James Parker plant in their cotton. They're collecting it. Yeah, I farmed about, I don't know, usually five to six, 700 acres of cotton. So say 2000 bales. They're doing what farmers do. I spent a lot of time on a tractor and uh, you have to check your water every morning, every evening. Meanwhile, they have all this extra help in the air. Yes, they have bats. How many bats are out there? You really don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:14          Flying all around the bats eat the equivalent of two thirds of their own weight in insects every night. Wow. They eat all night long. All kinds of bugs. A whole bunch of pests that would otherwise be eating the cotton. No. A few years ago, guy named John Westfall did a calculation just to see how this arrangement was working out. He came out to my farm and did it. He did a study, he had some college girls that worked for him and those girls were out there all hours of the night listening to what the baths were saying and here the farmers collectively, they make about four or $5 million off of the these farms. The question was how much of this was because of the batch? Cause you know baths are natural pesticides, you know the more they're eating. Alyssa, I got a spray and here's what the scientists figured out out of four to $5 million, it was around $700,000 that you could describe to the bats.

Speaker 1:          02:08          It's just beautiful. Wow. I mean, it does make me think that if you're those farmers, you should be compensating the bets. Yeah. Well, yeah, it does give you a glimpse at the kind of scale of value, economic value that nature has that we generally just totally ignore. But we talked to a guy who didn't ignore it. My name is Robert Costanza. In fact, he took this way of thinking to the absolute limit. Yes. So the question was what's the value of all of these ecosystem services globally? All the services on earth? Yeah, it's bugs. Eating leaves, worms, turning the soil needles, chewing tree stump, or always protecting cities during storms, everything. We tried to synthesize all of the studies that had been done around the country in the world, like that bat study, except they didn't just look cotton farms, they looked at tropical forests, rivers and lakes, coral reefs, coastal wetlands, and then wetlands, the ocean woodlands, temporary forest, you know, it goes on and on grasslands, it's supposed to be some excel spreadsheet.

Speaker 1:          03:10          It's, it's kind of the excel spreadsheet from hell. It can get tricky. So Constanza and his colleagues took all these different studies. Some of them together did a whole bunch of half and came up with a number, which in today's dollars is 142 point $7 trillion per year of services. That's more than all of the ghosts national products of the world. That's how valuable the services of nature are. Yeah. Let me ask you, like I get the, I get the way this would work with a bat, like the bats eating the bugs, but like how do you do it with like with like a, like a field or something? Like do you just walk through and you're like, Oh, that's 20 bucks of services. That's 50. Like how do you even figure out what the services are? Well, uh, they, they came up with a list.

Speaker 1:          04:00          A, so the list kind of depends on the ecosystem you're talking about because different ecosystems provide different services. For example, uh, a salt marsh and we are in the water. You're in the water. What is it? A salt marsh? Is that like the Florida wetlands? But Salty, I have suddenly don't know what a salt marshes, salt marshes are. Wetlands that are on the coast. Got It. Yeah. We're standing in about a foot of water here. We're quickly approaching high tide Lisa and one of our producers, Simon Adler to a nearby salt marsh, partially the Hasan. Your boots are much more water, but really to talk to this guy. My name is Adam Welchol and I'm the director of science for the Nature Conservancy here in Connecticut. And Adam gave Simon a kind of inventory of some of the services provided by coastal salt marshes. It's a stream of goods and services with confided over time.

Speaker 1:          04:54          One of the things that does is it takes water that's coming in from inland and that laden with all sorts of pollutants, all sorts of bad stuff. The salt marsh will trap that water so that the plutons settle and then very often the marsh grass will suck up that water into their roots and clean it up. Yup. So you could ask very simply, how much would you have to spend to keep your water that clean second. Well, there is one other study I want to add them. Well, she'll said that scientists in New England have already figured that out. Uh, for flood control, water supply protection, pollution control, it's roughly about $31 and 22 cents per Hector per year. Then you've got to add the value of all the plants that could meet the fished. It ended up on our dinner plate, $338 annually per acre. And they're the birdwatchers that buy lattes and support the local economy or $190 per Hector. And then there's habitat provisioning. The list goes on and on and on and on. You do get kind of obsessed with it and you start like you started becoming an accountant and writing down numbers just furiously. Um, and uh, it

Speaker 3:          05:58          gets you to think about nature in a different way than you had before. There's this galling element though, or this aspect. Like when I first came across the, at this point, our producer Tim Howard jumped into the interview and you'll also hear our producers sworn wheeler in just a second. I do feel like in an example like the salt marsh, which cleans water, that's all reliant on people being there that need the water. So if you didn't have people there, does that Salt Marsh Sisa have any value. But Tim, haven't you ever had a conversation with somebody who just doesn't get, like if you make the aesthetic argument, which is that nature should be, should be preserved for its own sake. There's a whole category of humanity. It just doesn't respond to that argument is this becomes a way to talk across the aisle, but it does still feel like it demotes something of infinite value to something of a piddly valley and really be infinite value. I mean, like a mother's love. You don't think your mother's love is priceless. I mean, you know,

Speaker 1:          06:55          okay, I totally accept that there is this sort of priceless aspect of nature. But if you are in the government in a very poor country, you have some tough choices to make. If somebody comes to you and says, okay, you've got these lovely mangroves now. Uh, it turns out that that the, the sort of setting where the mangroves are is the perfect place for shrimp aquaculture

Speaker 3:          07:20          because shrimp farms need lots of seawater, so it makes sense to put them by the seat.

Speaker 1:          07:24          We're going to put in these farms, we're going to grow shrimp. You are going to get New Orleans and millions of dollars in tax revenue. If you're thinking about the, the welfare of all the people in your country, many of whom are starving, that might be a really powerful argument into that kind of a discussion. You can bring in the fact that these mangroves are sitting there very quietly doing all sorts of incredibly valuable things. In fact, they've done these kind of calculations and in some cases, the services that mangroves provide are four times more valuable than what you could get out with shrimp. So it's stupid. It's just stupid in a bay. A very basic sense too. Wantonly replaced lots of mangroves with shrimp aquaculture.

Speaker 3:          08:11          Is that a hypothetical situation? No, that's a no, that's what we're asked.

Speaker 4:          08:15          This is Glenn Marie Lang. She's an environmental economist for the World Bank and she says very often she finds herself in exactly this kind of conversation,

Speaker 3:          08:23          particularly, you know, I work for the World Bank, so our primary clients are our governments, Philippines, Vietnam, and when you're talking to a minister of finance and saying, you know what, you I know jobs are jobs, but you need those marshes, they have value. They'll say, well, yeah, that's true, but that means I'm going to have to reduce the money that I put into the education budget. So you've got to really make a strong argument about the benefits. That's really where the rubber hits the road. Well, I mean that's,

Speaker 4:          08:53          here's the counter argument. It comes Doug McCauley and

Speaker 5:          08:56          ecologist of the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Speaker 3:          08:58          The real danger is that we actually succeed, that we, we convince people that nature is valuable because it makes money. And then where we're really in trouble in the many instances where it doesn't make us money back, what do you do in a situation? He says, where say a bunch of rivers are running dry and they're depreciating in value. You know, by the same logic that you train me to think with, we should go out and liquidate these natural assets. That makes me feel really uncomfortable. He says, just kind of a weird way to think about nature. We had a proposal here in the state of California to make gay marriage legal and economists had a look at this legislation and said this is expected to generate $163 million annually for the state of California. Um, well it's good to know that. I appreciate having that information in front of me.

Speaker 3:          09:43          However, when I'm making a decision on this legislation, and I would say that when many legislators, voters, average citizens, so we considering the issues at hand, they're not thinking about whether they're going to make $160 million for the state that are thinking about a different set of values. On the other hand, I want to say, and this is based on my experience working in developing countries, that when you don't put a value on these services, basically they don't get counted. They get implicitly assigned a value of zero according to Glen Marie Lang, and as we were debating this and going back and forth and back and forth, we bumped into a story about what happens when all of these value of nature ideas are let loose into a world of fruits and trees and human uncertainty.

Speaker 6:          10:30          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          10:30          the parable of the bees. We heard this first from writer, JB McKinnon who says the story begins in Mao County in central China, rural area, fairly remote, lush green mountains filled with apple orchards and a apple. Orcharding was the main business and according to JB in in the 1990s the wild bees of Mao county slowly started to disappear.

Speaker 6:          10:54          Am

Speaker 5:          10:55          there a few different reasons given for that? That could have been the destruction of the habitat that the bees nested in the heavy honey harvesting that wasn't leaving enough food for the bees. But the prevailing theory is actually an economic one because in the 1990s as China was shifting to a market based economy, apple producers were under pressure to produce more apples. So they started spraying pesticide probably it was a constellation of all of those things in a few others, a end result is a stopped buzzing in Mal county, which if you are an apple farmer, that's a disaster. As bees travel from flower to flower in search of nectar, they are, they're dusted with pollen, which is the means by which flowers engage in sexual intercourse. So if you don't have the bees making the birds and the bees on the blossoms, then um, Ben, you don't get fertile flowers to turn into, to turn into fruit. And obviously if you're a fruit farmer and you have no fruit to sell, you have no, so what do you do? You're an apple farmer and you don't have bees. Then you need to find some other way to pollinate the flowers. And I guess they concluded, well we'll have to do that ourselves by hand.

Speaker 7:          12:07          In Mandarin Chinese we say [inaudible] show fan, so it would basically a, that means a manual putting nation.

Speaker 5:          12:15          This is Harold t boat.

Speaker 7:          12:17          I'm a correspondent in China for the French newspaper alone. A couple years ago you heard about the apple farmers in Mal County, so he flies to Chengdu and he and a friend hop in a car and we drive for like five or six hours until we reach a this village and mansion tiny little village like around the a few houses. And then we took our smaller roads in between the, the fields and uh, we actually saw that there were lots of farmers in the, in the trees, like on the apple trees traveling

Speaker 8:          12:47          on these often fin and spindly branches, men and women that I've seen in photos. In any case, Harold and his friend took pictures and if you look at those pictures, you'll see the farmers holding little brush, little pollen brush that they'd constructed using things like chopsticks and chicken feathers and cigarette filters. And they'd have a little bottle filled with pollen. And then what they do, they dip the brush into the bottle and they paint a flower blossom with the pollen. They dip the brush back into the pollen and they paint the next flower blossom again and then they dip the brush back in again and they paint again and it dip again. And they been to make sure that that

Speaker 5:          13:22          all of the blossoms that they could possibly fertilize would be fertilized so that they would go onto produce fruit. We're talking hundreds and hundreds of flowers per tree.

Speaker 7:          13:30          It was very strange to see, uh, uh, humans doing the, the job of the bees. God, what a pain in the ass

Speaker 5:          13:37          that sounds like. Yeah. The image of this, of these Chinese orchardists standing up in these spindly trees traveled around the world through environmental circles and it, the message that it seemed to send was that, you know, this is what happens if you, if you lose biodiversity, you end up standing in the trees doing the job that the bees used to do on the wing for free,

Speaker 3:          14:01          for free. Those people just like human bs. But then this guy interests the story. This is Ian Son. Chen. Yeah. Human bees. Four years ago he traveled to Mal county to do a sort of economic analysis of just how much the loss of the bees was hurting the farmers of Mao county. But what he discovered weirdly was that the trees were producing more apples than ever. Well, production oil production, this can be a confirmed zone. More production for hand, pawn nation, uh, apple chase and uh, be punish apple tree. You'll miss I'm white patient. Really

Speaker 8:          14:38          evil. We're doing it better than the bees had been doing it.

Speaker 3:          14:41          Yes, a lot better. Fruit production went up

Speaker 5:          14:43          30%. That's what the farmers told you,

Speaker 3:          14:46          which is kind of amazing. The all new word I remember. Amazing because

Speaker 7:          14:52          I think Hemphill nation campaign, h Massarelli a, they can pollinate every flower and bees don't. Pauline. Every flower

Speaker 5:          15:00          bees are a little bit, uh, you know, they're a little bit, uh, uneven when on their, they don't like it. If it's cold, they don't like it. If it's damp, uh, they don't like it. If it's windy in all those cases, bees often decide to stay indoors and just take the day off. But you send people out there and tell them to pollinate every damn blossom and they're going to do it. And there was the additional benefit of the people that you paid. They'd go to the bar, they'd buy groceries, they'd spend those earnings in their local communities in a way that obviously bees never did. So here you had this whole story that was supposed to be about how important the bees are and this whole parable of biodiversity turns up maybe the lessons, just the opposite that actually we don't need bees and maybe we never did. If we only measure things economically, then we might conclude that that uh, some species are, some ecological processes just aren't necessary in certain places or that we might even do better to, to take care of those processes ourselves.

Speaker 7:          16:00          Right. So let me find my notes about the wages. Exactly. But there's one more chapter to the story. Heraldo told us that when he visited and then chin, I talked with one farmer, his name is a Zanes ago. Is there a certain age and uh, he said in his opinion, uh, do the hand nation, uh, may disappear in a few years. Apparently as China's economy has continued to grow, workers have started demanding better pay. Xu wages are getting so high for the workers that the farmers have to employ to help them. Basically, it's not efficient economically to do the in nation anymore. That's what a lot of farmers say this to you. Now they're likely thinking, damn, we need those bees back, right? Yeah. Problem is there are no bees are in those villages anymore. One farmer told Harold beekeepers in other parts of China aren't gonna bring their bees to this area because they worry about the pesticides that the farmers have used. As for when wild bees might come back, whether for this we have a new idea. It's very hard to make a prediction if you, as the farmers, they're like, uh, well, Bridget, oh, I don't know.

Speaker 9:          17:08          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          17:09          here's where that story leaves me. It leaves me thinking that economics is just not a good way to go. And putting an AARP a value, even a even a precise and thoughtful value on a bee or on a pound of pesticide. You do it and you think you're smart, but then the value changes, the bees go from being worth a lot to being worth nothing to being worth everything all within a few years. This, this is what markets do. They swing back forth and we pretend that we can predict but we never can. So you can't put a value on cause you're always going to be wrong or is it dumb? When I, Winona I'm in love. I would argue the other side for a second. No where in the story did someone walk into the middle of the proceedings and say,

Speaker 3:          17:50          you know what, the bees do have value. Here's the number. In fact, you know Carl, when we were talking to him, told us, you know, there've been estimates that the value of the pollination that comes from wild bees is $190 billion. So that's globally, right? But still there was nobody in the room giving that kind of number. So the bees were inherently valued at zero. But remember, bees are valued at zero only until humans get valued more than bees go down and just go, I got to have a lot of numbers in your head, but here's what I like about this idea is that when you put a number on a bee or a bat or a marsh, it's like an attempt to force a kind of longterm thinking. You can't just say, don't do that. I mean that's the thing that like conservation to say don't, don't, don't.

Speaker 3:          18:30          But if you say don't do that because here's the value, here's the loss. Yeah, here's the loss. Well then that actually gives the whole precautionary, don't think some teeth except for this, that if you go businessy on nature and you're wrong, there are irreversibility [inaudible]. That's how environmental economists, Glen Murray Lang boots. This is one of the differences between nature ecosystems and what we produce. You smash your car, Hey, someone can build a new one. If you lose the bees, many instances you cannot bring them back. So the question we got to is, is there another way to think about the value of nature in a way that's not economic and therefore shortsighted and all about us, but also not simply about the aesthetics and the beauty? Cause that can be sort of limiting too. Is there another way? The Best I was able to do thinking about this writer JB McKinnon again

Speaker 5:          19:24          was when it struck me that that in a way all of this diversity that's out there, all this biological diversity, all these wonderful and amazing and alien things that other species can do is like an extension of our own brains. There's so much imagination out there that we simply could not come up with on our own. That we can think of it as as a, uh,

Speaker 8:          19:51          pool of imagination and creativity from which we as humans are able to draw. And that when we draw down on that, on that pool of creativity and imagination, we, we deeply impoverish ourselves. You know, in a sense we are, we are doing harm to our own ability to think and to, and to, and to dream. JB McKinnon's book is called the once and future world. He's written many, but this one is my fav deep thanks to Carl Zimmer, who's a reporting in the New York Times on this topic is really what got us launched into this whole thing and what got us through this whole thing is Simon Adler, who's production assistants, was invaluable. That was him freezing his ass off in the marsh. I talked so long, he nearly died. His toes fell off. Anyway, thank you. So sir, thank you Simon, and a thank you guys for listening. I'm jet up and run. I remembered [inaudible] we'll see you next time.
