00:00:00.676 --> 00:00:02.554
Narrator: As we entered in to World war I

00:00:02.554 --> 00:00:04.734
the British already had a
presence in the Middle East.

00:00:04.734 --> 00:00:08.078
Egypt was already a British protectorate

00:00:08.078 --> 00:00:10.889
and it formalized this as we entered in to

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.219
World War I and they don't
get their independence

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.083
until 1922.

00:00:15.083 --> 00:00:16.330
The British don't just hand it to them,

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.343
they fight for this, they have a revolt

00:00:18.343 --> 00:00:19.953
against the British rule and they win,

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:22.583
so you have an independent Egypt in 1922.

00:00:22.583 --> 00:00:25.813
The British also had
Kuwait as a protectorate

00:00:25.813 --> 00:00:28.194
and this is from the
1800's and they don't get

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:31.517
their independence until 1961.

00:00:31.517 --> 00:00:33.950
We also know that the British were eager

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.332
to get the help of the Arab's,

00:00:36.332 --> 00:00:38.085
to essentially convince
the Arab's to revolt

00:00:38.085 --> 00:00:42.014
against the Ottoman's so
that they could successfully

00:00:42.014 --> 00:00:46.555
fight the Ottoman's on the
Sinai and Palestine fronts

00:00:46.555 --> 00:00:49.436
and on the Mesopotamia front.

00:00:49.436 --> 00:00:52.770
In particular, they tried
to convince this gentleman,

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.942
Hussein bin Ali, who at the time,

00:00:54.942 --> 00:00:56.469
at the beginning of World War I

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.933
is the Sharif of Mecca.

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:02.548
In order to convince him
they made promises to him.

00:01:02.548 --> 00:01:06.017
We have a whole video
on the McMahon-Hussein

00:01:06.017 --> 00:01:06.882
correspondence.

00:01:06.882 --> 00:01:10.047
They say look if you help
up us we will give you

00:01:10.047 --> 00:01:13.066
and independent state,
an independent Arab state

00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:15.371
that would include all of this territory

00:01:15.371 --> 00:01:17.867
except for maybe, except
for maybe this region

00:01:17.867 --> 00:01:19.619
right up here.

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.941
So, with those British
assurances he agrees

00:01:22.941 --> 00:01:27.069
to commit his forces to
fight in the Arab revolt,

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:30.096
to rise up and to help the British.

00:01:30.096 --> 00:01:32.413
From that point on in 1916 where you have

00:01:32.413 --> 00:01:34.916
the Arab revolt, he declares himself as

00:01:34.916 --> 00:01:36.855
the King of the Hejaz.

00:01:36.855 --> 00:01:39.468
Just as a little bit
of a geography tangent

00:01:39.468 --> 00:01:41.425
right over here, this is the Hejaz.

00:01:41.425 --> 00:01:43.885
It's kind of the west coast of the Arabian

00:01:43.885 --> 00:01:46.659
peninsula and it contains
the very influential towns

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.149
of Mecca and Medina.

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.929
You might say, well whatever
happened to the Hejaz?

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.159
Isn't all of this region
right now Saudi Arabia?

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.846
And you are correct.

00:01:56.846 --> 00:01:59.404
What happened shortly after, so in 1916

00:01:59.404 --> 00:02:01.392
he declares himself King of the Hejaz

00:02:01.392 --> 00:02:04.384
but then you had another
group, the Saudi's

00:02:04.384 --> 00:02:09.552
in the Nejd region, which is
this area right over here.

00:02:09.552 --> 00:02:17.278
They are able to, in 1925, successfully,

00:02:17.278 --> 00:02:22.310
successfully, successfully
conquer the Nejd

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.540
and you have Ibn Saud who declares himself

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.396
King of the Nejd and
Hejaz from 1926 to 1932.

00:02:30.396 --> 00:02:33.386
He later merges them into Saudi Arabia

00:02:33.386 --> 00:02:35.323
and he's the first King of Saudi Arabia

00:02:35.323 --> 00:02:38.959
all the way until 1953.

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.782
That's how you get Saudi Arabia.

00:02:41.782 --> 00:02:43.748
Now, let's continue, let's rewind back to

00:02:43.748 --> 00:02:45.587
World War I.

00:02:45.587 --> 00:02:47.474
You have the Arab revolt.

00:02:47.474 --> 00:02:49.711
Hussein bin Ali declares himself the King

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:51.053
of the Hejaz.

00:02:51.053 --> 00:02:54.570
Two of his sons are very
active in collaborating

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.000
with the British to fight
against the Ottoman's.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.212
This right over here
is Faisal bin Hussein.

00:03:01.212 --> 00:03:03.829
Bin Hussein literally
means son of Hussein.

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.138
This right over here is Abdullah.

00:03:06.138 --> 00:03:08.603
By the end of the war,
and we covered this in the

00:03:08.603 --> 00:03:11.260
Sinai, Palestine and
Mesopotamia Campaigns,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.934
the combined British
and Arab forces are able

00:03:15.934 --> 00:03:19.182
to move all the way into,
all the way into what

00:03:19.182 --> 00:03:20.738
is now northern Syria.

00:03:20.738 --> 00:03:24.397
They're all able to move into what is now

00:03:24.397 --> 00:03:27.173
northern Iraq.

00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:30.471
You can imagine at this
point, the Arab's are eager

00:03:30.471 --> 00:03:34.798
in a post world environment
to have their state.

00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:37.367
The reason why they're
a little bit unceratin

00:03:37.367 --> 00:03:39.445
about their future is based
on what some of the things

00:03:39.445 --> 00:03:41.339
that came out during the war.

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:44.216
We now know that while
the British were trying to

00:03:44.216 --> 00:03:47.844
convince Hussein bin Ali to
get his forces to rise up

00:03:47.844 --> 00:03:50.882
against the Ottoman's
they were dealing with

00:03:50.882 --> 00:03:53.071
the French in the secret
Sykes-Picot Agreement

00:03:53.071 --> 00:03:55.328
to essentially carve
up this whole territory

00:03:55.328 --> 00:03:56.796
between the British and the French.

00:03:56.796 --> 00:03:58.990
They really weren't talking
about independent states

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.818
for the Arab's.

00:04:00.818 --> 00:04:04.009
A few years later in 1917,
this was still during the war,

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:05.132
while the war was happening,

00:04:05.132 --> 00:04:06.694
you have the Balfour Declaration,

00:04:06.694 --> 00:04:08.727
which declared the
British intent to create

00:04:08.727 --> 00:04:11.263
a homeland for the Jewish people.

00:04:11.263 --> 00:04:13.355
Then a month later, really
the end of that month,

00:04:13.355 --> 00:04:16.017
November 1917, the Russian's make the

00:04:16.017 --> 00:04:18.984
Sykes-Picot Agreement public,
so all of these things

00:04:18.984 --> 00:04:20.871
made the Arab's very uneasy.

00:04:20.871 --> 00:04:22.660
They got assurances from the British that

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.284
oh that wasn't that
serious of an agreement,

00:04:24.284 --> 00:04:26.741
just keep fighting with us.

00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:29.484
So, at the end of the war
they were eager to get,

00:04:29.484 --> 00:04:32.885
what they thought, was their just claim.

00:04:32.885 --> 00:04:34.832
So you have Faisal bin
Hussein, he attends the

00:04:34.832 --> 00:04:37.489
Paris Peace Conference in 1919.

00:04:37.489 --> 00:04:41.486
(writing) So in 1919 you have the Paris,

00:04:41.486 --> 00:04:45.480
Paris Peace Conference
and just to be clear

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.950
at that point in time it
wasn't obvious that you

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.165
necessarily had to have
this, what we now have,

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:53.416
is this conflict between
what is now Israel

00:04:53.416 --> 00:04:55.128
and the Arab people.

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:58.731
Faisal bin Hussein was
actually eager to kind of

00:04:58.731 --> 00:05:01.672
reach out to the World
Zionist Organization,

00:05:01.672 --> 00:05:04.826
to the Zionist movement to
hopefully get their help

00:05:04.826 --> 00:05:07.500
in establishing an independent Arab state.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.794
He didn't think that they would,

00:05:08.794 --> 00:05:11.703
that it would establish an
independent Jewish state,

00:05:11.703 --> 00:05:15.748
but he said hey look if they
can have a homeland here

00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:17.528
but in order to get that homeland,

00:05:17.528 --> 00:05:19.962
they're willing to support
me for an independent

00:05:19.962 --> 00:05:22.842
Arab state then I might
kind of send out an

00:05:22.842 --> 00:05:24.282
olive branch to them.

00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:27.932
This right over here is a
quote by Faisal bin Hussein.

00:05:27.932 --> 00:05:29.982
This is while he was trying to get support

00:05:29.982 --> 00:05:32.893
for an independent Arab
state, one that he would

00:05:32.893 --> 00:05:34.165
argue, was promised to him by

00:05:34.165 --> 00:05:39.355
the McMahon Correspondences
with his father.

00:05:39.355 --> 00:05:40.576
So, this is Faisal.

00:05:40.576 --> 00:05:42.626
"We Arabs, look with the deepest sympathy

00:05:42.626 --> 00:05:43.991
"on the Zionist movement.

00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:46.263
"Our deputation here in Paris is fully

00:05:46.263 --> 00:05:48.446
"acquainted with the
proposal submitted yesterday

00:05:48.446 --> 00:05:51.013
"by the Zionist Organization
to the Peace Conference

00:05:51.013 --> 00:05:53.886
"and we regard them as
moderate and proper.

00:05:53.886 --> 00:05:56.996
"We will do our best, in
so far as we are concerned

00:05:56.996 --> 00:05:59.720
"to help them through,
we will wish the Jews

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.523
"a most hearty welcome home.

00:06:01.523 --> 00:06:03.785
"I look forward, and my
people with me look forward

00:06:03.785 --> 00:06:06.713
"to a future in which we
will help you and you will

00:06:06.713 --> 00:06:09.061
"help us so that the
countries in which we are

00:06:09.061 --> 00:06:12.376
"mutually interested may
once again take their

00:06:12.376 --> 00:06:14.390
"places in the community
of the civilized peoples

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:15.657
"of the world."

00:06:15.657 --> 00:06:17.537
But he did throw in this
caveat, he was doing this

00:06:17.537 --> 00:06:18.917
because he wanted their support for

00:06:18.917 --> 00:06:21.607
an independent state and
he did throw in the caveat,

00:06:21.607 --> 00:06:23.850
look this only applies,
I'm only supportive,

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.270
essentially, of the Balfour Declaration

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.885
if we get our independent state.

00:06:27.885 --> 00:06:32.136
He really wanted ... he
really wanted an independent,

00:06:32.136 --> 00:06:34.261
(writing) independent state.

00:06:34.261 --> 00:06:36.176
He explicitly said, hey
look if we don't get

00:06:36.176 --> 00:06:37.872
an independent state all
the stuff I said here,

00:06:37.872 --> 00:06:41.433
doesn't really apply.

00:06:41.433 --> 00:06:46.713
So you end of with the
Treaty of Sev in 1920.

00:06:46.713 --> 00:06:49.864
It turns out that the
Sykes-Picot Agreement

00:06:49.864 --> 00:06:52.168
held a lot more weight than the assurances

00:06:52.168 --> 00:06:55.122
between McMahon and Hussein because in the

00:06:55.122 --> 00:06:58.302
Treaty of Sev, this area
was divided, essentially,

00:06:58.302 --> 00:07:00.847
according to the Sykes-Picot Agreement.

00:07:00.847 --> 00:07:04.407
Up here, this whole region
was given to France,

00:07:04.407 --> 00:07:07.026
they called it a mandate,
which is essentially

00:07:07.026 --> 00:07:08.865
it was allowed to be occupied by France

00:07:08.865 --> 00:07:10.956
but they called it a mandate.

00:07:10.956 --> 00:07:12.958
The allies wanted it
to be called a mandate

00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.757
so it didn't look like
France was getting something.

00:07:14.757 --> 00:07:16.877
A mandate is kind of,
hey you have to come help

00:07:16.877 --> 00:07:20.064
these people to transition
them to establish a state,

00:07:20.064 --> 00:07:23.400
to help them transition
institutions so eventually they

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.724
can get independence.

00:07:24.724 --> 00:07:26.663
The allies wanted it to appear that,

00:07:26.663 --> 00:07:28.565
look central powers, look Ottoman's,

00:07:28.565 --> 00:07:29.825
you're not giving us something,

00:07:29.825 --> 00:07:30.823
you're not giving us this territory,

00:07:30.823 --> 00:07:32.919
you're giving us a responsibility.

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:35.611
Needless to say, they were eager to occupy

00:07:35.611 --> 00:07:39.224
this territory, so eager
that when Faisal bin Hussein,

00:07:39.224 --> 00:07:42.107
in 1920, declared himself King of Syria,

00:07:42.107 --> 00:07:43.655
they booted him out.

00:07:43.655 --> 00:07:47.637
He was in really no power
to contest that booting out.

00:07:47.637 --> 00:07:50.367
This area right over
here, this was pretty much

00:07:50.367 --> 00:07:51.842
in line with the Sykes-Picot Agreement,

00:07:51.842 --> 00:07:55.477
became a British, this
whole area right over here

00:07:55.477 --> 00:07:57.801
became a British mandate.

00:07:57.801 --> 00:08:01.176
Now, in what is now Iraq,
you essentially have

00:08:01.176 --> 00:08:03.620
an uprising in 1920,
they don't appreciate,

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.559
they thought that they
were going to become

00:08:05.559 --> 00:08:06.419
independent now.

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:07.664
They were free of the Ottoman's,

00:08:07.664 --> 00:08:08.992
but now all of a sudden the British come

00:08:08.992 --> 00:08:10.982
and say that they are in charge.

00:08:10.982 --> 00:08:13.439
So you have this revolt
against the British in 1920.

00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:15.377
The British start to realize, gee this is

00:08:15.377 --> 00:08:18.325
kind of expensive trying
to keep control of this

00:08:18.325 --> 00:08:20.851
maybe we should install someone,

00:08:20.851 --> 00:08:23.051
and we'll still kind of
keep this as a protectorate

00:08:23.051 --> 00:08:26.059
as a mandated territory, but why don't we

00:08:26.059 --> 00:08:29.996
install someone, an
Arab leader, as the King

00:08:29.996 --> 00:08:31.555
of this region.

00:08:31.555 --> 00:08:33.388
So, the install Faisal bin Hussein

00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:35.469
as a King of Iraq.

00:08:35.469 --> 00:08:38.666
He is a King of Iraq,
essentially under protection,

00:08:38.666 --> 00:08:40.273
or under influence of the British

00:08:40.273 --> 00:08:43.911
from 1921 until 1933 and
that's when they finally

00:08:43.911 --> 00:08:48.755
get independence of the British, in 1932.

00:08:48.755 --> 00:08:51.575
When they get booted out of Syria,

00:08:51.575 --> 00:08:55.667
his brother Abdullah,
son of Hussein bin Ali,

00:08:55.667 --> 00:08:59.397
he's allowed to become
King of trans Jordan.

00:08:59.397 --> 00:09:01.942
They later get independence in 1946

00:09:01.942 --> 00:09:05.565
after World War II at
which point he becomes

00:09:05.565 --> 00:09:07.468
the King of Jordan.

00:09:07.468 --> 00:09:10.278
Syria and Lebanon, they
don't get independence

00:09:10.278 --> 00:09:13.152
until during or after World War II.

00:09:13.152 --> 00:09:15.046
Lebanon gets independence in 1943,

00:09:15.046 --> 00:09:19.271
Syria gets independence
from the French in 1946.

00:09:19.271 --> 00:09:22.179
And we know that the mandate of Palestine,

00:09:22.179 --> 00:09:24.164
which the British kept,
this would continue

00:09:24.164 --> 00:09:26.764
to be a sore point through World War II

00:09:26.764 --> 00:09:29.406
and then with the
establishment of the state

00:09:29.406 --> 00:09:33.100
of Israel shortly afterwards,
it becomes a very,

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:37.286
I guess we could say, hot
point in international affairs.
