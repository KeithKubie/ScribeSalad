[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.590
JESSE: I'm so excited to have
Mike Steib, CEO of XO Group--

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.510
The Bump, The Knot, The
Nest, you know them all--

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.425
here with us today.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.230
Mike is an awesome guy.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.834
But he's especially an
awesome guy in my life.

00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:27.250
So I'm just going to open with
a little brief story of how

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.412
I came to know Mike.

00:00:29.412 --> 00:00:31.120
It was the beginning
of my Google career.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.950
This was like a long time
ago, like 9 and 1/2 years ago.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.030
I was here.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.870
I was in my job.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.030
I was sort of like--

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.320
I was satisfied, but wasn't
feeling the love totally.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.230
And this new guy had
moved onto the floor.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.840
I'd seen him speak
at sort of an event

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.970
and noticed that he put this
little piece of notebook paper

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.060
on his glass door of his
office which, of course,

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.780
he shared with a
bunch of other people.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.370
It would say Google
TV ads, now hiring.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.260
And I was like, that
sounds interesting.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.989
I think I should find out more.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.270
And so I introduced
myself to Mike,

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.900
who would come on board
to run Google TV ads.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.500
And my whole life and
career took a dramatic turn.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.060
I did a 20% project, then I
joined the Google TV ads team

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.140
and so on from there.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.650
In Mike I found an amazing
leader and mentor and someone

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.780
that I and lots
of us at the time

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.852
kept going to for career advice.

00:01:31.852 --> 00:01:34.060
So I think he probably got
sick of having one-on-ones

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.720
with all of us.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.910
And he actually
wrote this doc, which

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.340
maybe many of you in
this room are aware of,

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.610
called the Career Manifesto.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.034
And it was literally
just a simple Google doc,

00:01:44.034 --> 00:01:46.450
which took a lot of the advice
that he had been dispensing

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.850
about how to think about
career and just sort of put it

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.590
into writing.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.450
Well, the Career
Manifesto went viral.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.780
It got passed around beyond
the Google TV ads team,

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.220
beyond the walls of
Google, and has really

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.320
inspired a lot of people.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.400
And now there is a rumor that I
cannot confirm that this Career

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.130
Manifesto may be
turned into a book.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.900
And there is another rumor,
which I cannot also confirm,

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.515
that if you are here today and
you badge out and find Leah,

00:02:18.515 --> 00:02:21.010
who's sitting in the back
and make sure to badge out

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.010
on the way out, you may or
may not receive a copy of this

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.870
book, which may or may not be
published later on this year.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.580
But Mike is here to
bring it all to life.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.130
Again, Mike, thank you
so much for being here.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.120
It's so awesome to have
you back at Google.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.940
And we're psyched to just
hear what you have to say.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.530
MIKE STEIB: Thank you, Jesse.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.934
I'm thrilled to be back.

00:02:45.934 --> 00:02:47.517
You guys hear me OK
in the back there?

00:02:47.517 --> 00:02:48.380
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.380
MIKE STEIB: For anyone
who's watching the video,

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.060
I'm told this room seats 900.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.260
It's almost full.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.880
So this is really--
this is great.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.290
So quickly, I'm not
licensed to do this.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.750
First, it's probably
a disclaimer,

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.090
but Kate and Jesse
invited me to come

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.925
speak at an off-site here four
or five or six months ago.

00:03:09.925 --> 00:03:12.280
And I've heard from
a number of folks

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.810
since who wanted to connect.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.730
And so we came back.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.610
I'm excited to do it.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.010
I'm going to walk you through
essentially today a roadmap

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.560
for thinking about
your life, making

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.010
a plan for your life, which
I can't emphasize enough,

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.300
I'm completely
unqualified to do.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.260
At the same time, I
have found it useful,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.850
people who are important
to me have found it useful,

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.340
and you might as well.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.780
We've got 60 minutes.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.500
I have more.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.480
So as folks-- if
you have to leave,

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.570
leave any time, of course, and
I'll stay after a little while.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.250
I invite questions throughout.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.130
And we're going to save time
for questions at the end.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.630
Sound good?

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.670
Good plan for today?

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:54.170
All right.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.450
First, I need two
volunteers to help.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.519
Just-- it's wonderful.

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.560
You didn't even know what
I was going to ask for.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.874
It could be anything.

00:04:02.874 --> 00:04:04.540
Just tell me why you
came, what you were

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.690
hoping to get out of today.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.940
AUDIENCE: So I know Jesse, and
I like to listen to her advice.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.494
And I know it's always good
to get an outside perspective.

00:04:13.494 --> 00:04:14.410
MIKE STEIB: All right.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.701
Outside perspective and advice.

00:04:15.701 --> 00:04:16.250
Anyone else?

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.624
Tell me just your
goal for today.

00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:19.850
I want to make
sure we achieve it.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:20.350
Anyone else.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.603
What would you like
to get out of today?

00:04:22.603 --> 00:04:31.300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.570
MIKE STEIB: OK.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.410
So talking about
the cloud was not

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.200
in the original scope
of the presentation,

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.160
but I'm here for you guys.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.050
So outside advice and
perspective and talk about

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.560
cloud.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.630
Well, so all right.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.384
That's what we're going to do.

00:04:46.384 --> 00:04:47.050
Thank you, Kate.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.200
Thank you, Jesse,
for the invitation.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.660
Thank you Alan and Matthew
for getting this all set up.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.570
What I want to do first
is a quick exercise.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.604
I'm going to ask you
to close your eyes.

00:04:56.604 --> 00:04:58.270
I'm going to ask you
to admit something.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.930
So Matthew, I would like
you to put your hand

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.000
in front of the camera.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.390
You cover the camera.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.040
I want you to raise
your hand if you

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.110
are living the life
and career that you

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.290
dreamed you would be living.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.800
If you are on your dream
life's path, raise your hand.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.530
OK.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:14.030
Good.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.240
Both of you, put
your hands down.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.960
I've been there.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.580
I know exactly--

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.510
I know exactly how you feel.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:22.010
All right.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:27.770
One more thing-- raise your hand
if you are engaged or married

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.300
and of childbearing years.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.950
Raise your hand.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.810
All right.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.520
Download The Knot and The Bump.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.810
That's what I do for--

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.230
that's what I do for a living,
and I would appreciate that.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.420
So there's a website that
I want to tell you about,

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:50.300
and I'll footnote this
with a friend of mine

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.110
calls this discussion my
self-important obsession

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.122
with my own mortality.

00:05:55.122 --> 00:05:56.330
But I want you to play along.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.690
There's a website
called deathclock.com.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.610
If you put some information
into deathclock.com--

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.430
do you take care of yourself?

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.090
Do you smoke?

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.380
When you're born?

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.990
It'll tell you, give or take,
when you're going to die.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.210
So it doesn't know, but it's
from an actuarial table.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.470
It gives you a bet.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.600
Might be right,
it might be wrong.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.610
Mine's May 2068.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.110
All right.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.565
So we've got a deadline.

00:06:20.565 --> 00:06:24.305
And we've got-- now, I work out.

00:06:24.305 --> 00:06:27.560
I avoid Third World
Airlines, but still there's

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.820
a limited amount of time.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.880
You have a limited
amount of time.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:37.550
And you and I, we sit in this
incredibly privileged position

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.462
in the context of the
history of the world.

00:06:40.462 --> 00:06:42.670
The vast majority of human
beings who have ever lived

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.600
have lived very
short British lives

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.700
and have spent most
of their energy trying

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.070
to have food, shelter,
and to defend themselves.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.570
Right?

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.370
Like, that was most
people's obsessions.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.872
I have a friend who--

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:55.580
most of us in this
room, our grandparents

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.040
worked to make sure
no one starved.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.720
That was the purpose of work.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.840
And then I get to be
in a room with folks

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.050
like this who all were the
smartest kids in their classes,

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.030
went to good colleges,
work at Google.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.890
Someone made a
movie about what it

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.680
takes to try to get a job
at Google, and you have one.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.410
We're so fortunate.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:20.090
Our lives are such a gift.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.420
And yet many of us,
especially those

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:27.230
who come to obscure tech talks
about planning your life,

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.840
feel this dissatisfaction.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:35.159
We feel this thing,
something is not quite right.

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:37.700
We all have this sense that we
have a limited amount of time,

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:43.010
and we have this sense that
we're blessed with something,

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.260
a really precious amount
of time and a really

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.560
precious opportunity.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.184
And we're constantly
wondering if we're

00:07:48.184 --> 00:07:49.970
doing the right thing with it.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.170
Also people like us
have so many options.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:56.400
So many options.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.190
Headhunters call you guys?

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:00.360
They probably call you a lot.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.550
And you're being recruited
by other companies.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:03.675
You can really do anything.

00:08:03.675 --> 00:08:05.550
If you work here, you
could do anything.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.940
And there was a study done once.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.750
Some weird psychologists had
people walk into a store,

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.730
and there were four
jellies on the shelf.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.095
And they calculated how
many jellies they bought.

00:08:17.095 --> 00:08:18.720
And then people would
walk in the store

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.490
and they put like 70
jellies on the shelf,

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:21.960
and they calculate how
many jellies people bought.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.334
And the more jelly on the
shelf, the fewer people bought.

00:08:24.334 --> 00:08:30.060
We're paralyzed by the array
of choices that we have.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.883
So I'm going to walk you
through a little bit about how

00:08:32.883 --> 00:08:35.299
I've thought about those choices
and some other folks have

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:37.008
found those choices--

00:08:37.008 --> 00:08:38.549
and a way that other
folks have found

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:40.309
is a useful way to think
about those choices.

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:41.642
So I've got to skip some slides.

00:08:41.642 --> 00:08:44.594
I've got to go back
to the beginning.

00:08:44.594 --> 00:08:47.010
Any presentation that starts
with the definition of a word

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:48.160
is the worst presentation.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:48.743
But I'm sorry.

00:08:48.743 --> 00:08:52.350
I did this last night for you.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.270
What's important?

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:56.310
Now, that word, there
are multiple definitions.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.900
I picked one.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.360
One definition is
of high status.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.050
I like this one--

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.540
of great significance
or value, likely to have

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.680
a profound effect on success,
survival, or well-being.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.790
Important.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:14.420
And when you put
that in context, I'd

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:18.140
ask you a question--
how important are you?

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.041
Now, you could say, well, we're
all a unique and beautiful

00:09:21.041 --> 00:09:21.540
snowflake.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.410
We're all really important.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:22.920
That's fair.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.044
But like Mark Zuckerberg
is more important than me.

00:09:25.044 --> 00:09:26.770
I'm willing to admit that.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:29.370
It's very big of me.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.950
How important are you?

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.759
There's an exercise
that I've done

00:09:33.759 --> 00:09:35.550
and that others have
found helpful that I'm

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.320
going to walk you through now.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.530
It answers, in a
way, this question.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.044
So I'll start with you.

00:09:42.044 --> 00:09:42.960
How important are you?

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.725
This is you.

00:09:43.725 --> 00:09:46.770
And now think about the
impact that your life has.

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:52.540
An honest assessment of the
impact that your life has.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.060
I first did this--

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.250
I was like 26 years old, and I
had this very prestigious job

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.570
at a big media company, where I
worked in corporate development

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:01.320
and strategy.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.690
And we met with
important people.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.440
I was very big in my britches.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.440
And a friend of mine was
a kindergarten teacher,

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.220
and she asked me to speak at
the kindergarten for employment

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.110
day-- for jobs day.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.270
And a little girl, she
was a kindergartner

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.457
or a first grader,
came up and said

00:10:17.457 --> 00:10:20.040
to me-- they had these prepared
questions they had to ask you.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:24.180
And the first one she said, do
you bring your lunch to work?

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.740
And I was like, no,
that's a good idea.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.147
I spend a lot of money on lunch.

00:10:28.147 --> 00:10:29.480
I should bring my lunch to work.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.330
Thank you.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.180
And the second thing she
said, she said, do you

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.770
work in New York City?

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:35.550
I said I do.

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:36.960
I work at Rockefeller Plaza.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.130
It's really great.

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:39.670
Thank you for your questions.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:42.390
Third question, she said,
is your job important?

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:46.710
I said, well, capital
allocation is an important lever

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.800
of the success of
a corporate entity,

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.650
and I guess this strategy
stuff, sometimes it's obvious.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.825
But you know, someone
has to do these jobs.

00:10:54.825 --> 00:10:56.700
And I make a lot of charts.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.290
And this little girl is looking
at me, and then she said,

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:00.700
I'm supposed to write yes or no.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.870
And I said no.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:12.090
And I had an existential
crisis from a kindergartner.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:14.210
And I went home, and
I did this thing.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.100
So I was like, am I important?

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.060
What do I do?

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.090
Well, there's me and then what
things do I touch in the world?

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:21.724
It was my family and friends.

00:11:21.724 --> 00:11:24.140
And those of you who know me
know I have like six friends.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.730
So there's that.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:26.630
I call my parents.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:27.910
But I mean, this is not--

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:28.510
OK, fine.

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.780
That's nice.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:34.250
When I describe my work, my
value of a replacement player

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:35.236
just wasn't that high.

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:37.610
And the impact that I felt
that I was having on the world

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:40.426
wasn't that inspiring.

00:11:40.426 --> 00:11:42.800
I did a little bit of community
service stuff but nothing

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.490
where if you took me out
of the equation something

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:47.860
bad happened to the world.

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.151
I did the math, and I
was like, jeez, no wonder

00:11:50.151 --> 00:11:51.650
that little kid
made me feel so bad.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.960
I'm not having a
big enough impact

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.350
on the world with
what I would argue is

00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:01.190
a pretty precious opportunity.

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:02.632
So that's depressing.

00:12:02.632 --> 00:12:04.250
Like I said, but this is unfair.

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:07.597
So that exercise isn't fair,
because you're 26, you're 36,

00:12:07.597 --> 00:12:08.930
you've got a lot of years to go.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:10.100
And maybe you're
on the right path,

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.560
and you're going to have a
huge impact, just haven't yet.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:16.310
So I did the exercise again
and said-- oh, and I called it,

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:17.270
this is the impact map.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.230
I named this for you.

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.440
OK?

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.065
So the next thing,
it's like all right,

00:12:20.065 --> 00:12:22.710
imagine I become much
more senior in my role.

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.650
I get my boss's boss's
boss's job, then

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:26.090
how much impact can I have?

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:27.880
And I sort of went through it.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.340
And look, these are
personal judgments.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.725
There is no right answer here.

00:12:32.725 --> 00:12:34.100
It's what you
think is impactful.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.870
I worked at a
company whose primary

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:38.300
KPI was the number of hours
people spent on their butt

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.330
watching television.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.140
So I was like, even if
I get to be a lot more

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:43.730
important to this
company, I don't

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:45.813
know that I'm necessarily
having the impact that I

00:12:45.813 --> 00:12:47.270
want to have on the world.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.007
So I drew my map.

00:12:49.007 --> 00:12:51.090
And I thought through
things that I could be doing

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.180
and if I was more
senior, if I had

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:54.850
more money, if I had more time.

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:56.840
But I sort of scoped
it out, and I started

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.923
coming to this conclusion.

00:12:57.923 --> 00:13:00.650
I was like, I don't know
that I like the next 15

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:03.300
years that are laid out for me.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.770
All right.

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:05.915
So this sucks.

00:13:05.915 --> 00:13:07.470
I did it again.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.230
I did a total zero
base of my life.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:11.076
I was like, you're
a smart young guy.

00:13:11.076 --> 00:13:12.700
You've got plenty of
time ahead of you.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.673
If you can do
anything, and presume

00:13:14.673 --> 00:13:16.730
for this second you
could do anything,

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.254
how much impact could I have?

00:13:18.254 --> 00:13:19.670
And then this was
a hard exercise.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.220
I literally at one point--
this is a true story--

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:23.990
I literally called
NASA and asked what you

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:25.670
have to do to be an astronaut.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.250
And at the time I was thinking
space is so important,

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:30.200
but there's nobody out
in front like really

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.580
pushing new frontiers of space.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.440
You have to be a pilot.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.500
FYI, if any of you-- if
this was on your list.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:37.760
And you sort of run the math.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.470
You're like, all
right, I could do that,

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:42.200
but that might not
be the shortest

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.300
distance between two points.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:51.680
This part of the exercise
will reveal to you, I think,

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.020
whether or not you're
currently executing

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.820
a plan that is going
to get you to a place

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.700
where you can have a big
impact with your life.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:01.705
So there's you and
what you're achieving--

00:14:01.705 --> 00:14:03.830
what I was achieving then--
what you might consider

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:05.090
you're achieving today.

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.940
Because you're a little bit
more senior, 10 years from now,

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.640
running the same
playbook, and then there's

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.230
blank space, whatever
you could do.

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:13.340
Anything.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.620
Now, here I'll pause to
say, on this third exercise,

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:16.870
you have to suspend disbelief.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:19.212
There's this thing
that nags at all of us.

00:14:19.212 --> 00:14:20.670
We're like, well,
I know I'm smart.

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:22.130
I know I did well in school.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:26.330
But I don't know that I
could fill in the blank--

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:30.669
found a company, run a big
company, run for office,

00:14:30.669 --> 00:14:32.210
write a book, whatever
your thing is.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:32.440
I don't know.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.648
There are people who do that.

00:14:33.648 --> 00:14:35.770
I'm not that person.

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:38.321
And I've had the pleasure
of meeting all those people

00:14:38.321 --> 00:14:39.320
on the other side of it.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.370
They're no smarter than you.

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:41.930
They don't know anything
that you don't know.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:43.346
There are two
categories of people

00:14:43.346 --> 00:14:45.650
who have a job that
you can't have,

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:50.650
like super superstar musicians
and super superstar athletes.

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:52.340
It's just like, I just am not--

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.810
I'm not big enough to be a
linebacker for the Giants.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.500
So that one's out.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.020
But if my life's
dream was to work

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:01.857
in baseball operations
for the Yankees

00:15:01.857 --> 00:15:04.190
at a very senior level, of
course, I or you or any of us

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:05.550
could have that job.

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:07.744
If my life's dream was
to run a nonprofit that

00:15:07.744 --> 00:15:10.160
has an impact on the developing
world, of course any of us

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.060
could have that job.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.360
So you have to
suspend your disbelief

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.620
and think about what
you could be doing.

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.990
And you need to ask yourself
which one you like best.

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.840
This exercise doesn't presuppose
that the purpose of your life

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.965
is to maximize your impact.

00:15:24.965 --> 00:15:26.631
The purpose of this
exercise is to think

00:15:26.631 --> 00:15:29.540
about what it could be and then
ask yourself what you like.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.460
Someone who worked for
me many years ago said

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.840
to me in a review, you
know Mike, I just--

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.360
I don't live to work.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.880
I work to live.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.380
I said that's fair, you're
allowed to say that.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:43.190
You're allowed to
choose the first chart.

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:45.960
There are no judgments here.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.486
But you should know
which one you want.

00:15:48.486 --> 00:15:50.360
Don't say, well, I don't
really want all that

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.401
when you really do, because
you're afraid to try.

00:15:52.401 --> 00:15:55.130
So that's exercise number one.

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:56.090
Completely unhelpful.

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:58.340
All this does is force
an existential crisis.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.520
So hopefully-- some people
are nodding their heads.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:04.870
Hopefully I've caused a
couple few existential crises.

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:07.030
Then the second
part of the exercise

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:08.500
is where you start
to define, well,

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.264
so what should I do about that?

00:16:10.264 --> 00:16:11.680
Mike, the last
thing you said is I

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.138
could be anything
from an astronaut

00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:15.540
to an entrepreneur
to a politician.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.090
So which one?

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:25.017
And we think about
designing a product.

00:16:25.017 --> 00:16:26.850
And the way that you
design a product is you

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:28.860
have certain things that
the product has to do

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.270
and certain things that
you would like it to do.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.645
And you work really hard to
maximize all the things you'd

00:16:32.645 --> 00:16:34.920
like it to do and not
sacrifice any of the things

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.600
that it has to do.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.680
If we were designing
an iPod, it's too late.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.600
But if you were
designing an iPod,

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.516
you'd say it has to play
at least 1,000 songs.

00:16:41.516 --> 00:16:43.230
It has to last at
least 12 hours.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:44.700
It has to fit in your pocket.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:45.982
Everything else is a bonus.

00:16:45.982 --> 00:16:47.940
And you'd start trying
to make the best product

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.620
within those constraints.

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:53.861
So now we've sort
of opened up the--

00:16:53.861 --> 00:16:55.110
we've opened up the lens here.

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:56.984
We've zero-based how we
think about our life.

00:16:56.984 --> 00:16:59.700
Now we start to say, OK,
well, if I can do anything

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:03.480
to have a big impact,
what do I want to do?

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.329
And here I did a
very simple exercise.

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:09.900
Make a list of things
that you love to do,

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.599
things that you hate to do,
and things that you cannot live

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:13.770
without.

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:16.230
So on the last
chart, I very well

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:19.619
may have concluded that the most
impactful thing I could do--

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:21.839
I once studied the
impact that you

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.819
can have through
nonprofits, and one

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:27.170
of the highest ROI,
the highest ROI

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:30.030
you can get nonprofit
work at the time I

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:33.180
did the research is distributing
mosquito nets in the developing

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:33.720
world.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:37.080
The impact that it can have
on malaria and human health,

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.171
and it's significant.

00:17:40.171 --> 00:17:41.670
That doesn't mean
that I necessarily

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:44.211
have to make that my job next,
because if you make this list,

00:17:44.211 --> 00:17:47.280
like, I really hate travel
and hot places and mosquitoes.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.950
So that one just might not
be the right one for me.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:51.630
There was other stuff
on the list that

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:56.250
can be really impactful that I
can do that I also can really

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:57.810
enjoy.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:00.060
So what do you hate doing?

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:03.090
And these things change at
different parts of your life.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:05.280
I have two young kids, and
there are jobs out there

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.237
that are just 220 days a year
on an airplane or a hotel.

00:18:08.237 --> 00:18:08.820
I won't do it.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.520
That's a design
constraint on my life.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.940
Travel some during the quarter,
but I can't live on the road.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.550
I'll miss what's
going on at home.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:19.810
It's a personal choice.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:21.300
You fill this whole thing in.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.970
And you have to do
it really honestly.

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.290
You have to be
honest with yourself.

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:30.730
And I'll use one example
where we never are.

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:34.860
And again, another really
personal question but it's

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.400
money.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.940
How much money do
you need to be happy?

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.820
Well, we've all been trained
to answer that question.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.550
We've been trained by like
Shel Silverstein poems

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:48.510
that what you're supposed to
say is money doesn't matter.

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:49.860
Money cannot buy happiness.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.210
I don't care about money.

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:54.165
All right.

00:18:54.165 --> 00:18:58.070
You ever live in a sixth floor
studio walk up with two kids?

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.880
It's hard.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.180
There are trade-offs,
and there are

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.130
considerations that we have to
make in all of these things.

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:07.890
So take this one--

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:12.360
let's use this example, how
much money does someone need?

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.310
Because you get
tricked on both ends.

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:17.695
What happens is, there
will be a day, a moment,

00:19:17.695 --> 00:19:19.820
where you have an opportunity
to choose among jobs.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.444
They may be within
your company or they

00:19:21.444 --> 00:19:23.526
may be outside of your company.

00:19:23.526 --> 00:19:24.900
And here's how
they always look--

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.145
there's a thing that you
know you want to be doing,

00:19:27.145 --> 00:19:28.020
and it's really cool.

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.000
It doesn't pay as much, but
you can live-- it's fine,

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:30.849
you can live on it.

00:19:30.849 --> 00:19:32.640
And there's this other
thing, and then they

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.990
keep raising the
temperature and offering

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:36.614
you more and more and more money
not to do the thing you really

00:19:36.614 --> 00:19:38.890
want to do.

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:41.012
It's a real choice.

00:19:41.012 --> 00:19:42.220
Everyone does the same thing.

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.660
Everyone takes the money.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:45.640
But we never ever
say-- no one ever

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.630
says I'm going to sacrifice
my dream to take the money.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:52.230
Our brains are too good
at self-justification.

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.190
We never ever do that.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:57.490
What we say is, I'll
take the money now,

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:04.150
and then in two or three years,
I can do anything I want.

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:08.020
Here's what happens-- whatever
money you make, you spend.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.430
Trust me.

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:11.770
Whatever money you
make, you spend.

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:13.270
So if someone says
to you, hey, come

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:15.280
take a job that is inconsistent
with the impact you

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:15.780
want to have.

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.190
It's inconsistent with
the things you enjoy,

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:18.890
but we'll pay you
a ton of money.

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:20.950
What will happen is
you will spend it.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:23.072
And then you will
not only be unhappy,

00:20:23.072 --> 00:20:25.030
you'll have even less
flexibility in your life,

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:32.680
because now you have a house
in Montauk, which is great.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.080
You used to have a
job you like, and you

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.570
rented a place in Quogue.

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:39.070
Now you have a job you hate,
and you own a house in Montauk,

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:42.310
and you have to keep the job.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:45.340
These personal sort of
design constraints and design

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:48.070
considerations you have to
really fight with yourself

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.894
and wrestle with each
and every one of them.

00:20:51.894 --> 00:20:53.560
And then you start
to come to a picture.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.170
You've started to outline some
things that could be impactful

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:57.378
that you'd really love to do.

00:20:57.378 --> 00:21:02.020
You start to outline
things that you would enjoy

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.970
and things you would not enjoy.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:05.800
And you start to get
a sense for something

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.022
like what you'd want to do.

00:21:07.022 --> 00:21:08.980
At this stage of the
exercise, I could probably

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.830
say I love working
with great people

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.450
and leading great people.

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:17.380
I love working in a
technology-related sector.

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.560
And I love to have work
that impacts lots and lots

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.390
and lots of users
in a positive way.

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:23.000
That's vague.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.860
Like you can't add an objective
to your resume based on that,

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:27.580
but I get closer.

00:21:31.391 --> 00:21:33.820
Oh, and the last part
of that is, I take--

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:36.132
just to lay on this point--

00:21:36.132 --> 00:21:37.590
look at the credit
card statements.

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:39.380
Look at how much money
we spend every month.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:41.660
Add up how much private schools
cost and the mortgage, dat dat

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:43.368
dat, and that adds up
to this much money.

00:21:43.368 --> 00:21:45.520
I'm like, OK, I've got
to make that much money.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.500
And any amount of money
over that, forget it.

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.190
I literally don't care.

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:51.130
I am not going to chase more.

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:52.690
I just need to hit--

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:53.960
I need to hit a certain bid.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.870
Because if I don't hit this
bid, the next best school

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:57.575
in our district after
the private school

00:21:57.575 --> 00:21:58.450
has a metal detector.

00:21:58.450 --> 00:21:59.930
So I'm going to be right--

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:01.580
I'm going to land
it right there.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:02.080
All right.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.712
So then we're
narrowing the field.

00:22:04.712 --> 00:22:06.670
We're designing this
product that is your life.

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:09.430
So now I'm just going
to filter the results.

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:12.580
Geography, function,
industry, company size.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:13.972
Where do I want to live?

00:22:13.972 --> 00:22:15.430
There are essentially
two choices--

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:18.400
New York or someplace else--

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.480
for me.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.426
It depends on what
is important for you.

00:22:22.426 --> 00:22:23.800
But there was a
period of my life

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.540
where I didn't internalize this.

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.040
And someone would
call and say we've

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.560
got this awesome
job for you running

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.580
six countries in Europe.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:36.340
And I am not the Europe guy.

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:36.840
You know me.

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.298
Like, I'm not
supposed to be there.

00:22:38.298 --> 00:22:40.330
But you go through this
crazy like, oh, maybe I

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:41.230
should go to Europe.

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:43.090
And I can sell widgets
to French people

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:44.412
and things will be great.

00:22:44.412 --> 00:22:46.870
And then think of the career
I could have because I can put

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:48.820
global experience on my resume.

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.959
When I leave New York to
go on vacation, I'm sad.

00:22:50.959 --> 00:22:52.000
I can't wait to get home.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:52.666
I love New York.

00:22:52.666 --> 00:22:54.632
That's my design constraint.

00:22:54.632 --> 00:22:56.590
I have friends who feel
that way about Chicago,

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:58.048
who feel that way
about California,

00:22:58.048 --> 00:23:00.070
who will not mess with Texas.

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.822
That's up to you.

00:23:00.822 --> 00:23:02.530
Other people do not
have this constraint.

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:03.738
It means you can do way more.

00:23:03.738 --> 00:23:06.520
I have friends who will pick
up stakes and go any time.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.704
You have to know
the answer for you.

00:23:08.704 --> 00:23:10.120
And the job shouldn't
decide that.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.400
You should decide that
and then filter the jobs

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.580
before they interrupt your day.

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:19.000
Next is what function
should you do?

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.130
And this is, you
know, a lot of us,

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:23.350
you sort of take a job
coming out of business school

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:24.975
or something, and
that's your function,

00:23:24.975 --> 00:23:27.080
and then you're just in
it, just in the function.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.440
You all work at a great company.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.190
They just let you switch.

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:32.026
A lot of places it's harder.

00:23:32.026 --> 00:23:34.150
There are basically three
functions in any company.

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:36.630
We make it so
difficult. We make it's

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:38.627
sound difficult. You can
either make the stuff

00:23:38.627 --> 00:23:40.210
or you can sell the
stuff or you could

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:41.980
support the people who make
the stuff or sell the stuff.

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.710
Those are basically
the three jobs.

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:44.520
So which one are
you going to do?

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.170
Are you going to make it?

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:47.378
Are you going to sell it or
are you going to support?

00:23:47.378 --> 00:23:48.640
And then, is that marketing?

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.306
Is that finance?

00:23:49.306 --> 00:23:50.672
Is that legal?

00:23:50.672 --> 00:23:52.630
You don't have to stay
in the function forever,

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:55.046
but it's really healthy once
you start to narrow the field

00:23:55.046 --> 00:23:56.770
and say I enjoy blank.

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:58.300
I enjoy design.

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:00.460
I enjoyed sales.

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:02.740
And if you have a hard time
with it, it's hard to say.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.865
It's especially hard to
say when you're in the job,

00:24:04.865 --> 00:24:07.150
because whatever job you're
in kind of sucks today.

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:08.350
That's life.

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:11.350
Because the job you're in today
comes with email and meetings

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:15.910
and a form you have to fill
out and an angry customer.

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:19.616
It always looks better to
be in someone else's job.

00:24:19.616 --> 00:24:21.490
So you ask yourself,
what are the things that

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:22.720
stir my animal spirits?

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:27.220
When am I most psyched at work?

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.380
Is it when you are
organizing the stuff?

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.390
There are people
who get endorphins

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:33.940
when they are in spreadsheets,
taking chaos, and turning

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.790
that chaos into order, giving
that order back to the team

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:38.920
and helping that
team to run better.

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.600
That feels good.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.660
Have you ever seen the way
the sweaters are lined up

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:44.680
in my closet?

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.470
It is the closet
of a psychopath.

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:51.354
I love when the comp plan
matches the behaviors

00:24:51.354 --> 00:24:52.270
you want for the team.

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:53.470
That is fun for me.

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:56.140
That is a thing that I
get endorphins from that.

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:59.290
Other people, they just see
that a Google spreadsheet has

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:01.700
been opened on their
computer, like, gah.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.260
They don't want to do it.

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.950
Some people, the thought
of going on a sales call

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:08.600
and convincing someone
to take something

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:12.370
that you want to give them
makes them want to throw up.

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:17.080
Some of us walk out of a meeting
where we've influenced someone,

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.960
and we're completely
energized by it.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.010
So what are those
things at work?

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:24.277
It's not do I love the job that
I currently have in finance?

00:25:24.277 --> 00:25:26.110
Do I love the job I
currently have in sales?

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:30.170
No, like every day it sucks
in one way or another.

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:33.700
But what is the essence of
the thing that I love doing?

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:37.330
Leading, influencing others,
organizing the world,

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:39.300
et cetera, et cetera.

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:42.250
It helps to narrow
down the functions.

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:43.370
Then you can ask industry.

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:44.470
Some people have a
strong opinion of this.

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:45.511
You probably should pick.

00:25:45.511 --> 00:25:47.717
It gets harder and harder
to switch over time.

00:25:47.717 --> 00:25:49.300
You guys all picked
a pretty good one.

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.110
And I'd skip this.

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:51.630
You work in a good industry.

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:53.020
You could switch
to food services

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:55.000
if you have a
passion for it, but I

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.340
think you're on the right path.

00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:01.800
And then last is sort of
company size and company stage.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.660
And a mistake that
many people who

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.700
work at big successful
companies make

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.770
is that your lens for the
world starts to become

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:11.500
big successful companies.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.640
When I worked at Google--
this was a while ago--

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.800
there were only three jobs.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.600
It was Google,
Facebook, and whatever

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.860
was the other hot
company people were

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.000
talking about that's
going to become

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.166
the next Google or Facebook.

00:26:20.166 --> 00:26:22.360
That's all we talked about.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:26.950
There is this enormous range
of companies of different sizes

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.900
and different stages at
which one could work.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.360
Now, the more
enlightened among us

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.620
thought that there
was Google, Facebook,

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:34.100
the place that could be the
next Google or Facebook,

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:35.600
and some startup that called.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.240
And so there was a fourth.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:41.290
In between are companies with a
market cap between $200 million

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:45.970
and $20 billion that
need really good people.

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:48.250
And I've had friends who
were like, what I really

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:50.330
want to do is just
run a big function.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.094
I'm like, you work at a--

00:26:52.094 --> 00:26:54.010
this one or another one--
a really big company

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:58.160
where someone might not give
you a really big function.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.000
But there's another company
with 1,000 employees, 5,000

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.150
employees, the sun would
rise and set on someone

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:05.317
with your talents.

00:27:05.317 --> 00:27:06.900
So this is an important
consideration.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:10.649
And it's one that many
of us miss, because--

00:27:10.649 --> 00:27:12.190
I don't know-- anyone
here ever think

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:17.595
about working at like Open
Table or Grubhub or TripAdvisor

00:27:17.595 --> 00:27:18.497
or HomeAway.

00:27:18.497 --> 00:27:20.830
These are companies with
market caps of like $1 billion,

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:22.420
$2 billion, $3 billion.

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:23.260
They're so small.

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:26.755
Like Google belches $3 billion.

00:27:26.755 --> 00:27:29.470
So to go work at a company where
the whole thing is worth that,

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:31.931
it's like oh, god.

00:27:31.931 --> 00:27:33.430
Those are really
cool companies that

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:34.960
deliver really
cool services that

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.224
could really use great people.

00:27:37.224 --> 00:27:38.890
To be clear, I'm not
asking anybody here

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:40.014
to go take a job like that.

00:27:40.014 --> 00:27:42.556
But I'm just saying there's
a range of company sizes.

00:27:42.556 --> 00:27:43.930
And whatever
company you work at,

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:45.388
you tend not to
see the other ones.

00:27:45.388 --> 00:27:47.750
You ever-- startup people
are their startup people.

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:48.880
Oh, my startup's
getting too big.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:49.755
I need a new startup.

00:27:49.755 --> 00:27:52.540
OK, as long as that's
not because where you sit

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.690
is where you stand, you just
have started to form this bias.

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:59.120
If you really love it, then
that's the right thing for you.

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.390
And then there's stage.

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:04.420
Continuing excellence is the
stage of many large companies.

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:05.860
That can be fun.

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:07.360
Turnaround can be a lot of fun.

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.470
Take somebody's broken
company and fix it.

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:11.350
Startup can be a lot of fun.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:12.940
You change the
paper in the copier.

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:13.750
It's up to you.

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:16.240
You've got to decide
what you like doing.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.310
I have friends in
the harvest business.

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:19.780
That one is no fun.

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:21.950
They're like, OK, the
investors think the business

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:22.870
will last five more years.

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:25.203
If we can make it last eight,
we'll make a lot of money.

00:28:25.203 --> 00:28:26.380
But that's a job.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.490
It's an honorable job.

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:28.940
It helps keep the
economy moving.

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.910
You've got to make
your own decisions.

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:33.700
So through that
exercise, you start

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:37.000
to narrow down what are the
things that could have impact?

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.680
How could I be
important to the world?

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.720
How important do I want to be?

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:44.290
What are the things that I
enjoy or don't enjoy or things

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:45.950
that I need to be happy?

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:49.209
And then as I'm picking among
career choices, which are

00:28:49.209 --> 00:28:50.500
the ones that feel right to me?

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:53.440
And you start to
narrow the field.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:56.230
So over time, I was able to
narrow the field down to I

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:57.550
really like tech.

00:28:57.550 --> 00:29:00.770
I want a smaller company but
one that has an opportunity

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:02.140
to have real impact.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:05.510
I want something that I
think we can really grow.

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:08.380
I want to be in a significant
leadership position.

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:10.861
Then you can wait
for your pitch,

00:29:10.861 --> 00:29:12.610
and you know when to
swing, because you've

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:15.220
got a good sense for that
thing that you're looking for.

00:29:21.572 --> 00:29:24.030
If you look at the careers of
people who've been successful

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:26.195
and people who haven't,
generally speaking,

00:29:26.195 --> 00:29:27.570
the people who've
been successful

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:30.990
have known what they're looking
for and they have a plan.

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:33.900
And the people
who've done OK tend

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:38.340
to have a career path that has
a lot of variety or no variety.

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.020
They stay in one
job in one function

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:43.200
and just wait to be
elevated or they keep

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.330
changing to try new things.

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:49.430
But you don't see a plan.

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:52.830
And so the next
part I would suggest

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:58.280
is once you've got a sense
for what you want to do,

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:02.580
you then come to grips
with the brutal fact

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.550
that you are unqualified for
that thing that you want,

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:10.700
completely unqualified
to do it today.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:14.430
But you have the
ability and the right

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:19.320
to expect to be in that
position in some period of time.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:23.220
And then from here to there,
you have to make a plan.

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.710
The way you make a plan--
here's one way you can do it--

00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:28.620
think of the job
that you really want.

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.330
If mine got really
specific, I'd say

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:34.020
I want to be a senior
executive, a C-level executive,

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:36.870
in the tech space with
consumer-facing products.

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:39.130
Let's say I picked that one.

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:42.630
There are bios of senior
executives in the tech space

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:44.560
available on every
one of those company's

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:45.060
Websites.

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:46.110
Read them.

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:49.530
What experiences did they have?

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:51.450
Meet with people
who have these jobs.

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:55.320
Ask them what do you have
to be good at in your job?

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:59.230
You'd be amazed at who's
willing to talk to you.

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:01.380
Then you say, OK, those
are experiences I need.

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.450
Those are things I
need to be good at.

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:04.560
How do I get it?

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.520
Some of them are easy.

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.390
You need to know
how to manage a P&amp;L.

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:11.940
You need to know how to read
the numbers for the job I just

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.945
described.

00:31:13.945 --> 00:31:14.820
My wife was a banker.

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:15.611
She gave me a book.

00:31:15.611 --> 00:31:16.660
It was like this thick.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.034
It was on accounting
and finance,

00:31:18.034 --> 00:31:19.590
and I read this horrible book.

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:22.500
I'd rather eat that
book than read it again.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:23.372
But then I knew.

00:31:23.372 --> 00:31:25.080
You knew what to debit
and what to credit

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.970
and the difference
between EBIT and EBITDA

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:28.680
and all these things that
are so confusing to someone

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.340
who hasn't read the book.

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:30.150
I read the book.

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:32.040
You basically get it.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.470
There are other things that
reading the book helps,

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:36.870
but you really have to do it.

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:37.980
Managing a large team.

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:40.170
Anyone who has a big job
like the one I described

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:41.580
manages a large team.

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.640
At the time that I did
this impact map exercise,

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.560
I managed a team of one intern.

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.450
His name was Felix.

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:51.150
I was not qualified
to manage managers

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:52.680
in a large team at
an organization.

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.388
Tell me about your
leadership experience.

00:31:54.388 --> 00:31:57.330
Like, well, one time Felix
wasn't doing what he should,

00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:03.810
and I said Felix, I really need
you to do something different.

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:07.850
But what you can do with any of
these capabilities is you can--

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:09.870
you break it down
into its atomic parts

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:13.860
and say, OK, what does
leading a large team entail?

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:15.960
Being able to hire good people.

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:16.460
OK.

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:18.876
Break that down further, because
if you don't have a team,

00:32:18.876 --> 00:32:20.160
you're not allowed to hire.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.340
Knowing how to recruit
and identify good talent.

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:24.510
OK.

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:26.221
Anyone here can
participate in that.

00:32:26.221 --> 00:32:27.720
If you are an
individual contributor

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:31.380
on a team that hires
from time to time,

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:33.930
ask your manager if you can
help be a part of the interview

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:34.765
process.

00:32:34.765 --> 00:32:37.140
Tell your manager I've just
read two books on the topic--

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.971
read the books--

00:32:38.971 --> 00:32:41.220
I think I've developed some
expertise on interviewing.

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:42.480
Can I please
interview a candidate

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.930
and give you my notes on the
person and compare with you?

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:46.980
That would take you
very little bit of time.

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:49.770
Now you're becoming someone
who's developing expertise

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:51.450
in interviewing.

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:58.230
Next, you get a Felix, and
you manage that Felix well.

00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:00.210
You might break
down other elements

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:01.800
of a leader's position.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.030
Being a good communicator.

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:04.800
There are books on this, and
there are opportunities for you

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.090
to demonstrate this at work.

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:07.297
You practice these things.

00:33:07.297 --> 00:33:08.880
The worst thing that
could ever happen

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.296
is you get the job
of your dreams,

00:33:10.296 --> 00:33:13.080
and you just never
put in the effort

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.660
to become good at those things.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:18.270
You swing and miss when
you finally get the chance.

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:23.100
So this career roadmap,
you break the job

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:25.480
that you'd like to have
ultimately in your life

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.480
down into the things that
you have to be good at

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.370
and the experience
that you need.

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:32.550
And you go and you get them.

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:34.470
You go develop
those experiences,

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:37.110
sometimes through books, through
mentoring, through practice,

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:38.610
through side hustle.

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:41.170
It's up to you.

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:43.380
How are we on time?

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:45.360
Do we have any time left?

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.170
I think we do.

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:48.474
But what I want to
do is, the next part

00:33:48.474 --> 00:33:49.390
is a little different.

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:52.570
So I'm going to pause
there and take questions.

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:53.786
Who has a question?

00:33:53.786 --> 00:33:54.810
Is this helpful?

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:55.310
Useful?

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.490
There's a question.

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:01.740
AUDIENCE: How often do you
find that people are just--

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.130
AUDIENCE: Can you please
use the microphone?

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:03.470
MIKE STEIB: It's OK.

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:04.720
I'll just repeat the question.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:05.830
Can you please say it?

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:07.630
AUDIENCE: How often do you
find that people are just

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:09.713
always striving for the
grass always being greener

00:34:09.713 --> 00:34:12.239
or seeing something better
than what they currently

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:15.780
have when it turns out they're
just looking for something

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:17.822
else different as opposed
to this specific thing?

00:34:17.822 --> 00:34:20.071
MIKE STEIB: How often do you
find that someone is just

00:34:20.071 --> 00:34:22.679
looking for the next thing and
the grass is always greener

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:23.739
rather than looking
for the right thing?

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:24.238
Always?

00:34:24.238 --> 00:34:25.260
All the time.

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:25.900
All the time.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:26.980
It's a great question.

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:30.780
And it's why having
a purpose and a plan

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.880
is so important to your success.

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.172
And I want to, if I can, I
want to sort of break that

00:34:36.172 --> 00:34:37.380
question down into two parts.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:40.610
Because one is just
vague dissatisfaction

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:43.469
as a driver of a career
is not necessarily

00:34:43.469 --> 00:34:46.112
going to get you
to the right place.

00:34:46.112 --> 00:34:47.070
This is obvious, right?

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:48.310
But you don't know
where you're going.

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:50.518
The faster you run in that
direction, the more likely

00:34:50.518 --> 00:34:51.894
you are to miss it.

00:34:55.319 --> 00:34:57.610
The second component of that
question-- so have a plan.

00:34:57.610 --> 00:34:59.530
So part of the answer
is if you have a plan,

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:01.810
and you're jamming
to achieve that plan,

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:03.420
you're on the right path.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:08.260
Second part of the question is,
you might have asked it there.

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:08.980
I might ask.

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.110
Hey, I'm really ambitious
so I'm always miserable,

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:12.943
because other people
are more senior than me

00:35:12.943 --> 00:35:13.850
or more successful.

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:15.010
Have you ever felt that?

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:17.050
Somebody ever like leave your
team or leave the company

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:19.633
and go somewhere else and get a
better job and a better title,

00:35:19.633 --> 00:35:21.616
and you're like oh, that person?

00:35:21.616 --> 00:35:22.115
Please.

00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:27.235
The guy is terrible.

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:32.300
Like there's someplace
you want to be

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.110
and then other people seem to be
someplace else and you're not,

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:39.320
and it makes you
like, aah, crazy.

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:43.102
So that's not healthy either.

00:35:43.102 --> 00:35:44.560
Not being ambitious
is not healthy.

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:45.760
Not having a plan
is not healthy.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.551
But then always being
miserable because you

00:35:47.551 --> 00:35:50.110
want to be somewhere
else is not healthy too.

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:55.960
So as you think about it,
here's a good exercise to do.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:59.230
Imagine the sum of all of
your dreams-- astronaut,

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:01.870
like whatever it is--

00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:05.900
you want to be CEO
of pick a company.

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:08.830
You want to run such
and such, just pick it.

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:10.270
And if you wanted
a ton of money,

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:12.670
give yourself $100 million
bucks, put it all in a pile.

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:14.650
Put it on a pile on a plate.

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:15.832
And I will give it to you.

00:36:15.832 --> 00:36:17.290
It's a trade that
you have to make.

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:18.670
I will trade you something.

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:20.590
I will give you all
the things you want,

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:26.770
and all you have to give me
back is the health of someone

00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:33.910
important to you or your
sight or your limbs,

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:37.720
your relationship
with your parents.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.880
Very few people would
make that trade, which

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.970
means you currently have--

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:44.350
this is mathematically
true-- you currently

00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:48.516
have more value than all the
things to which you aspire.

00:36:48.516 --> 00:36:50.890
What you have right now is
worth more than all the things

00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:52.240
that you want.

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:55.600
So it would be criminal,
it would be horrible,

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.760
to have all of that and
be miserable all the time,

00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:00.218
because somebody else got a
raise you didn't or a promotion

00:37:00.218 --> 00:37:00.920
you didn't.

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:04.240
It would be awful to set
yourself off on this journey

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.880
to have impact, but
all along the way

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.520
to be miserable because you
haven't had the impact yet.

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:13.270
So the balance, the trick,
and it's hard to do,

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:18.220
is to enjoy today and be
driving for greater impact

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:20.950
that you want to
have in the future.

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:22.040
A great way to do that--

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.040
one man's opinion, take
it for what it's worth--

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:26.380
is just don't multitask.

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:29.051
If you're with your friends,
turn off your phone.

00:37:29.051 --> 00:37:31.300
Yes, there's interesting
stuff going on on your phone,

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:33.841
but there's interesting stuff
going on with your friends too,

00:37:33.841 --> 00:37:36.990
and if you're half on the phone
you missed the whole thing.

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:39.150
Yes, someone else got
promoted or something

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:40.365
is going on at work
that's stressing you out,

00:37:40.365 --> 00:37:41.790
but be in the moment
that you're in now.

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:43.890
Don't be stressing out about
some stuff going on over there.

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:44.940
That's a balance.

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:45.865
And it's a balance.

00:37:45.865 --> 00:37:47.115
It's a great question, though.

00:37:47.115 --> 00:37:47.615
Thank you.

00:37:47.615 --> 00:37:49.840
Other questions, in the back.

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:52.170
AUDIENCE: So as you're going
through these exercises

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:55.440
and identifying what
you need in order

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:59.160
to set up the filters to
build a plan, how do you

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:02.370
or what recommendations do you
have for someone that says,

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:03.075
I don't know?

00:38:03.075 --> 00:38:04.560
And I don't know
what I would love.

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:05.910
MIKE STEIB: The question is, if
you're going through all this

00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:07.535
and you don't know,
what should you do?

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:11.760
This is the tyranny
of choice, right?

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:12.930
This is what's so hard.

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:17.092
There was some experiment
where the psychologist gave--

00:38:17.092 --> 00:38:19.300
they brought a group of
people in and said they could

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:20.995
have a free pair of jeans.

00:38:20.995 --> 00:38:22.620
And they said to the
one group, they're

00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:24.636
like just pick a pair of jeans.

00:38:24.636 --> 00:38:25.510
They had three jeans.

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:27.759
It was tighty jeans and
regular jeans and baggy jeans.

00:38:27.759 --> 00:38:31.994
And everyone under 30, I
guess took the tighty jeans.

00:38:31.994 --> 00:38:33.660
They had another group
come in, and they

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:35.330
were like we have 60
different kinds of jeans.

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:36.960
They had every different
kind that you want,

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.293
and later they ask people how
happy they were with them.

00:38:39.293 --> 00:38:41.445
And the people who had
fewer choices were happier.

00:38:41.445 --> 00:38:44.130
The people who had more choices
had all this regret over

00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:46.342
whether or not they
took the right ones.

00:38:46.342 --> 00:38:48.800
So if your question is, you go
through this whole exercise,

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:51.050
and you're just
paralyzed by the choice--

00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:55.680
paralyzed-- give
yourself a deadline,

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:57.070
and give yourself a method.

00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:57.570
All right?

00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:00.450
I did a thing where I woke
up every morning at 5:00 AM

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:02.104
and I would write.

00:39:02.104 --> 00:39:03.520
I would write and
write and write.

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.680
I wrote bucket list.

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.000
I wrote a eulogy.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.670
I wrote the book report that
I would want my granddaughter

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:12.049
to write about me some
50 years from now.

00:39:12.049 --> 00:39:13.590
Write, write, write,
all these things

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:15.030
that I wanted to be true.

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:18.715
Mike Steib, what do you want
it to say in your eulogy?

00:39:18.715 --> 00:39:21.000
Mike Steib leaves
us at 125 years old.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.500
He still has all
of his hair, and he

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:28.189
has 90 wonderful
great-great-grandchildren.

00:39:28.189 --> 00:39:30.480
Whatever your thing is, like
what are those things that

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:31.350
are important?

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:32.970
The more you go through that
exercise, the more clarity

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:33.190
it gives you.

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:34.981
And I can't emphasize
this enough-- writing

00:39:34.981 --> 00:39:36.360
is really powerful.

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.250
Not typing, writing.

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:43.020
It just seems to touch a
different part of your brain.

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:45.507
And that exercise starts
to bring you clarity.

00:39:45.507 --> 00:39:46.590
And then wander the earth.

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:47.310
Tell you yourself,
I'm going to go

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:49.080
talk to these 10 people
who have careers--

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.550
different kinds of careers--
that they seem to enjoy,

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:53.040
and I'm just going to ask
them how did you do it?

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:54.720
What was interesting?

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.640
What did you like?

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.380
Do that exercise.

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:02.100
If you still don't
know what to do,

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:03.660
that means you're indifferent.

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:04.980
Pick one.

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.560
Pick one and stick with
it, and just go for it.

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.670
Pick one that's like--

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:12.990
and honestly, there is no
perfect answer for you.

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:16.090
Unless you are Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart,

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:20.430
you are supposed to play
piano, like 99.9999% of us

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:22.500
are not supposed to do anything.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:25.540
So pick one.

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:27.786
I have a friend who's an
author, and I said to him--

00:40:27.786 --> 00:40:29.077
this was a couple of years ago.

00:40:29.077 --> 00:40:30.243
I was like this is so great.

00:40:30.243 --> 00:40:32.792
You wrote a book,
like you're a writer.

00:40:32.792 --> 00:40:34.250
How did you know
you were a writer,

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:36.360
and he was like that's the
stupidest question I've ever

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:36.600
heard.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.230
You're a writer after
you write a book.

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:40.796
So you don't know you're a
writer until you write a book.

00:40:40.796 --> 00:40:41.670
Then you're a writer.

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:43.211
I'm like, no, but
like a real writer.

00:40:43.211 --> 00:40:44.760
He's like they
don't do that they.

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.410
Don't split them
into categories.

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:50.020
There's just a writer.

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:52.929
So if you can't pick--

00:40:52.929 --> 00:40:53.970
I put my email up before.

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:54.553
Just email me.

00:40:54.553 --> 00:40:55.597
I'll give you something.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:01.224
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]
heard from a lot of people

00:41:01.224 --> 00:41:05.096
is to never try to over-engineer
that things change,

00:41:05.096 --> 00:41:08.000
that opportunities come
up, and that if you

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.452
are too busy planning, you
will miss opportunities.

00:41:10.452 --> 00:41:11.910
MIKE STEIB: Oh,
that's interesting.

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:13.660
AUDIENCE: What's your
perspective on that?

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:15.660
MIKE STEIB: The question,
if you didn't hear it,

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:18.080
was I think the opposite of
everything you just said.

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:21.903
What was your name?

00:41:21.903 --> 00:41:22.750
AUDIENCE: Matt.

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:24.020
MIKE STEIB: So Matt
said, I've gotten advice

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:25.610
that you shouldn't try to
over-engineer your career,

00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:27.230
because you could
miss something.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:28.560
It's very good advice.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.670
But I might express
it differently.

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:35.141
You should be iterating
this plan regularly.

00:41:35.141 --> 00:41:37.640
You should regularly be asking
yourself, what kind of impact

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:38.390
do I want to have?

00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:43.550
What career roadmap
do I want to execute?

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:46.050
As you're in the field, as
you're doing and learning,

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:49.310
you should be
iterating that plan.

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:52.550
There is some moment when a
bunch of people who really

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:56.660
wanted to work in media defined
it as television and missed

00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:58.160
internet.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:01.130
Did not reboot their
career plan for maybe

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:05.060
I'll do something
in the internet,

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:07.940
much to later their dismay.

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:09.590
So I would say you
should have a plan

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:12.470
and you should engineer it, but
in the same way that we develop

00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:14.750
products and put them
in front of our users,

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:18.055
launch early and
often, you should

00:42:18.055 --> 00:42:19.430
learn from the
experience, and we

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:21.570
should iterate to the
next level of the product.

00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:22.840
And I that gives you
the best of both.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:23.820
It gives you a plan.

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:26.240
You're not just wandering
in the wilderness.

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:30.140
And it allows you to
take new data points

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:31.640
and incorporate
them into that plan.

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.500
That would be my
advice, but everybody's

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:36.590
got to do their own thing.

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:40.192
The Chairman of LinkedIn wrote
a book, which is very good,

00:42:40.192 --> 00:42:41.150
and it is very popular.

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:42.831
And it basically
just says, hang out

00:42:42.831 --> 00:42:44.330
with really smart
interesting people

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:46.670
and some good shit will happen.

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:48.650
And he has a lot
more money than me.

00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:49.670
So you pick.

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:53.120
Like, there are different
ways to execute it.

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.520
My humble advice
would have a plan

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:57.530
and consistently edit
that plan and iterate

00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:59.650
that plan as you learn more.

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:00.730
Yes.

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:05.327
AUDIENCE: So some of
this comes out to,

00:43:05.327 --> 00:43:07.660
and I think you were alluding
to it in the beginning is,

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:08.842
big fish, small pond.

00:43:08.842 --> 00:43:09.766
Small fish, big pond.

00:43:09.766 --> 00:43:15.065
And so what do you attribute
sort of general happiness to?

00:43:15.065 --> 00:43:18.010
Is there a preference
to you as far as either?

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:20.214
And then do you think
there's a correlation

00:43:20.214 --> 00:43:23.904
small-pond environment
allowing you to [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:23.904 --> 00:43:25.570
MIKE STEIB: Elliot
asked, what's better?

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:28.195
To be a big fish in a small pond
or a small fish in a big pond?

00:43:28.195 --> 00:43:35.020
And it is completely
dependent upon what you enjoy.

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:39.250
Big fish, small
pond is my job now.

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:44.110
My company has 800 employees.

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:46.930
I make a decision, and we do it.

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:49.030
I actually remember when
I first took the job,

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:49.810
I said to my CFO--

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:52.476
there was a company we wanted to
buy-- and I was like, OK like--

00:43:52.476 --> 00:43:56.080
I was like who do we
have to talk to now?

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.370
And she was like, nobody.

00:43:57.370 --> 00:44:00.236
You're the CEO, you just buy it.

00:44:00.236 --> 00:44:02.710
I said whoa.

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:05.170
I guess this is what
I signed up for.

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:07.030
At the same time in the job--

00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:09.027
a job I had had
previously, the only way

00:44:09.027 --> 00:44:11.110
to get anything thing done
was to build coalitions

00:44:11.110 --> 00:44:13.540
and get everybody on the same
page and manage stakeholders.

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:14.810
Some people are really
good at one of those.

00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:15.790
Some people are
good at the other.

00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:16.660
Some enjoy one.

00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:18.790
Some enjoy the other.

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:22.780
For me, that's essentially
what determines bigger company

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:26.550
versus smaller company.

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:29.140
I'd also comment that
it's a false choice.

00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:31.202
Because there are people--

00:44:31.202 --> 00:44:32.410
this is a big company, right?

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:34.618
But there's a small group
working on the Google Space

00:44:34.618 --> 00:44:36.350
Elevator or whatever
you guys are up to,

00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:38.470
that I'm sure it doesn't feel
like a big company over there,

00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.740
right?

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:40.739
There's probably like 10
engineers and a product

00:44:40.739 --> 00:44:43.610
guy and a marketer, just
trying to launch it into space.

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:49.510
So it's not only company, it's
team, and it's [INAUDIBLE],

00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:51.790
and it's how much that thing
is the same as everything

00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:53.998
else going on at the company
or how much it's unique.

00:44:53.998 --> 00:44:56.230
The more it's the same,
the more your skill set

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:57.795
has to be bureaucratic
in nature.

00:44:57.795 --> 00:44:59.920
And the more it's different,
the more your skillset

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.922
has to be getting things
done in nature, I'd say.

00:45:02.922 --> 00:45:04.080
Thank you, Elliot.

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:07.315
AUDIENCE: Can you talk more
about living below your means

00:45:07.315 --> 00:45:10.510
and how this plays into the
decisions you're talking about?

00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:12.991
You mentioned renting in Quogue
and now you own in Montauk.

00:45:12.991 --> 00:45:14.740
Can you explain a
little bit more,

00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:17.360
you now, like you live
frugally, like how

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:18.360
that impacts this stuff?

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.443
MIKE STEIB: The question
was, can you talk about--

00:45:20.443 --> 00:45:23.140
it's a good question-- living
below your means and how that

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:24.296
can create optional--

00:45:24.296 --> 00:45:25.670
I think that
creates optionality.

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:29.620
It gives you flexibility
in your career.

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:32.560
I have never
successfully done it.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:34.660
And there are people
who go on CNBC,

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:36.670
and they'll tell you
the way to become

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:39.520
a millionaire is you just
stop having a latte every day

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.279
at Starbucks.

00:45:40.279 --> 00:45:42.070
And then over time,
the interest compounds,

00:45:42.070 --> 00:45:44.380
and you'll be a millionaire.

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:46.750
I've met millionaires.

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:52.949
No one has ever said to me, I
just stopped drinking lattes,

00:45:52.949 --> 00:45:53.740
and now I'm loaded.

00:45:58.210 --> 00:45:59.320
It's good to be a saver.

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:00.778
It's good to live
below your means.

00:46:00.778 --> 00:46:03.820
People who do that are
better people than I am.

00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:07.250
What I have found instead
is that whatever you make,

00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:09.630
you spend.

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:11.950
And therefore, to
the earlier point,

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:14.920
I figure out what we really
need at this moment in time

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:16.216
in our family to be happy.

00:46:16.216 --> 00:46:17.590
And then how much
we need to save

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:19.230
for retirement and the kids'
school and all that stuff.

00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:21.940
You add it up, and that's the
amount of money I need to make.

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:24.400
And I'm painfully aware
that if we make any more,

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:26.774
we're just going to get an
extra bedroom on the apartment

00:46:26.774 --> 00:46:27.920
or something.

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:29.710
In my life, it's just
going to get spent.

00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:32.043
And I also know that that
extra bedroom in the apartment

00:46:32.043 --> 00:46:32.980
is not happiness.

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:36.220
Living the career and the
life with a purpose that is

00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:38.620
meaningful to me is happiness.

00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:40.594
And I have friends
who have successfully

00:46:40.594 --> 00:46:42.260
gone this way too--
they have just said,

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:43.510
look, we spend too much money.

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:44.440
It's not worth it.

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:47.980
Let's get down to
the basics of what we

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:49.370
need so that we can be happier.

00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:50.680
And that's fair too.

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:52.990
I don't know that I could
successfully pull that off

00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:54.959
either.

00:46:54.959 --> 00:46:56.500
It just feels to me
like the spending

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:58.750
becomes somewhat permanent.

00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:05.080
And so in a weird way, my advice
is know what that number is,

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:07.540
make it, disregard any
more that you make,

00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:09.790
and understand that if you
do make it and you save it,

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:10.956
you're really a good person.

00:47:10.956 --> 00:47:12.550
But if you spend it, I feel you.

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:13.216
I've been there.

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:21.246
I'll come right back to you.

00:47:21.246 --> 00:47:24.544
AUDIENCE: Can you talk a little
bit more about your roadmap

00:47:24.544 --> 00:47:28.280
as it related to decisions you
made after being at Google?

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:30.160
So [INAUDIBLE]
after leaving here?

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.951
MIKE STEIB: So my
roadmap and the decisions

00:47:31.951 --> 00:47:33.850
I made after leaving Google.

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:36.350
I had a terrific job and worked
with great people at Google.

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:38.720
My job over time became
more bureaucratic,

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.520
which wasn't for me.

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:42.662
And also there's
the point at which

00:47:42.662 --> 00:47:44.870
you might feel in your career
this sort of flattening

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:46.850
of either what you're
learning or just is

00:47:46.850 --> 00:47:49.730
sort of the trajectory
of your career

00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:51.950
and the current
path that you're on.

00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:54.830
And someone called me
with an opportunity

00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:57.590
to be the CEO of
basically something that

00:47:57.590 --> 00:47:59.922
was being built from scratch.

00:47:59.922 --> 00:48:04.060
And it checked a
bunch of boxes for me.

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:06.620
And it was the
absolute wrong one.

00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:09.490
It was a catastrophe.

00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:11.660
Catastrophe.

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:14.630
But in doing it, I got to,
really for the first time

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:16.680
in the wild, be a CEO.

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:18.120
And I absolutely loved it.

00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:20.750
And I learned a ton.

00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:21.600
And it went well.

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.120
Operationally, it was working.

00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:25.610
Our issue was sort of
investor-relations related.

00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:27.210
But operationally,
it was working,

00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:30.620
and I was like I think
I can do this job.

00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:32.360
And the next thing
that presented itself

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:34.340
was even better.

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:35.620
And it's where I am now.

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:36.470
So in a way--

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:38.180
this is as a personal
anecdote, and I

00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:42.620
don't know what it's
worth, but I made a mistake

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:44.090
when I made a change.

00:48:44.090 --> 00:48:47.620
But the bigger mistake would
have been not making a change.

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:49.370
Optimally, I would
have left for something

00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:51.650
that was a success and not
a catastrophe right out

00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:53.441
of the gate and saved
two years of my life.

00:48:53.441 --> 00:48:55.250
That would've been optimal.

00:48:55.250 --> 00:49:00.650
But the next best option
was just forward progress.

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:07.550
I can't emphasize how
important doing is to success.

00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:10.010
And it sounds so obvious.

00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:14.180
But I have a story about
a friend of some of ours.

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:16.622
Remember when Yahoo
bought Tumblr?

00:49:16.622 --> 00:49:17.330
I don't know why.

00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:20.240
He was possessed with the Idea
Like he started blogging about

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:22.130
that this was a bad deal.

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:23.150
I was like, who cares?

00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:25.220
But our friend really cared.

00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:27.440
So he was blogging and
blogging about that

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:29.210
this was a bad deal for Yahoo.

00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:30.960
And then he pinged
some people on Twitter.

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:32.210
He was like, what do you think
about all the things I've

00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:33.320
been writing about
what a bad deal this?

00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:35.180
And people tweeted
about it and so on.

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:36.846
And then Bloomberg
Television called him

00:49:36.846 --> 00:49:39.782
and asked if he'd come on as an
expert to talk about this deal.

00:49:39.782 --> 00:49:41.240
Everyone is looking
for someone who

00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:43.100
knows what they're talking about
and knows what they're doing.

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:44.090
And no one does.

00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:47.060
So if you just act like
you do, you eventually

00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:49.740
get the shit you're after.

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:54.272
So forward motion,
it's really important.

00:49:54.272 --> 00:49:54.980
And I don't know.

00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:56.063
For whatever that's worth.

00:49:56.063 --> 00:49:56.750
That's my life.

00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:58.416
I wouldn't do it if
I were someone else.

00:49:58.416 --> 00:49:59.440
Go ahead.

00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:02.380
AUDIENCE: So my question
was about if [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:06.300
and they think that's kind
of what you [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:08.260
to but sometimes-- and filter.

00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:09.778
Maybe you say I
don't want to work

00:50:09.778 --> 00:50:10.944
anywhere else than your are.

00:50:10.944 --> 00:50:12.360
But then a really
good opportunity

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:13.985
presents itself somewhere else.

00:50:13.985 --> 00:50:16.437
How do you think about
temporary sacrifices

00:50:16.437 --> 00:50:19.224
that you can make to make
stronger [INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:19.224 --> 00:50:20.890
MIKE STEIB: The
question was, how do you

00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:24.060
think about temporary sacrifices
in your design principles

00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:27.480
to move your career
ahead more quickly?

00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:30.330
It's really important to know
which of your design principles

00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:35.250
are constraints versus desires.

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:37.500
So for me, a
constraint is the time

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:40.922
I need to spend
with my children.

00:50:40.922 --> 00:50:43.380
There are jobs that for two
years I just won't to see them,

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:45.420
but it's only two
years, but they'll never

00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:46.590
be this age again.

00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:49.560
So for me, that one
I won't budge on.

00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:51.420
I won't budge on it at all.

00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:54.440
There's other stuff that--
most people are not as psycho

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:56.190
as I am about wanting
to live in New York.

00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:57.840
They'll take it, but they'd
also move to California

00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:58.470
for the right deal.

00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:00.261
So you just have to
know which ones for you

00:51:00.261 --> 00:51:03.749
are fixed constraints and
which ones are negotiable.

00:51:03.749 --> 00:51:05.790
And fixed constraints,
don't even think about it.

00:51:05.790 --> 00:51:09.505
Like you made a principle
decision with clear eyes,

00:51:09.505 --> 00:51:11.130
and then something
came along and tried

00:51:11.130 --> 00:51:12.720
to get you to think differently.

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:16.860
At one point in my career,
I just said, you know what?

00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:20.460
I'm not going to play golf.

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:21.060
I'm just not.

00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:22.650
Everyone keeps trying to
pressure me to play golf.

00:51:22.650 --> 00:51:24.480
Oh, business gets done
on the golf course.

00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:25.260
You have to play golf.

00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:26.220
We're going on a golf trip.

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:26.820
No.

00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:27.390
I hate golf.

00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:28.098
I'm not doing it.

00:51:28.098 --> 00:51:29.334
It's so liberating.

00:51:29.334 --> 00:51:30.000
It's liberating.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.010
Now, every time
someone's like, oh hey,

00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:32.170
we're putting this
thing together.

00:51:32.170 --> 00:51:32.711
There's golf.

00:51:32.711 --> 00:51:34.780
I'm like, psht, nope.

00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:37.440
I'm not doing it.

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:40.560
You've got to decide what those
fixed constraints are for you.

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:42.066
Other questions.

00:51:42.066 --> 00:51:44.058
AUDIENCE: I love that
this approach is really

00:51:44.058 --> 00:51:47.046
inward looking, but what
are some good questions

00:51:47.046 --> 00:51:51.445
to ask mentors and advisors to
get the best advice from them?

00:51:51.445 --> 00:51:53.070
MIKE STEIB: What are
the best questions

00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:54.879
to ask of mentors
and advisors to get

00:51:54.879 --> 00:51:55.920
the best advice for them?

00:51:59.299 --> 00:52:01.590
There's a book called "The
Finer Points of Leadership."

00:52:01.590 --> 00:52:03.660
That's good read, and
there's a concept in there

00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:04.849
called The Career Covenant.

00:52:04.849 --> 00:52:07.140
And The Career Covenant is
you agree with your manager,

00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:08.670
that I'm going to do
really good work for you

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:10.740
and help make you as
my manager successful.

00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:16.080
What I'd like from you is advice
and championing my career.

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:18.270
Would you be willing
to do that with me?

00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:21.090
Any manager worth their
salt will say yes.

00:52:21.090 --> 00:52:23.946
Then with a manager
like that, you've

00:52:23.946 --> 00:52:25.320
negotiated that
we're going to be

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:26.820
talking about my career
from time to time.

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:27.900
And just ask anything.

00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:29.010
I ask for feedback.

00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:30.930
A great way to
ask for feedback--

00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:34.870
everybody in this room, like
you go to the tech talks for--

00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:36.120
like you're probably winning.

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:37.620
You're probably
getting good scores.

00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:39.990
Your feedback is usually
you're doing a great job.

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:42.510
Say, if I was a
managing director,

00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:45.000
what would I have done
differently with this project?

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.460
Well, I mean, you're
not a managing director.

00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:48.840
I'm not asking you to make
me a managing director.

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.215
What's the difference between
me and a managing director?

00:52:51.215 --> 00:52:53.860
Well, you would have asked
somebody a million questions.

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:54.360
That's fair.

00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:55.110
That's helpful.

00:52:55.110 --> 00:52:56.220
Tell me what I could
have done to not

00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:58.386
ask so many annoying questions
and on and on and on.

00:52:58.386 --> 00:53:00.570
So I think forcing
feedback on yourself

00:53:00.570 --> 00:53:02.850
that is not just,
did I do a good job,

00:53:02.850 --> 00:53:05.631
make me feel good about the
job I just did but, OK, people

00:53:05.631 --> 00:53:06.630
are much better than me.

00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:08.670
What would they have
done different gets

00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:11.497
you the kind of feedback that
can really fuel your career?

00:53:11.497 --> 00:53:13.830
And then I think with people
who you don't know as well,

00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:18.420
people who are in other
jobs, other professions, when

00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:24.060
you meet people, just be so
vulnerable and willing for them

00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:27.060
to know that you don't know
what they're talking about

00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:28.960
and keep, keep, keep
asking them questions.

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:31.170
So you're at some
like-- my wife makes

00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:32.730
me go to these fancy
dinners, and you

00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:33.854
have to meet random people.

00:53:33.854 --> 00:53:34.920
This is terrible.

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.040
Days of my life.

00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:39.291
And so you're like, hey,
what do you do, Tom?

00:53:39.291 --> 00:53:41.040
And Tom's like, oh, I
work in debt capital

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:43.290
markets for Goldman Sachs.

00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:45.915
But everyone says, they're like,
oh cool, debt capital markets.

00:53:48.550 --> 00:53:51.570
How's debt capital
markets going this year?

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:54.180
I say, what's debt
capital markets?

00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:56.070
Which is, it's
embarrassing, right?

00:53:56.070 --> 00:53:57.010
How long have I
lived in New York?

00:53:57.010 --> 00:53:58.590
How could I not know what
debt capital markets is?

00:53:58.590 --> 00:53:59.160
Tell me.

00:53:59.160 --> 00:53:59.880
I don't work in finance.

00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:01.046
What's debt capital markets?

00:54:01.046 --> 00:54:04.490
Oh, we create liquidities for
investment-grade companies.

00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:06.960
What's liquidity?

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:08.790
For some reason, people
describe their jobs

00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:10.702
in a way that makes it
sound so complicated.

00:54:10.702 --> 00:54:12.660
And when you keep asking,
they finally give up.

00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:17.130
And they say, we
loan money to GE.

00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:19.850
What I say, I say,
oh, that's brilliant.

00:54:19.850 --> 00:54:21.100
I say GE makes a lot of money.

00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:22.600
Why would they need
to borrow money?

00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:24.420
He says, honestly,
these days it's just

00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:25.680
to buy back their stock.

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.810
It's financial engineering.

00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:32.610
And then I go how
does that work?

00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:34.061
And then they explain it to you.

00:54:34.061 --> 00:54:36.560
And I'm like, what do you have
to do to be good at that job?

00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:37.740
GE can borrow money from anyone.

00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:38.340
They have great credit.

00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:39.756
Why would they
borrow it from you?

00:54:39.756 --> 00:54:42.240
He says, oh, it's all sales.

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:43.805
Tell me how you win in sales?

00:54:43.805 --> 00:54:45.180
For me, it's a
relationship game.

00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:46.560
I take the guys
out, ba ba ba ba,

00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:47.640
and I know more
about the market.

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:49.223
How do you know more
about the market?

00:54:49.223 --> 00:54:51.392
It is like-- anybody else
have a five-year-old?

00:54:51.392 --> 00:54:52.350
I have a five-year-old.

00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:54.951
I am the five-year-old of
asking you about your career.

00:54:54.951 --> 00:54:55.450
Why?

00:54:55.450 --> 00:54:55.850
Why?

00:54:55.850 --> 00:54:56.760
Why did you do that?

00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:57.700
What does that mean?

00:54:57.700 --> 00:54:58.908
What's the opposite of apple?

00:54:58.908 --> 00:55:02.230
Da da da da, like
on and on and on.

00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:05.610
I just keep going until I really
know what this person does,

00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:07.560
and I can really engage
them in a discussion,

00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:10.500
I've taken something from
them or until they just

00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:12.667
like they surrender.

00:55:12.667 --> 00:55:14.750
And one way they surrender
is they go, what do you

00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:16.810
do, to try to make you stop.

00:55:16.810 --> 00:55:18.836
The other is they drink
their drink really fast,

00:55:18.836 --> 00:55:20.460
and they're like,
oh, my drink's empty.

00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:21.540
I have to go to the bar.

00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:22.860
That's all right.

00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:24.420
The people who stay
with you, these

00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:28.060
are people that you're
now familiar with.

00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:30.510
Next time you see them,
I'm not like, hey,

00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:33.320
Tom from debt markets.

00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:34.780
How are you?

00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:37.520
I'm like, Tom, I just
heard interest rates moved,

00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:39.270
and I remember what
you told me about what

00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:40.020
that means for liquidity.

00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:41.250
Are people still
buying back stock?

00:55:41.250 --> 00:55:42.040
And he's like, you're
not going to believe it.

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.770
Nobody's buying back
stock or it's 10% to gold.

00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:45.061
This year we're getting killed.

00:55:45.061 --> 00:55:46.874
Like I'm having a
conversation with Tom.

00:55:46.874 --> 00:55:49.290
So if you're talking to a
mentor or someone in an industry

00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:51.630
that you like, just
ask questions like--

00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:53.130
I don't know-- like
a five-year-old.

00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:54.921
There's got to be a
better way to say that,

00:55:54.921 --> 00:55:57.322
but ask questions
like a five-year-old.

00:55:57.322 --> 00:55:59.070
We've got a couple minutes left.

00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:01.897
Anyone else?

00:56:01.897 --> 00:56:03.438
AUDIENCE: How do
you manage your time

00:56:03.438 --> 00:56:07.366
when it comes to
[INAUDIBLE] aspect of career

00:56:07.366 --> 00:56:13.337
[INAUDIBLE] versus [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:13.337 --> 00:56:15.420
MIKE STEIB: The next
question was time management,

00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:16.710
but people have a meeting next.

00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:17.834
So I'll pause for a second.

00:56:17.834 --> 00:56:19.280
Anybody needs to go, go.

00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:21.530
And I'll stay and answer the
time management question,

00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:22.987
even if you don't stay.

00:56:22.987 --> 00:56:24.070
So we'll give it a minute.

00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:25.153
Thank you guys for coming.

00:56:25.153 --> 00:56:26.458
It was great to see you.

00:56:26.458 --> 00:56:31.072
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:31.072 --> 00:56:32.280
Next page is time management.

00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:33.760
How much time have you got?

00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:35.876
I'll give you like the
three-minute version.

00:56:35.876 --> 00:56:37.250
And then if you
want to ask more,

00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:39.541
but you guys are welcome to
leave as you want to leave.

00:56:39.541 --> 00:56:46.760
So you're working hard,
and you have obligations.

00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:47.447
You have family.

00:56:47.447 --> 00:56:49.280
Some of you are in an
adult kickball league,

00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:51.570
like there's just no time left.

00:56:51.570 --> 00:56:52.520
Right?

00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:55.801
So how do you also work a career
plan and meet with mentors

00:56:55.801 --> 00:56:57.800
and read books on accounting
and all that stuff?

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:03.610
So you have to be
hyper productive.

00:57:03.610 --> 00:57:07.070
And if you calculate
the number of hours

00:57:07.070 --> 00:57:09.410
that are already spoken
for in your life--

00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:12.564
you have sleep eight hours,
you have to sleep eight hours.

00:57:12.564 --> 00:57:14.480
Don't believe anyone
that tells you otherwise.

00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:15.606
You must sleep eight hours.

00:57:15.606 --> 00:57:17.063
You have to exercise
an hour a day.

00:57:17.063 --> 00:57:17.780
Have to.

00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:18.650
You really should.

00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:19.400
You have to bathe.

00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:21.020
You have to.

00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:22.070
Eat.

00:57:22.070 --> 00:57:24.320
And if you're ambitious,
you work 60 hours a week,

00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:26.270
which over seven
days averages out to,

00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:29.030
call it 8 hours, 8
and 1/2 hours a day.

00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:32.930
You add that all up, on an
average day, blending weekends

00:57:32.930 --> 00:57:36.110
and weekdays, you have five
hours of discretionary time

00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:37.070
every day.

00:57:37.070 --> 00:57:39.380
You have five hours to live.

00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:42.950
That's your time to
proactively decide

00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:45.320
how you are going to spend
it and what you're going

00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:47.720
to achieve with your life.

00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:50.180
The average American
spends five hours a day

00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:53.000
on social media and television.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.786
And then they all
say, I have no time.

00:57:56.786 --> 00:58:02.030
[CHIMES]

00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:04.470
And the bell tolls for you.

00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:07.850
If for five hours you
could be doing anything

00:58:07.850 --> 00:58:10.504
you want, anything you want.

00:58:10.504 --> 00:58:12.170
You could put more
hours into your work,

00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:14.540
so you don't work 60
hours, you work 70.

00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:17.510
There have been points in my
career where it's been 80.

00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:19.490
You decide when
that's appropriate.

00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:22.070
If you have kids, you
owe time to your kids.

00:58:22.070 --> 00:58:23.270
I love my children.

00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:24.950
Five hours every night's a lot.

00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:26.450
A lot.

00:58:26.450 --> 00:58:29.360
Two gets you there.

00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:31.610
You have time with friends,
you spend it proactively.

00:58:31.610 --> 00:58:33.776
You decide how you're going
invest those five hours.

00:58:33.776 --> 00:58:36.452
A portion of those five hours,
I invest in personal development

00:58:36.452 --> 00:58:37.160
almost every day.

00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:37.660
Right?

00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:38.240
Reading.

00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:39.720
There's a list of things
that I know I want to read,

00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:40.845
and I know I want to learn.

00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:45.320
Spending time with
people in the space

00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:47.130
who can give you
perspective, et cetera.

00:58:47.130 --> 00:58:49.100
A proactive investment
of that time.

00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:51.400
If you believe the
10,000-hour rule,

00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:53.990
with five hours every day,
in just a few years you,

00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:55.340
could also be a concert pianist.

00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:56.390
This is up to you.

00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:58.790
Five hours is a ton of time.

00:58:58.790 --> 00:59:01.600
But most of us don't
invest it proactively.

00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:02.600
It gets invested for us.

00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:03.222
We work.

00:59:03.222 --> 00:59:05.430
You get up, you're like,
shit, what am I doing today?

00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:05.602
All right.

00:59:05.602 --> 00:59:05.990
You scramble.

00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:07.460
You're like, I'm not going
to go to the gym now.

00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:08.251
I'll go after work.

00:59:08.251 --> 00:59:09.140
You work.

00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:11.110
Somebody bothers you,
and then it's 6:00

00:59:11.110 --> 00:59:12.920
and you've got to get home, and
then you didn't go to the gym.

00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:14.420
And you're home, and you
scramble with the kids,

00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:15.350
and then you're just beat.

00:59:15.350 --> 00:59:16.790
And you're like,
all right, I know

00:59:16.790 --> 00:59:20.377
I have some work to do but I'll
just like veg out for a minute.

00:59:20.377 --> 00:59:22.460
And next thing you know,
Netflix is saying to you,

00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:23.540
are you still there?

00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:25.340
Has that ever happened to you?

00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:26.940
Get a life.

00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:28.910
Of course I'm still here.

00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:31.010
I have found that
when I proactively

00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:34.520
say how I want to spend my time
and then put it in my calendar,

00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:36.130
that it works.

00:59:36.130 --> 00:59:38.994
And you calendar is this really
powerful operating system.

00:59:38.994 --> 00:59:40.910
You never miss a one-on-one
with your manager,

00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:43.490
because it's in your
calendar and you go.

00:59:43.490 --> 00:59:46.100
And yet, somehow we keep
not going to the gym.

00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:47.690
It's in my calendar.

00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:49.190
When I read is in my calendar.

00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:50.900
When I get in bed
is in my calendar.

00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:54.940
It's really weird.

00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:57.200
But it is really effective.

00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:59.990
There's this block
of time on Saturday

00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:03.517
that is my personal
time, not with my family,

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:04.600
and it's not work related.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:09.140
It's investment in things
I want to learn, explore,

01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:09.890
or contribute.

01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:10.670
It's my time.

01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:13.310
It's 5:00 AM to about 10:00 AM.

01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:14.359
That's mine.

01:00:14.359 --> 01:00:15.900
There's this block
of time where it's

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:18.560
going to be me with the kids,
and I will not check an email.

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:20.322
I cannot be bothered.

01:00:20.322 --> 01:00:21.530
I'm going to be with my kids.

01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:23.030
It's dedicated time.

01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:25.610
And it's so much more powerful
when you wake up on Saturday,

01:00:25.610 --> 01:00:27.910
and you're like all right,
what are we going to do?

01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:33.980
So the most impassioned advice
I could give you on this topic

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:38.090
is to proactively
schedule your five hours.

01:00:38.090 --> 01:00:41.840
I can also tell you, and
I said this in passing,

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:44.510
but when you sleep, you really
are much more productive.

01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:46.070
They did an experiment.

01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:49.560
People were asked to sleep six
hours a night for two weeks,

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:51.710
and they performed
cognitively and physically

01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:53.570
at the same level of
people who had pulled

01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:56.120
back-to-back all nighters.

01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:00.260
When you don't sleep,
you suck at everything.

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:02.000
And we're all
ambitious, and so we're

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.970
looking for an extra
hour and an extra hour.

01:01:03.970 --> 01:01:07.340
And you take it out of
sleep, and it's massively

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:11.375
destructive to your
ability to be productive.

01:01:11.375 --> 01:01:12.250
So the way to do it--

01:01:12.250 --> 01:01:13.410
I said before, like
I literally have

01:01:13.410 --> 01:01:14.910
an alarm that goes
off that tells me

01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:16.160
it's time to get in bed.

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:18.110
And I have to plug my
phone in, not by my bed,

01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:19.943
because if I bring my
phone to the bed, then

01:01:19.943 --> 01:01:22.580
I will lay in the bed with
the phone for another hour.

01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:24.530
The phone is actually
over by the door

01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:25.497
next to my gym clothes.

01:01:25.497 --> 01:01:27.830
And when the alarm goes off,
I get up, I get out of bed,

01:01:27.830 --> 01:01:29.360
I go, I grab the phone,
and I'm right there

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:30.193
with my gym clothes.

01:01:30.193 --> 01:01:32.030
So I know I have to
go to the gym now.

01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:36.020
You can create these
barriers or these guardrails

01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:39.242
in your life that force you to
proactively and intelligently

01:01:39.242 --> 01:01:40.700
invest your time
in the things that

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:44.720
maximize your productivity.

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:45.755
Other questions?

01:01:45.755 --> 01:01:47.930
AUDIENCE: What is [INAUDIBLE]?

01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:52.410
MIKE STEIB: Oh, so this was, if
we had enough time, essentially

01:01:52.410 --> 01:01:54.499
quickly, the way to
manage your to-dos is

01:01:54.499 --> 01:01:56.790
to figure out what's the goal
you're trying to achieve?

01:01:56.790 --> 01:01:58.620
How much impact can
this action item have?

01:01:58.620 --> 01:01:59.650
How fast can you do it?

01:01:59.650 --> 01:02:01.140
And by when is it due?

01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:03.750
And we have a tendency
to go to a meeting

01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:06.630
and some to-dos come up, and
they go to the top of the list.

01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:09.480
And my advice is, you will never
do everything on your list.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:15.911
So always assess every to-do and
only do the high-leverage ones

01:02:15.911 --> 01:02:17.910
that you can-- first the
ones you can do quickly

01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:20.160
that are due soon and then
the high-leverage ones that

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.120
take a long time.

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:23.604
And match them to the amount
of time that you have.

01:02:23.604 --> 01:02:25.770
So you know how you have
15 minutes between meetings

01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:27.740
so you come back to your
desk and you open an email,

01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:29.040
and it's like a 20-page
PowerPoint you're

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:29.804
supposed to read?

01:02:29.804 --> 01:02:31.470
And then you read
like four pages of it,

01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:33.210
but then the 15 minutes are up.

01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:34.890
So then you run to the meeting,
and then you come back,

01:02:34.890 --> 01:02:36.000
and you're like, OK,
let me go to my email.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.020
And you're like,
oh, this PowerPoint.

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:37.520
Where was I?

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.360
And you basically start over.

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:42.330
Not matching the important
task to the amount of time

01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:44.080
with which you can
use to get it done

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:46.730
is the way that most people
make themselves unproductive.

01:02:50.672 --> 01:02:52.130
It was really nice
to see you guys.

01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:53.571
This was a lot of fun.

01:02:53.571 --> 01:02:55.570
This is how to get in
touch with me if you want.

01:02:55.570 --> 01:02:56.590
I'm more than happy to help.

01:02:56.590 --> 01:02:57.590
It's great to see you.

01:02:57.590 --> 01:02:59.298
You're all friends or
friends of friends,

01:02:59.298 --> 01:03:04.340
and I'm at your disposal if
I can ever be useful to you.

01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:05.740
Thanks, you guys.

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:08.790
[APPLAUSE]
