Hello, I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
TodayIFoundOut YouTube channel.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.279
In the video today, we're looking at the origin
of the That's what she said and the equivalent

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:09.380
British phrase.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.570
"That's what she said" is thought to have
been around since the 1970s with the earliest

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.520
known documented case of it showing up on
Saturday Night Live, spoken by Chevy Chase

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.500
in a weekend update skit in 1975, which also
happened to be the first season of SNL.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.710
"That's what she said" was later hugely popularized
thanks to Wayne's World skits on Saturday

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.509
Night Live and later usage in the movie "Wayne's
World".

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.500
Accross the pond from Saturday Night Live's
studios, a much older equivalent double entendre

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.470
inspired phrase had been around for nearly
a century- "said the actress to the bishop".

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.070
This phrase is thought to have its origins
as far back as the Edwardian period (around

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.180
1901-1910), though it didn't appear in print
until "The Saint" novel "Meet the Tiger" was

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.370
published in 1928.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.010
"Said the actress to the bishop" is thought
to derive from the fact that, during early

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.900
English theater, actresses very commonly used
prostitution to supplement their stage income.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.040
In fact, their performances on stage often
worked very effectively as a form of advertisement

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.500
to men in the audience, who could generally
request an "audience" with a given actress

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.110
via so-called "orange-girls"- scantily clad
young teen girls who sold fruit to audience

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.110
members.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.610
Because of the so-called "loose morals" of
the actresses, clergymen spent a lot of time

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.610
with them...

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.740
...trying to get them to turn from their sinful
ways.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.680
Thus, it was a common occurrence for actresses
to confess their sexual sins to the bishops.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.380
Somewhere along the line (and nobody knows
exactly where or when), it became common to

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.620
say "as the actress said to the bishop" or
alternatively "said the actress to the bishop"

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.560
when someone uttered a phrase that could be
taken sexually, if viewed in the correct light.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.820
"Said the actress to the Bishop" became a
near extinct phrase by the 1970s, but saw

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.150
a huge resurgence in common usage relatively
recently due to Ricky Gervais, playing the

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.400
character David Brent in the British The Office,
frequently using this wellerism.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.950
In homage to Gervais, Steve Carrel adopted
the American equivalent of "that's what she

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.170
said" for his corresponding American The Office
character.
