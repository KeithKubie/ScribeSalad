00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.750
&gt;&gt;Dick: I'm Dick Soule. I work at YouTube
Global. It's my honor to introduce Eric Pooley.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:15.980
Eric is the deputy editor of Bloomberg Businessweek.
He is the former managing editor of Fortune

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.740
and Chief Political Correspondent for Time
magazine. Eric's work has been recognized

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:29.099
with many awards and honors, including a 2001
National Magazine Award, the 1996 Gerald R.

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.490
Ford Prize for Distinguished Reporting on
the Presidency and four Henry R. Luce awards

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.440
from Time. And being a humble man that Eric
is, I could read many more awards, but let's

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.801
just have Eric up here. Thank you.

00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:42.260
[applause]

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.660
&gt;&gt;Eric: Thanks Dick.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.070
&gt;&gt;Dick: You're welcome.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.899
&gt;&gt;Eric: Hi, thanks for coming out today. It's
great to be with you and I appreciate the

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:02.940
introduction, Dick. I walked in to Google
and I was asked if I'd been here before, and

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.730
we started talking about people that I knew
here, and then I turned around and saw an

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:13.560
old friend. So, that was nice. And as Dick
said, I'm Eric Pooley and I am the deputy

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.170
editor of Businessweek. That's not why I'm
here today. I'm here as the author of a new

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:27.340
book called "The Climate War." It's a book
about the struggle to get serious about climate

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:35.380
change in the United States at the federal
level. So, it's a tale of battling to pass

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:46.229
a mandatory declining cap on carbon emissions.
In the spring of 2007, I saw that the debate

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.690
was starting to shift from the science to
the politics; from whether climate change

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.280
is real, although some people still debate
that point, it's not really debatable, to

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.240
what we're gonna do about it. And I thought,
"Well, there's a book. How about a book about

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.850
the attempt to begin to get serious in this
country, which is, as you know, has lagged

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.570
the rest of the industrialized world in taking
the problem seriously and beginning to try

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:22.630
to address it through a declining cap on emissions."
Somewhat naively, I thought that if I tracked

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:30.980
this story from 2007 through to 2010, I might
be able to tell a story with a happy ending;

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:39.100
that I might be able to actually write a narrative,
because I wanted to write a political thriller

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:46.640
with the fate of the Earth hanging in the
balance and that by following the characters

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.460
at the heart of this debate, by embedding
with them, if you will, the way reporters

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.520
embedded with the soldiers in Iraq, but doing
it on all sides of the war that I would be

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.230
able to tell the story about how we turned
the corner and took just the first step to

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.710
start to get serious about reducing emissions.
But a funny thing happened on the way to the

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:18.010
signing ceremony. We didn't get serious about
it; we didn't pass a federal bill to reduce

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:25.990
our emissions and so the book became not just
a political thriller, but actually a murder

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:32.670
mystery. It became a who-done-it. It became
a book about all the forces that conspired

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:41.880
to kill climate action on the federal level.
And as I was working on it, I thought back

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.160
a lot of times to when I was a crime reporter
in New York in the 1980s. I worked at New

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.630
York Magazine and I wrote crime stories and
in those days, there was a homicide detective

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.420
named Marty Davin who was very famous for
showing up at the hospital after someone had

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.380
been shot on his turf and he would try to
intercept the victim, who would be laying

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.720
on a gurney out in the hallway, and Davin
would go up and lean over the guy and say,

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.220
"Who killed you?" And, which would tend to
get the attention of the victim if he was

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.700
indeed conscious and he would often protest,
"I'm not dead yet," and Davin would say, "Well,

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.680
you're gonna die so you might as well tell
me who did it." And as I was working the halls

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:33.710
of Congress, interviewing politicians and
lobbyists for environmental groups and all

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:43.950
those people who were trying to drive legislation,
I often thought of Davin. And I tried to resist,

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:50.860
for a long time, the idea of thinking about
this book as a murder mystery because climate

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.910
legislation missed a lot of near death experiences,
or survived a lot of near death experiences

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.680
in the years I was working on this book. And
I had a great deal of respect for the environmentalists

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:10.320
I was spending so much time with. And just
to lay it down, I spent time and established

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.260
embargoed reporting relationships with a whole
group of people from Al Gore and the Alliance

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:23.860
for Climate Protection to Fred Krup and the
Environmental Defense Fund to lobbyists like

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:31.060
the folks at the American Coalition for Clean
Coal Electricity, who are trying to keep the

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:37.630
world safe for coal-fired electric generation
and essentially stave off climate legislation

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:44.000
for as long as possible. A professional climate
denier named Myron Ebell from the Competitive

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:53.980
Enterprise Institute, Jim Hansen, the climatologist,
and a number of other people on various sides

00:05:53.980 --> 00:06:00.700
of the fight right down to the activists who
are chaining themselves to bulldozers to try

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:07.700
to prevent the construction of coal-fired
power plants. So, I basically was a ping-pong

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:17.110
for three years, bouncing among all these
groups as the story unfolded. And then finally,

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:24.110
this summer, after I'd finished work on the
book, I wanted to close it and have it come

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:29.690
out in the midst of what I hoped would be
the next debate and then write the final chapters

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:36.060
for the second edition of book, or the paperback
edition. But this summer, here we are in the

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:42.690
hottest summer in recorded history, or at
least so far it's shaping up to be that, in

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:51.389
the hottest year in recorded history, we've
just completed the hottest decade in reported

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:56.830
history, which beat the record set by the
previous decade, which beat the record set

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:05.370
by the decade before that. We're at a moment
where the Russian wheat harvest is being decimated

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:13.850
by drought and unprecedented heat, hundreds
of deaths being recorded in Moscow, wildfires,

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:18.460
and I thought back to somebody who said to
me a few years ago, he said, "Well, when Greenland

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.990
starts falling into the sea, we'll be ready
to get serious about climate change." Well,

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:29.020
on August 5th, a chunk of Greenland, four
times the size of Manhattan, calved off and

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:37.110
fell into the sea. Ed Markey, the Congressman,
said that's ample room for the professional

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:43.090
deniers to set up their own country and they're
now trying to figure out what to call it.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:51.639
But it is if folks need evidence that this
is going on, the evidence is all around us.

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:57.840
And yet, the United States Senate, just about
a week before that huge Greenland ice flow

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:04.380
separated from the mainland, announced that
it would not be debating comprehensive climate

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:13.570
legislation, that it would not be even debating
a measly 15% renewable energy standard, which

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:21.139
would require utilities to get that percentage
of their power from alternative means. And

00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:26.230
I, many of you saw in the paper today, in
the New York Times, a great story about renewable

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:33.310
electricity in Portugal, which in the last
five years have, has moved from 17% to 45%

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:41.230
of its electricity from renewable sources.
Just one example of what's possible, now obviously,

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:48.460
the scale in this country is completely different;
much harder for us to scale up as quickly

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:53.490
as Portugal is doing, but at the federal level,
we're not even trying. I'll talk about things

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:58.430
that are going on at the state and local level
a little later. But the fact is, across three

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:05.900
years of repeated attempts, the US Senate
has always been a complete obstacle to action

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:13.041
in this area. So, as I said, it was a who-done-it
that I ended up writing. It was a murder mystery

00:09:13.041 --> 00:09:19.310
and what I hadn't anticipated was that it
would end up being one a lot like Agatha Christie's

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:24.150
"Murder on the Orient Express" where there
are multiple culprits; everybody is in on

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:30.500
the killing. So, I thought that I would start
by talking a little bit about who some of

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:37.080
these culprits are and why it's been so hard
for us to achieve any kind of climate action

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.080
at the federal level.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:44.630
[pause]

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:51.640
The first group that you have to begin with
is the professional deniers. And let me just

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:57.350
say, I differentiate between regular folks
who are skeptical about climate change and

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:05.460
don't know what to believe and the paid professional
public relations executives whose job it has

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:11.020
been to spread doubt and confusion about climate
change for the last 15 or 20 years. And I

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:22.140
mentioned Myron Ebell, one of the people that
I look at in the course of the book. These

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:28.440
are folks that I don't claim to have George
W. Bush's ability to look into someone's eyes

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:34.730
and see down into their soul the way the President
famously said he could about Putin. So, I

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:39.520
don't know, and I'm often asked, "Do they
really believe it? Are they just mercenaries?"

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:47.110
Ultimately, I don't think it matters because
I've come to the conclusion in more than 25

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:54.540
years of journalism that motive is highly
overrated; that ultimately, it doesn't really

00:10:54.540 --> 00:11:01.200
matter why you're doing what you're doing.
If what you're doing is bad for the planet,

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:08.400
the country, the economy, the future of civilization,
the fact that I talked myself into believing

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:17.440
it doesn't really make that much of a difference.
So, I didn't take, make any grand attempt

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:25.350
to try to figure out if Myron Ebell and his
ilk believe what they were saying. And I don't

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:32.390
spend an enormous time in the book dealing
with science. I do, if you're not familiar

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:38.780
with climate science and you read The Climate
War, you will pick up an awful lot of carefully

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:43.831
fact-checked science about exactly what's
happening and why. But the thrust of the book

00:11:43.831 --> 00:11:51.560
is politics and economics, because what I
found with the professional deniers is they

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:56.510
were more than happy to fight this war on
multiple levels for people who are still capable

00:11:56.510 --> 00:12:01.020
of being convinced that the science is not
sound and we don't really know what's happening.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:06.860
They will fight it on that level. For other
people that are sure that the science is real

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:13.880
and as I'm sure, all or most of you know,
the overwhelming majority of climatologists

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:19.670
in this country has no doubt the basics of
climate science are fundamentally understood,

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:24.610
have been for a hundred years, are not in
dispute. Of course, there's always debate

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:32.300
in any realm of science. Debate never goes
away and I actually think that Al Gore and

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:36.430
the environmental community made a strategic
error when they announced that the debate

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:44.830
was settled and it was time to move on. Because,
by refusing to engage the deniers, they seeded

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:52.141
the messaging space to the professional deniers,
who filled it up with this information. And

00:12:52.141 --> 00:12:58.660
Gore and the Green Group, which is the loose
coalition of major environmental organizations

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:03.399
in this country, made a decision to stop arguing
about it and say, "Well now we have to move

00:13:03.399 --> 00:13:09.410
on." Well, even though they were right, I
think it was the wrong tactic because you

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:17.089
all know what happened. The deniers, along
with their enablers in my line of work, the

00:13:17.089 --> 00:13:26.190
journalists who are scared to come out and
say anything without hedging it, so they're

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:30.580
always looking for what climatologists say.
"This is happening, but I'm gonna get the

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.570
appearance of balance into my stories. So,
I'm gonna look for somebody who's saying 'Well,

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:41.600
maybe it's not really happening,' and here's
Myron Ebell, or others who share his profession,

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:47.480
stepping up and sowing down confusion on what
is actually established science." So, that's

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:52.970
what we call "balanced bias." That's elevating
two sides of an argument, even when there

00:13:52.970 --> 00:14:01.300
aren't two co-equal sides. And that happened
with the science for many years till slowly

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:07.630
the journalism community began to move on
from that false opposition. And then they

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:15.840
began to do it with the economics, which was
the second great front in the climate war.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:21.209
When the climate deniers saw that people were
no longer swayed by disinformation on the

00:14:21.209 --> 00:14:26.120
science, they began to fill the airwaves with
disinformation on economics and they claimed

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:34.640
that any action to stop climate change would
destroy the American economy. They hired economists,

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:41.470
usually from right-wing and libertarian think
tanks to produce doomsday studies that claimed

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:48.390
to prove that if we capped carbon emissions
it would kill millions of jobs and double

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:53.399
electricity rates. And then they would find
gullible journalists who would write stories

00:14:53.399 --> 00:14:58.030
about these without ever looking at the fine
print and seeing, "Well, what are the economic

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:02.190
assumptions that you're putting into these
models?" And economic assumptions, when you

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:12.529
looked at them, were completely bogus. Cite
one example that I cite in my book, a study

00:15:12.529 --> 00:15:21.440
sponsored by the National Association of Manufactures
and it's assumption for uptake of wind power

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:29.080
year after year between now and 2030 was that
we would use, we would take less wind new

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:35.740
generation capacity online in each year than
we did in 2007. So that in other words, the

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:41.930
transition to a clean energy economy had already
peaked. And when you start cooking the numbers

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:48.910
that way, it's not a surprise that you get
extremely high electricity rates as your output.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:52.850
So, that's what they did. When you look at
it, that's just one example, there are a lot

00:15:52.850 --> 00:16:04.240
of others, in the fine print of all of those
studies, but the reporters wouldn't actually

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:10.820
ever bother to look under the hood of these
studies. They would just present the doomsday

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:17.589
report and I got the feeling that if somebody
affiliated with the National Association of

00:16:17.589 --> 00:16:23.320
Manufacturers had stood up and said that in
2030, the sky will be yellow and the sun will

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:30.649
be blue, the headline the next day would read,
"Sun Will Be Blue Economist Warns" and they

00:16:30.649 --> 00:16:39.470
would just put it out there. So, the press
enabled the deniers as, and I call them the

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:45.170
"deny and delay community" because step one
was denying climate science and step two is

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:52.480
delaying climate action. It was less interesting
as I hung out with the professional deniers

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:59.981
to see their twisted take on the science then
it was to learn about their view of the politics

00:16:59.981 --> 00:17:08.459
because they laid out an entire playbook for
how they intended to kill climate action and

00:17:08.459 --> 00:17:17.029
let me tell you, it worked. I think I'll read
just a couple of paragraphs from an interview

00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:26.279
that I did with Myron Ebell of the Competitive
Enterprise Institute.

00:17:26.279 --> 00:17:27.279
Quote:

00:17:27.279 --> 00:17:32.190
"'Global warming is a problem that will be
easy to solve,' Ebell said. And now his little

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:37.190
smile was back because Ebell was in his comfort
zone again saying something counterintuitive

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:41.980
and outrageous." Quote "'We'll solve it in
50 years. We'll take carbon dioxide out of

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:48.960
the atmosphere and one one-hundred thousandths
of the cost of the solutions that Al is banding

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:55.070
about.' Ebell kept referring to Gore by his
first name. Al, as if they were colleagues

00:17:55.070 --> 00:18:00.539
who were working in an atmosphere of mutual
respect, when, in fact, CEI had spent years

00:18:00.539 --> 00:18:07.200
trying to trash and discredit Gore. It was
impossible to imagine Gore referring to Ebell

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:12.669
as Myron. Ebell's full-time job was to keep
alive the impression that the scientific debate

00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:18.450
was wide open, and yet here he was conceding
that climate change was a problem, though

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:24.049
an easily solved one, that levels of greenhouse
gas were rising and that this would eventually

00:18:24.049 --> 00:18:29.980
need to be addressed. It felt surprising,
but it shouldn't have. As those who tracked

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:35.409
him over the years had pointed out, Ebell
was always dependably opposed to climate action,

00:18:35.409 --> 00:18:40.720
but his stance on just what was happening
to the planet seemed to morph to fit the moment.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:46.330
A connoisseur might call today's formulation
'classic late period Ebell.' Spotting his

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:51.470
opponents, much of the scientific argument,
but still holding out against doing a damn

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:57.389
thing. 'I could concede a lot on the science,'
he said. I don't, but I could and I'd still

00:18:57.389 --> 00:19:02.299
think this was the wrong way to address the
problem. The public doesn't agree with me,

00:19:02.299 --> 00:19:08.320
though. They say if there is warming, then
we have a moral obligation to solve it. If

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:13.309
there's not, then we don't. As a result, he
explained those who opposed climate action

00:19:13.309 --> 00:19:18.980
needed to dig in on the scientific details
and concede nothing." Quote "'The science

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:23.850
is still the battleground. The battle is still
over whether this is really happening and

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:29.259
whether we are really causing it.' It was
a war and Ebell could see Gore's troops massing

00:19:29.259 --> 00:19:35.730
on the far ridge." Quote "'We want to drive
a wedge between bi-coastal, elite opinion

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:40.360
and heartland opinion,' he said. 'We have
to protect our base from a hundred million

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:46.010
dollars a year in Al Gore's advertising. I
don't think we can ever win over your typical

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:52.289
New Yorker or San Franciscan, but we don't
need to. This battle is for the heartland.

00:19:52.289 --> 00:19:56.570
If we protect our base, we win.'"

00:19:56.570 --> 00:20:02.940
So, the goal for the deniers was to protect
their base by scaring the pants off people

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:11.229
with these doomsday arguments; arguing that
so-called cap and tax, a national energy tax,

00:20:11.229 --> 00:20:17.080
would destroy their household budgets and
destroy the economy and throw the mellow out

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:25.669
of work. And the reality is that the cap that
was being debated in the United States Senate

00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:34.779
would have imposed costs of roughly 70 to
140 dollars a year per household by 2030.

00:20:34.779 --> 00:20:39.950
For low income households, it was a net plus.
There were rebates that would actually make

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:44.539
sure that low income Americans came out ahead.
So, the idea that this was gonna be an onerous

00:20:44.539 --> 00:20:51.749
burden was simply not true, but that didn't
stop the opponents of climate action from

00:20:51.749 --> 00:20:56.249
putting out their false reports and it didn't
solve the Senate Republicans from picking

00:20:56.249 --> 00:21:04.120
up that rallying cry. And they were the second
group responsible for killing the climate

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:09.129
bill, where the Senate Republicans who opposed
climate action to a man. There wasn't a single

00:21:09.129 --> 00:21:15.400
senator and a woman, a single man or woman
in the United States Republican Caucus this

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:25.059
year who was willing to come forward in support
of climate action. We look back now on 2008,

00:21:25.059 --> 00:21:34.239
2007, even 2005 as the good old days of bi-partisanship
on this issue. When you had John McCain as

00:21:34.239 --> 00:21:41.239
the leading proponent of climate action in
the US Senate, more recently with a conservative

00:21:41.239 --> 00:21:47.009
primary challenge, McCain stopped talking
about it and then did a flip-flop and called

00:21:47.009 --> 00:21:52.720
the senate bill based on the bill that McCain
himself had co-sponsored years ago, a farce

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:59.299
and said he wouldn't support it. His mantle
of republican climate courage was adopted

00:21:59.299 --> 00:22:05.220
by Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican
who tried to hammer out a climate bill for

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:11.909
about ten months between 2009 and 2010 and
then jumped ship the weekend before they were

00:22:11.909 --> 00:22:17.659
set to unveil the bill. He did this for a
couple of reasons. He was getting completely

00:22:17.659 --> 00:22:22.900
hammered by his own party and he had come
to the conclusion that the Senate Democrats

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:29.899
weren't serious about trying to move a bill
this year. What led him to that? Well, the

00:22:29.899 --> 00:22:36.840
fact was they weren't serious. The Senate
Majority Leader, Harry Reid, decided that

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:41.679
he was gonna try to curry favor with Latino
voters by pretending that he was gonna move

00:22:41.679 --> 00:22:47.799
an immigration bill instead of a climate bill.
When he signaled that, even thought there

00:22:47.799 --> 00:22:53.429
was no immigration bill written, and there
was a climate bill waiting to move, that was

00:22:53.429 --> 00:22:58.240
a pretty good indication that the Senate was
just playing politics and wasn't ever really

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:03.299
gonna try to pass a bill. Now, it was in the
interest of all the Democrats to go through

00:23:03.299 --> 00:23:09.779
the motions. Now some of them wanted to do
it but the will of the Senate was not there.

00:23:09.779 --> 00:23:13.450
And the only guy getting hammered over this
was Lindsey Graham, so he said, "Why should

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:19.809
I stick my head up out of the fox hole here
and take friendly fire from my own party if

00:23:19.809 --> 00:23:25.980
the Democrats aren't really gonna try to do
this?" So he jumped ship. So, after you've

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:30.510
got the Senate Republicans as being culprits,
you've gotta add the Senate Democrats to the

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:39.809
list of people who are in on this murder because
the truth is Harry Reid never had the juice

00:23:39.809 --> 00:23:45.669
to try to lead his committee chairmen to actually
move a bill. And the committee chairmen, with

00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:53.429
the exception of Barbara Boxer and John Kerry,
were not serious about trying to do it. I

00:23:53.429 --> 00:23:58.450
mentioned that every Republican in the Senate
was opposed to climate action. There were

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:04.570
a few, like Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins,
who probably would have come on board had

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:10.440
there been an actual bill. And the Democrats,
after everything crashed and burned were quick

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:17.369
to blame the Republicans as being the guilty
party, ignoring the dozen or so Midwestern

00:24:17.369 --> 00:24:24.480
Democrats who were also opposed to climate
action. These were not all from the Midwest,

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:30.210
but largely from the Midwest, from coal-burning
states; from states that either mine and produce

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:36.389
coal or states that depend on coal for their
electric fired electricity, excuse me, their

00:24:36.389 --> 00:24:44.440
coal-fired electricity. So, there are 25 states
in the US that get 25%--I'm sorry, 50% or

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:50.249
more of their electricity from coal. And it's
hard to tell whether those Democratic Senators

00:24:50.249 --> 00:24:55.690
are really worried about the effect on the
economy of a climate bill, which they say

00:24:55.690 --> 00:25:01.849
they worried about, or whether they're just
worried about the effect on their re-elections

00:25:01.849 --> 00:25:07.039
if they support climate action. Because, as
I said, all of the best studies show that

00:25:07.039 --> 00:25:12.739
the economic effect of climate action, especially
the very modest, early step that's being debated

00:25:12.739 --> 00:25:20.269
in the Senate, would be minimal. What wouldn't
be minimal was the force of the attack on

00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:26.389
the politicians if they supported this. And
so, these people were scared; I believe more

00:25:26.389 --> 00:25:37.419
of the politics than they were of the economics.
And they realized, I think, how difficult

00:25:37.419 --> 00:25:42.710
this was gonna be in the summer of 2008, when
the Lieberman-Warner bill crashed and burned

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:50.190
in the United States Senate. They realized
that again, in the summer of 2009, at the

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:57.159
moment of the greatest success for the climate
movement, when the Waxman-Markey bill passed

00:25:57.159 --> 00:26:02.279
the House of Representatives by a very narrow
margin, but it did pass. The first time that

00:26:02.279 --> 00:26:07.479
either house of Congress had ever passed a
major landmark piece of climate legislation.

00:26:07.479 --> 00:26:13.950
And what happened after that scared the pants
off the US Senate because as soon as that

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:20.099
bill passed and the environmental groups that
had been pushing it and the Coalition of Environmental

00:26:20.099 --> 00:26:26.299
and Fortune 500 groups called USCAP that had
helped write the bill, and had been instrumental

00:26:26.299 --> 00:26:32.440
in pushing it through; a signature moment
of compromise between environmental America

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:38.619
and corporate America coming together to try
to get something done. They got it passed,

00:26:38.619 --> 00:26:43.070
they all took a breather and it was a big
mistake because that was the moment when the

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:48.679
opposition to climate action unleashed the
full fury of its opposition. That was the

00:26:48.679 --> 00:26:56.019
rise of the Tea Party Movement; started on
the 4th of July, 2009. Obviously there had

00:26:56.019 --> 00:27:01.039
been some Tea Party demonstrations around
tax day in the spring, but if you recall,

00:27:01.039 --> 00:27:08.849
the 4th of July demonstrations, just a little
over a year ago now, unspooled an enormous

00:27:08.849 --> 00:27:14.619
amount of fury at all of the politicians,
especially the eight Republicans who had voted

00:27:14.619 --> 00:27:21.729
in favor of that bill and swing state Democrats.
There were expensive advertising that came

00:27:21.729 --> 00:27:29.639
on the air immediately targeting those courageous
politicians. There was the full rage and fury

00:27:29.639 --> 00:27:36.879
of Rush Limbaugh and Glen Beck and every other
right-wing commentator on the airwaves and

00:27:36.879 --> 00:27:42.729
it essentially caught the climate action community
flatfooted. It terrified the US Senate and

00:27:42.729 --> 00:27:51.950
it even led the political strategists inside
the West Wing of the White House to think

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:56.670
that maybe this was gonna be too hard to do.
So, there was a climate bill, it had passed

00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:02.749
the house, it was ready to steam on toward
the Senate with some important modifications

00:28:02.749 --> 00:28:08.529
to be made to get it to 60 and the White House
and the Senate decided not even to try to

00:28:08.529 --> 00:28:16.450
move that bill. The White House was pushing
what was described to me by multiple Obama

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:23.909
advisors as a quote "stealth strategy" toward
moving climate policy that would deploy the

00:28:23.909 --> 00:28:30.809
President only sparingly. It would deploy
him, usually on a weekday afternoon on a visit

00:28:30.809 --> 00:28:37.149
to a solar factory or wind turbine factory,
where he would say all the right things about

00:28:37.149 --> 00:28:42.289
the need to accelerate the transition to clean
energy. He would talk about the need to cap

00:28:42.289 --> 00:28:49.600
carbon, he would say all the right things
when the country wasn't listening, but for

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:55.989
the first 18 months of his administration,
he did not make a single prime time address

00:28:55.989 --> 00:29:03.809
calling for this. There was one shining moment
in the first address to the joint session

00:29:03.809 --> 00:29:09.599
of Congress, what we usually call the State
of the Union, but in the first year of the

00:29:09.599 --> 00:29:14.290
president, president's term, it's not a State
of the Union address, it's just called the

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:19.269
Joint Address. So, that was a moment when
he said he'd wanted Congress to send him a

00:29:19.269 --> 00:29:27.429
bill that capped carbon. He never devoted
an entire speech to the issue until after

00:29:27.429 --> 00:29:33.729
the BP spill that forced his hand and Obama
wanted to change the subject from the oil

00:29:33.729 --> 00:29:39.769
spill to climate and energy. I mean, he wanted
to change it to anything he could and the

00:29:39.769 --> 00:29:45.379
logical place to go was the need to get off
oil. So, he began talking about it a little

00:29:45.379 --> 00:29:52.109
bit in June and July, and he scheduled an
Oval Office address, maybe some of you saw

00:29:52.109 --> 00:29:57.820
it, where he sat down and he explained what
the country was doing to cope with the oil

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:05.629
spill and he explained that this was yet another
reason to get off fossil fuels. And then instead

00:30:05.629 --> 00:30:10.549
of saying, "And we know how to do it. We need
to put a cap on carbon emissions. We need

00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:21.700
to price carbon so that clean energy becomes
economically competitive and profitable."

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:27.309
The President said, "We don't know how we're
gonna get there." He didn't use the word cap.

00:30:27.309 --> 00:30:32.659
He didn't come out in favor of a specific
piece of legislation and hearts sank throughout

00:30:32.659 --> 00:30:37.690
the climate and clean energy community that
night because it became clear that the President

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:44.309
was not going to be driving a particular piece
of legislation, even though what was being

00:30:44.309 --> 00:30:50.690
called the worst environmental disaster in
American history gave him a perfect opportunity

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:58.129
to do that. He felt that it was gonna be too
hard. He felt that he had already asked the

00:30:58.129 --> 00:31:03.409
United States Senate to do enough; tap into
their political capital with difficult votes

00:31:03.409 --> 00:31:10.999
for the stimulus bill and healthcare reform
bill and the bailouts of the auto industry,

00:31:10.999 --> 00:31:17.469
etc. So, he wasn't willing to try again and
so, when the President would have members

00:31:17.469 --> 00:31:24.350
of the White House to talk about climate and
energy legislation, they would leave, he would

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:31.249
not make a comment, they would step up the
microphones and say they had had a wonderful

00:31:31.249 --> 00:31:38.789
exchange of views and nothing specific would
come out. So, the final culprit is the President

00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:43.379
of the United States. And I didn't really
expect when I began a book called "The Climate

00:31:43.379 --> 00:31:47.989
War," that one of those wars would be unfolding
inside the West Wing of the White House, but

00:31:47.989 --> 00:31:52.039
that's what I discovered. There were people
in the White House, notably Rahm Emmanuel,

00:31:52.039 --> 00:31:57.450
the Chief of Staff and David Axelrod, the
Chief Strategist, who felt that the public

00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:03.440
was not in a place where they were ready for
the President to make this a signature agenda

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:09.210
item. He could talk about it, he could play
to his base, he could do the Tuesday at the

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:16.200
Vestas Wind Turbine Facility, but in prime
time when it counted, and certainly when he

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:22.339
was campaigning, heading into a mid-term election
was not the time to do it. So, in retrospect,

00:32:22.339 --> 00:32:28.839
2009 was our window of opportunity. This is
no surprise. In my book I describe Al Gore

00:32:28.839 --> 00:32:34.409
sending a memo President Obama in the first
days of the Obama Administration laying out

00:32:34.409 --> 00:32:41.200
exactly why it was important for the President
to get behind a mandatory declining cap. In

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:50.429
2009, why the, why it had to be the first
big agenda item after he finished the economy,

00:32:50.429 --> 00:32:56.070
not kicked down the road, mainly because the
countries of the world were meeting in December

00:32:56.070 --> 00:33:04.010
of 2009 in Copenhagen, to hammer out a successor
to the Kyoto Treaty and if the United States

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:12.820
came up empty handed, showed up in Copenhagen
empty handed without a bill to reduce emissions,

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:17.789
the global deal was gonna crash and burn.
That's what Gore warned Obama about and that's

00:33:17.789 --> 00:33:25.889
precisely what happened in December of 2009.
So, where are we now? We haven't done the

00:33:25.889 --> 00:33:31.190
hard work. We're about to experience a mid-term
election where votes for climate action will

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:41.889
probably go away. Could it have been any different
and what we can we do over the next few years?

00:33:41.889 --> 00:33:50.179
I think in 2009, if Obama had surveyed the
landscape after the Waxman-Markey bill passed,

00:33:50.179 --> 00:33:55.539
but then ran into that buzz saw of opposition.
And he had said at that time, an economy wide

00:33:55.539 --> 00:34:02.419
cap is gonna be too hard. We've gotta lead
a tactical retreat to just a cap on the utility

00:34:02.419 --> 00:34:07.389
sector, which makes up 40% of the emissions
in this country." It's a great place to begin.

00:34:07.389 --> 00:34:13.500
We've already got a cap on sulfur dioxide--the
pollution that causes acid rain-- it was passed.

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:21.530
And the Clear Act Amendments of 1990, it went
into effect in 1995, it has reduced that pollution

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:28.010
ahead of schedule and below cost. It's been
a huge win. The utility sector knows how to

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:34.130
regulate its smokestacks. EPA knows what to
do. Let's start there and let's take the next

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:38.410
year to get it done. Let's get everybody around
the table and figure out how to do this. I

00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:45.149
think we'd be celebrating a victory; a first
small step now instead of yet another defeat.

00:34:45.149 --> 00:34:49.050
The climate action community, the Green Group,
was not willing to take that stand because

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:54.200
they were so invested in a mandatory economy-wide
cap, they weren't willing to retreat. It would

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:59.330
have required presidential leadership to get
that done. And the President didn't stake

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:06.380
that claim, he did not lead on that, he did
not lay out a vision for something that was

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:13.151
achievable given the difficult economic and
political situation of 2009 and 10, and as

00:35:13.151 --> 00:35:19.720
a result, we didn't get it done; anything
at all. In the last few weeks, before the

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:25.790
Senate pulled the plug on the bill, they tried
to beat a retreat to that utility-only place,

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:29.410
but it was too late, it was too complicated,
they couldn't get it done in the short period

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:37.930
of time that they had at hand. It may be the
place to begin when we start with a new Senate

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:42.920
after the elections. It may be possible to
just start there, but in fact, my hunch is

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:48.920
gonna be that we're not gonna be able to even
address that for a couple of years. I think

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:53.730
we're going into a period now and I hate to
say it and I have avoided making apocalyptic

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:59.140
predictions, but right now it looks like this
is where we are. If we're gonna be losing

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:04.830
votes and we weren't even close to 60 for
an economy-wide cap, I think it's gonna be

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:12.770
tough to get to 60 for the next year or two
and I think we need to change the math a little

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:18.220
bit, we need to change the politics a little
bit, we need to put some points on the boards.

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:24.620
We need to, in other words, reduce emissions
without having a mandatory cap for awhile

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:30.860
and then come back to the idea. In Copenhagen,
when it was crashing and burning, I sat with

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:38.900
Al Gore and I asked him, "What happens if
we can't pass this bill in 2010?" And he said,

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:45.520
"Well, if the Senate refuses to act or the
climate bill fails or is watered down beyond

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:52.960
recognition," he said, "that's an event horizon
beyond which it's almost impossible to see."

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:58.180
He said, "It may mean there's a fundamental
flaw in the architecture of the political

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:05.030
solution. But the problem," he said, "is that
we don't have a plan B. When it comes to reducing

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:08.980
emissions, there's really not a lot of alternative
to reducing emissions. That's what you need

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:14.660
to do." So, there's the cap, there's the idea
of a tax. The politics of a carbon tax are

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:21.630
just as fraught as the politics of a carbon
cap. So, what we need to do is shut-up the

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:27.090
Chicken Littles, who say that we can't reduce
emissions, by reducing them for a while. And

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:32.280
we have a lot to build on. Emissions had been
declining in this country and not just because

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:40.980
of the recession. In the great state of Texas,
a governor named George W. Bush, passed a

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:47.630
mandatory renewable energy standard, a renewable
electricity standard in, I believe the year

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:54.400
was 2009 that it took effect. It's now been
taking effect, it's now been in effect for

00:37:54.400 --> 00:38:01.420
a decade and it has helped give birth to the
Texas wind industry, which has created something

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:10.280
like ten thousand jobs. It has created ten
gigawatts of wind-powered electric generation

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:14.770
and it has helped reduce emissions in the
great state of Texas. They have not done this

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:21.070
because they're worried about climate change.
They've done this because energy is what Texas

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:31.280
does and they see a market and they see a
opportunity to make money. But they've reduced

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:36.930
emissions anyway. So, again, remember I said
motive is overrated? Any reason that anyone

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:41.920
has for getting into the game and reducing
emissions, I'm all for. That's why it's such

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:49.751
a tragedy that the Senate wouldn't put a renewable
energy standard into its energy bill. Of course,

00:38:49.751 --> 00:38:54.070
now it's pulled the plug on the bill itself.
It says they're gonna come back to it in the

00:38:54.070 --> 00:39:03.940
fall, but they fail to see that what we need
in this country is a market. What we need

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:11.620
to do is level the playing field for clean
electric generation so it can compete against

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:18.460
dirty electric generation. It's not a difficult
concept to understand. There are a lot of

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:24.700
different ways to do it and we may be able
to experiment with some other ways before

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:33.620
we get back to a cap at the federal level.
That's why it's so important now that the

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:38.750
western front in the climate war is unfolding
now in California with an attempt to roll

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:45.560
back a bill called AB 32, which made California
the first state in the country, excuse me,

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:52.600
yeah, the first state in the United States
to put a mandatory declining cap on statewide

00:39:52.600 --> 00:40:01.330
emissions. People wanna roll that back now.
There's a ballot initiative that's being bankrolled

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:09.430
by two Texas oil companies and that is a huge
battle. The second battle is gonna unfold

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:15.500
in the United States Senate when senators
try to strip the EPA of its authority to regulate

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:21.980
greenhouse gases. Remember back, I said in
2007, I thought the politics were shifting,

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:25.950
that the debate was shifting from science
to economics? One of the things that led me

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:31.320
to believe that was the Supreme Court decision.
The Supreme Court of the United States held

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:37.040
that the EPA had the duty to decide whether
carbon emissions posed a threat to public

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:43.820
health and that if it did, then it had the
obligation to regulate. EPA has since made

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:49.840
that determination and is scheduled to roll
out regulation beginning in January of next

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:58.090
year. The Senate is gonna try to strip EPA
of that power. And depending on what happens

00:40:58.090 --> 00:41:03.810
to the balance of power in the Senate, it
could be a very close vote. That's incredibly

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:07.590
important because the Senate has made it clear
that it isn't gonna act on this issue anytime

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:13.430
soon. So, what the Senate is saying is, "We
wanna reserve the right to do nothing on this

00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:18.490
issue. We want the perogatives of power to
be reserved for the United States Senate so

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:23.830
that we cannot act." Ok, we wanna prevent
the United States from doing this. Now this

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:29.360
is an area where I know that President Obama
is gonna be throwing his considerable might

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:39.470
into turning back at any attempt to roll back
EPA. And I hope very much that the attempt

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:44.670
to strip EPA of those powers, or delay their
implementation, will be defeated just as two

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:55.050
previous attempts this year have already been
turned back. However, EPA regulation is what

00:41:55.050 --> 00:42:01.730
John Dingell, the veteran Congressman from
Michigan, once described as "the glorious

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:08.700
mess." It is gonna be a glorious mess of regulation,
which is going to lead to litigation. Why

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:13.760
is that? Because the only way the EPA can
regulate is to do so on a source by source

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:19.330
basis, power plant by power plant, factory
by factory. So, there's gonna be lawsuits

00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:27.100
around every stationary source of emissions.
In other words, we are moving from a moment

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:31.590
of attempted legislative compromise between
the environmental community, the regulatory

00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:39.450
community and the corporate world into a period
of renewed battling between those entities.

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:43.290
Environmental organizations that had been
putting their money in their manpower into

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:48.100
finding a compromise in Congress are now pulling
back and they're putting their manpower into

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:56.640
the courts. They're going back to suing the
bastards to shut down the dirtiest power plants.

00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:02.070
There are 153 coal-fired power plants east
of the Mississippi that were built in the

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:08.320
50s and 60s that are terrible sources of pollution
and extremely inefficient and they should

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:15.920
be shut down tomorrow. And the EPA will be
rolling out its draft regulations in September

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:23.590
for implementation beginning in January and
it is devoutly to be wished that some of these

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:28.520
most polluting plants are not gonna be able
to meet EPA standards and will have to be

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:35.330
shut down finally. The whole search for a
compromise in the Congress and the whole reason

00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:45.710
for a cap was to reduce rate shocks and regulatory
costs on industry, on the utility industry

00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:50.140
and the manufacturing industry so that they
could find ways to smooth out their costs

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:57.400
by trading carbon permits between various
emitting entities. It was a compromise that,

00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:03.120
as I mentioned earlier, was very successful
when it was used for sulfur dioxide. It was

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:11.390
a compromise championed by Republican President
George H. W. Bush, and then it was demonized

00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:17.980
by the current Republican Party and turned
into a crazy left-wing scheme and Enron Rube

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:28.840
Goldberg contraption, a way to put the investment
bankers in charge of climate action. You saw

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:34.970
what the attacks leveled on, what were actually,
what was actually a centrist approach, was

00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:48.210
vilified as being a kooky left-wing, Al Gore,
eco-hoax to seize control of the energy economy.

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:55.960
And as a result of the success of those attacks,
they're now right back to EPA command and

00:44:55.960 --> 00:45:02.440
control regulation of the kind that they wanted
to avoid in the first place. So, it's gonna

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:09.280
be ugly for a couple years, folks. And my
hope is that a couple of years of bitter battling

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:18.680
in the courts between the environmental groups,
the corporations, and the EPA will make everyone

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:23.220
wake up and smell the coffee that there's
a better way forward here. And maybe those

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:32.750
groups will then go back into the legislative
arena and that the Republican Party and the

00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:37.440
conservative wing of the Democratic Party
will agree that it's time to actually get

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:42.790
serious. And maybe when that happens, I'll
be able to write a happy ending to my book,

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:49.680
The Climate War. So, with that, I'd like to
open the floor to questions.

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:50.760
[applause]

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:57.850
&gt;&gt;Male member #1: Just started reading your
book on the iPad; kudos to your publisher

00:45:57.850 --> 00:46:04.850
for getting it there. Your writing style is
quite engaging and informative.

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:05.850
&gt;&gt;Eric: Thank you.

00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:10.830
&gt;&gt;member #1: I guess you've been doing it
a long time, so, but you seem to be preaching

00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:17.930
to the converted. So, I wonder how you picked
a side and what you would say to someone who

00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:24.650
view you, who views you the way you view those
you call deniers, as somebody who might be

00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:28.550
sincere, but is profoundly mistaken on the
science?

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:37.300
&gt;&gt;Eric: Fair question. The, as I say, I don't,
I reserve the term deniers for the paid professionals

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:42.670
whose job it is to sow doubt and confusion
about climate change. I use the word skeptics

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:47.320
for everyday folks who are skeptical about
whether it's happening and I hope that my

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:55.250
book. I'm delighted that you find my writing
style engaging, my mother does too and I hope

00:46:55.250 --> 00:47:01.810
that it's engaging to people who are confused
or in doubt about what's going on. But as

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:07.500
I set out to write the book, I decided that
I couldn't pretend that there were two equal

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:11.860
sides here. I couldn't write a book that said,
"Well, some people say this is happening and

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:17.760
some people say it's not." I felt that that
would be intellectually dishonest. It's not

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:26.380
what I believe. I have been looking very,
very closely at the evidence, the scientific

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:31.020
evidence for climate change and I find the
evidence overwhelming. I find it extremely

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:36.610
compelling and I think that people who take
a fair look at what's happening, and the weight

00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:42.840
of evidence that's described in my book and
many others, will be lead to that same conclusion.

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:46.950
That said, there are people, roughly a quarter
to a third of the country according to the

00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:56.940
polls, who aren't sure it's happening or don't
think it's happening. And I am, I'm not here

00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:03.670
to call you a denier or to question your motives.
I think there are people of, as I say in the

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:10.600
book, and maybe you haven't gotten to this
part yet, people of goodwill who don't think

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:16.671
this is happening. That said, there are plenty
of books out there that explain what's happening

00:48:16.671 --> 00:48:21.740
and why. And I didn't feel that what I brought
to the party would necessarily be another

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:27.350
book about climate science. There are some
great ones. A good one by a climatologist

00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:33.550
named Heidi Cullen, called "The Weather of
the Future," just came out last week. Jim

00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:38.930
Hansen's "Storms of my Grandchildren" is another
one; there are a lot of terrific books. So,

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:42.190
I didn't feel that what I wanted to do was
write another book about climate science.

00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:47.800
I'm a political reporter and a business editor
and I wanted to write about the intersection

00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:55.320
of politics and economics and write about
the argument over getting this done. So, so

00:48:55.320 --> 00:49:00.420
my book I guess, is for people that think
it's real and wonder why it's so hard to take

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:06.640
action because there are valid economic arguments
that need to be addressed. In my view, the

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:12.110
climate policy has moved a lot further than
the climate politics and the policies have

00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:16.180
actually figured out how to cushion Americans
from rising electricity rates, for example,

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:21.160
how to cushion carbon intensive industries
from competition with non-carbon constrained

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:27.560
economies. So, I think we know what to do;
we just lack the political will to do it.

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:34.350
If you are a climate skeptic and you're feeling
left out of my book, I would say you might

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:43.780
stick with it and it might bring you around,
or you could always, I don't know.

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:46.390
[laughter]

00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:51.300
I hope that my argument is compelling enough
that it can turn some people's minds and I

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:56.770
know that, in fact, it has turned a few because
I've been hearing from some people. But that

00:49:56.770 --> 00:50:03.620
said, I don't claim to be a magician and if
you don't find the arguments compelling, then

00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:08.630
I would urge you to go deeper into the science
because I think the science is compelling.

00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:09.630
&gt;&gt;member #1: Thank you.

00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:10.810
&gt;&gt;Eric: Yes, sir.

00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:16.960
&gt;&gt;Male member #2: Well, that was actually
a rather depressing talk. I guess I sit here

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:22.040
thinking, "What can we do?" And the only thing
that came to mind was, well maybe if the Internet

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:27.070
does put every single current journalist onto
the unemployment line, that'll be a good thing.

00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:30.170
But I guess I have one specific question.
You didn't talk at all about international

00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:36.800
politics. My sense is that I hear a lot of
arguing with reform, unless the Chinese and

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:42.820
the Indians do this also, then anything we
do is pointless and hurts us. And you either

00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:48.160
hear that argument in completely different
contexts, like health and safety regulations.

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:54.020
So, is that important or is Congress so focused
on inside the beltway that it doesn't really

00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:55.020
matter?

00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:57.860
&gt;&gt;Eric: That's incredibly important and it's
a very important argument and I'm glad you

00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:03.610
brought it up. My book opens in Bali at the
International Climate Negotiations there and

00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:11.890
it closes in Copenhagen with an afterword
that takes the story up through the most recent

00:51:11.890 --> 00:51:18.070
Senate bill. So, international negotiation
is incredibly important. The truth is that

00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:22.900
until the United States acts, a global deal
is not possible. So, the global deal is not

00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:27.990
waiting on China; the global deal is waiting
on us. And the argument that we shouldn't

00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:36.200
act until China and India act is completely
misinformed for a couple of reasons. Now,

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:42.460
lemme not sound like I'm just rejecting it
out of hand, I understand the fears of competing

00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:46.970
with China and I understand the fears of people
who are worried that their jobs are gonna

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:52.820
be exported to China. The trouble here is
that we're trying to legislate via the rear

00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:59.430
view mirror. We're trying to save 20th century
manufacturing jobs instead of worrying about

00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:06.140
developing 21st century jobs. The fact is
that China is stealing our bacon in the clean

00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:13.510
energy race. China is already receiving twice
as much venture capital money in clean energy

00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:19.130
as the United States. In the second quarter
of 2010, it received more venture capital

00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:26.980
funding than the US and Europe combined. So,
money is flooding into China. And why is it

00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:31.830
flooding into China? Because they have a market.
Why do they have a market? Because a centralized

00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:38.290
authoritarian government that plans the economy
has decreed that they'll have a market and

00:52:38.290 --> 00:52:44.620
is spending nine billion dollars a month in
public money to make sure that clean energy

00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:55.950
is incented. They are expecting to spend upwards
of 300 billion dollars on clean energy in

00:52:55.950 --> 00:53:01.090
the People's Republic over the next decade.
That's just public money. So, we can't compete

00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:08.780
with that level of spending. We need a market
to pull our private dollars off the sidelines.

00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:14.930
And so, the real international argument, or
international competition that we oughta be

00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:20.750
talking about is the race to dominate the
clean energy economy, which we are badly losing

00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:31.270
to China now. Item two, today's New York Times,
China is closing 2,087 of its dirtiest, most

00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:38.460
polluting factories by decree on September
1st, I believe the date is. So, that's more

00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:44.850
than two thousand of their dirtiest plants,
which is gonna have a serious reduction in

00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:49.800
their carbon intensity; it's not gonna get
them all the way to their targets. But the

00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:56.210
idea that China is not acting is an obsolete
argument. China is acting in ways that we

00:53:56.210 --> 00:54:01.190
can't. In fact, the very day that the Senate
announced that it wasn't gonna be debating

00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:10.460
a climate bill, China announced that they're
putting into place a carbon trading program.

00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:14.180
So, the day that we said we're not gonna have
one, they said, "We're gonna experiment with

00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:18.970
one." So, China is moving ahead. But there's
an important distinction between China and

00:54:18.970 --> 00:54:27.840
the US. The US had a one century or more head
start over China and India in developing our

00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:35.910
prosperity through a carbon-based economy.
It would be unfair for us to expect China

00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:44.530
to get into the game on the exact same timetable
that we're doing. So, the notion that we oughta

00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:49.170
wait for China to act, and in fact, the idea
that China and India don't have to act is

00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:55.630
entwined in the international treaties. They
are part of the developing world, which is

00:54:55.630 --> 00:55:01.150
not required in the Kyoto Treaty to reduce
emissions. We're part of the developed world,

00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:07.160
which is required. We, alone among the developed
world, refused to sign, refused to ratify

00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:16.619
the treaty. So, I like the statement that
was made by Republican Senator John Warner,

00:55:16.619 --> 00:55:22.920
co-sponsor of the Lieberman-Warner climate
bill in 2008, when he said, "We can't allow

00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:29.160
China and India to hide behind our skirts
of inaction." Ok, if we, if we continue not

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:37.170
to act, we continue to give them a reason
not to act. In fact, China has proven that

00:55:37.170 --> 00:55:42.630
they wanna dominate clean energy; they're
number one in wind energy production, number

00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:53.780
one in solar PbC production. They are moving
ahead with their low-cost manufacturing advantages

00:55:53.780 --> 00:56:01.010
as well as their huge government pushed market.
I think it's probably already too late for

00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:06.740
us to beat them at the clean energy race,
but we can at least stay in the game. And

00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:13.710
in order to do that, we need to price carbon
and we need to put in place renewable energy

00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:19.430
standards and do a lot of other policies;
all of which we know what to do, we just need

00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:21.560
the political will to do them. Yes, sir.

00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:27.240
&gt;&gt;Male member #3: Two short questions. The
first is how much is the failure to pass action

00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:33.070
related to the economic collapse and the specter
of job loss potentially being so unpopular

00:56:33.070 --> 00:56:37.370
in this time with people being out of work?
And the second short part there is, you think

00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:42.119
it'd be easier to, instead of raising the
cost of carbon to lower the cost of clean

00:56:42.119 --> 00:56:46.240
energy through rebates? Is that more politically,
more political will behind that than maybe

00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:47.240
capping carbon?

00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:52.960
&gt;&gt;Eric: Two good questions. The, I'll start
with the lower of the cost of clean energy.

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:59.170
I'm all for that and it's gonna take R&amp;D and
deployment money to do that as well. And,

00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:05.340
the question is what's the funding mechanism
to actually put the billions and billions

00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:11.000
of dollars into that that we would need to
make a real dent in it? The nice thing about

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:17.360
the cap is that it gives you a revenue stream
and you can spend that revenue stream on intensive

00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:23.770
R&amp;D, and you're not just raising the cost
of fossil fuels, you're also lowering the

00:57:23.770 --> 00:57:28.890
cost of clean energy. But should we do that?
Yeah, we should start by getting rid of the

00:57:28.890 --> 00:57:37.950
subsidies for fossil fuels, which are still
a subsidized energy source in this country,

00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:43.050
and I think that's still globally. There's
a lot of disinformation from fossil fuel companies

00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:48.820
saying, "Well, we can't just give clean energy
all these subsidies and artificially reduce

00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:53.780
the price." But we've been artificially reducing
the price of petroleum for generations in

00:57:53.780 --> 00:58:01.210
this country and, in fact, we've never priced
in the social cost of petroleum, the cost

00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:08.970
of the pollution, the cost of oil spills,
the cost of climate change; none of those

00:58:08.970 --> 00:58:16.200
costs are factored into the cost of carbon
since spewing carbon is free. So, the first

00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:22.630
step would be to close that loophole and put
into place what the opponents call attacks,

00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:26.940
what's really just a common sense fee. It's
a common sense pollution fee. If I wanna go

00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:33.350
down to the dump and dump all the stuff in
my garage down at my local landfill, I have

00:58:33.350 --> 00:58:37.690
to pay to do that. So, I don't think of that
as a tax, I think of that as a use fee. So,

00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:48.290
I do think that I'm all for reducing the cost
of clean energy through subsidies, incentives,

00:58:48.290 --> 00:58:54.980
rebates, what have you, but I think in these
constrained times, we need a revenue stream

00:58:54.980 --> 00:59:01.960
to do that with. To your first question, yeah,
one of the culprits was clearly the greatest

00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:07.660
economic downturn in 70 years; one of the
reasons this was so hard to do. The Waxman-

00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:13.920
Markey bill passing the House in the summer
of 2009 was proof that it didn't have to prevent

00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:23.700
climate action, but it certainly made it much
harder to do. And it's ironic because, in

00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:29.780
reality, a cap would, although it does have
a short-term economic impact, it would have

00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:35.540
a long-term impact that would be a, that would
put us on a higher growth path. So, there's

00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:44.850
actually an economic argument for constraining
carbon and the, that equation is understood

00:59:44.850 --> 00:59:52.230
all the way to the top of the Obama Economic
Council. Larry Summers, in conversations with

00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:56.660
environmentalists and Fortune 500 executives
last year, described the economic approach

00:59:56.660 --> 01:00:04.350
as a scissors. The first blade of the scissors
would be the stimulus bill, which had 70 or

01:00:04.350 --> 01:00:09.560
80 billion dollars just for clean energy deployment.
The second blade of the scissors would be

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:14.960
the cap, which would bring all of this private
money off the sidelines and create an enormous

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:24.020
incentive and unleash innovation and pick
up where the stimulus bill left off. But,

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:29.470
the sad thing is that our scissors is short
one blade, right? So, we're trying to cut

01:00:29.470 --> 01:00:34.060
but we're not really getting it done. And
I think this'll be the last question. Can

01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:35.060
we have time for one more?

01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:37.850
&gt;&gt;presenter female: No, unfortunately we don't--

01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:39.490
&gt;&gt;Eric: Sorry about that.

01:00:39.490 --> 01:00:40.490
&gt;&gt;presenter female: thank you for coming.

01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:41.490
&gt;&gt;Eric: Thank you everybody. I appreciate
it.

01:00:41.490 --> 01:00:41.491
