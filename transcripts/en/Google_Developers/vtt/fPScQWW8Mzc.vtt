TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.633
and this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:07.710
from Google in the last week.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.290
Actions on Google let
you bring your services

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.570
to the Google Assistant.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.680
Your integrations can
help you engage users

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.280
through Google Home today and in
the future through Pixel, Allo,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.800
and many other experiences
where the Google Assistant will

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.794
be available.

00:00:20.794 --> 00:00:22.710
To learn more about this
awesome new platform,

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.530
use the link in the
description below.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.510
We're wrapping up our
annual global Playtime

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.180
series of events where we met
with app and game developers

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.800
from around the
world to discuss how

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.650
to build successful
businesses on Google Play,

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.380
share experiences, give
feedback, collaborate,

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.542
and get inspired.

00:00:38.542 --> 00:00:39.750
Don't worry if you missed it.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.916
You can now watch some of
the best Playtime sessions

00:00:41.916 --> 00:00:44.280
on our Android Developers
YouTube channel.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.520
Highlights include a great
session on sustainable growth

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.980
and how you can use
augmented reality

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.550
to create innovative, immersive
experiences for your users--

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.620
all linked below.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.016
Firebase Crash Reporting
is now fully released

00:00:58.016 --> 00:00:59.640
with many new features
and enhancements

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.264
to help you better
diagnose and respond

00:01:01.264 --> 00:01:04.739
to crashes that affect the
users of your iOS and Android

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.280
mobile apps, including issue
resolution, improved reporting

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.410
latency, and email alerts.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.310
For more info and screenshots,
check out the post.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.110
One of the main
challenges in exploring

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.090
data being interpreted
by ML models

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.630
is that it often has hundreds
or even thousands of dimensions,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.480
requiring special tools
to investigate the space.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.000
To enable a more intuitive
exploration process,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.250
we are open-sourcing
a web application

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.440
for interactive
visualization and analysis

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.100
of high dimensional data
called the Embedding Projector.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.360
Check out the post for some
cool animations of it in action.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.730
DeepMind has invested
considerable effort

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.770
toward building rich
simulated environments that

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.070
serve as laboratories
for AI research.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.200
They just open-sourced
their flagship platform

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.710
DeepMind Lab, which is a fully
3D game-like platform tailored

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.990
for agent-based AI research.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.820

Remember the "No-Nonsense
Guide to Native Ads"?

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.560
It contains guiding
design principles

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.440
that help you better implement
native ads, practical tips

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.710
and best practices and examples
for implementing native ads,

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.670
how to set up a proper A/B test
to begin testing native ads,

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.900
and more.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.160

in the January

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.406

This week, we announced the beta
release of the new Google Cloud

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.990
Client Libraries for
four of our cloud

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.440
services-- BigQuery, Google
Cloud Datastore, Stackdriver

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.990
Logging, and Google
Cloud Storage.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.030
These client libraries
are well-documented,

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.380
easy to access, and cover 7
server-side languages-- C#, Go,

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.870
Java, Node.js, PHP,
Python, and Ruby.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.400
We also recently announced
the general availability

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.650
of Regional Managed
Instance Groups

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.270
in Google Compute Engine.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.280
This release offers a
fully managed service

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.530
for creating highly
available applications.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.980
Simply specify the region in
which to run your application,

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.860
and Compute Engine automatically
balances your machines

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.160
across independent
zones within the region.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.290
