1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,150
Last time we heard about the uh,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,710
some medical considerations regarding
stereochemistry and we're going to just

3
00:00:07,711 --> 00:00:12,690
start today with a little bit about legal
considerations about Stereo Chemistry.

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,930
Uh, first, uh, uh,

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,510
the doctor gave a disclosure
last time about her connections,

6
00:00:19,511 --> 00:00:20,580
so I'll do the same thing.

7
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:24,690
I've served as a scientific consultant
or expert witness to a number of farms,

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,070
pharmaceutical companies including Asi,
which is how I knew about that. Seven,

9
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:29,970
three, eight, nine,

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,440
I take Lipitor and served as an expert
witness for a generic competitor in a

11
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:41,460
case involving the validity of a
Canadian lip atar patent by Pfizer.

12
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,600
And my only connection to Astrazeneca
and a members all his is an occasional

13
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:48,090
consumer of [inaudible] sec.
Okay.

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,260
This book here is very heavy.

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,780
It's about the stereochemistry of
organic compounds and interestingly,

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,010
it's from 1994. So it's, it's
all, it's less than 15 years old.

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,040
It's still the Bible and only eight pages
of it are about biological properties.

18
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,180
And just one of those pages had anything
to do with legal things which had to do

19
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:17,100
incidentally with cocaine. It turned out
that somebody was on trial for cocaine.

20
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:20,430
And the, the defense had
the idea that the, uh,

21
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,380
that the prosecution did not tested the
cocaine to see which he auntie Maria.

22
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,870
It was as to whether
it was, it was, uh, uh,

23
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,030
artifice might've been artificial
because the Ian antitumor of cocaine,

24
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:37,770
there's no law against.
It also wouldn't work.

25
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,551
But anyhow,

26
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:41,430
they hadn't tested it so they thought
they could get their client off.

27
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,790
I didn't actually look up the case
to see whether they got off or not,

28
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:48,270
but that's an interesting
stereo chemical application.

29
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,890
But one that made a big difference was
the court rejecting a suit about Nexium

30
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:59,640
marketing. We saw last time and
you did a problem for today about,

31
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,533
uh,

32
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,600
about Nexium and whether the advertising
seemed convincing to you or fair for

33
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:08,930
that matter. There was a big, uh,

34
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,970
suit about that and this in 2005 was a
news report about that a federal court in

35
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:19,821
Delaware dismissed the class action
lawsuit alleging Astrazeneca had misled,

36
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,061
had,
had,

37
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:26,061
had misleading marketing of Nexium and
thus added billions to healthcare costs.

38
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,750
And the district court judge,

39
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:32,520
Sue Robinson rejected the suit brought
by the Pennsylvania employee benefit

40
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:37,050
trust fund on behalf of entities that
foot the bill in health care plans

41
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,690
according to the health
plan paying organizations.

42
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,830
The big difference between the two drugs
is not effectiveness but advertising.

43
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:48,510
So you presumably looked at some of this
and have your own opinion about that by

44
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:52,320
selling doctors and patients on the
idea that patented Nexium is better than

45
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:54,930
prior lasek which face
generic competition,

46
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,830
Astrazeneca was able to preserve
billions in sales. So for example,

47
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:04,330
the year Nexium was introduced
the, their, their marketing,

48
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,450
their advertising budget was $260 million.

49
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,310
And in 2005 it had declined
slightly to $226 million,

50
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,190
but the sales were five point $8 billion.

51
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:19,480
So the advertising was negligible
compared to the cost of advertising.

52
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,540
Judge Robinson said the courts should
defer to the u s FDA in weighing the

53
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:29,380
differences between drugs and that
since the FDA cleared nexiums label,

54
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,650
the lawsuit could not stand.
So That's interesting.

55
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:35,620
And shows the importance of the FDA.

56
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,420
Okay. Back to chemistry now, uh,

57
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,060
in order to market Nexium,

58
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:46,150
the singling anti Mer
Astro Zenica had the,

59
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:48,870
of course prepare it as a
single land in antitumor,

60
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,160
which meant either resolution.

61
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,880
So separation of the right and the left
handed forms or else preparation of only

62
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,930
the one form the s uh,
members.

63
00:04:00,931 --> 00:04:05,120
All I noticed that the
doctor said Isa met resolved.

64
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,580
Maybe they all pronounce it that way,

65
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:10,370
but the reason they got the names
because it's ass, right? So I say yes,

66
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:14,020
a map result. Uh, so how are
you going to do it? Resolution.

67
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:16,720
You could do a posture
conglomorate kind of thing.

68
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:20,320
You could make temporary dietary
immerse and separate them perhaps by

69
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:25,321
crystallization or you could destroy
wanting antitumor react the Ras and mate

70
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:29,080
with the resolved chiral reagent that
would react with only one or maybe a

71
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:33,250
catalyst that would catalyze the
destruction of only one, like an enzyme.

72
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,720
Or You could do it nature's way and
prepare only wanting auntie Marie either

73
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:42,721
from a resolved chiral starting
material or using a resolved reagent or

74
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:47,380
catalyst. And they tried,
they tried all of these.

75
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,170
So let's a look at it first.

76
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,860
A resolution of a map
result by chromatography.

77
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:59,170
So they had uh, Silico, it's what you
use probably in your chromatography,

78
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:02,830
but they coated it with something
that was a singly Nan tumor.

79
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,580
Now how did they get something solid
that was a singly Nancy where that they

80
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:10,940
could coat it with, they
got it from nature. It was
cellulose, Tris, fennel car,

81
00:05:10,941 --> 00:05:12,370
Bama wheel cellulose.

82
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:16,390
And they did this in 1990 when they were
looking forward to the time that they'd

83
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:18,580
lose patent protection
on the Ras Rasamayi.

84
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,080
So there's cellulose and fennel, ISO, Cya,

85
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:27,210
Nate thing with two double
bonds in a row there. Now, uh,

86
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:32,310
what would make you think fennel
isocyanate reactive the reagent.

87
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,980
See any functional groups there?

88
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:42,060
Any ideas? Okay. Carbon double bond. Good.

89
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,430
And how about the cellulose?

90
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,580
What's going to make it reactive?

91
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,340
Rick? What makes cellulose
reactive? Any functional groups?

92
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,770
Sole unshared payers on oxygen.
Okay,

93
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:06,440
so none shared pair on oxygen
could attack the carbon yield.

94
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,880
Now it could attack either the CEO
or the CN double bond. And in fact,

95
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:12,980
we've seen this before.
This,

96
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:17,210
remember is how urea got
made from ammonia and,

97
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,420
and uh, and the, and
the corresponding acid.

98
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:24,050
This is just the fennel derivative of
that asset. So it does the same thing.

99
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:28,580
And in fact you can do it with all the
ohs in the group. So you put that, uh,

100
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,490
that car bammo wheel group as
it's called on all the oxygen.

101
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:37,280
So that is the chiral stuff that was on
the solid that the chromatography was

102
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:41,510
conducted with. Now they weren't
able to get very much. They did,

103
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,610
they did six injections in chromatography
and were able to get three milligrams

104
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:51,611
of the dextro rotatory and four milligrams
of the Livo rotatory stuff separated

105
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:55,340
by the rate at which they would go
through this chiral column. Now,

106
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:58,280
that wasn't enough for any kind
of human testing or anything.

107
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:02,210
You need 20 milligrams. Remember
for a human dose for just one dose.

108
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:07,640
But what they could do was
measure how fast [inaudible] was,

109
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,140
because obviously if the stuff
rast summized immediately
it would be useless to

110
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,470
have a single enantiomers.

111
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,880
So they found out that that the half
life for [inaudible] was an hour at 75

112
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:20,204
degrees,

113
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:25,640
which they then extrapolated to what it
would be at a body temperature to be a

114
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,360
hundred hours. So plenty of time, it's
not going to randomize just spontaneously.

115
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:32,180
So at least that was not a trouble.
So they,

116
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:37,540
so this very first quick way of resolving
it allowed them to see that it was

117
00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:40,580
maybe worthwhile continuing.
Okay.

118
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:45,581
Then they tried reversible formation
of a crystal and man delete Esther.

119
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:49,850
Now that red stuff there is mandelic acid,
which is a natural substance.

120
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:55,090
So you have that as the pure s enantiomers
and now you want to react that with

121
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:59,260
uh, with the OMAP resolve with
the receipt we can map result.

122
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,120
But there you do it with
an intermediate compound,

123
00:08:02,121 --> 00:08:05,210
formaldehyde such that the Formaldehyde,

124
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,740
the carbon eel group gets attacked
from both sides one of the time by the

125
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:14,741
nitrogen on the Ameb Rizal and the oxygen
on Mandelic acid to put ch two group

126
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:18,650
between them.
And we'll talk about that a lot,

127
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:22,250
that kind of thing when we get onto
the chemistry of aldehydes and ketones.

128
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:27,310
But anyhow, they could do that. Now they
have what? What Stereo? What's the stairs?

129
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,860
They have two things.
What's their stereo chemical relationship?

130
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,470
Because they had received
me come and resolve,

131
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,680
they've reacted it with s mandelic acid.

132
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:41,180
What are the two that you got two
compounds. What's their relationship?

133
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,150
Russell?
Their dietary immersed.

134
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,350
So they're different so you can
crystallize them apart. Okay.

135
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:52,310
So they did that and then the important
thing was that it's a reversible

136
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:57,311
reaction so they could go back again
adding water and get the result back after

137
00:08:58,501 --> 00:09:03,120
the separation. And now they have
both the r and the s versions of that,

138
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:07,470
both the d and the l or the Dexter
rotatory in the Livo rotatory forms of a

139
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:12,360
members all in separate bottles and
now they have hundreds of milligrams.

140
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,810
So it's not enough to
do a large scale test,

141
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,360
but they can do some biological testing.

142
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:23,361
And with it where they found that the
ar was four times as active as the s in

143
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:29,220
rats that they studied. But Lo and
behold, when they got into humans,

144
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,020
it turned out it was reversed,
that the s was more active than the are.

145
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,790
So that's why the drug is SMF resolved.
Okay?

146
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:42,630
But that's that you're not going
to do this to make enough to, uh,

147
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,340
to sell to the public,

148
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:48,870
especially because you don't want to
throw away half the material you make,

149
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,490
both because you're polluting
the environment, uh,

150
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:56,430
and because you're wasting the money
you've put into making it. So there's a,

151
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,940
they developed a chiral catalyst,
uh,

152
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,800
involving titanium.

153
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:07,150
So there's a titanium bond bounded to,
to,

154
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:11,760
uh, to four alcohols are actually one
of them bridges to another titanium.

155
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,590
But anyhow, you can do something
called Lig and exchange. So one of the,

156
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,710
so the electrons in the
bond go onto the oxygen.

157
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,520
So you have our oh minus and
the plus you've broken the bond.

158
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,800
Now that goes away and a different one
can come in a different alcohol and form

159
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:29,551
a new bond.

160
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:33,930
So that exchanges the ligands by
losing one and putting on another one.

161
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,453
Okay?

162
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,780
Now you can do that trick
with Dai Ethel tartrate.

163
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,120
So two of the oxygens,
the alcohol,

164
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:46,920
oxygen's of tartaric acid can exchange
for two of the alcohols that are on the

165
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:50,370
titanium. And you get this,
this compound of titanium.

166
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:54,150
Now what you really want is the titanium.
That's what's the catalyst.

167
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,530
So you can lose another aro
minus and you get this Tei plus,

168
00:10:58,531 --> 00:11:00,660
and now it's when the Talus begins

169
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,640
because you bring in a per oxy compound,

170
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,740
a hydro peroxide. So instead of an
alcohol, there are two oxygens there.

171
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,280
And that can do the same trick
and combined with the titanium.

172
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,050
So you have this compound,

173
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:21,290
but now you have different functional
group there you have the o bond and what

174
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:24,930
makes the OBOD reactive.
We've seen this before, Kevin,

175
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:32,160
and what is the low luma?
Right?

176
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:35,400
So sigma star is going to
be reactive there, okay?

177
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,670
And you could bring in a sulfur,

178
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,620
right with its unshared
payers and they'll react,

179
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,800
make a bond, break a bond, right?

180
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:51,870
So you get the sulfur attached to the
oxygen and it's s plus since it's used its

181
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:56,680
electrons to make that new bond,
uh,

182
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,250
now that thing can come off the same way.

183
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:05,251
The compound above it did the Aro came
off the the sulfur compound can come off.

184
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,030
And that's the sulfoxide.

185
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:10,390
And remember that's the important
group in the SMS spurs all.

186
00:12:10,391 --> 00:12:14,980
That's what sets things
going. Okay, so we've got it.

187
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,560
And now that compound on the lower left,

188
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:21,400
the titanium compound is the same
as the one on the upper right.

189
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,910
So we've made a cycle.
Okay?

190
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,170
So that means we could look at the
cycle this way, a catalytic cycle.

191
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,170
We bring in our oh minus,

192
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,870
it combines with the little machine.

193
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:40,140
Then s comes in and Aro minus comes out
and then s double bond o comes out and

194
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:45,790
you get the catalysts back again.
Start at the top and go.

195
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,960
So you go round and round and round
and round. And every time you have the,

196
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,990
the peroxide come in,
the sulfide come in,

197
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,530
the Aro minus comes out
and the so comes out.

198
00:12:56,531 --> 00:13:00,220
So essentially the r o gives one of its,

199
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:04,030
owes the redwood to the sulfur.
Right? But it's catalyzed by this.

200
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:08,810
Now why is it important for their purposes
that this thing be involved in Qatar?

201
00:13:08,811 --> 00:13:13,360
Alesis we looked last time that you
can put an oxygen on sulfur just with

202
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:16,030
peroxide.
You don't need the catalyst to do that.

203
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:17,890
Although it's faster with the catalyst.

204
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:22,090
Did they do it just to gain speed
or could you see something else?

205
00:13:22,091 --> 00:13:23,980
What's special about the catalyst?

206
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,070
Lucas part? It's one in antitumor, right?

207
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:32,590
It's a chiral oxidizing agent.

208
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,510
The peroxide alone would
have been an oxidizing agent,
could have done the trick,

209
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:42,870
but the Chiral oxidizing agent means
that it will discriminate between the two

210
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,060
hands of the product.
Right?

211
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:49,210
It could attack one of
the unshared pairs here

212
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:55,770
or it could attack the other and those
are Ian Antia Mers of one another.

213
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,740
But when it's combined with this
thing that has tartaric acid on,

214
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,560
which makes it chiral and have one hand,

215
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,960
then those are diastema
immerse one of the tacks.

216
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:08,710
This one or when this one
does the attacking. Right.

217
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:13,890
So they won't be 50 50 unfortunately
it was 50 50 it just happened to be the

218
00:14:17,351 --> 00:14:21,250
same rate. So did they give up? No,

219
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:26,251
they started fiddling and one thing they
did was to add dye Eissa propyl ethyl

220
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:33,400
amine. Why? Who knows, right?

221
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:38,670
But they discovered that what you do
that then you get what's called 94%

222
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:44,200
enantiomers excess. That means
the desire dean, Nancy homer is,

223
00:14:44,201 --> 00:14:46,990
they're at a 96,

224
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,150
97% and there's 3% of
the ragging antitumor,

225
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:57,470
right? So there's an excess of 94%
of the Ena, Auntie Marie you want.

226
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,550
So now all you do is crystallize
it and it gets purified.

227
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:05,060
You get rid of the 3% and
you have the stuff you want.

228
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,230
Now you can sell it to the
public as Nexium. So that's the,

229
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,930
that's the way you do it
practically, right? When you
want to make a lot of stuff,

230
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:15,920
you make just one.
Okay?

231
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,910
So that's what we're going to
say about a configuration. Uh,

232
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,700
and now we have one C to go.

233
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:26,540
We'd talked about composition of
course from the time of Lavoie,

234
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,960
ca about constitution from the
time of Cooper and [inaudible],

235
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,860
Calculi, uh, those,

236
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,550
but then there are distinctions
based on this bonding model.

237
00:15:37,551 --> 00:15:41,960
Note that constitution is already
involving the bonding model,

238
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:47,150
but something beyond constitution
is how things are arranged in space.

239
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:52,450
So configuration is obviously also a
question of the model that you make in for

240
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:57,080
bonding and con formation, which is
the sea we haven't talked about yet.

241
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,500
And those last two are stereo isomers
because they have to do with arrangement

242
00:16:03,111 --> 00:16:06,470
in space. Which constitution
as you remember it doesn't.

243
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,540
So you could, the difference between
configuration and confirmation,

244
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:15,710
both of which have to do with arrangement
in space is that the configuration you

245
00:16:15,711 --> 00:16:19,580
have to break bonds to go for
one and I isomer to another.

246
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:23,120
And in the uh,
con formation,

247
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:26,650
you just rotate about single bonds
to get from one isomer. Other.

248
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:31,280
And in general it's hard to break
bonds and easier to rotate bonds.

249
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:36,580
So typically configurational isomers
lasts longer than conformational isomers

250
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,250
but not always.
There could be special cases.

251
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:46,850
Now all things that you call isomers
represent local energy minimis.

252
00:16:46,851 --> 00:16:50,600
So the molecule can sit there at that
geometry and of course it has to be

253
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:54,650
vibrating at least zero point vibration.
So the atoms are moving,

254
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:59,570
but they're in a, well, they stay in the
same relative locations more or less.

255
00:16:59,571 --> 00:17:01,250
Right?
They vibrate in there,

256
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:05,030
but then they can get out of that well
and go to a completely different well and

257
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:05,960
vibrate there.

258
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:10,460
So not all the different
phases of vibration are
considered different molecules.

259
00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:14,210
That would be way too much to call
those all isomers of one another.

260
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,290
Those are all one isomer.
And these are all another isomer.

261
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:21,320
But there's some barrier to
get from one to the other.

262
00:17:21,321 --> 00:17:22,820
So you can have one or the other.

263
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:27,650
And the barriers are typically higher
for configuration and lower for

264
00:17:27,651 --> 00:17:30,170
confirmation.
Okay.

265
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:32,840
Now we've seen that in 19th century,

266
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,740
the stereo chemistry was qualitative.

267
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:40,910
It was a question of counting
isomers not measuring something,

268
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:45,980
but just counting how many isomers
you can get. Very qualitative, right?

269
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,830
But Khan formation,
which didn't come along until later,

270
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:55,050
which involves rotational isomerism about
single bonds is much more subtle and

271
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:59,040
it requires quantitative
thought about equilibria rates.

272
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:02,580
And Energy's not just this
qualitative counting of isomers.

273
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,090
So notice that this is,

274
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:10,950
that con formational analysis came
relatively late to the timeline.

275
00:18:10,951 --> 00:18:13,830
We're talking about all the other stuff
we're talking about happened before.

276
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:15,460
Most of the other stuff.
Uh,

277
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,080
with respect to structure
happened before 1900,

278
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:23,280
but it was only in 1950 that
confirmational analysis began.

279
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,440
And then, uh, uh,

280
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,360
25 years later that people started doing
significant what's called molecular

281
00:18:30,361 --> 00:18:32,250
mechanics modeling,

282
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:35,670
treating molecules as if
they were springs and so on.

283
00:18:35,671 --> 00:18:38,460
And we'll talk about that a
little bit later. So remember,

284
00:18:38,461 --> 00:18:42,840
there you are and we can
trace your lineage back to PD.

285
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:47,430
Bartlett at Harvard, who was my phd
supervisor and his phd supervisor,

286
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:48,300
JB Conant.

287
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:53,220
Now those guys were involved in a
special flavor of organic chemistry,

288
00:18:53,221 --> 00:18:57,330
which influences you,
it's called physical organic chemistry.

289
00:18:57,331 --> 00:19:02,331
It's interested in not so much in
making new compounds as in why compounds

290
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,990
behave the way they do.

291
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,250
So what you've suffered through this
semester is because of these guys,

292
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,080
right? We talk much more about why
things work, how bonding works,

293
00:19:13,081 --> 00:19:17,460
how to recognize a functional group than
we do with memorizing reactions that

294
00:19:17,461 --> 00:19:21,690
will get you from here to
there. Okay. So Conant was, was,

295
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:26,640
was one of the founders of this discipline
because he did phd with two advisors,

296
00:19:26,641 --> 00:19:30,570
one of whom was a physical chemist
and one was an organic chemist.

297
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,750
So if we go back a little bit here,
you see the blue,

298
00:19:33,751 --> 00:19:37,080
the organic chemist was Kohler,
whom we've talked about.

299
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,140
And the red was tw Richards,

300
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:43,470
the physical chemist who
himself studied with Ville Helm,

301
00:19:43,471 --> 00:19:48,471
Austin called who together with Vantiff
and to rainiest these three guys here,

302
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:52,200
Vantiff last of all an erroneous.

303
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:56,310
Those are the guys who founded
physical chemistry as a discipline.

304
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,580
Okay? So, uh,

305
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,120
so we have a lot more physical chemistry
in this course than you'd normally

306
00:20:03,121 --> 00:20:07,320
would in an elementary
organic course. Uh, now,

307
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:11,100
uh, if you go a little bit
further in the family tree,

308
00:20:11,101 --> 00:20:14,670
you get GN Lewis as well.
When we've of course talked about

309
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:20,970
now in the late 19th century when these
guys were founding physical chemistry,

310
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,720
organic chemists focused their
efforts on molecular structure,

311
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:29,160
on these things having to
do with configuration and,
and enantiomers and so on.

312
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:34,490
But physical chemists focused on energy
sometimes to the exclusion of structure.

313
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,120
In fact, asked of all, oh, I forgot to
bring his book. I was going to bring,

314
00:20:39,121 --> 00:20:42,180
but I can to show you,
but I have a page from it here.

315
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,780
He wrote lots and lots of books on.
First of all to is like, you know,

316
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:49,570
you're four great Kevin uncle,
grandfather or something.

317
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,790
This principles of chemistry,
which he gave the, uh,

318
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:59,270
not too modest title and introduction
to all chemical textbooks.

319
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,670
So this is why if you read it,

320
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:03,230
then you were ready to read
any other chemical textbooks.

321
00:21:03,231 --> 00:21:08,231
So it was a general view in
19 seven and on page four 21,

322
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:12,880
there's a very long footnote. And if you
look at a little bit of this footnote,

323
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,240
it says Dalton who developed the law
of combining weights on the basis of an

324
00:21:18,971 --> 00:21:23,971
hypothesis he had proposed about the
composition of matter from Adams at first

325
00:21:24,611 --> 00:21:29,611
took hydrogen as unity since it had the
smallest atomic weight that is combining

326
00:21:29,711 --> 00:21:32,080
weight.
And so there's the word Adam,

327
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:37,620
and that's the only place in 554 pages
of this book that the Word Adam occurs.

328
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:44,500
It's in the subordinate clause of
a footnote, because at this time,

329
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,150
asked of all, didn't believe in atoms.
He believed that philosophically,

330
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:51,430
since you couldn't see him,
you shouldn't talk about them.

331
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,430
So you should do things
that you can deal with.

332
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,220
And energy was such a thing he thought.
So physical chemists,

333
00:21:58,221 --> 00:22:01,960
these guys who founded physical
chemistry focused on, of course,

334
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:06,100
Vantiff is interesting because he's the
guy that had the idea of the tetrahedral

335
00:22:06,101 --> 00:22:09,280
carbon. So he didn't sign off on
this together with Austin Oswald,

336
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,470
but Oswald was much more influential.
He had a much bigger school of,

337
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:18,580
of uh, students. And so, uh, he was,

338
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:24,180
he was only two years later that he
finally accepted the existence of atoms.

339
00:22:24,871 --> 00:22:28,540
So I'm just drawing you the contrast
between what organic chemists we're

340
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:31,990
thinking about and what physical
chemists were and that now,

341
00:22:31,991 --> 00:22:36,610
to deal with confirmation, we have to
become a little physical chemist to, uh,

342
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,180
to, uh, to, to see the
influence of energy.

343
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:44,890
So here's the dedication of
sterling chemistry lab in April,

344
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,320
1923 and there is a group
of people that will look at,

345
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:50,140
and all of these guys here,

346
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:55,220
we're students of Austin Bald. So
he had a very broad influence. Uh,

347
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,240
the one there is tw Richards got the
first American Nobel prize in Chemistry.

348
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:05,380
Okay. Andy, he remember is, is, uh,

349
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:09,430
is your something grandfather.
Okay. So then, uh,

350
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,420
done in the next guy where there's a guy
from Canada, guy from Britain and the,

351
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,950
the uh, guy on the left, there was a
student of Richard, so a grand student of,

352
00:23:17,951 --> 00:23:21,280
of Austin Ball with his cigars.
He always had,

353
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,580
and this guy is wilder band Croft,

354
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,990
who was at Cornell and who
founded and owned for that matter,

355
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,730
the Journal of Physical Chemistry.
And he wrote an obituary of Austin Bald,

356
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,290
uh, in 1933 in which he said, asked,

357
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,290
followed Skift for
leadership showed itself.

358
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:44,860
And the way his pupils regarded him
all throughout, all through their,

359
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:51,890
they usually believe Twat Ostfeld said,
even when they knew he was not right.

360
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:57,920
Okay. And no doubt Adams where what he
had in mind that Oswald didn't believe in

361
00:23:57,921 --> 00:24:01,430
atoms, but as students still
believed in atoms. Okay,

362
00:24:01,431 --> 00:24:05,600
but they all believed in energy. Now,
did anybody walk past here this morning?

363
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,570
You recognize this place? Okay,
you take a different path.

364
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,520
Okay, but have you noticed
what's off on the left there?

365
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,230
Here's stood the house
of Josiah Willard Gibbs,

366
00:24:20,231 --> 00:24:23,440
class of 1858 professor
of mathematical physics.

367
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,280
So Yale has a really special
connection to, to energy.

368
00:24:27,281 --> 00:24:31,900
There's Gibbs as a, as a
freshman, uh, and here,

369
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,333
here he is in,

370
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:37,360
in later life he spent his whole life
here at Yale except for one year he went

371
00:24:37,361 --> 00:24:38,194
to Germany.

372
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:44,910
So physical chemists were and still are
quantitative about equilibrium constants

373
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:50,920
and rate constants.
So big K is an equilibrium constant.

374
00:24:50,921 --> 00:24:54,820
Small K is a rate constant
and they're related to energy.

375
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,240
So you can call energy. He or if
you're, you're more particular,

376
00:24:58,241 --> 00:25:02,590
you can call it h for
[inaudible] or g for Gibbs.

377
00:25:02,591 --> 00:25:07,150
Free Energy and entropy gets into the
argument as we'll see in a few lectures.

378
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,950
So energy determines what can
happen at equilibrium. That is,

379
00:25:11,951 --> 00:25:13,210
if you have this stuff,

380
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:18,400
is it possible spontaneously to go to
this stuff if you have forever and ever

381
00:25:18,401 --> 00:25:21,730
for it to happen? Is it conceivable
that this stuff will go to this stuff?

382
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,840
It can only happen if it's
downhill and energy in free energy.

383
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,580
Okay. And the equilibrium
constant is determined by,

384
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,040
is related to energy in this way.

385
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:38,050
And here's something that's really
handy and you'll impress a subsequent

386
00:25:38,051 --> 00:25:41,380
teachers and your roommates and
everyone else, if you remember this,

387
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:45,640
that if you know the change in
energy and kilocalories per mole,

388
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:50,850
you can say what the equilibrium constant
is cause it's 10 to the minus three

389
00:25:50,891 --> 00:25:52,600
fourths of whatever that is.

390
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:57,750
So suppose the difference between this
and this is four kilocalories per mole.

391
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:01,330
What will the equilibrium constant B,

392
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,403
yeah,

393
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:09,330
it'll be 1,010 to the
three fourths of of four,

394
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,740
right? Three. Four. So four is three.

395
00:26:11,741 --> 00:26:15,460
10 to the third is a thousand so the
equilibrium constants gotta be a thousand.

396
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,430
Now, whether it's a thousand
or one over a thousand,

397
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,140
depends on which way you're going.

398
00:26:20,141 --> 00:26:22,420
But obviously it's going
to favor the one down hill.

399
00:26:22,421 --> 00:26:25,990
So you have to keep your thinking
cap on to get the right direction.

400
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,420
But 10 to the minus three fourths of Delta
h or tend to the plus 10 to the minus

401
00:26:31,421 --> 00:26:35,110
three fourths, uh, is the way to do it.

402
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:40,270
Okay. But you can also say
something about how fast it will go.

403
00:26:40,271 --> 00:26:43,800
This is just whether it's conceivable
that it will go. The big guy,

404
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:48,780
the little Kay says how fast because
rates, this is an approximation.

405
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:52,800
This isn't a written on the
tablets by the angel or someone.

406
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,400
But for practical purposes,
for our purposes,

407
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,320
the rate in seconds,

408
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:03,000
that is how many per second is 10
to the 13th so that's very fast.

409
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,590
10 to the 13th per second.

410
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:09,030
But then it gets cut down by
how big the energy barrier is.

411
00:27:09,031 --> 00:27:10,350
You have to get across.

412
00:27:10,351 --> 00:27:15,210
And the cutting down is exactly the same
kind of thing you have in the big k 10

413
00:27:15,211 --> 00:27:18,000
to the minus Delta h.
So you can again,

414
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,580
that that energy is
called activation energy.

415
00:27:20,581 --> 00:27:23,190
It's how high the barrier is
that you have to get over.

416
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:27,000
And you can use the same
trick of the three fourths.

417
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:32,330
So it's the rate constant is 10 to the
13th minus three fourths of whatever the

418
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:35,730
energy.
So if you have a four,

419
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,550
suppose you had a four kilocalories of
energy barrier you had to get across was

420
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,780
you had a 40 kilo calorie energy barrier,

421
00:27:42,781 --> 00:27:47,490
you had to get across 40 kilo
calorie energy barrier, right?

422
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:49,590
How fast would the rate constant?
B?

423
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:53,600
Yeah.

424
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,710
Becky, why don't you help me? So
the barrier is 40 kilocalories.

425
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:02,660
Okay. That you have to get across. So
now how am I going to plug that in here?

426
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:11,050
Okay, so three fourths of 40
I need, right? So what's that?

427
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,080
30 30.
Okay,

428
00:28:14,081 --> 00:28:18,370
so it's 10 to the 13 minus 30 okay,

429
00:28:18,371 --> 00:28:22,260
what's 13 minus 30
okay,

430
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:25,510
so it's 10 to the minus 27 per second.

431
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,430
Do you think that's very fast?

432
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,860
10 to the minus 27 that's
a pretty small number,

433
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,480
right?

434
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,130
So forget spontaneously at
room temperature going over,

435
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:44,080
uh, going over a barrier
of 40 kilocalories per mole
for practical purposes.

436
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,670
But you have this tea here. So if you
increase the absolute temperature,

437
00:28:48,671 --> 00:28:53,290
then you make that for bidding factor
smaller and smaller and smaller.

438
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:57,130
Up in the exponent. So if you heat it
up, you could make the reaction go. Okay,

439
00:28:57,131 --> 00:28:58,210
so Eddie, yeah, that's really,

440
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,710
that's really helpful to remember
this three fourths trick. Okay.

441
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:03,850
Now,

442
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:08,740
confirmation involves rotational
isomerization about single bonds.

443
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:14,080
So the question is,
how free is single bond rotation?

444
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,500
Paterno said it wasn't free at all.

445
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:22,560
I can count isomers that way I can have
this isomer and I can have this isomer

446
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:27,730
and I can have this
isomer, right. For cat,

447
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,710
for purposes of counting. But
van Hoff says, no, don't count.

448
00:29:32,711 --> 00:29:35,410
Isomers like that because why?

449
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,920
Why shouldn't you account
isomers like that?

450
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:45,520
Because they rotate too easy, right?
It's like that in his picture. Right?

451
00:29:45,521 --> 00:29:48,700
So you shouldn't count this and
this and this and this. Okay.

452
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:53,590
Now there are different kinds of models.
Something like these,

453
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:59,080
and some of them you can rotate
easily, but not others. Right?

454
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:03,540
Which one's realistic, right? Or
I mean, this one you can rotate.

455
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:07,960
It's just not easy to rotate, right?
It sticks. Right? Or this one,

456
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,610
remember that Fisher used,

457
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:14,140
which is good because you can
bend it for his purposes, right?

458
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:16,600
For drawing two dimensional
Fisher projections.

459
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:20,890
But forget rotating that right.
It could vibrate, but it can't.

460
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:24,760
You can't rotate it. It'll always
come back, right? So the question is,

461
00:30:24,761 --> 00:30:28,990
which model is right?
Can you rotate or can't you rotate?

462
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:31,300
And how hard is it to rotate?

463
00:30:31,301 --> 00:30:35,380
Because that's going to determine
how fast these things will be. Okay?

464
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:40,740
Now notice that all that both of these
authors drew their pictures with a

465
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:44,530
confirmation which we call eclipsed.

466
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,680
Now eclipsed means these means this,

467
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:52,030
that the ones on the top or right
over ones on the bottom, okay.

468
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:55,960
And the same is true in Van
Hoff's Tetrahedron, right?

469
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,980
Right above the others.
Obviously you could rotate, uh,

470
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,580
60 degrees on the top and
everything would be staggered,

471
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:06,040
not directly above.
Okay?

472
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,670
Notice incidentally that from the exam,

473
00:31:09,671 --> 00:31:14,380
we looked at the molecule of the week
for last week from the American Chemical

474
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:19,270
Society and notice how it's
drawn, right? It also is eclipsed.

475
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:23,650
This redwood here is directly opposite.
This red one here,

476
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,950
this acid group is directly
opposite that hydrogen,

477
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:31,720
and this has group directly opposite that
hydrogen, it's eclipse, right? And here.

478
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,660
This CO2 is directly above that CO2.

479
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,370
It's eclipsed right now you
need notation and, and uh,

480
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:43,470
and names to talk about these things.
And this,

481
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:48,370
the projection that was invented for
this purpose was invented by someone who

482
00:31:48,371 --> 00:31:52,390
sat in the seat that some of you
are sitting in, I don't know which,

483
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,250
maybe he's probably in the course of,

484
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,960
of his undergraduate years
and also is getting his phd,

485
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:01,300
probably sat in most of the seats
in here or many of them anyhow,

486
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:03,400
but his name was Melvin Newman.
You see,

487
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:08,401
he graduated from Yale in 29 he got his
phd in 32 and then he went to Ohio state

488
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:14,430
and he invented a way of
drawing confirmations on paper.

489
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,510
So there are two carbons in the,

490
00:32:17,511 --> 00:32:22,511
the convention is that for the Newman
projection that you sight down the carbon

491
00:32:22,661 --> 00:32:25,960
carbon bond.
So I'm going to show this,

492
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:29,530
the rotation around this central bond.
Okay.

493
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:34,770
So I look right along that bond and
there's one carbon in front and one carbon

494
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:39,350
behind and each of them has
three things on it. Okay.

495
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:44,560
So the one behind here has three hydrogens
and the one in front hides the one

496
00:32:45,471 --> 00:32:47,540
behind,
okay?

497
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:52,070
But it has three other groups on it to
everybody. See how he's doing this, that,

498
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:56,420
that shows this why it chose it
without the methyl groups here. Okay?

499
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:00,230
Any calls that staggered,
right?

500
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:05,510
But you could also have the be right
on top of one another like this,

501
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,960
right?
And that's called eclipsed.

502
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:13,520
And that's the way it was shown on the
previous slide by Paterno, by van Hoff,

503
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,540
and by the acs operative who
made the molecule of the week.

504
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,390
Okay.
Now that does,

505
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,380
that's not so convenient because
you can't see the stuff in back.

506
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:27,290
So sometimes people turn
it a little bit that way,

507
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,740
or sometimes they turn
it a little bit that way.

508
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,440
By which they don't mean
that it's not eclipsed,

509
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:38,300
they just mean I want to be able to
show both things right now that's very

510
00:33:38,301 --> 00:33:39,134
cumbersome.

511
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:45,160
And the reason you don't mind that it's
cumbersome is that things are never

512
00:33:45,261 --> 00:33:47,870
eclipsed.
They're always staggered.

513
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:52,460
So all those previous pictures were wrong,
including the molecule the week.

514
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:57,020
Because confirmations tend to
be staggered, not eclipsed.

515
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,890
Okay. But anyhow, you can
draw them in this way. Okay.

516
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:04,250
And that's just the conventional way of
drawing something that's eclipse because

517
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:09,200
it's, as you can see, it's not
truly a 100% eclipsed. Okay. Now,

518
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:11,480
when you have substituents
on those things,

519
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:15,590
you can give different names to different
phases of rotation. For example,

520
00:34:15,591 --> 00:34:18,170
they could be exactly opposite
one another like that,

521
00:34:18,171 --> 00:34:22,430
which if this were a double bond,
you would call trans or e.

522
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,070
Right?
But for a single bond,

523
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:30,200
you look at it with a Newman projection
like this, and it's called Auntie,

524
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:31,820
right?

525
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:36,820
Or you can have it rotated like
this and be what's called Gauche.

526
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,950
And I've never found out why
it's called Gauche. Right?

527
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,040
But notice something about that.
Is this,

528
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:51,100
is AMT chiral is that confirmation
chiral or is it super imposable on?

529
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:56,210
Is there a mirror? Right?
There's a mirror right here,

530
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:00,320
right. So it's its own mere
image. How about Gauche?

531
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:07,370
Is it chiral? Is there a mirror
here? There's a twofold access here.

532
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:08,810
If I rotate like this,

533
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,890
if I had you close your
eyes and did that rotation,

534
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,730
you couldn't tell whether with
whether I had rotated or not. Right?

535
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:17,720
It's like a propeller.

536
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:23,860
But if I take another one like this and
make the mirror image of this Gauche win

537
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:29,180
like this
here,

538
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,700
right? This is a mirror
image everybody see? Right?

539
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:39,330
But I can't superimpose them, right?
If I superimpose the back three,

540
00:35:39,331 --> 00:35:43,470
the front ones are not right.
So these are chiral.

541
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:48,660
So with respect to go, shh,
we have enantiomers right?

542
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:52,740
That one as well. And one of them we
call minus and the other we call plus.

543
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,313
Okay.

544
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,680
And now if you have the analog for
eclipsed is that you can have something

545
00:36:01,531 --> 00:36:03,040
that's fully eclipse,
right?

546
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:08,060
That where the special groups are right
on top of one another or it can be like

547
00:36:08,161 --> 00:36:11,100
that. Right? But again,

548
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,450
so and that can be one way or the
other. Again, it's twisted like,

549
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,780
like a propeller would be,
and these are again,

550
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:22,290
cumbersome things to draw
with Newman projection,

551
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:26,550
but you don't worry about there being
cumbersome because you don't have to draw

552
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:30,300
them usually because
they're not energy minima.

553
00:36:30,301 --> 00:36:34,890
They're not isomers. There are barriers
between going from one to another.

554
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,880
Okay. But again, those
would be minus and plus.

555
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:44,330
And if you want to be really pedantic
and meet in a committee of the pure of

556
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,510
pure and applied chemistry people,
the IUP AAC,

557
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,630
and decide precisely what you're
going to call different things,

558
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:56,100
then you get together and you scratch
your head and for different rotations of

559
00:36:56,101 --> 00:36:59,820
the thing in back with
respect to the thing in front,

560
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:05,130
you have these different pedantic names.
Sin Perry Planar is,

561
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:10,460
is is the one that we called fully eclipse
and you can have anticline UL and Sin

562
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,130
Clientele and sin,
Perry planar and plus and minus and so on.

563
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:18,960
But you never do that really, but it's
there if you need it. Okay, so there's,

564
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:20,400
there's,
there's a notation,

565
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:24,510
Newman projection and there's
a nomenclature which could
be sort of simple like

566
00:37:24,511 --> 00:37:28,680
on the previous slide or very complicated
like this that allows you to discuss

567
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:31,260
these things to draw and discuss them now,

568
00:37:31,261 --> 00:37:35,400
but here's the practical question
is the threefold barrier.

569
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:39,600
So if you have ethane like this,
right,

570
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,590
and you rotate this,
right,

571
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:47,580
the energy will go up and down.
If the,

572
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:50,370
the energies will be different
for different angles of rotation.

573
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,760
But obviously there's a
certain symmetry that this,

574
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:57,450
if it's all hydrogens will be the same
energy as this will be the same energy as

575
00:37:57,451 --> 00:38:01,920
this and for the eclipse this will be the
same as this will be the same as this.

576
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:07,300
Okay, so there's a three fold
barrier. Now the question is to,

577
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:09,600
there are two questions.
How big is the barrier?

578
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:14,250
So are we going to be able to have
isomers and what's the energy minimum?

579
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:20,040
Now let's just suppose together
with Vantiff and Paterno
and the person who made

580
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:23,040
the molecule of the week
that the lowest energy,

581
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,400
if we plot energy versus
phase of rotation here,

582
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,410
that the lowest energy is zero degrees.
That's fully eclipse like this. Okay,

583
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:37,010
that's zero degrees and now we'll start
turning it and the energy may go up when

584
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:41,470
we go to a staggered and then down
and then up, down, up, down. Right,

585
00:38:41,471 --> 00:38:44,530
and then you're back where you started
once you've gone through three 60 degrees

586
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:49,660
or is there a big barrier,
right? Is the barrier smaller,

587
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:54,250
big? Now, how can you tell?
Here's an interesting thing,

588
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:58,570
a way to tell,
right that if there is a big barrier,

589
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,240
then the things are going
to be quantized in it.

590
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:05,110
The energies are being quantized, but
the energy is, if the barrier is very,

591
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:06,070
very small,

592
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:11,310
then almost any energy you have is above
the barrier and so it's not quantized.

593
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:17,860
Remember when you get above a barrier,
you can have energy, any energy you want.

594
00:39:17,861 --> 00:39:21,310
It's only when the thing is
bonded on both sides, that the,

595
00:39:21,311 --> 00:39:25,720
that the wave function has to
come down and reach zero. Okay?

596
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,880
So if the barrier is big,

597
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:31,750
the energy will only be certain amounts.

598
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:35,140
But if the energy is very small,
you can have any energy you want.

599
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:39,940
And that you can tell that is
in fact how it was discovered,

600
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,150
how big the barrier for rotation was,

601
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:47,710
was by measuring something, having
to do with energy, with heat.

602
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,270
Okay. And here's a, so the question is,

603
00:39:52,271 --> 00:39:55,480
is the energy quantized
in this triple minimum?

604
00:39:55,810 --> 00:40:00,550
We've talked about double minimum. This
is actually a triple minimum. Okay.

605
00:40:00,551 --> 00:40:01,150
So you,

606
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:06,150
they measured in 1936 the
absorption of heat by ethane,

607
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:11,410
uh, going down to very, very low
temperature. This starts at a 150 Kelvin,

608
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:13,240
but I think they went further than that.

609
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:19,780
So there's a thing called entropy and
we'll talk about that in different terms a

610
00:40:19,781 --> 00:40:24,730
little bit in a, in a week or two
after vacation. Okay. Vacation.

611
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:30,040
Okay. So there's a thing
called heat capacity CP,

612
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:31,690
which is how much heat you absorb.

613
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:37,020
So entropy is defined by people who do
thermodynamics in this way that you sum

614
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:41,920
up or integrate starting from Zero Kelvin.
Remember Calvin,

615
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,560
all the way up to whatever
temperature you interested in,

616
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,040
you sum up how much
heat is being absorbed.

617
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,170
So CP times temperature,

618
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:54,550
that's how much heat is being absorbed
at each temperature as you go up,

619
00:40:54,551 --> 00:40:57,220
as you raise the temperature
more and more heat gets absorbed.

620
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:02,200
But you always divide it by the
temperature as you go up. So if you,

621
00:41:02,201 --> 00:41:04,720
if you absorb heat at
very low temperature,

622
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:08,680
that makes a much bigger difference
than absorbing the same heat at high

623
00:41:08,681 --> 00:41:11,440
temperature in this
quantity called entropy.

624
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,500
So don't worry about it except
by this definition for now,

625
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:18,070
and this is very technical and not so
very important to what we're doing.

626
00:41:18,071 --> 00:41:21,460
So don't get tied up in knots about it.
But anyhow,

627
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,910
if you have larger quantized spacings,

628
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,870
then less heat gets absorbed.
And I'll show you that on the next slide.

629
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:33,500
And the heat that gets absorbed gets
absorbed at a higher temperature,

630
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,610
right?

631
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:39,020
So both those factors mean
that the entropy at any
given temperature is going to

632
00:41:39,021 --> 00:41:44,021
be smaller because you've absorbed
less stuff in the numerator and you've

633
00:41:44,061 --> 00:41:47,720
absorbed at a higher temperature so you
have a bigger denominator for all these

634
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:52,370
contributions. Okay, so the
results in 1936 where this,

635
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:57,550
if you're interested in what the
entropy of ethane is at at 298 Kelvin,

636
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:03,030
it turns out experimentally, that's
what they did out at Berkeley. They,

637
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:08,040
they found it was 54.8 plus or minus 0.2
entropy units and then they calculated

638
00:42:09,441 --> 00:42:10,700
how that, how, how,

639
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:14,990
how high that would be for different
heights of this threefold barrier in the

640
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:16,610
quantum nation that's involved.

641
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:20,150
And what they saw was that
if the barrier were zero,

642
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:25,390
that number instead of 54.8 should be
56.4 if the barrier were 0.3 it should be

643
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:31,961
56.3 if the barrier is 3.1 it should be
54.6 which is within experimental error

644
00:42:35,421 --> 00:42:36,590
of the experiment,
right?

645
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:41,210
So that showed that the barrier was
about three kilocalories per mole.

646
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:46,070
So it wasn't totally free rotation,
it was just pretty fast.

647
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:51,310
So suppose the barrier had been four
kilocalories per mole instead of three.

648
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:53,960
Just suppose that were for how fast,

649
00:42:53,961 --> 00:42:56,150
what would the rate
constant B for the rotation.

650
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:00,920
So the barrier is four kilocalories
per mole that you have to get over.

651
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:02,960
How do I deal with that,
Sam?

652
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:08,720
It's this, there's a trick, right?

653
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:14,660
10 to the minus three quarters
centers, four is three.

654
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:16,180
Okay,
so it's going to be tender.

655
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:19,910
There's going to be a minus three up
in the numerator up in the exponent.

656
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,270
And what else is going to be an exponent?
Remember for a rate,

657
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:27,800
10 to the 13th so it's 10
to the 13th minus three.

658
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:33,170
So it's 10 to the 10
to the 10th per second.

659
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,000
So we'd take 10 to the minus
10 seconds for it to rotate.

660
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:43,430
That's pretty darn easy at room
temperature, right? Pretty easy,

661
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:48,500
but not perfectly free and enough to
make this difference in the entropy.

662
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,030
Now let me just see what time it is.
Okay, we have time to do this. Okay,

663
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:57,740
so we're now going to use that
big k equilibrium constant.

664
00:43:57,741 --> 00:44:02,741
So suppose we have something that has
this Roger say that has a barrier of such

665
00:44:05,181 --> 00:44:10,040
that the spacing between successive
levels is one kilocalories per mole.

666
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,100
Suppose it's a harmonic oscillator.
We already did that.

667
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:17,530
The lowest zero point level you had
to have that energy and then one kilo

668
00:44:17,531 --> 00:44:20,570
calorie above that one kilo
calorie one kilocalories.

669
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:23,690
Now what we're going to
do is see how much energy,

670
00:44:23,691 --> 00:44:27,860
extra energy above zero point
is there at equilibrium,

671
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,880
right? At any given temperature. So, uh,

672
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,250
so we have some stuff
that's at equilibrium.

673
00:44:35,251 --> 00:44:39,660
There's going to be stuff
that has no extra energy,
zero point, a certain amount,

674
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:45,350
but there'll be a certain amount that
has one kilocalories per mole that's in

675
00:44:45,511 --> 00:44:46,590
that first level.

676
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:51,090
Now how do I know how much is in
that first level at equilibrium?

677
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:56,580
How do I know the ratio of what's
in the top to what's in the bottom?

678
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:00,930
If the spacing is one kilocalories per
mole, is there a way of doing that?

679
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,310
You don't have to do the numbers,

680
00:45:02,311 --> 00:45:06,540
but tell me what formula you would
use to get the equilibrium constant.

681
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:10,410
Caitlin, do you remember, Sophie,

682
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,570
how do you get the Big k?
How does it relate to energy?

683
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,870
Anybody remember we already
did the hard one. Eric.

684
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:24,720
10 to the minus three fourths of one.
Okay. That's at room temperature.

685
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,030
It's different at other temperatures.
Okay,

686
00:45:27,031 --> 00:45:32,031
so so we know how much there's going to
be that what fraction of the stuff of

687
00:45:32,071 --> 00:45:35,460
the stuff that's here is going
to be one kilocalories up.

688
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:39,690
It's going to be 10 to the minus
three fourths right of of this.

689
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:43,230
So something like a 10th of it,
right?

690
00:45:43,231 --> 00:45:46,230
10 to the minus one would be a 10th okay.

691
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:50,970
And then there'll be stuff here and the
amount here relative to the amount here

692
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,850
that this is what we're
doing so that that ratio,

693
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,880
the ratio of zero to one is going to
be the same as the ratio of one to two

694
00:45:58,981 --> 00:46:03,981
because that one is one kilo calorie
above this one and the same for the third

695
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,810
to the second or the fourth to the third.

696
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:11,520
So then we can sum all these up there
knowing the ratios and figure out what

697
00:46:11,521 --> 00:46:16,230
percentage there is of each of these.
And it turns out that that tend to divide.

698
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:21,231
The three fourths is 5.6 so there's going
to be 5.6 times as much here as there

699
00:46:21,481 --> 00:46:25,380
is here.
5.6 times as much here as there is here.

700
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:29,250
5.6 times as much here as there is
here and if you translate that into

701
00:46:29,251 --> 00:46:34,251
percentages it will be that there's 81.9%
here and one over 5.6 14.8% there and

702
00:46:37,411 --> 00:46:42,411
two seven 2.7 0.5% and 0.1% but of course
this stuff added only what this 14%

703
00:46:45,961 --> 00:46:50,940
added only one kilocalories per mole.
This one added to this one added three,

704
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:55,680
this one added four so you sum all
those up and you get how much energy,

705
00:46:55,681 --> 00:47:00,060
how much heat was absorbed. This didn't
absorb anything. It's still in the lowest.

706
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,970
This absorbed a certain amount,

707
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:07,130
14.8 right 0.148 and then twice that
0.2 0.027 and so on so you can sum it up

708
00:47:10,921 --> 00:47:14,910
and see how much heat would have been
absorbed by the time you get out there.

709
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,510
Now if the spacing had
been very much smaller,

710
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,920
if the spacing had been
0.025 kilocalories per mole,

711
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,560
then we would have made the,
how much is there of this?

712
00:47:25,561 --> 00:47:26,760
That's at the lowest level.

713
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:31,910
How much has one unit 0.025 how
much has 0.0 5.075 and so on.

714
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:35,470
And we do exactly the same trick,

715
00:47:35,471 --> 00:47:40,471
although of course you need
to a spreadsheet to do this
with cause it's tedious,

716
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:41,590
right?

717
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:46,590
But you would get this and you think
you absorb more heat if you have smaller

718
00:47:46,691 --> 00:47:47,524
steps.

719
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:52,950
And now there's 4.2% here and 0.8%
at exactly one kilocalories per mole.

720
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,320
But you have a lot of others in here.

721
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,440
So 59% of the population is between,

722
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:04,470
is halfway out to the one and then a 33%
is more or less one and a 6.6% is like

723
00:48:08,321 --> 00:48:10,660
that and so on.
So anyhow,

724
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,580
you'll absorb more heat and you
absorb it at lower temperature too,

725
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:18,520
right?
So both those things build up the entropy.

726
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:22,140
So that one absorbs 364 kilocalories.
Mole,

727
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:25,000
more not kilo calories,
small calories,

728
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:27,700
364 more than the other one.

729
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:32,110
And that is what gives
that entropy difference.

730
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:33,281
Okay.

731
00:48:33,281 --> 00:48:38,080
So that's how people knew that there was
a barrier to rotation was by measuring

732
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:40,360
heat capacity.
Uh,

733
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:45,420
so we'll stop here and next time we'll
address the question of whether the,

734
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:49,540
now we know what the barrier is, but we
don't know what the low energy forum is,

735
00:48:49,541 --> 00:48:51,100
whether it's eclipse,
they're staggered.
