00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.690
(Julian)
There is officially only one thing cooler

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:03.710
than giant robots:

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.600
(Trace)
Microscopic robots.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.710
(Trace)
Hello decepticons, Trace and Julian here for

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.710
DNews.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.139
Medicine and robots go together like ice cream
and robots.

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.570
(Julian)
Everything is better with robots.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.900
(Trace)
Correct, but some robots are better than others.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.130
When it comes to the robots, we mostly talk
about ATLAS or Big Dog, but maybe you should

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.050
be thinking smaller -- like the size of a
red blood cell.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.050
(Julian)
Right!

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.119
Why not have tiny robots that you could ingest?

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.920
It’s not easy to achieve robots on the nanometer
scale just by miniaturizing the systems we

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.680
already have, known as the top-down approach.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.440
You know what they say, nanobottin' ain't
easy.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.000
The other method, which might be better, is
to build machines from the bottom-up atom-by-atom,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.649
small enough to swim through the bloodstream
to monitor our health, deliver drugs, and

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.859
perform surgeries as needed.

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.940
Obviously, we aren’t there yet, but we’re
making progress.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.980
(TRACE)
That’s right, scientists have made machines

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.149
that you can eat.

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.570
In early 2015 scientists from MIT devised
an origami robot, which is exactly what it

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.570
sounds like.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.710
It’s a robot that can fold itself into a
shape that lets it propel itself.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.850
(JULIAN)
Sure it’s much bigger than nanoscopic or

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.780
even microscopic, but because it’s foldable
it can be accordioned down to a size that

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.860
fits in a pill.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.000
The scientists who made it think it might
be useful for removing button batteries in

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.399
the stomach that were accidentally swallowed,
and look awfully cute doing it, though that’s

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:21.399
just my opinion.

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.360
It can’t control its own movement yet though,
it needs an operator applying a magnetic field

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.360
to swim14.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.000
(Trace)
Do people swallow that many button batteries?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
(Julian: yes.)

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.540
Not to be outdone, scientists from UC San
Diego tested tiny bots just 20 micrometers

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.680
in length that could actually propel themselves
through stomach acid.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.579
When fed to a mouse, these machines shot off
towards the stomach’s walls and imbedded

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.469
themselves in the lining, where they delivered
a drug.

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:47.000
It was the first instance of a nanobot being
used on a living animal.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.530
(Julian)
Another group of researchers from ETH Zurich

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.500
also came up with the idea of using external
magnets to solve the problem of locomotion

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.840
like the folks at MIT.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.119
They’ve invented robots so small 3 billion
of them could fit in a teaspoon.

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.420
(TRACE)
You actually won’t swallow these bots, though:

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.930
their creators imagine they’ll be more useful
if they’re injected into your eye, where

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.580
they would swim through the vitreous humor
and poke the blood vessels to break up blood

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.580
clots.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.510
(JULIAN)
But the goal is to get even smaller, totally

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.980
autonomous machines.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.480
To quote the late Nobel prize winning physicist
Richard Feynman, “It would be interesting,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.800
in surgery, if you could swallow the surgeon.”

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.540
That’s my Richard Feynman impression.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.940
(Trace)
With just a hint of Walken.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:27.940
WOW.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.040
Feynman proposed that in 1959 and is generally
credited with kick-starting this nanotechnology

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.040
movement.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.870
He laid out two challenges to the scientific
community.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.680
1) Shrink the information on the page of a
book down 25,000 times and 2) Create a motor

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.409
that was just 1/64th of a cubic inch.

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.580
The reward for completing either of those
challenges was a princely.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.160
Ten HUNDRED DOLLARS.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.830
(Julian)
Within a year someone claimed the prize for

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.360
challenge number two.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.629
Bill McLellan used watchmaking techniques,
toothpicks, and the patience of a saint to

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.020
build a tiny conventional electric motor.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.530
That was over 50 years ago, so why isn’t
my body filled with nanobots that will keep

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.300
me healthy and immortal?

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.180
Probably because Feynman, genius though he
was, didn’t make the size requirement small

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.180
enough.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.560
The motor is about the size of a grain of
salt, which is absolutely huge compared to

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.120
something like a red blood cell.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.300
(TRACE)
Feynman’s dream is alive and well and

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.500
in fact, even though his original challenges
were met, the Foresight Institute has offered

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.470
a $250,000 prize, named the Feynman Grand
Prize, to anyone who can build a nanoscale

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.020
robotic arm and computer.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.360
(JULIAN)
Since this nanofuture is being built at universities,

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.819
maybe the person to claim that new prize will
be you.

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.030
But could robots ever evolve on their own?

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.709
Could they even one day be indistinguishable
from us?

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.569
Seeker Stories took a look at that and met
a robot named Bina 48.

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:48.569
Check it out here.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.500
Well would you swallow a robot? No stop it.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.319
