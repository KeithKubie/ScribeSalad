00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.120
[Captions by Y Translator]
Today, we're going to see if we can
use focused sunlight to fire a bullet.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.900
Today, we're going to see if we can
use focused sunlight to fire a bullet.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:11.980
[Music]

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.660
This is a bullet.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.780
A 22 caliber bullet,
and this is our solar scorcher,

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.160
and today, we are going to see
if we can use the solar scorcher

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.000
to focus sunlight to fire the bullet.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.660
The idea here is pretty simple.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.240
We have a small metal plate
that we'll rest the bullet on,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.280
and focus the sunlight
by tipping our solar scorcher.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.380
We want to know if the sunlight will
be enough to get the bullet to fire.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.560
This plate doesn't
really hold the bullet much.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.840
It just keeps it from rolling, so that it
will end up exactly where we want to go.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.140
This cord is attached to the top of our
solar scorcher, and by pulling on it,

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.840
we can tip the solar scorcher until it's
focused right where we want it.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.520
The cord is going to be pulled
from about 50 feet away,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.920
inside the cover of a concrete dome,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.220
which is perpendicular to the path
of where the bullet is aimed.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.860
Even if the bullet managed to
shoot with the force of a gun

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.800
in our direction,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.620
we'll be behind a concrete
wall about a foot thick.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.820
We also have a couple
of pieces of foam core,

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.780
and we're just going to set those
up behind and in front of our bullet

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.460
to see if it happens to shoot straight
enough to pass right through.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.340
Now, because this plate isn't
holding the shell in place,

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.990
it is pretty likely that the shell
and bullet will shoot off in opposite

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.330
directions with approximately
equal power.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.680
Of course, all of that's assuming
that the sunlight is enough to

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.320
set it off in the first place,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.040
and I think it's time we do a test.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.299
First, we're going to remove the bullet
and put a small stick in its place.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.939
We'll test pulling the solar scorcher with a
rope, seeing if we can angle it just right

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.130
so that it starts burning that stick.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.159
That's going to be how we know
if we have enough heat on it

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.590
to try and light off the bullet.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.780
It certainly lights
that stick up pretty well.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.200
Now, let's try it with the bullet.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:52.100
[Music]

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.340
That's a fire.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.370
I don't know where the pieces
went, but, here's the bullet part.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.319
I don't know what that hit.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.840
Or like if it just popped apart.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.440
We're gonna have to watch the footage,
you know, even if it does that 50 times,

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.159
I'm not going to stand out here next to it,
because you never know,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.800
that one time might be bad.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.520
Oh, but there's an impact mark.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.600
Is that from the shell?

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.920
Maybe the bullet hit that and bounced?

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.440
Interesting.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.060
There's a slight impact mark.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.680
Doesn't even go through to the other
side, but something hit it.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.340
Interesting.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.060
The shell...

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.900
This board has nothing except, well,
it does have a couple of tiny spots,

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.740
but those might have already been there.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.960
I guess I didn't pay
enough attention to that.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.820
Let's check the footage, and see
if we can figure out what happened.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.060
No way to tell where it went.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.140
To me, it looked like both
pieces like that way, but...

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.180
Wait, can we see the bullet
land back on here?

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.540
Let's try this again.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:23.020
[Music]

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.859
Kinda surprised it
takes as long as it does.

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.049
This solar scorcher can actually
melt a bullet shell, so it's possible

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.559
I don't have it focused quite right.

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:32.200
Getting the height is really tricky.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.680
[Music]

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.680
There it goes.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.299
The last time, we had an impact.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.360
This time, we caught the bullet.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.880
Oh, that's great.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.100
So not a lot of force on that bullet,
if it can't even shoot its way through

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.900
a single piece of foam core.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.880
It dented the back, but it
didn't make it all the way through.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.200
Oh, there you go magicians.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.939
That's how you do a bullet catch.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.600
You just have the bullet not be in a gun,

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.240
set it off with the power of sunlight,

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.160
and catch it in a piece of foam core.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.600
Nothing could be easier.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.380
It did go pretty straight.

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.599
That was almost
exactly where it was aimed.

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:23.020
Of course, it also hit the foam core
sideways, so it was tumbling a bit.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.139
Lack of rifling will do
that, and I really just don't

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.600
know what happened to the shell.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.180
Didn't leave a mark, so it didn't
shoot off straight backwards,

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.960
unless it ran right into the wood.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.920
Oh, maybe it did.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.760
There's a little chip
in the wood right here.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.620
That's pretty in line with it.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.240
Oh, that is probably it.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.260
And that didn't just shoot
the bullet that, that is destroyed.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.920
Wow.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.140
So not being containing
a gun, that just exploded.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.260
That's cool.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.440
I'm going to move the foam core to
the other side of the wooden leg support.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:11.900
[Music]

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:12.980
That was quicker.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.319
Oh, we got a good focal point on it.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.139
Okay, we definitely caught
the shell with the board this time.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.680
In fact, I believe it shot right through.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.080
That's the most powerful impact
we've had with a piece of foam core so far.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.360
The bullet didn't make it through.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.139
This last shot...

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.330
I don't see any indication
of where the bullet hit.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.460
I think we just lost it.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.699
Maybe it went off sideways.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.460
I'm not sure, but the shell...

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.300
It looks like it launched
right through, and so I'm not

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.000
sure where it would have ended up.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.740
Probably didn't get too far given how
much power we've seen that these things

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.740
don't have before,
but, it exploded nicely.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.700
Setting off bullets with the power
of sunlight, definitely possible.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.080
But now, I do want to take it one step
further, and rather than just setting

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:03.760
the bullet on top of this metal tray,

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.660
I'm actually going to try
and grip the shell in the vise itself,

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.220
and see if we can get it to
shoot with the force of a bullet.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.980
[Music]

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.860
We've got a couple pieces
of veg tanned leather right here,

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.610
and we're just using those to help
grip the bullet shell more evenly,

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.200
so it's not just biting into the rim.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.480
[Music]

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.480
You can see the leather smoking.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.440
Random Fact: The average bullet
travels at 2,500 feet per second,

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.100
which is roughly twice
as fast as the speed of sound.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.580
[Music]

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.620
Yeah.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.780
Alright, we got the bullet to fire.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.199
The leather dropped out,
and the shell is not here.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.980
I was hoping it would end up with just
a shell being held in the vise.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.620
Maybe we try squeezing a little bit harder.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.560
As for the bullet, let's see.
Did we hit our...

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.980
I don't see any indication
of a bullet mark on our board here.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.819
So, I'm gonna assume we missed.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:10.900
Oh, there's one little chip.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.180
That might be from a bullet,
that might have just been a scratch.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.180
I'm not sure.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:19.980
[Music]

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:24.240
It's also possible the shell is
exploding. When the shell explodes,

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.360
doesn't really matter how well it's being
held, 'cause there's not much shell left.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.080
[Music]

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:32.720
Bam!

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.060
[Music]

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.400
Fires quick when it's properly focused.

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:39.419
Mmm.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.200
It smells like burning leather, delightful.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.780
Still no indication of a bullet impact,

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:49.780
and once again, the leather
was blown clear, and we have no shell.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.320
Let's try again, and squeeze
it down even tighter.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:08:03.700
[Music]

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:04.820
Bam!

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:10.840
[Music]

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.720
Alright, even with all that,
we still lost our shell...

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:20.580
[Music]

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.700
And...

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.120
I'm not seeing much
in the way of an impact spot.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:32.400
[Music]

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.360
Like not so much as a dent really.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:42.640
[Music]

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.700
Sunlight and bullets.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.339
Can you use concentrated
sunlight to fire off a bullet?

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.280
Turns out, yes, you can.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.540
It fires just sitting in a tray,
it fires held in the vise.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.510
We did not get any results that indicate
that you can get a bullet to go

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:57.279
where you want it by using sunlight.

00:08:57.279 --> 00:09:00.630
We could probably build a nice
little complicated mechanism that holds

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.010
the shell on almost all sides,
but just lets in enough sunlight to

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:07.330
set it off, and maybe then we could
get it to shoot a nice straight line.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.660
But overall, I would say this is
a terribly impractical

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:11.660
way to shoot bullets.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:16.300
The sun moves, or more accurately,
we move in reference to the Sun,

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:20.780
and that makes it so you have to realign your
solar scorcher, your magnifying lens.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.760
Like every couple of minutes,
we were just having to move and adjust,

00:09:23.769 --> 00:09:26.730
and move the solar scorcher,
move the vise, move the bullets

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:27.730
back and forth.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.130
So it can work.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:30.510
I don't recommend it.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.040
In fact, this is not really
a super safe activity,

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.880
so there's no reason to do this anyway.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.920
But we just wanted to know
if it was possible, and it is.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.720
The solar scorcher does get hot
enough to ignite the gunpowder

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.060
within the shell, and fire off a bullet.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.540
Although, like we saw,
not with much force.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.060
It almost managed to pierce
a piece of foam core,

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.160
which pretty sure most
people could punch through.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.900
So it does fire, just not with as much
power as you might be interested in.

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.800
