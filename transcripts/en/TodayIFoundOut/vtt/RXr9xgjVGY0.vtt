00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:14.190
“I’ll eat my hat” is an utterance commonly
used when a person is absolutely certain that

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.110
something will not happen.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.130
But where did this unusual phrase first originate
and have there ever been any recorded instances

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.000
of people actually eating their hats after
being proven wrong?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.540
According to the venerable Oxford English
Dictionary, the earliest known example of

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.500
the phrase comes from the 1762 book Homer
Travestie, by Thomas Bridges.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.550
The book is a parody of the more famous Iliad
and contains a line that reads:

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.620
For though we tumble down the wall, And fire
their rotten boats and all, I’ll eat my

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.320
hat, if Jove don’t drop us, Or play some
queer rogue’s trick to stop us.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.960
While this is the first known example of the
phrase “I’ll eat my hat” as we’d understand

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.920
its meaning today, Bridges isn’t believed
to have coined the phrase as much as he streamlined

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.050
a now defunct utterance “I’ll eat Old
Rowley’s hat” that had essentially the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.050
same meaning.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.990
As for who “Old Rowley” was, this may
be referring to King Charles II who was called

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.310
such owing to his reputation with women combined
with the fact that “Old Rowley”

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.420
was the nickname of one of the King’s prized
stallions.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.450
This is referenced, among other places, about
a century after Charles II’s death in The

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.180
Biographical History of England (1775):

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.670
In some of the State Poems, Charles II, is
ridiculed under the nick-name of Old Rowley,

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.540
which was an ill-favoured stallion kept in
the Mews, that was remarkable for getting

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.940
fine colts – Mrs. Holford, a young lady
much admired by Charles was sitting in her

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.310
apartment, and singing a satirical ballad
upon “Old Rowley the King,” when he knocked

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.360
at her door.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.630
Upon her asking who was there? he with his
usual good humour replied, “Old Rowley himself,

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.630
madam.”

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.770
As for why the saying specifically mentioned
the king’s hat instead of, say, his shoes

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.620
or his underwear, this is speculated to be
due to the king’s fondness for fabulously

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.689
flamboyant hats which would be exceptionally
difficult, if not impossible, for a person

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:57.689
to eat.

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.909
(Incidentally, a similar foppish fashion trend
in the form of giant “macaroni” wigs is

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.409
also why Yankee Doodle stuck a feather in
his cap and called it “macaroni”.)

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.440
“I’ll eat my hat” gained widespread
acceptance about three-quarters of a century

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.950
later thanks to the 1837 novel written by
Charles Dickens, The Pickwick Papers, in which

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.410
we have the line: “If I knew as little of
life as that, I’d eat my hat and swallow

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.030
the buckle whole.”

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.170
This is uttered by a satellite character to
mock the main character who is contemplating

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.660
out loud about breaking a deal to avoid moving
into a sub-par house.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.690
Given how long this expression has been around,
this may leave you wondering if anyone has

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.830
ever actually literally eaten their hat owing
to uttering the expression and subsequently

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.230
being proven wrong.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.849
The answer is yes.

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.600
In fact, in the last few years alone there
are several documented instances of this occurring.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.620
For example, in 2014 a user on Reddit predicted
that the value of one Bitcoin would never

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.710
again fall below $1000, adding that they’d
eat their hat if it ever did.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.080
When the value of the currency did fall below
that mark, the user, amusingly identified

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.050
as “Hat Eater”, uploaded a video of themselves
eating an entire cotton beanie on a sandwich.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.050
This is in keeping with the culture of Reddit
which particularly praises individuals who

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.400
follow through on such ridiculous boasts,
a more extreme example of which can be found

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.540
in the form of the guy who filmed himself
eating a bull penis after boasting that he’d

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.980
“eat a dick” if his post was liked enough…

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.360
(And if you’re curious, see: Why is “Dick”
Short for “Richard”?)

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.769
Then you have an Atlanta Falcons fan who filmed
himself eating one of his team’s hats after

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.319
declaring that the Falcons wouldn’t lose
to the Panthers in 2015, and if they did,

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.590
he’d eat his hat.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.830
When they did lose, true to his word, he ate
the hat with a Wendy’s chicken sandwich.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.319
Next up we have British politician Lord Paddy
Ashdown who publicly declared that he’d

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.080
eat his own hat if the exit polls for a British
election were correct.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.190
When they were, Ashdown got out of the whole
thing while appearing to keep his word by

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.659
eating a chocolate cake shaped like a hat
during an interview.

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:02.340
During the same interview, another MP who’d
made a similar claim, only this time promising

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.870
to eat his kilt, ate a cake shaped like a
kilt- in both cases in true political form

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.670
the individuals actually broke their word
but attempted to make it appear as if they

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.330
did not.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.889
Another example of following through on the
promise of eating a clothing item, though

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:22.479
this time not a hat, is that time famed director
Werner Herzog claimed that if Errol Morris

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.979
ever finished the film Heaven’s Gate (a
now legendary box office bomb) he’d eat

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:27.979
his shoes.

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.270
Herzog, true to his word, ate his shoes after
hiring a professional chef to prepare them

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.560
with garlic and various herbs at the premier
of the film.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:05:13.999
You can see footage of this in the aptly titled
documentary, Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe.
