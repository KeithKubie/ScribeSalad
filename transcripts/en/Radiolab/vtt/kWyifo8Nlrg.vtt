1
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.270
Okay. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.750
This is Radiolab and today we're going to tell you is an old story.

3
00:00:06.751 --> 00:00:08.370
It's about 70 years old,

4
00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:12.930
but it's not really as old as that at all because you will notice

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.840
that it hasn't ended and it comes to us from reporter Karen Duffin. Yeah. Okay.

6
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.360
All right. So where to start? I mean, do you have a sense of where to start?

7
00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:22.690
I feel like I could blame. Well,

8
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.220
I can blame this on my dad and that's the house I grew up in. Just so you know.

9
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.610
Oh, right. Well that was my, my bedroom window.

10
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.760
This is Karen and her dad looking at pictures of his childhood home.

11
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.570
He grew up in this tiny town in Idaho called Aberdeen at all Aberdeen.

12
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:38.330
I forgot how much on a potato farm.

13
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.290
He loves to talk about the farm like he thinks we saw live on a farm,

14
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.350
the garden. That's pretty cool.

15
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.560
So we were talking one day left the records and he mentions very casually as if

16
00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:52.200
it's like something we all know. He says, yeah.

17
00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:56.460
Back when we had Nazi prisoners of war working on our farm and I was like,

18
00:00:56.461 --> 00:01:00.300
timeout. What? Really? That's what he said. It was just parents theoretical.

19
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.390
Yeah, it was totally like, yeah, we're picking potatoes and then yeah,

20
00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:07.710
the Nazi prisoners of war were helping us sorta remember how old I was just by

21
00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:10.560
how tall the guards were. They were very tall.

22
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.710
He was only three or four at the time. Very, very tall.

23
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.630
Do you know if there were like dozens of prisoners or just like a handful? Oh,

24
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:21.320
there was a bunch I saying I didn't even know there were prisoners of war Nazi

25
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.700
preventive war in America ever. Yeah, me neither. Oh, okay. Yeah.

26
00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:26.910
So that was the, so after I talked to my dad,

27
00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:29.640
I ended up calling this historian Kathy Kirkpatrick,

28
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.310
cause I wanted to know was this just an Aberdeen thing? No.

29
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.970
Like you were talking about Idaho.

30
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.930
She told me in Idaho alone this branch camps in Aberdeen and Blackfoot and

31
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.870
Emmett and Holly Lane, Idaho Falls, there were 23 different camps.

32
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.400
Generally you had prisoners that were in churches, tent cities and Paul Rodeo,

33
00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:53.910
ground dormitories, high school gyms, sugar city,

34
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.130
and this was the case all across the country.

35
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.870
The only state that did not have prisoners of war was Vermont.

36
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.760
Wow. At the maximum we had over 371,000 Germans,

37
00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:09.690
51,000 Italians in 5,000 Japanese,

38
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.030
almost half a million people. Oh my God. Nobody know this.

39
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.750
I don't even remember. It doesn't even like strike a little cord. That may be,

40
00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:23.160
I once learned about it in junior high school. No, this was not talked about.

41
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.270
We just don't talk about it. We just don't. I think we don't,

42
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.913
I don't know,

43
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.210
but today we are going to talk about it but not just because it's a cool

44
00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:36.750
historical thing but because it raises a question. Breaking news,

45
00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:41.010
this nuna stunning report looking into how the CIA interrogated detainees,

46
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.100
the question that on top secret interrogation with torture reports or even

47
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.630
suggested treatment and Abu Ghraib, Regan views by American soldiers,

48
00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:54.510
Guantanamo Bay that we are still trying to answer today,

49
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.350
which is you know when you capture an enemy soldier taken out of the battle,

50
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.090
out of the fight, how should you treat that person?

51
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.920
And if both sides have agreed to follow certain rules and one side doesn't,

52
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.133
what do you do?

53
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.890
And interesting thing is that 70 years ago this question was playing out in this

54
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.160
really dramatic way. In all of these towns across America,

55
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.040
there were about 200 base camps that were huge.

56
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:20.920
They were like up to 8,000 people. And by the way,

57
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:24.820
that's like 70 times the size of Guantanamo Bay currently.

58
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.460
In any case, as she was researching,

59
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:29.890
Karen started to zoom into one camp in particular.

60
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.710
So this is really illustrative of what happened.

61
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.290
There's this one camp in Aliceville, Alabama.

62
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.180
It's this tiny town of like 1500 people,

63
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.800
but the camp has 6,000 people. Wow. It's like four times the size of the town.

64
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.280
Yeah. So I went and interviewed a bunch of people, guards, prisoners,

65
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.000
locals from Aliceville and it was quite a day.

66
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.410
That's Thomas Sweet.

67
00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:57.100
He worked in Aliceville and he told me that the day that the prisoners came

68
00:03:57.101 --> 00:03:59.980
through, a thousand of them came at first and the police were like,

69
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:01.480
nobody is allowed on the street.

70
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.800
But of course when word got out that the first train blowed was coming,

71
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.340
<v 1>everybody rushed out on the street that day. The train come in,</v>

72
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.660
there wasn't supposed to be any challenge people. But uh, of course there was,

73
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.970
everybody was sad. The road was laying with his from three years old up there,

74
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.860
people 70 years old.

75
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.300
<v 0>So these voices are from an oral history project that was recorded in 1994 about</v>

76
00:04:27.301 --> 00:04:28.560
the prison camp in Aliceville.

77
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.250
So the climb the lumber pile so that we could see them when they got off the

78
00:04:33.251 --> 00:04:35.530
train. So everybody's super nervous

79
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.420
because they have these images in their head. In my mind,

80
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.840
<v 1>just like a lot of people now, it's real.</v>

81
00:04:42.841 --> 00:04:45.390
They didn't know what kind of devils where we was going to get off of that

82
00:04:45.391 --> 00:04:48.270
train. You guys with Horn boiler head.

83
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.930
<v 0>So these prisoners that were sent to Aliceville were actually part of Rommel's</v>

84
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.270
Africa corps and these guys were the most feared of Hitler's

85
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.630
<v 1>fighters. There were supposed to be the elite.</v>

86
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.320
<v 0>He told Nazi Superman then Nazi superman. Right? So the train pulls up,</v>

87
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.170
<v 1>they stopped right on the main highway,</v>

88
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:08.403
<v 0>doors open,</v>

89
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.150
and then hundreds and hundreds of German soldiers get out and they were marching

90
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.380
with that German march and they're singing their military songs at German.

91
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.760
Tell us about what it was like when,

92
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.450
what she thought when they got off the train, the train.

93
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.950
What did they look like? Do they have on uniform? Oh yes.

94
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.890
So when you listened to the oral histories,

95
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.610
it's really clear that this was a really complicated moment for the people in

96
00:05:40.611 --> 00:05:43.700
Aliceville at Vaco. The allies for were scared today.

97
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.970
<v 1>I didn't know what I was going to be mad at them when they first come in and or</v>

98
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.830
what. But when I actually knew we just a bunch of quip kids sham with

99
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.820
<v 0>a feeling of uh,</v>

100
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.910
a concern for in our hearts, for them all. I see them.

101
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:00.770
There was nothing but a bunch of young kids.

102
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.400
How young they will haggard looking,

103
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.430
washed up and meet remanded and some of they maggots.

104
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.830
Oh, just grapes. You could tell they'd been through a rough time. Uh, it was,

105
00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:17.220
it was hopeful for us. That sounds cool. Para,

106
00:06:17.221 --> 00:06:19.950
he was one of the prisoners stepping out of the train that day.

107
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.850
He'd been drafted into the army against his well captured in North Africa.

108
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.590
And then he was sent to America in the bottom of this big cargo ship on the new

109
00:06:28.591 --> 00:06:32.340
one room, the crowded 700 people.

110
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.670
You couldn't even sit. There was no toilet.

111
00:06:35.671 --> 00:06:40.671
Of course she had only 13 of boxes over with full soaked with urine.

112
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.470
It was helpful. Was a low food trip. Yeah.

113
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.920
And you kind of had to feel sorry for them. But on that other hand,

114
00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:50.960
and you hear this too, in the oral histories,

115
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.050
the people in Alice filler thinking, these are Nazis.

116
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.630
These are the men who are killing our son. Well, you know,

117
00:06:56.631 --> 00:06:59.960
I had three brothers I would say is at the same time,

118
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.790
so we didn't like them. That's just the way we felt.

119
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.180
Okay, so there's that question in people's mind,

120
00:07:08.181 --> 00:07:12.710
and this is playing out all across the country. Here's the enemy at your mercy.

121
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.730
What do you do? How do you treat them? They're in your hands. Nobody's watching.

122
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.010
You can do whatever you want with them at that point in theory. But in practice,

123
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.940
we'll actually, this was a significant moment for the world.

124
00:07:25.941 --> 00:07:30.080
I mean 14 years before a bunch of countries had gotten together and they'd made

125
00:07:30.081 --> 00:07:32.370
up rules for exactly this kind of moment.

126
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.540
<v 2>In 1929 at Geneva,</v>

127
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.710
long before Hitler and his partners began to eye the real estate of the world.

128
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.360
That was an international conference here,

129
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.220
a nation solemnly promise to uphold the rules covering the treatment of

130
00:07:45.221 --> 00:07:46.180
prisoners of war.

131
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.360
<v 0>Oh, it was a series of do's and don'ts.</v>

132
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:54.550
That's a story in Arnold Kramer. He's a professor at Texas A. And. M.

133
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.450
Some of the rules he says are pretty basic that women and children should be

134
00:07:58.451 --> 00:08:00.900
protected. So you had to give prisoners a certain amount of

135
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.790
<v 2>food and alerts are entitled to the same quality rations,</v>

136
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.460
loving and living quarters as aren't afforded our own truck.

137
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.690
<v 0>And then there's rules about medical attention, labor. Well,</v>

138
00:08:09.691 --> 00:08:13.470
did you need a convention? Says yes, you can use people for Labor.

139
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.490
Cathy Kirkpatrick. Again, you also should be paying people for Labor. Okay,

140
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.340
the rate of payment was 80 cents a day.

141
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.900
So the Geneva Conventions are this attempt to kind of civilize the most

142
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:27.520
uncivilized thing, which is war. You'll see the f,

143
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:30.220
the first world war was so horrific.

144
00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.280
Hundreds of thousands of prisoners died in POW camp.

145
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:36.370
There were no real regulations with regard to prisoners.

146
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:38.200
Sides did almost anything they wanted.

147
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.700
So the Geneva Conventions of 1929 was an attempt to kind of set things right,

148
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.880
because people just couldn't fathom another war to end wars.

149
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:53.040
We were well trained in the Geneva Convention. That's Thomas Sweet. Again,

150
00:08:53.041 --> 00:08:57.870
he was actually one of the guards at camp and what he said is that even before

151
00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:01.470
the POW is arrived at the Geneva Conventions were drilled into their heads.

152
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.550
They had lectures,

153
00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:06.750
the rules were posted in the rec hall and in the officers' club where you had

154
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:11.460
to, the prisoners had to be treated the same, uh, as you would,

155
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.750
uh, your own fail or soldiers, which sounds kind of basic,

156
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.800
but for somebody like Hahn's who stepping off this train and wondering how is he

157
00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:24.270
going to be treated? It was, I should say it was

158
00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:28.800
assault of a heaven.

159
00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:32.130
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

160
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:35.550
<v 0>when I got into the, the badge at all been laid out,</v>

161
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.430
that fresh clean,

162
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:43.480
they had a towels and shape and equipment for each one on each, uh,

163
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:44.790
each one's bonk.

164
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.620
<v 3>Prisoners washed up and then the guards opened up the cafeteria.</v>

165
00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.810
Then we got to eat good things.

166
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.870
This is Walter Fel tilter he was another prisoner at Ellisville.

167
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.220
We got the piece of white bread,

168
00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:01.980
you American white bread and we got peanut butter. I didn't know about it,

169
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:06.960
what peanut was and it chased it one for one level.

170
00:10:06.961 --> 00:10:11.740
It was the best one I ever had. And I always been,

171
00:10:11.741 --> 00:10:14.730
I think on the which times, and I think on peanut butter.

172
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.890
<v 0>Yeah. And here's the funny thing. As you look into this,</v>

173
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:23.490
you start to realize that we're not just following the Geneva Conventions,

174
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:28.290
the letter of the law. We're going above and beyond. And according to Hahns,

175
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.840
what started out as a great thing,

176
00:10:30.841 --> 00:10:33.720
getting all this food ended up to be kind of a problem.

177
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.420
The voice came to me every day.

178
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:41.770
Please tell them we don't want to have so much hem and the sash.

179
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:44.130
And came to me who heard that and said,

180
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:48.930
don't tell the captain that you're going to throw it away. No, no, no, no, no.

181
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:53.280
Take teeth and make a hole in the sand and put it in the sand.

182
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:58.370
So they buried the hand and a lot of it varied.

183
00:10:59.161 --> 00:11:02.440
A lot of the hem because we didn't know what to do with it. Wow.

184
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.320
And they also didn't like corn,

185
00:11:04.321 --> 00:11:07.650
but they kept [inaudible] getting corn and so they buried corn and then they get

186
00:11:07.651 --> 00:11:12.380
caught because corn starts growing. [inaudible].

187
00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.500
Everyone's like, wait a minute, there's bad corn hiding.

188
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:17.543
<v 4>Okay.</v>

189
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.540
<v 0>Within two months they have an orchestra.</v>

190
00:11:21.541 --> 00:11:26.460
Within a year they have three orchestras. This is a pow led orchestras.

191
00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:30.150
Yes, yes. And they're being given instruments. They're making instruments.

192
00:11:30.151 --> 00:11:32.610
The locals are donating instruments, the YMCAs,

193
00:11:32.611 --> 00:11:35.070
giving them instruments before through the mud,

194
00:11:35.071 --> 00:11:38.000
young and [inaudible] in the field. They opened a school,

195
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.040
<v 4>Hey, hold on, wait, wait, hold on baby.</v>

196
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:44.770
<v 0>You can learn anything from pottery to like mathematics,</v>

197
00:11:44.771 --> 00:11:46.400
almost any language you want to learn.

198
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:49.970
<v 4>So,</v>

199
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:52.820
<v 0>and they set up correspondence programs with the local universities.</v>

200
00:11:52.821 --> 00:11:55.150
You could credit, they had soccer again,

201
00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.680
just about every day they drew big crowds. They had a newspaper.

202
00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:04.660
Their newspaper was called the fence to guest and it had like poetry fist. Yes,

203
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.860
you're right. They,

204
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.520
they also did a lot of theatrical productions and sometimes there were regular

205
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.880
art shows. So this is where things get a little bit strange.

206
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.900
On December 18th there was another art exhibition.

207
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:21.190
This is a woman named Ellen Vander's whose father was a pow at the camp.

208
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.380
And here she's reading from his diary

209
00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:25.700
<v 5>12 [inaudible].</v>

210
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:30.770
That means Hitler had sent $12,572 to open the art exhibition in

211
00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:36.690
Camp V. Okay.

212
00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:41.340
<v 0>Wait, she's saying that wait, Hitler sent money to the camp for an art thing.</v>

213
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:43.240
<v 5>Yup. Wow.</v>

214
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.120
<v 0>The dirt while we're fighting it. Are He sending money? Yeah.</v>

215
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:51.790
While we're fighting Hitler, while we're fighting Hitler. That's really strange.

216
00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.860
<v 4>It's fun. I go on the</v>

217
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.360
[inaudible]. Oh yeah.

218
00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:10.260
<v 0>Coming up the fence. Guests are on fence, be buried.</v>

219
00:13:10.261 --> 00:13:12.480
Amazon buried and the Nazis next door began.

220
00:13:12.481 --> 00:13:14.600
An argument that we are still having

221
00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:19.030
<v 4>to this day show</v>

222

Yay. I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and uh,

249
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:12.080
get back to our story. Here's Karen Duffin. Um, okay. So, so, okay.

250
00:15:12.081 --> 00:15:17.081
With Hitler's a Christmas gift to the art show and the ham and the bands and all

251
00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:19.040
that stuff, did people in the,

252
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.880
in the outside the camp know what was going on inside? You know,

253
00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:23.450
and once they start,

254
00:15:23.451 --> 00:15:28.451
so I think it was in 1943 was the point at which we started realizing we're

255
00:15:29.241 --> 00:15:33.650
running out of American men to do labor and we look around and we're like,

256
00:15:33.651 --> 00:15:37.850
well actually we have quite a few men who might be able to do some work here.

257
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:39.540
Love them. Prisoners worked uh,

258
00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:43.070
on farms down there picking cotton peanuts.

259
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:46.610
So some of the farmers would bring them in the house for lunch,

260
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.590
they would drink with them, they were drunk. They,

261
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:53.420
there's some really funny stories of like, I was probably moonshine.

262
00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:56.450
The prisoners getting drunk with the farmers and then they get in trouble cause

263
00:15:56.451 --> 00:15:57.530
they come home late.

264
00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.950
One of the biggest things that the word apartments says when they start sending

265
00:16:00.951 --> 00:16:04.200
the men out is like if you, if you make friends with these ws,

266
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:07.100
it's against the rules, but they do it all the time.

267
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:12.000
Anybody Fall in love with anybody? Oh yeah. [inaudible]

268
00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.410
I mean not a lot, but it definitely happened.

269
00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.580
So as these prisoners are out in the community and they're forming friendships,

270
00:16:18.581 --> 00:16:20.050
few of them are falling in love.

271
00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:24.490
Where it starts to get out about how they're being treated. And meanwhile,

272
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:28.600
across America there's rationing and so when they learn that the pure W's are

273
00:16:28.601 --> 00:16:32.050
getting food that they might not be getting a lot of the American public,

274
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:33.790
they get pissed.

275
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.210
<v 7>No, the other [inaudible],</v>

276
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:40.090
<v 0>especially this radio guy, Walter Winchell who sort of made this his cause,</v>

277
00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:44.730
they call him the rush Limbaugh of World War II. Was He that well known one?

278
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.510
Walter Winchell was one of the most famous reporters in America.

279
00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.960
He spoke like that telegram, Waukegan,

280
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:54.890
[inaudible]. He spoke in this funny nasal voice. Oh, we got,

281
00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:59.020
that's exactly what it sounds like. Our radio dispatch from Prague. In any case,

282
00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.330
when he finds out about the Nazi POW program,

283
00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:03.000
Walter Winchell just starts to rant.

284
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.950
<v 7>The United States army caters to the Nazis as no, they were king.</v>

285
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.710
They get more food than our soldiers get.

286
00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:15.220
Pony radio luxuries and all sorts of leniency beyond imagination.

287
00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.280
<v 0>And he would do this week after week,</v>

288
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:19.630
<v 7>wait, Kako is over here.</v>

289
00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.580
We'll pay of any Nazis to catch up and fucking up on stage.

290
00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.760
[inaudible] bacon or chicken lit up.

291
00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:28.280
<v 0>People start writing articles in the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune,</v>

292
00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:31.520
the Boston Globe, it's citizens start flooding the war department with letters.

293
00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:36.000
<v 7>I know, sir, that y'all YMC a wall, prisoners aid does all it can,</v>

294
00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.280
can make Nazi war prisoners all the head comment about.

295
00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:41.980
<v 0>And in the meantime, according to Thomas Sweet inside the camp,</v>

296
00:17:41.981 --> 00:17:46.290
some of these prisoners are starting to get kind of bold for a couple of nights.

297
00:17:46.291 --> 00:17:50.100
I cut out swat stickers and took

298
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.840
<v 8>a kite and uh,</v>

299
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:56.220
we're flying the kite and had dishwash stickers in a box underneath the kite

300
00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.540
with a string that down to the ground. And uh,

301
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.570
they handed the Strang to one of the, one of the guards and said,

302
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.090
pull this string. And when I pulled the string,

303
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:13.580
<v 2>the trap door open on the gadget they had made and all these swastika started</v>

304
00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:19.050
falling all over, all over the camp. And in Aliceville too, in the towns,

305
00:18:19.051 --> 00:18:23.280
people started calling the base mad about that,

306
00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:27.490
<v 0>add to that we don't have enough men to guard a lot of these camps. So,</v>

307
00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:31.150
so the prisoners are starting to get more and more control of the camp grows.

308
00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:35.210
Moose had the, Ron was a camp and in some cases the Nazi hardliners would,

309
00:18:35.211 --> 00:18:38.650
would start to torment the non Nazis. They would threaten them,

310
00:18:38.651 --> 00:18:39.730
they might beat them up.

311
00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:44.710
There were even a couple of murders who was not a Nazi in side of these camps.

312
00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:49.690
Um, if you had been drafted but you didn't, you weren't idle ideologically.

313
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:50.290
I see.

314
00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:54.520
So the perception that's coming out of these camps is that we've created these

315
00:18:54.521 --> 00:18:56.650
hotels on American soil. We're Nazis.

316
00:18:56.651 --> 00:19:01.150
Kids start radicalizing and people get so mad that there's actually a

317
00:19:01.151 --> 00:19:04.690
congressional investigation into the coddling of prisoners of war.

318
00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:10.570
So I spent a lot of time at the national archives trying to get to like,

319
00:19:10.571 --> 00:19:13.450
all right, what are the arguments? And here's kind of how it went.

320
00:19:13.451 --> 00:19:16.300
You have this congressman on one side, Richard heartless,

321
00:19:16.301 --> 00:19:17.710
and he's saying you're coddling them.

322
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.210
<v 7>Congressman Holler from Arizona called the Nazi prisoners in the United States.</v>

323
00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:22.503
Hi Brett.

324
00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:26.650
<v 0>And on the other side you have the guy who's now running the prisoner of war</v>

325
00:19:26.651 --> 00:19:29.410
program, archer alert. And he's basically saying, no,

326
00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.000
<v 7>not all them.</v>

327
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.040
<v 0>He says, we're just following the Geneva Conventions.</v>

328
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.730
And the reason that he gave was the same reason that Joe Biden would give almost

329
00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:38.930
60 years later.

330
00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:44.140
<v 2>And there's a reason why we signed these treaties to protect my son in the</v>

331
00:19:44.291 --> 00:19:48.220
military. We are torture them. They'll touch your up reciprocity.

332
00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.800
That's why we have these treaties.

333
00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:53.890
So when Americans are captured,

334
00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:59.220
they are not tortured. That's the reason case.

335
00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:01.750
Anybody forgets it. That the reason,

336
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:03.750
<v 0>one problem though,</v>

337
00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:08.310
just one month after that hearing in 1944

338
00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:11.290
<v 9>on, um, the defense of American prisoners battle,</v>

339
00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.650
the machine guns of our enemies

340
00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:15.910
<v 0>news breaks that 84 American soldiers,</v>

341
00:20:15.911 --> 00:20:20.020
prisoners of war now in Germany are gunned down after they surrendered.

342
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:21.110
<v 9>Well, a week later,</v>

343
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:25.300
they're frozen body and the mango found found where they fell.

344
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:29.740
<v 0>We then go on to liberate American soldiers from POW camps in Germany and we</v>

345
00:20:29.741 --> 00:20:34.110
find misery. Nothing like Ellisville American

346
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:37.680
<v 2>prisoners of war report in human hospital conditions.</v>

347
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.860
<v 0>Walter windchill gets back on the airwaves, right?</v>

348
00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:41.680
<v 7>The premise of the United States,</v>

349
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:45.370
<v 0>you said, look, reciprocity hasn't worked. Our generosity.</v>

350
00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.010
<v 7>I have not been reciprocated. And olive oils</v>

351
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.890
<v 2>were not treated the same. There's nothing wrong.</v>

352
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:55.460
I believe protected as much by [inaudible]. And by the one side of the room,

353
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:59.370
<v 0>a few months later, things get even worse.</v>

354
00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:03.780
<v 2>It was impossible to fully realize the horror of the Nazi concentration gaps.</v>

355
00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.880
We started going into concentration camps.

356
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:10.610
Incredible truth that man had indeed some below the level of animal [inaudible],

357
00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.290
the pretty lean started seeing what the Germans had done,

358
00:21:13.291 --> 00:21:17.130
what the Nazis have done. Both kinds of dead bodies were piled everywhere.

359
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.680
Most never having received the dignity of burial.

360
00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:23.370
But what was even more frightening were the living dead left behind.

361
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:39.423
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

362
00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:50.120
<v 0>so congress decides to hold a second investigation into the treatment of</v>

363
00:21:50.121 --> 00:21:54.380
prisoners. But this time it's real soul searching. I mean,

364
00:21:54.381 --> 00:21:58.340
we had just seen the full horrors of the Holocaust. So we're thinking, you know,

365
00:21:58.341 --> 00:22:00.980
anything we do to these guys at this point they deserve.

366
00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:04.510
And we've also realized we're not really getting reciprocity.

367
00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:08.000
So we don't really have a practical reason to treat them well anymore.

368
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:12.860
So at this point, the question has really become,

369
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:17.390
do we continue to be good even when we're not getting anything in return?

370
00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:22.890
And the kind of amazing thing to me is that we decide, yeah,

371
00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.220
we're going to stick to the Geneva Conventions.

372
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:30.660
Archer alert who runs the POW program at this point. He gets up and he says,

373
00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:34.230
we are not going to lower ourselves to Nazi standards.

374
00:22:34.231 --> 00:22:38.100
We are not going to let the enemy decide who we are as a country.

375
00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.320
And that argument stuck. Yeah.

376
00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:45.460
I think that most people associated with the prison camp a experience that's

377
00:22:45.461 --> 00:22:48.370
historian Arnold Kramer again, felt that we treated them well,

378
00:22:48.371 --> 00:22:50.980
not because they treated Howard as well,

379
00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:54.400
but that we are decent people and we probably would have done this anyway.

380
00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:58.000
<v 2>Well, what makes on the American is not any special precious sort of blood,</v>

381
00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:03.130
but the tradition we have inherited, it's tradition, not blood,

382
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.100
but pattern is the way we think and act and feel.

383
00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:12.870
<v 10>Oh, there's a great belief that, uh,</v>

384
00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:17.150
we have a special mission, uh, and we have a special history.

385
00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:20.900
<v 0>This is David Goldfield. He's a historian at UNC Charlotte.</v>

386
00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:25.540
<v 10>That's the ideal, but no,</v>

387
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.301
I mean you don't.

388
00:23:27.301 --> 00:23:32.301
You only have to look at the treatment of Japanese Americans during World War

389
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:34.010
II.

390
00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:37.790
<v 0>He says, don't forget, right, is we're giving the Nazis massive amounts of Ham.</v>

391
00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:41.990
We're also rounding up tens of thousands of Japanese American citizens,

392
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.943
citizens,

393
00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:47.000
and we're throwing them into these cramped camps that are way worse than

394
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:49.340
Ellisville. And if you ask David,

395
00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:53.120
why are we treating the Germans so much better? They look like us.

396
00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:59.270
<v 2>Who's people look alright? The mailman, the farmer,</v>

397
00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:01.670
they all look pretty much like the floats back home.

398
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:06.150
<v 10>The major reason race, the Germans were white.</v>

399
00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:11.900
They seemed familiar that there was a connection between the German POW

400
00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.530
[inaudible] and the folks in the American south,

401
00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.490
not only because of the ethnicity of the Germans,

402
00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:24.930
not only because of their economic benefit to the region.

403
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.280
David told us that he's looked at the historical documents and he thinks the

404
00:24:29.281 --> 00:24:34.281
German laws against the Jews were essentially copied from the Mississippi black

405
00:24:36.271 --> 00:24:39.710
coats. We couldn't confirm that they were literally copies, but there are both.

406
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:43.440
There are similarities and a bunch of official Nazi documents from that time.

407
00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.450
Priests, southern race laws.

408
00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:50.930
So there was already a connection between the American south and that's the

409
00:24:52.641 --> 00:24:56.940
Germany. This is the most horrifying thing I've, I mean,

410
00:24:56.941 --> 00:25:01.230
is it really true that like all the niceness was just a perverse form of racism?

411
00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:01.681
<v 0>Well,</v>

412
00:25:01.681 --> 00:25:05.760
I would say racism plays an enormous role in why Japanese citizens were interned

413
00:25:05.761 --> 00:25:08.040
in the first place. I don't think there's any question about that.

414
00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:11.940
That's Paul Springer. He's a military historian, Maxwell Air Force Base,

415
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.570
Alabama. He's not quite sure that race explains all of this. He says,

416
00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:15.961
you know what?

417
00:25:15.961 --> 00:25:20.280
You've got to be careful because you're comparing treatment of citizens to

418
00:25:20.281 --> 00:25:22.830
treatment of prisoners of war. And that's different.

419
00:25:22.831 --> 00:25:25.090
It's not a fair comparison for the case of,

420
00:25:25.091 --> 00:25:28.900
of why you treat the German POW is better. Well, um,

421
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:31.530
because they're prisoners of war, the Japanese POW is,

422
00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:33.240
were also exceedingly well treated.

423
00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:37.050
They were treated much better than the Japanese citizens of the United States.

424
00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:41.070
And I think that's the comparison that's probably more interesting is why did

425
00:25:41.071 --> 00:25:46.071
you treat enemy soldiers from Japan better than you treated citizens of the

426
00:25:46.471 --> 00:25:48.690
United States of Japanese heritage?

427
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:52.650
And he says very simply that with prisoners of war,

428
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:56.400
it's because we had a rule governing international law,

429
00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:58.050
like the Geneva Conventions.

430
00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:03.080
There's no similar law at that time that says what you can and can't do towards

431
00:26:03.331 --> 00:26:05.910
your civilian populations. That's interesting.

432
00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:09.540
<v 10>So it's like maybe we're not racist or noble, but both,</v>

433
00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:12.420
and it's the rules that allow us to be our better selves.

434
00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:17.630
<v 0>Maybe. Here's what I take from this. I think that in a time of war,</v>

435
00:26:17.631 --> 00:26:21.080
it's incredibly difficult to be good to your enemy.

436
00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:24.680
It's not just about aspiring to be good at this American ideal.

437
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:29.390
It's about having 97 really nitpicky, tiny,

438
00:26:29.391 --> 00:26:34.391
tedious rules to tell you exactly what you can do and what you can't do because

439
00:26:34.971 --> 00:26:39.971
it would just be so easy to not be the person that you want to be in.

440
00:26:40.611 --> 00:26:44.000
That moment does

441
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.500
<v 11>kind of make you think back to February of 2002 good afternoon,</v>

442
00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:50.210
I have an announcement to make.

443
00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:55.400
I'm President Bush today has decided that the Geneva Convention will apply to

444
00:26:55.401 --> 00:26:59.660
the Taliban detainees, but not to the al Qaeda international [inaudible]

445

<v 12>terrorists.</v>

446
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:04.750
The president has maintained the United States his commitment to the principles

447
00:27:04.751 --> 00:27:08.770
of the Geneva Convention while recognizing that the convention simply does not

448
00:27:08.771 --> 00:27:13.180
cover every situation in which people may be captured or detained by military

449
00:27:13.181 --> 00:27:18.060
forces. As we see in Afghanistan today says John,

450
00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:20.860
already, what you're telling us is that the Taliban prisoners,

451
00:27:20.861 --> 00:27:25.780
detainees at Guantanamo will not get any more protections than they already are

452
00:27:25.781 --> 00:27:27.310
given under the Geneva Convention.

453
00:27:27.311 --> 00:27:30.550
And what you seem to be telling us is that the al-Qaida detainees will give,

454
00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:34.590
you know, there is no change in the protections they will be provided.

455
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.970
They are usually,

456
00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:39.540
they have always been treated consistent with the principles of the Geneva

457
00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:39.780
Convention,

458
00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.900
which means it will be treated well if you're looking for anything that will not

459
00:27:42.901 --> 00:27:45.960
happen as a result of this announcement is that they will not receive stipends

460
00:27:45.961 --> 00:27:47.130
from the American taxpayers.

461
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:50.460
They will not receive the musical instruments courtesy of the United States

462
00:27:50.461 --> 00:27:54.010
military. They would have received those had they been declared pow.

463
00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:58.670
They will continue to be treated well because they're in the custody of America.

464
00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.680
But the concern, the debate here was about if you don't do it here,

465
00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.980
then US soldiers could be mistreated abroad. Isn't that correct?

466
00:28:06.981 --> 00:28:07.910
And so isn't that a big,

467
00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:13.070
a big motivation here is sure that US whole just get the same kind of treatment?

468
00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:13.260
Yes sir.

469
00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:17.640
Important for all nations throughout the world to treat any prisoners well.

470
00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:22.050
And that is something that I says always expects and United States always does.

471
00:28:22.051 --> 00:28:24.780
We have time for one more question and then there's a, we'll pull it back.

472
00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:28.470
Hold it David. We'll get it. David,

473
00:28:28.471 --> 00:28:33.060
we'll get one more and then we'll cover ahead. Wasn't this an important concern?

474
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.830
I understand what the expectations are,

475
00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.950
but it was important for this administration to be able to say, look,

476
00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:42.180
we want to be able to protect our soldiers and similar situations down the line.

477
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:43.950
And if we, if we don't accord,

478
00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:47.400
if we don't know if we're afforded a probably just under the Geneva Convention

479
00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:49.010
that our solutions could be a girl. Dude,

480
00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:52.770
I was not in the ass who deliberations were various issues were raised.

481
00:28:52.771 --> 00:28:56.860
So I really, there's no way I can accurately answer that question. Go ahead.

482
00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:01.200
Devon forces. They don't, they often do not wear uniforms.

483
00:29:01.201 --> 00:29:04.260
They often do not carry their weapons outwardly. If they were captured,

484
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:06.960
they wouldn't use reserve in terms of the Geneva Convention,

485
00:29:06.961 --> 00:29:10.050
apply to all those terms. Speak for themselves. Okay. Thank you everybody.

486
00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:25.513
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

487

Thanks for listening.
