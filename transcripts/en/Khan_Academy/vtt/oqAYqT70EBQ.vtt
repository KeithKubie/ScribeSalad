00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:07.800
Solve 4 is equal to
log base b of 81 for b.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.070
So let's just remind ourselves
what this equation is saying.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.750
This is saying, if I raise
b to the fourth power,

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.140
then I'm going to get 81.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.150
Let me rewrite that.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.890
So if I raise b, that's our
base, so if I raise our base,

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.590
b-- I guess that's why
they picked b. b for base.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.030
If I raise b to
the fourth power--

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.530
I'll do the fourth
power in orange.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.010
If I raise b to
the fourth power,

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.690
that is going to be equal to 81.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.800
I've just rewritten
this equation,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.250
this logarithmic equation,
I've rewritten it

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.410
as an exponential equation.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.770
So it says b to the fourth
power is equal to 81,

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.820
and we need to
still solve for b.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.780
So you just have to
think, what number do I

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.000
have to multiply by itself
four times in order to get 81.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.080
And 81 might jump out of
you, it is a perfect square.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.384
We know that 9 times
9 is equal to 81.

00:01:04.384 --> 00:01:05.800
Or we know that
another way to say

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.210
that is, nine squared
is equal to 81.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.510
But we have to raise
something to the fourth power.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.980
But 9 itself is 3 times 3.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.480
So one 9 is 3 times 3, and then
you multiply it by another 9.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.090
That's another 3 times 3.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.910
That will also be equal to 81.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:25.970
And we can verify it.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.950
3 times 3 is 9, 9 times 3
is 27, 27 times 3 is 81.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.680
So this is 3 to
the fourth power.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.582
9 squared is the same thing
as 3 to the fourth power.

00:01:39.582 --> 00:01:40.540
So there we've done it.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.070
We've said, well, some
number to the fourth power

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.900
is equal to 81.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.300
We know that 3 to the
fourth power is equal to 81.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:54.270
So we know that b is equal to 3.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.640
3 to the fourth power is 81.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.800
Or we could say, log
base three of 81,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.307
this is saying what power do I
have to raise 3 to, to get 81?

00:02:03.307 --> 00:02:03.890
Well, we know.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.860
You have to raise 3 to the
fourth power to get to 81.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.669
And if you know about
fractional exponents,

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.210
and don't worry about this if
this confuses you a little bit,

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.990
you could raise both
of these, if you

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.720
know about fractional exponents
and exponent properties,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.700
you could do it
this way as well.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.200
You could take, so you
have b to the fourth power

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.250
is equal to 81.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.224
You could raise both of
these to the 1/4 power.

00:02:27.224 --> 00:02:28.890
Anything you do to
one side of equation,

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.346
you have to do to
the other side.

00:02:30.346 --> 00:02:31.720
And from our
exponent properties,

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.720
you know that if you raise
something to a power,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.340
then raise that
to a power, that's

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.160
like raising it to
the 4 times 1/4 power.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.000
Or this is, essentially, just
raising it to the first power.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.710
So on the left hand side,
you're just left with b,

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.690
and on the right hand side,
you're left-- is equal to 81

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.310
to the 1/4 power.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.490
But figuring out what
81 to the 1/4 power,

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.680
you really have to go
through this exercise anyway.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.030
Because when you raise
something to the 1/4 power,

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.275
you're really saying, well,
what do I have to multiply?

00:02:58.275 --> 00:03:00.650
What do I have to raise to
the fourth power to get to 81?

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.156
And then you get what
81 is to the 1/4 power.

00:03:03.156 --> 00:03:05.030
So actually, this is
another way of realizing

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.530
that 81 to the 1/4
power is equal to 3.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.600
3 to the fourth
power is equal to 81.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.210
81 to the 1/4 power
is equal to 3.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.670
But if this is confusing to you,
don't worry about it for now.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.400
The important thing
is you understand

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.720
what the logarithm
is actually saying.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.660
If I raise b to the
fourth power I get 81.
