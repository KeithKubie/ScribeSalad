00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
(Music)

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Quick! What's common between

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
beef burgers, baseball training

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and auto mufflers?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Tough question. Let's ask it another way.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What's the common factor between McDonald's,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
D-Bat and Meineke?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You may know the answer if, along with a Big Mac,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
you've absorbed a fragment of the romantic story of Ray Kroc.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
He's the salesman that created what became

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
the world's biggest fast food chain.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
He did it by making a deal

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
with a couple of men called the McDonalds.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Brothers they were, owners of a small restaurant chain,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and the deal was, he could use their brand name and their methods.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Then he invited small entrepreneurs

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
to open McDonald's, that they'd run as operators,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
with an ownership state.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Very different than the business model where Mom and Pop stores

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
have full ownership, but no similar support.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
All the examples

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
in my opening question are a franchise operation.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Kroc is sometimes credited

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
with inventing franchising,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and so is Isaac Singer, the sewing machine magnate.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Not so. The real genesis of franchising

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
was not in stitches or beef,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
it was in beauty.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Martha Matilda Harper

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
was a Canadian-born maid.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
She made the beds, cleaned house, did the shopping.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
In the employment of a doctor's family in Ontario,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
she acquired a secret formula for shampoo,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
one more scientifically based

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
than the quackeries advertized every day in the newspapers.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The kindly doctor also taught the maturing young woman

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
the elements of physiology.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Martha had a secret ambition

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
to go along with the secret formula:

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
a determination to run her own business.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
By 1888, serving as a maid in Rochester, New York,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
she saved enough money --

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
360 dollars -- to think of opening

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
a public hairdressing salon.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
But before she could realize her dream,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
two blows fell. She became sick,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and collapsed from exhaustion.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Mrs. Helen Smith, a healing practitioner

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
of the Christian Science faith, was summoned to her bedside.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The two women prayed, and Martha recovered.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
No sooner was she better then she was told,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
"Oh no, you can't rent the place you've eyed."

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
You see, her venture was to be the first public hairdressing salon.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
A woman in business was shocking enough then.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Only 17 percent of the workforce in 1890 was female,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
but a woman carrying out hairdressing

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and skincare in a public place?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Why, it was sure to invite a scandal.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Martha spent some of her savings on a lawyer, and won her case.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
She proudly displayed on the door

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
of her new her salon a photograph

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
of the barely five-foot Martha as Rapunzel,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
with hair down to her feet, but glowing with good health.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Her sickness, too, had proved a boon.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Her ambition was now propelled

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
by Christian Science values.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
The Harper Method, as she came to call her services,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
was as much about servicing the soul

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
as it was about cutting hair.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
In the therapeutic serenity of her salon,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
she taught that every person could glow

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
with the kind of beauty she had,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
if spiritually whole and physically obedient to what she called

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
"the laws of cleanliness, nourishment,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
exercise and breathing."

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
She was very practical about it.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
She even designed the first reclining shampoo chair,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
though she neglected to patent the invention.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Martha's salon was a huge success.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Celebrities came from out of town

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
to experience the Harper Method.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
They enjoyed the service so much

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
that they urged her to set up a salon in their cities.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And this is where Martha's ethical sense

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
inspired her crowning innovation.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Instead of commissioning agents, as other innovators had done,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
from 1891, she installed

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
working-class women just like herself

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
in salons exactly like hers,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
dedicated to her philosophy and her products.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
But these new employees

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
were not provided a salary by Martha.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
The women in what became a satellite network of 500 salons

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
in America, and then Europe and Central America

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and Asia, actually owned the Harper's Salons.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
What was good enough in the nineteenth century

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
for suffragette campaigners like Susan B. Anthony

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and was good enough in the twentieth century

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
for Woodrow Wilson, Calvin and Grace Coolidge, Jacqueline Kennedy,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Helen Hayes and Ladybird Johnson

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
must be good enough for the rest of the world.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Today, only the Harper Method Founder's Shop

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
remains in Rochester, New York, but Martha's legacy is manifold.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Her health and beauty treatments have been copied,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and her business model is dominant.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
In fact, half of retail sales in America

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
are through Martha Harper's franchising idea.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So the next time you enjoy a McDonald's hamburger

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
or a good night's rest at a Days Inn,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
think of Martha.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Because these franchises might not be the same

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
without her inventing the model, over a century ago.
