00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.280
Video games are more popular than ever.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.990
Games like Fortnight have gone completely
mainstream, and now almost everybody considers

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.960
themselves a gamer.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.550
In the past, video games have been looked
down; they have been accused of causing habits

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.090
of violence or addictive behaviors.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.419
But what about the benefits of playing video
games?

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:23.630
Here are some reasons you might want to game
hard in 2019.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.630
One; video games are linked with emotional
stability.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.090
Here at Psych2Go, we're all about helping
and educating others on everything related

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.060
to psychology, and emotional stability is
a huge part of that.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.620
A 2012 study suggested that immersive games
in particular, appear to be the most beneficial,

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.260
because they allowed gamers to try out different
versions of themselves.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.100
Games like Red Dead Redemption 2 are so immersive
that people can go anywhere and do anything.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.559
We're allowed to explore our own personalities
and see what fits best with our ideal selves.

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.390
And according to research, this helps a lot
with emotional stability.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.570
Three; video games improved Visumotor coordination.

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.880
You might have heard previously that video
games improve hand-eye coordination, it's

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.880
true.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.490
In fact, a recent study found that video games
improve all Visumotor coordination which is

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.770
when vision and movement work together to
produce actions.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.220
For example, in First-Person Shooters, gamers
must aim quickly and accurately at small targets.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.240
In driving games, we make small steering adjustments
at high speeds.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.909
When we boost our Visumotor coordination,
we get better at all kinds of tasks; including

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.700
walking, driving, sports and even basic tasks,
like getting dressed in the morning.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.110
Four; playing certain video games boost social
skills.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.640
We all know that in 2019, some of the best
video games are the ones we can play online

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.000
with our friends.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.100
But until recently, no one really considered
the benefits of these games.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.619
In 2014, a very interesting study was published
on the subject, which proposed that immersive

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.689
social video games help gamers develop pro-social
skills.

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.680
In these games, you have to figure out who
you can trust, who to make friends with and

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.180
how to lead a group.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.650
And yes, those skills can definitely be transferred
from the game world in to the real world.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.069
Five, videogames are linked with better vision.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.170
We've been told that staring at a screen all
day is bad for our eyes, but what if videogames

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.709
actually improves our vision?

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.220
There have been quite a few studies on this.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.090
Games can boost visual contrast sensitivity,
which is basically the ability to distinguish

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.310
between different shades of gray.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.010
One study even found that videogame treatments
can cure a lazy eye, which is also known as

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.430
amblyopia.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.370
That being said, don't stare at a screen all
day playing video games with the excuse of

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.410
trying to improve your eyesight.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.530
Six; video games might help with dementia.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.900
Almost everyone's a little fearful of getting
old, and one big reason is dementia.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.400
Once again, it's video games to the rescue.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.349
A 2016 study found that playing video games
helped older patients restore their cognitive

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:03.500
functions.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.970
This included benefits like improving walking
abilities, better moods and better social

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.970
interactions with friends and family.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.970
Seven; video games can help teens blow off
steam.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.010
Being a teen isn't easy and most of us remember
having a lot of pent up emotions during this

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.010
time.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.659
If anybody needs to blow off some steam, it's
your average teenager.

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.330
And according to a 2007 study, video games
are a great way to do that.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.879
The study found that teens were relieving
a lot of stress by playing video games.

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.400
So instead of causing aggression, video games
might actually be helping teens vent by getting

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.220
aggressive in the game world instead of the
real world.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.390
