00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:03.120
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.830
My name is Paul Carff.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.529
I'm on
Google's developer-relations team.

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:08.529
I'm a home brewer.

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:11.170
I've been at
Google five years.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.530
Today we have -- first of all I want
to thank everyone for joining us.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.420
We have a great crowd
here enjoying the beer and the books.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.099
I want to let you
know we're going to be welcoming Greg Koch

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:21.680
from Stone
Brewing Company today.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.679
Greg is going to be talking about
his book.

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:29.839
He's CEO and co-founder of Stone Brewing
Company in San Diego, California.

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:33.230
The Stone Brewing
Company was voted the -- I want to make sure

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.230
I get this
right.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.289
All-Time Top Brewery on Planet Earth in 2008
and

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:41.289
2009 by Beer Advocate magazine.

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:44.230
So please, prepare
yourself to receive the gospel according to

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.859
Stone and
join me in welcoming Greg.

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.460
[Applause]

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.409
&gt;&gt;Greg: Thank you.

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:55.409
Thank you.

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.120
Everybody enjoying a little
afternoon beer here at Google?

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.800
[audience responds] I think so.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.800
That's good.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.840
Because actually I notice -- I've noticed
over the years

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.780
that the Q and A section is always a little
bit better when

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.210
people are enjoying some beer in the audience.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.450
So I'll look
forward to it.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.799
I've got to talk around 40 minutes or so.

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.860
And then, I'd love to do some Q and A with
you guys.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.119
Go
into any subjects that you would like.

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.600
Again, I'm the
CEO, co-founder of Stone.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.770
We've been around for now just
a little over 15 years.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.200
So, basically I decide -- or I
describe the history of Stone and our success

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.010
kind of
based upon this very simple phrase -- don't

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.100
be different
to be different.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.060
Be different to be better.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.170
And we've
applied that in a number of ways -- which

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.570
I'll go into a
few.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.479
But first, I actually want to give a little
bit of

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.119
a foundation on beer here in the United States
for some

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.399
of you who may not be so familiar.

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.079
This is going to be
the quickie super-rush course.

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:08.220
So it used to be back in
the late 1800s there were of course many thousands

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.700
of --
several thousand breweries in the United States.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.750
But
they only went as far as a horse drawn carriage

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.800
could go out and
back in a single day.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.080
They were very limited
in distribution.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.410
Fast forward to the industrial
revolution.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.780
Transportation changes and changes in
refrigerations led to the big guys eater the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.690
smaller guys and
consolidation and a number of breweries in

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.080
the United
States started to drop precipitously from

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.080
a high of over
3500 breweries in the United States around

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.080
1880.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.510
To around
the turn of the century, about half that.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.630
And of course,
this is the mother of organized crime in the

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.820
United
States.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.580
For those of you who get that, this is of
course

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.840
Carrie Nation.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.790
Carrie Nation was behind the women's
temperance movement which eventually led to

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.830
Prohibition,
which led to organized crime [laughter] . It's

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.560
true.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.100
In the so-called noble experiment.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.940
Now, once
Prohibition ended, about 800 and something

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.290
breweries opened
back up, but then many, many years of consolidation

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.290
continued.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.321
Until, in 1979, we hit the ultimate low point
of beer in the United States where there were

00:03:28.321 --> 00:03:32.900
just 42
breweries and only one, Anchor, right here

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.900
in San Francisco
was making something different.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.480
The rest of them --
their flag ship beers of all of the other

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.790
breweries were
interchangeable fizzy yellow stuff -- unfortunately

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.590
so
common today.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.940
But now today we know that beer is no
longer equal to just this fizzy yellow industrial

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:55.940
stuff.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.520
In fact, over the last several years, major
domestics

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.580
have been declining.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.930
The imported stuff has been flat at
best.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.960
And it's been craft beers that have been on
the

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.030
rise and are really setting the tone for beer
in the

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.030
United States.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.170
We've gone from a country of lowly to a
country of elevated when it comes to beer.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.439
And the world
is now looking at the United States and looking

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:22.690
to the
United States for its inspiration.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.919
So this again gives
you an idea.

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.740
If you look -- I think this is kind of
interesting.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.630
If you take out Prohibition.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.980
This one very
significant dip out here.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.669
You can see that the line
probably would have been much the same.

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.210
We probably
would have historically ended up in much the

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.210
same point.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.830
A lot of people misperceive Prohibition as
being the

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:43.830
killer.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:44.830
It wasn't.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.840
It was just a major pause button in
the direction the beer industry was already

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.870
going.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.860
This
is me and my partner Steve Wagner when we

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.440
were starting
to put the brewery together in 1996.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.460
And that's us
today.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.719
Notice, I haven't changed much.

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:06.719
Steve has kids.

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:15.090
[laughter]
I think that's the difference.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.110
And this is our brewery
today.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.199
Again, that's what we started with in 1996
and

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.879
this is where we're at today.

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:29.300
We spent our first nine
and a half years in the former spot very inauspicious

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.840
generic industrial suite in a multi-tenant,
Tilt-up concrete warehouse.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.729
And
then, six years ago, we built our purpose-built

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:44.030
facility
with our brewery and a restaurant attached.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.490
And I want
to show you this.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.919
This is where we started and this is
what it looks like now with our restaurant

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.681
. And I want
to paint a little bit of a picture of what

00:05:53.681 --> 00:05:55.729
we've done here.

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.939
For
those of you who have visited, you know we're

00:05:57.939 --> 00:05:58.939
out
of the way.

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:00.790
We're 30 minutes from downtown San Diego.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.229
We're 25 minutes from the coast.

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:05.650
We have no sign on our
building.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.830
We have a complete ban on high fructose corn
syrup.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.090
We serve only organic produce and natural
and

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.439
free range meats.

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:19.040
Our menu is decidedly eclectic.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.909
We
don't have any processed foods.

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:25.860
We don't allow them into
our kitchen.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.009
And it's difficult to find.

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:32.620
For the first
several years, Google maps would send you

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:33.930
to the wrong
place [laughter].

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.249
&gt;&gt;Male #1: I can confirm that.

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:40.419
&gt;&gt;Greg: I got a confirmation here.

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:43.060
But with all of that.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:48.150
And
also, the three closest restaurants to us

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.860
are an Applebee's,
a Chili's and an Olive Garden which would

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:59.050
suggest by
traditional matrices of looking at how companies

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.439
make
decisions about where they have their possible

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:06.669
populace
that would be interested, this is not a place

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:10.559
to do all
of these really crazy left turns, if you will,

00:07:10.559 --> 00:07:12.279
that we did
with our restaurant.

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:17.949
And yet, over the last five years,
we've grown to become the largest restaurant

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:20.199
in our part
of the county.

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:24.370
And we have grown every year usually 20
or 30 percent.

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.699
This year we've grown 13 percent because
our kitchen is no longer large enough to handle

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:30.759
any growth past that.

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:33.629
So we're expanding it in
January.

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:37.279
So that is sort of our thinking different
perspective.

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:41.840
Because I looked at it -- we have our own
phrase.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.790
You have your two-word phrase, I think.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.699
Or
three-word phrase -- do no evil.

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:50.249
Ours is just two words
and it's not even official.

00:07:50.249 --> 00:07:52.710
Which is -- what's that?

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:56.069
&gt;&gt;Male #2: It's a black slide
&gt;&gt;Greg: It's a black slide.

00:07:56.069 --> 00:07:57.680
We're okay right now.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:06.460
[laughter] Tech
support right on top of it.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.590
And ours, informally, has been
'be amazing'.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.990
So I thought what's more amazing?

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:17.490
From very
simple matrix, organic local produce or commodity

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:18.490
produce?

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:19.839
Easy decision, I thought.

00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:22.009
What's more amazing?

00:08:22.009 --> 00:08:25.749
Major
brand high fructose corn syrup sodas or locally

00:08:25.749 --> 00:08:31.460
made sodas
that we create recipes ourselves and some

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.810
of the
specialty stuff in the bottles.

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:35.910
I thought that was
pretty easy.

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:42.030
Generic deep fried stuff and chicken
sandwiches and French fries and things like

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:46.450
that or
barbecue duck tacos and spicy beef and broccoli

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:48.570
stir-fries, the more interesting menu that
we

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:49.570
have.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.740
And so, that's what's led to our decision
here.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:56.570
In fact, I'd like to actually read just a
little bit -- a

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.870
small excerpt from the book to give you further
idea into

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:02.480
our thought process here.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:07.130
So, what makes our tale
different -- or more interesting than that

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.310
-- are the
stories of the mega-breweries.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:13.040
Well, we're a craft
brewery and that unquestionably adds interest.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.940
We get to be creative and inventive and have
fun and make tasty beer

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.960
without being brought down by
some marketing department's focus-driven ideas

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:24.190
about
focus group driven ideas about what some random

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:27.200
sampling
of the populace thinks that perhaps others

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.510
might think that they might
want.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:30.510
What?

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.920
Hell, I barely understood what I just said
there.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.410
So
you can imagine my level of interest and any

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:37.700
conclusions
that might come out of interpreting the key

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.440
matrices of the core objectives when overlaid
with

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.010
extrapolated bell curves and consumer acceptance
coefficients.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.970
Truth is I have no idea what I said there
either.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:48.890
But I digress.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:51.650
I was heading toward telling you
why I thought a book about the Stone Brewing

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.960
Company story might be a
good idea.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:00.180
And the reason is I wanted to share the very
simple idea that doing it our way is better.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:04.960
And by "our
way" I really mean "your way."

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.260
And what I mean by that
is that I believe things are almost universally

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.460
better when
people do something the way they think it

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.380
should be done.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.850
The way they truly think is the best way.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.680
If you don't
care for what we do and how we do it, then

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.380
you're not our
customer.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.740
And, if you're not our customer, we don't
need

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.290
to fashion ourselves to your personal taste.

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:28.840
In fact, I
think we shouldn't.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:35.090
If we did, it's questionable whether
we'd make a loyal customer out of you.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.541
And we'd almost
definitely alienate our customers who have

00:10:37.541 --> 00:10:38.541
been loyal.

00:10:38.541 --> 00:10:40.930
I'll turn it around the other way.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:43.760
If you do something
you're quite good at and you're doing it your

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.720
way, then
it's simply up to me as your potential customer

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.570
to decide
for myself whether or not I like what you

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:51.770
do.

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:55.220
If I do,
then I've just discovered that finally someone

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:58.380
is doing
whatever it is you do in a way that gets me

00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.590
excited.

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:01.090
I'm
thrilled that you've learned to do what you

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:03.710
do so well
and you're doing it in a way that's unique

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.280
and special.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.420
On the other hand, if I don't like what you
do, then I

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.850
can simply move on.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:13.700
Sure, I might decide that the best
possible thing I can do for you is to explain

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.550
how much
better it would be if you do what you do the

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:18.490
way I think
you should do it.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:24.490
But, if you're smart, you'll file my
invaluable advice in the round file.

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:28.070
Now, I'm not one to
say that all advice or perspectives from others

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:29.070
are
bad.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:30.370
Far from it.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:33.180
So how do you separate the barley
from the chaff.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.770
It's simple.

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:40.110
Does the advice support
your vision or does it attempt to derail it?

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:43.680
If the
former, lean in.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.680
And that, in its own way, is what this
book is about.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.570
Think of our story as providing a
supporting context for your vision whatever

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:52.000
that may be.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.470
As long as it's good or you're good at it
or at least on your

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:59.940
way to getting there.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.200
So that kind of thought process and philosophy
has led

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.280
us to this building now.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:13.270
And, you know, positioning
statement right there.

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:20.630
[chuckles] This is what the American
populace has for so long thought of beer.

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:22.010
Of course,
they haven't thought of it with the sticker

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:23.010
on it.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:25.030
They
thought of it with the contents of that glass.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:30.790
They
thought of beer as being this rather simple,

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:34.450
mostly just
wet, cold, carbonated.

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:38.870
And, for perspectives, there's
something called IBUs.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:39.870
International bitterness units.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:42.740
And you can actually measure the bitterness
in beer.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.530
The
bitterness threshold -- low-end of the threshold

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.560
that the human
palate can perceive is around 7.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:53.649
Major industrial beers
tend to be around eight to 12 IBUs.

00:12:53.649 --> 00:12:57.650
For perspectives,
this is where we start.

00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:59.000
We start at 45.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.630
So four times
more bitter than the typical industrial stuff.

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.430
Going all
the way up the scale -- and this is just a

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:06.860
small
selection of the beers we produce -- going

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:10.750
all the way up
to over 100 when the human palate can only

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:15.850
perceive up to around 85
to 90 IBUs so we have several beers that are

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:18.440
more bitter
than the human palate can perceive.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.850
And when we started
off, nobody was asking for this stuff.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.300
Nobody ever said,
"I want this kind of thing."

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:31.030
People didn't mostly know
that beers of this sort even could exist.

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:34.440
Which leads me
to another small excerpt that I'd like to

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:39.370
read you from our
early days when we were starting off.

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:42.290
And this is
talking about our first year here.

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:45.760
It says, "we were
having a tough time.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.060
We had a number of accounts, but a
few of them were turning big numbers and by

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.350
this time we
were hemorrhaging about 30,000 dollars a month

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:55.110
and desperate to
reach a critical mass.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:59.450
We hadn't lost faith but things
were looking a little bleak at the time especially

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:00.820
on
paper.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.940
A lot of consumers were still finding Stone
Pale

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.500
Ale challenging, which was the first beer
that we ever

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.500
produced.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:11.000
It was much more bitter than most people's
palates were ready to appreciate at that time.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.390
I can
remember sampling Stone Pale Ale with bartenders

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.420
and
restaurant buyers and having them react with

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.210
this, "it's
just so bitter."

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:22.740
Sure, we could have listened and scaled
back on the hops, but we didn't want to.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.290
It wasn't our
nature.

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:26.431
We were brewing beers we liked to drink and,
if

00:14:26.431 --> 00:14:29.500
they didn't like it, well, we'd find other
people who did --

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:34.290
hopefully, maybe.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.230
Instead of easing up, we decided to go
bolder.

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:42.740
In August of 1997, we released Stone IPA to
celebrate our first anniversary.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:48.130
IPAs are almost de rigueur now for
most breweries, but at the time, they were

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:51.260
quite unusual
and drinking an IPA was a new experience for

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.730
a lot of
people's palates.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:57.850
Bitter, yes, but the fresh flavors and
aromas that came from the hops -- wow.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:01.470
And at the time,
few people knew beer could even taste like

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:02.620
this.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.860
Hop
heads were being born and Stone certainly

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.120
was one of the
delivery rooms.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:10.990
This hunger for hops was a great thing,
because we were gearing up to release another

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:11.990
brew.

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:15.090
It
was and still is an aggressive beer.

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:17.200
You probably won't
like it.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.720
It's quite doubtful that you have the taste
or

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.050
sophistication to be able to appreciate an
ale of this

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:25.530
quality and depth, [laughter] as I wrote on
the back of the

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:29.060
Arrogant Bastard Ale label back in 1997.

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:34.370
We first
released this in November of 1997.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:38.150
It was -- it is
considered to be the very first -- the progenitor

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.860
of the
American strong ale category.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.820
7.2 percent.

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:43.970
Intensely
bitter.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.990
Intensely flavorful.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:50.610
I will fully admit that,
when we released this beer -- as you'll find

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:54.320
out in the
book -- we actually had the recipe from before

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.000
we actually opened
the brewery.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.970
My partner Steve and I developed this -- by
"Steve and I" I mean him 99 percent and me

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:02.320
one percent, to
be fair.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:07.861
We developed this recipe before, but we didn't
release it for nearly a year and a half, because

00:16:07.861 --> 00:16:11.990
we were
convinced -- weren't convinced that the public

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:16.100
could
handle it.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:22.360
And that's one of the only times that I've
actually not trusted in the public -- the

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.620
good taste of
the public -- and I was proven wrong.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.160
And I'm glad to
say I was proven wrong.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.270
We produced about 100 cases and
it sold out.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.930
And we produced 100 more and it sold out.

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:35.030
And we've been continuing to ramp it up.

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.110
Ever since.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:39.540
And we're now distributing in 36 states.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.720
And Arrogant
Bastard Ale, interestingly enough, is the

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:46.290
number 1 selling
single serve -- because it's in a 22-ounce

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:47.400
bottle format.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.310
You buy it one at a time.

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:55.370
Number 1 selling single serve
craft beer in the United States in chain stores.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:58.250
It's
quite interesting.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:01.410
This gives you an idea of our growth
over the years.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:06.750
This year we're going to do probably
right around 150,000 barrels.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:11.419
So, this is a picture of
Steve and I when we were bottling our very

00:17:11.419 --> 00:17:15.649
first bottles
of Stone Pale Ale.

00:17:15.649 --> 00:17:16.649
And that's us today.

00:17:16.649 --> 00:17:20.809
We have about
430 people that work with us at Stone.

00:17:20.809 --> 00:17:22.669
And we have a
restaurant.

00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:26.269
We have a distribution division.

00:17:26.269 --> 00:17:29.250
And sales
and merchandise.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.960
We're having a lot of fun.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.220
And I think
that, you know, it's been a privilege to be

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:39.200
a part of
this renaissance that is craft beer.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:43.049
And you know, the
great thing about craft brewers is, we definitely

00:17:43.049 --> 00:17:46.279
get to
have more fun.

00:17:46.279 --> 00:17:51.090
One more excerpt they'd like to read to
you about some of the -- just the philosophy

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:55.230
of
collaboration in brewing.

00:17:55.230 --> 00:18:00.029
Working together with other
brewers to craft interesting new beers has

00:18:00.029 --> 00:18:06.330
been one of
the most rewarding endeavors -- excuse me

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.960
-- working
together with other breweries to craft interesting

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.000
new
beers has been one of the most rewarding endeavors

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.049
we've
undertaken.

00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:16.590
It's an interesting phenomenon that we enjoy
in this industry being able to call up somebody

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:20.669
who
technically I suppose is a competitor and

00:18:20.669 --> 00:18:22.460
ask if they
want to come over and brew some beer with

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:23.640
us.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.230
It's
almost like a grown up version of inviting

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.740
someone to a
tree fort. [laughter] We have a ton of fun

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.470
with it and the
experience is quite different every time as

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:34.200
are the
beers.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.260
And that's one of the huge benefits.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.269
We always
push ourselves to make something we've never

00:18:38.269 --> 00:18:40.950
made before
and something none of us would have been likely

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:43.340
to have come up
with on our own.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:46.450
Sometimes we work with an old friend we
don't get to see that often.

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:49.679
Other times we might invite
one of the rising stars in the industry or

00:18:49.679 --> 00:18:52.110
an international underdog
we've become friends with.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:53.990
And whose work we admire.

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:56.600
And sometimes we invite passionate home brewers
and give

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.700
them a chance to play on the big boy equipment.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.909
Whatever
the case, we always come away with a feeling

00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:03.909
of
accomplishment and a newfound respect for

00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:05.220
each other.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.970
The exchange of knowledge and ideas never
ceases to amaze

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:14.080
me and neither do the beers that we collectively
produce.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:20.019
Which leads to talking a moment about the
Saison du Buff.

00:19:20.019 --> 00:19:22.500
Sam Calagione from Dogfish Head on the left.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.289
Me in the
middle and Bill Covaleski of Victory Brewing

00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:26.429
Company on the right.

00:19:26.429 --> 00:19:29.070
Got a
short video that we made to celebrate this

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:32.950
collaboration beer
I'd like to show you.

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:36.360
When Sam and Bill
and I got together for "BUFF" Brewers United

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.450
for
Freedom of Flavor in 2003, we put together

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:43.659
this little press
conference and one person showed up.

00:19:43.659 --> 00:19:47.610
Jamie Magee, from Yankee Brew News, Awesome
Jamie.

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:50.169
We
really thought when we did this that we might

00:19:50.169 --> 00:19:53.970
have some
real, you know, mainstream press people show

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:54.970
up.

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:55.970
No.

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:56.970
No.

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:58.370
When Sam started out, Bill started out, I
started out,

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:00.950
we didn't know what we could become.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.620
We didn't know the
things that we could do.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.070
We just knew that we wanted to
try.

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:13.419
Video announcer's voice: [electronic music]
In a world fraught with aggressive pushes

00:20:13.419 --> 00:20:18.350
towards generic sameness at the hands of mega
international conglomerate

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:22.830
brewers, three men have set out to create
their own path,

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:26.860
to go their own directions, to brew boldly
with great

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:30.749
passion, to rebuke commonly held ideas of
what can and

00:20:30.749 --> 00:20:32.759
cannot be accomplished in brewing.

00:20:32.759 --> 00:20:37.610
To make beers
bursting with sheer awesomeness.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:52.309
[music crescendos]
&gt;&gt;Greg: With these three

00:20:52.309 --> 00:20:58.379
brewers, the expectations are going to be
astronomical.

00:20:58.379 --> 00:21:02.190
&gt;&gt;Sam: We wanted to do a beer that we've never
done before.

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:05.570
&gt;&gt;Bill: Bringing something new to the style
is a challenge.

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:07.299
I
think we're up to the challenge.

00:21:07.299 --> 00:21:09.020
I think we rose to it.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:12.529
[music continues; glasses clink]
&gt;&gt;Sam: We're hoping it has a lot of those

00:21:12.529 --> 00:21:18.889
estery spicy notes
of a traditional Saison but that the herbs

00:21:18.889 --> 00:21:23.220
that we're
adding are going to bring it to a place that

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:26.259
Saison has
never been before.

00:21:26.259 --> 00:21:29.240
&gt;&gt;Bill: Conversation going on amongst the
three of us and

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:36.030
something came up about sage how much we loved
the flavor

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.880
of sage.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:43.120
From there, there was a whole cascade of herbs
we just pulled into it.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.750
&gt;&gt;Sam: I think we've cornered that parsley
beer niche.

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:47.159
&gt;&gt;Greg: Because there's such a collaborative
process, you want

00:21:47.159 --> 00:21:48.460
to be very hands on with it.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.929
You want to touch
everything.

00:21:49.929 --> 00:21:52.150
You want to understand.

00:21:52.150 --> 00:22:01.110
&gt;&gt;Bill: It's an herb fight.

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:03.999
The individual personalities of
the three breweries definitely have to shine

00:22:03.999 --> 00:22:04.999
threw.

00:22:04.999 --> 00:22:07.440
So
talking Greg off the hop mountain -- not an

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.619
easy thing.

00:22:09.619 --> 00:22:14.289
&gt;&gt;Greg: Saison is such a cool style because
it's really

00:22:14.289 --> 00:22:15.289
herbaceous.

00:22:15.289 --> 00:22:19.700
It's got peppery character and you got this
natural citrusy character as well.

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:23.360
Add in the herbs that we're using and it just
making this thing

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.889
to a completely new level.

00:22:25.889 --> 00:22:29.110
&gt;&gt;Sam: I think it's going to be an extremely
complex but

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:34.210
drinkable sessiony Saison that hopefully something
that

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:35.860
the world's has never seen before.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:36.860
&gt;&gt;Sam: Tough work.

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:37.860
&gt;&gt;Bill: Yeah.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:42.100
&gt;&gt;Greg: Because I'm going to want to take
a nap after lunch.

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:45.499
I'm just laying up against that rock.

00:22:45.499 --> 00:22:50.630
Boy, those are life
like garden gnomes you've got.

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:54.960
&gt;&gt;Greg: Yeah, so we had a blast with that.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.509
And we're going to
actually brew it again this coming spring

00:22:58.509 --> 00:23:00.369
in each of our
three breweries.

00:23:00.369 --> 00:23:05.419
The first time that we've redone a
collaboration; we liked it so much.

00:23:05.419 --> 00:23:11.039
And it's a great fun
to do stuff -- have a wide variety of collaborations.

00:23:11.039 --> 00:23:14.059
Of
course, collaborations can take many forms

00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:18.420
such as this
collaboration with Garrett Oliver the brew

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:22.200
master from
Brooklyn Brewery.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.779
At least I think he thought it was
collaboration.

00:23:24.779 --> 00:23:28.289
[laughter] All right, if you know Garrett,
that was

00:23:28.289 --> 00:23:29.530
a lot funnier.

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:36.799
So, you know, in looking at philosophy in
business and how to approach things, I kind

00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:38.210
of came up
with this little axiom.

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:41.600
I'd like to present it to you.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.669
It has two major matrices.

00:23:44.669 --> 00:23:46.429
They have this intersection.

00:23:46.429 --> 00:23:49.389
It depends on your goal.

00:23:49.389 --> 00:23:53.019
If your goal is to either do
the same old same old.

00:23:53.019 --> 00:23:55.480
Which I think you guys don't do a
lot around here.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.519
That's not the nature of your company.

00:23:57.519 --> 00:24:00.779
Or is it your goal to be creative.

00:24:00.779 --> 00:24:03.320
And then on the other
side, it's your ability.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:11.090
And either you suck [laughter]
Or hopefully you don't suck.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:12.100
Right?

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.989
So let's look at
each one of these equations.

00:24:13.989 --> 00:24:15.669
Same old same old and you
suck.

00:24:15.669 --> 00:24:16.830
What do you get?

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:17.830
Doomed.

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:20.010
[laughter] You're doomed.

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:25.450
Yes,
I'm not going to repeat that, but.

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:30.619
Or, same old same old
approach but you don't suck.

00:24:30.619 --> 00:24:35.210
Well, maybe doomed to
mediocrity.

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:39.009
How about creative and you suck.

00:24:39.009 --> 00:24:43.400
Well,
doomed, [laughter] but you're likely happier

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:49.999
and just maybe you
learn how not to suck at what you're doing.

00:24:49.999 --> 00:24:52.499
So you could
be creative and not suck.

00:24:52.499 --> 00:24:56.480
And of course, that is --
that's the ultimate success.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:03.110
And you know, I think that
the takeaway that I'd like to share with people.

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:05.860
And I
get to talk to college students from time

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:06.860
to time.

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:08.699
So
many people think that they need to do the

00:25:08.699 --> 00:25:12.299
-- they need
to focus on not sucking at the same old same

00:25:12.299 --> 00:25:17.379
old and
that's the path they feel they need to take.

00:25:17.379 --> 00:25:21.890
I realize I'm preaching
to the converted here at Google.

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:27.440
You know same old same
old just ain't gonna fly.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.720
If you do it and you're
really creative and you don't suck at what

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.049
you do, you
can be pretty amazing.

00:25:32.049 --> 00:25:35.379
I think we're in a room with
that.

00:25:35.379 --> 00:25:37.010
So I want to share this.

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:40.179
That's me back in the
music days.

00:25:40.179 --> 00:25:42.539
I used to be in the music industry before
I

00:25:42.539 --> 00:25:43.539
got into beer.

00:25:43.539 --> 00:25:47.279
And I think you can probably see some
rock and roll filtering through to the Stone

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:48.460
Brewing
Company.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:52.649
It was actually up here in the Bay Area.

00:25:52.649 --> 00:26:00.870
There
was this -- actually, so the analogy I want

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:04.840
to make is,
some of the best bands -- it doesn't matter

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:12.989
whether it's U2 or Metallica or Fugazi--,
are great because they did what they wanted

00:26:12.989 --> 00:26:15.460
to
do and they were great at it, right?

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.000
If they
weren't trying to be flavor of the month,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.150
they're not
trying to please people other than to please

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:27.169
themselves and
then, that of course has, pleases their fans.

00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:30.299
And so, it
doesn't matter whether Rolling Stones or Grateful

00:26:30.299 --> 00:26:33.389
Dead or
Metallica.

00:26:33.389 --> 00:26:38.289
When Metallica came out with the Black
album -- I remember there was a magazine called

00:26:38.289 --> 00:26:41.570
Bay Area
Music or Band magazine and they put Metallica

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:45.120
on the cover
when the Black album came out with this caption

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.049
and I
love this caption and I've always carried

00:26:47.049 --> 00:26:49.129
it with me to
this day.

00:26:49.129 --> 00:26:50.340
And the caption went.

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.269
"Metallica didn't go to
number 1.

00:26:52.269 --> 00:26:54.740
Number 1 came to them."

00:26:54.740 --> 00:27:01.960
And that's what I've tried
to do in my professional life in beer is to

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.360
create things
that are worth coming to.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:09.679
Because we decided -- Steve
and I decided at Stone, we weren't going to

00:27:09.679 --> 00:27:13.429
try and cross
that line and go to the public.

00:27:13.429 --> 00:27:15.980
Figure out what the
public thinks that they want.

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:17.760
We've never done any focus
groups.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:22.059
In fact, I believe in not listening to the
public if you want to do something great.

00:27:22.059 --> 00:27:25.350
You've got to
listen to yourself and then people who support

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:30.230
your
vision will follow you if you're good.

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:33.039
And this is
another small story.

00:27:33.039 --> 00:27:38.610
I was playing blackjack in Vegas
many years ago and sitting by some grizzled

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:40.059
old guy.

00:27:40.059 --> 00:27:41.990
And I
was playing sort of frivolously.

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:46.190
It was probably 3 in
the morning.

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:49.539
And you know, this guy -- we fell into this
conversation.

00:27:49.539 --> 00:27:51.730
It was probably a few words here.

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:52.779
Every
few hands.

00:27:52.779 --> 00:27:55.299
We weren't really chatty or anything.

00:27:55.299 --> 00:27:57.230
He
just shared a little piece of advice that

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:58.740
I've also
carried with me.

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:05.289
He said, "you know, if I was going to
lose, I'd mail it in.

00:28:05.289 --> 00:28:08.169
If I was going to break even, I'd
stay home."

00:28:08.169 --> 00:28:14.049
He said, "Son, I came here to win."

00:28:14.049 --> 00:28:17.759
And that
actually spoke to me and I've always remembered

00:28:17.759 --> 00:28:19.970
that the
very simple words.

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:24.940
It's like, you know, I thought when I
was going to get into beer, I got into it

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.350
because I'm a
beer geek.

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:29.340
I fell down that rabbit hole.

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:34.379
I became a mad
passionate enthusiast for craft beers.

00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:38.899
And I felt
eventually I just had to be a part of it.

00:28:38.899 --> 00:28:41.489
And I just
said to myself, "I'm not going to do this,

00:28:41.489 --> 00:28:42.489
you know?

00:28:42.489 --> 00:28:45.000
If
I was going to lose, I'd mail it in.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.149
If I was just going
to be mediocre, I'd just stay home.

00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:52.159
But I came to do
what I thought was a great job."

00:28:52.159 --> 00:28:56.169
Hopefully other people
would eventually agree with me.

00:28:56.169 --> 00:28:59.059
So what's the future
hold for Stone.

00:28:59.059 --> 00:29:04.080
I thought I'd share with you some of the
things we're doing now as well as working

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.649
on.

00:29:05.649 --> 00:29:07.539
This is Stone Farms.

00:29:07.539 --> 00:29:09.109
I'm a believer in organics.

00:29:09.109 --> 00:29:12.490
I'm
a believer in local and sustainable.

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:17.159
So we actually
revived a small local organic farm that had

00:29:17.159 --> 00:29:18.639
failed last
year.

00:29:18.639 --> 00:29:22.629
And we took over the farm in March of this
year.

00:29:22.629 --> 00:29:23.659
And we've now revived it.

00:29:23.659 --> 00:29:29.679
We supply a lot of the veggies
for our restaurant from this farm.

00:29:29.679 --> 00:29:32.100
To our restaurant
there.

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:39.549
So, up there in the right, you can see our
existing brewery, restaurant and gardens.

00:29:39.549 --> 00:29:41.869
This year, at
the end of the year -- or excuse me, one year

00:29:41.869 --> 00:29:44.109
from now we
hope to be up and running with the second

00:29:44.109 --> 00:29:47.830
production
facility right next door.

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:51.529
And then, across the street, as you
can see we'll be putting in additional outdoor

00:29:51.529 --> 00:29:52.669
area and a
hotel.

00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:55.860
We're actually building a 50-room boutique
hotel.

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:58.260
[chuckles from audience] Thought
it would be fun.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:01.919
It's going to be really cool, too.

00:30:01.919 --> 00:30:04.640
We
won't have a check-in counter, but you will

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:09.049
be able to
get your room key at the bar.

00:30:09.049 --> 00:30:14.980
[laughter] This is a picture of
what's called Liberty Station.

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.840
It's an old naval
training center close to downtown San Diego.

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:22.029
It's a
historic grouping of buildings.

00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:25.690
And we've decided to put
in a second Stone Brewing Bistro and Gardens.

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:29.419
It's just a hop, skip,
and a jump from the airport in San Diego.

00:30:29.419 --> 00:30:31.690
And this is a
little of an idea what it will look like.

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:34.730
It will be
22,000 square feet.

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:37.559
So if anybody's been to our
restaurant now.

00:30:37.559 --> 00:30:39.299
It's going to be more than double the
size.

00:30:39.299 --> 00:30:44.220
We'll have a 10-barrel brewing system there.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.730
This
is my other book -- Brewer's Apprentice--

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:52.399
which I wrote
with the help of 20 of my friends from Sam

00:30:52.399 --> 00:30:55.600
from Dogfish, and
Vinnie from Russian River Brewing Company.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.320
Nick Floyd from Three Floyds all contributed.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:01.299
And I interviewed for particular chapters
going deep

00:31:01.299 --> 00:31:05.380
dives into chapters on hops, on brewing water,
on malt and

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:06.889
mashing and so on.

00:31:06.889 --> 00:31:10.960
It's a really fun book.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.629
Chapter with
Ken Grossman.

00:31:12.629 --> 00:31:18.080
Much respect to Ken and everything that
he's built with Sierra Nevada Brewing Company.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.080
A
true leader.

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:25.480
And then, of course, I think many of you have
heard we're working on our project to be the

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:28.039
first
American craft brewer to own and operate or

00:31:28.039 --> 00:31:30.649
own brewery
in Europe.

00:31:30.649 --> 00:31:33.369
Taking it to the mother land.

00:31:33.369 --> 00:31:37.809
[laughter] You
may not be aware.

00:31:37.809 --> 00:31:44.710
Common perception both in Europe and
United States around beer is I would say about

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:46.289
30 years
old.

00:31:46.289 --> 00:31:48.890
Common perception in the United States amongst
the

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:53.669
average American, they think American beer
sucks.

00:31:53.669 --> 00:31:55.919
Amongst the average European, they definitely
think

00:31:55.919 --> 00:31:57.440
American beer sucks.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.970
[laughter] American beer most definitely does
not suck.

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:03.440
In fact, we are world leaders.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:08.480
And so, we
have completely transformed beer in this country,

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:11.570
but
still, you know, there's a lagging learning

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:12.570
curve.

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:14.350
You
guys are on the front end -- front edge of

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:16.580
the curve.

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:19.710
In
Europe, and I'm going to say this and I know

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:21.259
this is
going to be posted online.

00:32:21.259 --> 00:32:24.799
In Europe, most of the beers
suck.

00:32:24.799 --> 00:32:27.440
Just like most of the beers in the United
States

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.539
used to suck.

00:32:29.539 --> 00:32:36.399
And there are -- for clarity -- there are
many, many, many amazing small breweries either

00:32:36.399 --> 00:32:39.809
traditional
or new startups that are doing great things

00:32:39.809 --> 00:32:41.549
in Europe.

00:32:41.549 --> 00:32:46.609
So I -- you know, I believe in the movement
of the craft

00:32:46.609 --> 00:32:50.039
brewers and the traditional -- the artisanal
brewers.

00:32:50.039 --> 00:32:52.919
And we hope to just be a part of that.

00:32:52.919 --> 00:32:57.279
And I know that
we'll be able to put a little bit of a unique

00:32:57.279 --> 00:32:59.730
face on to
that to help get some attention.

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:03.919
Plus, we like to
showcase other beers.

00:33:03.919 --> 00:33:04.960
Have you been to our restaurant?

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:10.309
You know we have 32 beers on draft and 130
on the bottle.

00:33:10.309 --> 00:33:14.859
On draft, two-thirds are guest beers and in
the bottle about 128

00:33:14.859 --> 00:33:17.470
of the 130 are guest beers.

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:20.389
Really specialty beers we
don't have any commodity beers.

00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:26.409
And we love sharing the
culture of the craft in specialty brewing

00:33:26.409 --> 00:33:29.590
across its many
wide and varied spectrums.

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:33.609
In Europe, we hope to have a
restaurant as part of our facility there as

00:33:33.609 --> 00:33:34.609
well.

00:33:34.609 --> 00:33:37.429
And
although we haven't figured out exactly where.

00:33:37.429 --> 00:33:38.429
We've
been looking.

00:33:38.429 --> 00:33:41.509
We've visited 100 locations, 100 potential
sites in nine

00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:44.159
countries.

00:33:44.159 --> 00:33:49.419
Just as an example, if we open up a brewery
in Germany, which is possible, but I'm not

00:33:49.419 --> 00:33:51.139
making any
announcement here.

00:33:51.139 --> 00:33:52.190
It's possible.

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:56.399
I'll bet you within
one year we have the best selection of German

00:33:56.399 --> 00:34:02.720
craft and
traditional artisanal beer in all of Germany.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:07.419
And it's
almost sad that we could even have a chance

00:34:07.419 --> 00:34:10.609
at claiming
that title that instead -- because you can't

00:34:10.609 --> 00:34:13.040
go to
Germany and find amazing selections of German

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:17.200
beer all
over in bars or even stores.

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:21.960
They're so small you can
count them on two hands in the entire country

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:29.200
that have
amazing cross-sectional selections of great

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.470
German
specialty and artisanal beer.

00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:35.320
So you know, the
traditional European culture has been, it's

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.639
very insular.

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:39.799
They drink that beer in
that town and that other town that's 20 minutes

00:34:39.799 --> 00:34:40.799
away.

00:34:40.799 --> 00:34:44.399
It's like you know what I'm saying from down
here to San

00:34:44.399 --> 00:34:45.399
Jose.

00:34:45.399 --> 00:34:46.800
No, we don't drink Anchor.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.790
They drink that in San
Francisco.

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:51.760
[laughter] We do not drink that here.

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:55.889
Here we drink Gordon Biersch and
that's it.

00:34:55.889 --> 00:34:58.420
Or Tied House.

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:02.891
And of course, as an American
craft beer enthusiast, you're like you're

00:35:02.891 --> 00:35:03.891
kidding me?

00:35:03.891 --> 00:35:06.510
Yeah, I love Anchor, but I love all these
other ones as

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:08.580
well.

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:13.299
So that's the tone of beer in Europe right
now.

00:35:13.299 --> 00:35:18.140
So, as I said, our goal is to not just to
be different to

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:21.530
be different, but to be different to be better.

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:26.390
And with
that, like to have a conversation.

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:30.750
Take your questions.

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:32.210
[Applause]

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:37.070
&gt;&gt;Male #3: So first off I'd like to thank
you for coming here.

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:40.099
I
started brewing beer like two years ago in

00:35:40.099 --> 00:35:41.099
college.

00:35:41.099 --> 00:35:42.099
It
was a huge fiasco.

00:35:42.099 --> 00:35:47.059
Most of the times with the two
plastic buckets and everything like that.

00:35:47.059 --> 00:35:50.320
Haven't gotten
back into it since I got out here.

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.809
My roommate and
I -- we tried to experiment.

00:35:52.809 --> 00:35:57.579
And it seemed like every
time with using your words, it sucked.

00:35:57.579 --> 00:36:01.070
What process --
like, what point in the process did you find

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:04.230
out that you know
this beer is going to be good.

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:06.000
After you've boiled
everything.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.670
Do you have to wait till the very end when
you taste the final product that you know

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:12.109
you have a quality
beer.

00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:13.270
Because we always had to wait till the very
end

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:16.119
when we're like, all right, we found out this
whole recipe

00:36:16.119 --> 00:36:17.119
sucks.

00:36:17.119 --> 00:36:18.230
We have to start from scratch now.

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:20.040
&gt;&gt;Greg: Fair enough.

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.710
And that's the challenge in home brewing
or brewing in general.

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:27.950
So, as you get more experience,
you look to see these indicators all along

00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:28.950
the way.

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:31.559
As
you steward the beer through the initial brewing

00:36:31.559 --> 00:36:34.840
process
and then through the fermentation process.

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.020
You're
checking it and you kind of know what to look

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:39.969
for so you
can see if it's going left or right or south

00:36:39.969 --> 00:36:42.430
-- hopefully
not.

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:45.720
The main piece of advice that I would always
give

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:51.089
for home brewing -- second to of course buying
my book

00:36:51.089 --> 00:36:57.480
the Brewer's Apprentice -- [laughter] is to
home brew with friends.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.070
Make friends with a local -- with people in
local home

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:03.190
brew club or somebody who's an experienced
home brewer.

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:05.940
Because doing it by the book is great.

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:08.800
There are some
fantastic books out there such as the Joy

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.340
of Homebrewing
by Charlie Pappazian.

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:12.849
And many, many others I couldn't even
mention.

00:37:12.849 --> 00:37:17.579
But when you're doing it with somebody else
who's experienced, your learning curve is

00:37:17.579 --> 00:37:20.890
just like this.

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:22.069
Any other home brewers out here?

00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:24.319
&gt;&gt;Male #3: I'm not surprised.

00:37:24.319 --> 00:37:25.849
I figured I'd find some other homebrewers
here.

00:37:25.849 --> 00:37:27.559
&gt;&gt;Greg: Join a home brewing club.

00:37:27.559 --> 00:37:30.770
And just watch your curve
go exponential.

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:33.740
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Thank you.

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:37.470
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Thanks for coming.

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:40.250
Interesting factoid, my four-year-old
son has called your restaurant his favorite

00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:43.349
restaurant in
the world.

00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:45.130
He loves the beer garden.

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:46.230
You mentioned
collaborations.

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:51.760
Are there any collaborations that are up
coming that you can tell us about or ones

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.650
that you;re really hoping
to arrange?

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:59.650
&gt;&gt;Greg: We are -- where's my, coauthor Randy
Clemens is here by

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:00.650
the way.

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:01.650
Where is he?

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:02.650
There he is.

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:03.720
He's the coauthor of this book.

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.690
Everybody give Randy a hand.

00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:11.750
Randy works in PR with
us too.

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:15.020
So, it turns out I can so I will mention it.

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:18.089
There's the up coming the Alchemist which
is a great brewery

00:38:18.089 --> 00:38:19.220
in Vermont.

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:23.660
They sustained a lot of damage from
hurricane Irene.

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:29.190
And they contacted us about -- if we
could do something the to do some fund raising

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:32.830
for some
of the community out that way.

00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:38.040
And we decided because
the guy who runs the Alchemist is used to

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:41.549
work with Greg
Noonan at the Vermont Pub and Brewery.

00:38:41.549 --> 00:38:44.359
So I'm getting
beer geek on you guys.

00:38:44.359 --> 00:38:49.270
Greg Noonan's considered to be the person
who first created the black IPA style

00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:51.020
in 1990.

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:52.920
All the way back in 1990.

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:56.400
So we'll work with them.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:01.640
And Jamie Floyd from Ninkasi up in Eugene,
Oregon which is

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:06.950
up in the People's Republic of Cascadia.

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:09.079
Some folks
up there have called the black IPA style the

00:39:09.079 --> 00:39:10.230
the black Cascadian ale.

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:12.690
So we
thought we'd do this little solidarity thing.

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:16.119
So, long
story short, we created the together the More

00:39:16.119 --> 00:39:18.849
Brown than
Black IPA and it'll be out.

00:39:18.849 --> 00:39:20.609
Randy, when is it going to
be out?

00:39:20.609 --> 00:39:22.560
Couple of weeks?

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.980
&gt;&gt;Randy: December nineteenth.

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:24.980
December nineteenth.

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:25.980
&gt;&gt;Greg: December 19th.

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:26.980
There you go.

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:28.280
I think this is our first formal announcement
of that.

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:33.369
So I hope that's good answer.

00:39:33.369 --> 00:39:34.940
Cool.

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.890
If you want to
shout from the audience, I can repeat the

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:43.859
question for
everybody if you don't want to get up to the

00:39:43.859 --> 00:39:44.859
mic.

00:39:44.859 --> 00:39:45.859
&gt;&gt;Male #5: What's the worst beer you've ever
had and [inaudible].

00:39:45.859 --> 00:39:46.859
&gt;&gt;Greg: The worst beer that we've ever produced?

00:39:46.859 --> 00:39:47.859
&gt;&gt;Male #5: No, no, no.

00:39:47.859 --> 00:39:49.640
&gt;&gt;Greg: That I've ever tasted.

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:52.090
[laughter] The worst beer that I've ever
tasted.

00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:57.030
Unfortunately, I have to say that that's near
countless.

00:39:57.030 --> 00:40:02.240
But fortunately, not as countless as all
these incredible beers that I have also gotten

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.290
to taste.

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:06.390
I am not on the side of the fence that says
there's no

00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:07.640
such thing as a bad beer.

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:09.390
I can
tell you, I'm in the industry, there's lots

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:11.410
of really bad beer out there.

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:14.720
But
fortunately, today -- this is what's so wonderful

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.859
about
all this, there's more great beer than bad

00:40:17.859 --> 00:40:20.369
beer out there
by a wide margin.

00:40:20.369 --> 00:40:23.380
And the great beer out there is really
great.

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:26.640
So, I'm not going to name a particular brand
name.

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:29.020
But here's a challenge.

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:33.520
So much of the bad beer never
intended to be great.

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:37.420
They intended to fill a market --
what they consider to be a market need or

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:39.420
market niche or
market opportunity.

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:43.980
Essentially selling lowest common
denominator stuff to the masses.

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:48.200
So there was -- it's
not fair to point at it and say, "this is

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:51.789
a bad beer
because the brew master or somebody, an insider,

00:40:51.789 --> 00:40:54.349
would tell you
under their breath, it was never intended

00:40:54.349 --> 00:40:56.200
to be good.

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:58.869
It
was never intended to be great.

00:40:58.869 --> 00:40:59.869
Yeah.

00:40:59.869 --> 00:41:06.840
&gt;&gt;Male #6: So there's black IPAs and Belgian
IPAs.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:14.651
It seems like there's new
styles appearing especially with the long

00:41:14.651 --> 00:41:15.651
spectrum of
beer.

00:41:15.651 --> 00:41:16.651
What new styles are you excited about, are
you

00:41:16.651 --> 00:41:17.651
thinking about.

00:41:17.651 --> 00:41:18.651
&gt;&gt;Greg: So with black IPAs and Belgian IPAs
and all these new

00:41:18.651 --> 00:41:20.010
hybrid styles being created.

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:22.210
What am I excited about?

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:25.130
I
definitely got excited about black IPAs when

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:28.140
we first
came out with the Stone 11th Anniversary Ale

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:32.029
that is later
become brought to our full-time line up as

00:41:32.029 --> 00:41:36.170
Stone Sublimely Self-Righteous
which is a black IPA has become one of the

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:41.700
better known
black IPAs and the Stone Cali-Belgique IPA

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:44.510
which is our Belgian IPA.

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:47.589
One of the earlier versions available of that
style.

00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:53.839
God, what is coming up?

00:41:53.839 --> 00:42:00.799
You know, I just like that -- 15
years ago I had spent ten years learning about

00:42:00.799 --> 00:42:04.049
beer.

00:42:04.049 --> 00:42:05.210
Nearly ten years.

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:09.000
And I would have told you at that the time
we were starting Stone I felt that I knew

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.299
the complete
spectrum what was available and possible.

00:42:12.299 --> 00:42:13.680
What could be
done.

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:16.940
I was so ignorant.

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:22.349
And I am constantly delighted
and surprised to learn these crazy things

00:42:22.349 --> 00:42:23.480
that brewers
are doing.

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:27.240
I recently had a coffee IPA, you know?

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:29.890
A
coffee stout makes all kinds of sense.

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:31.540
The flavors
just meld naturally.

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:34.340
The coffee IPA took it in a
different direction.

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:38.700
It was delicious and I got to
contemplate that at 3 o'clock in the morning

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:43.039
as I was
still awake.

00:42:43.039 --> 00:42:54.270
So, you know, I have a very small batch of
Crime and Punishment coming out.

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:58.869
Punishment is Double
Bastard Ale with a ton of chili peppers from

00:42:58.869 --> 00:42:59.950
Stone Farm.

00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:04.150
So it's 11 percent really intense, 11 percent
really

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:07.010
strong Double Bastard Ale that we come out
with once a year in

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:12.510
November And we have a barrel aged version
with peppers from Stone

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:13.510
Farms.

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:15.790
And it is punishingly hot.

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:18.340
And it's -- so intense
in its flavor profile.

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:22.190
It's not like the fizzy yellow
beers with a chili dropped in which are kind

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:24.490
of one
dimensional.

00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:25.510
Learning.

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:27.650
I used to pooh pooh chili beers.

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:29.370
It's gimmicky.

00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:32.060
And now, I know, you know a lot of people
are

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:34.970
going to consider it gimmicky, that's fine,
but the flavors are really

00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:38.480
intense and deep and good.

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:39.480
Yes?

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:43.050
&gt;&gt;Male #7: So I just returned from a trip
to Belgium.

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:45.589
I've had
the good luck to attend an annual software

00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:47.240
conference
there.

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:51.020
And I made my annual pilgrimage to Cantillon
and

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:53.829
I want to defend the Europeans for a moment.

00:43:53.829 --> 00:43:56.299
The brew
master there does not think American craft

00:43:56.299 --> 00:43:57.299
brews suck.

00:43:57.299 --> 00:43:59.359
And in fact, he borrows ideas from them.

00:43:59.359 --> 00:44:02.230
They did a
collaboration beer this year with a grape

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:07.380
farmer in the Rennes Valley
. So you know, there are enlightened folks

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:08.380
there
too.

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:13.380
&gt;&gt;Greg: Yeah, I'm sorry if I didn't suggest
-- if I suggested

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:18.920
otherwise., you know,, John stayed at my house.

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:20.299
I've
been to Cantillon many times.

00:44:20.299 --> 00:44:23.080
My first time was 1995; I'm a die hard fan
of

00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:24.090
everything they do.

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:26.910
So just to set the record straight.

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:32.559
There are many, many, many small artisanal,
creative, craft-

00:44:32.559 --> 00:44:33.559
-brewing.

00:44:33.559 --> 00:44:35.470
You know with Cantillon , they would qualify
as

00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:39.400
being traditional because they are ultra traditional
incredible

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:40.589
breweries going on.

00:44:40.589 --> 00:44:44.640
But most Europeans drink industrial
stuff and he'll tell you that.

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:46.670
I have posted a video.

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:51.250
There's a YouTube video of a conversation
that I had at Moeder Lambic

00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:54.240
which is a place, a home if you will, the
tap house that has the

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:58.609
most Cantillon on tap in the world.

00:44:58.609 --> 00:45:01.349
And just a short
walk from Cantillon and I spent some time

00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:02.349
talking.

00:45:02.349 --> 00:45:04.089
You
want to hear people saying bad things about

00:45:04.089 --> 00:45:07.420
the European beer
industry and about the Belgian industry?

00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:09.950
Listen to those
guys and what they say and they're in Brussels.

00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:15.539
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Yeah, he told me lots of stories
too about how the amounts of sugars in the

00:45:15.539 --> 00:45:19.109
beer increase year by year to appeal to the
Pepsi generation.

00:45:19.109 --> 00:45:20.109
Same deal.

00:45:20.109 --> 00:45:22.450
&gt;&gt;Greg: Yeah, we're kindred spirits, definitely.

00:45:22.450 --> 00:45:23.450
I agree with you.

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:28.470
&gt;&gt;Male #8: Can you tell us a little bit more
about that decision

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:31.690
process of going from a beer enthusiast to
deciding you

00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:34.609
actually wanted to go into the business of
brewing beer,

00:45:34.609 --> 00:45:36.820
not just brewing beer.

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:41.539
&gt;&gt;Greg: It was a very challenging decision
for me, because I

00:45:41.539 --> 00:45:43.490
first discovered -- when I had my first Anchor
Steam that

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:47.329
was my first epiphany moment, enlightenment
moment in 1987.

00:45:47.329 --> 00:45:50.160
And we opened up Stone in
1996.

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.960
So there was a fair gap of time there.

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:56.960
There was
a -- I would say at least three years to even

00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:00.990
four years
where I climbed the cliff -- the mountain

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:02.279
of beer
knowledge.

00:46:02.279 --> 00:46:03.619
Not to the top.

00:46:03.619 --> 00:46:05.430
I'm still climbing that one.

00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:09.391
But I got high enough where it came time and
I was

00:46:09.391 --> 00:46:12.520
looking over the edge of actually doing it
and I walked

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:15.829
along that edge of 'do I dare take that leap.

00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:19.619
Do I dare
take that entrepreneurial business risk',

00:46:19.619 --> 00:46:21.220
everything else.

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:23.150
For several years I walked along that edge.

00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:24.809
Both Steve
and I did.

00:46:24.809 --> 00:46:27.980
Finally we just said we have to do this.

00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:29.720
We
felt compelled.

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:34.990
So it's hard to say there was that one
moment or one trigger point.

00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:36.630
We just continued to do it.

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:39.299
And
when I opened -- when we opened Stone in 1996,

00:46:39.299 --> 00:46:42.089
I thought
we were opening too late to make any level

00:46:42.089 --> 00:46:45.809
of a splash in
the beer industry at all, because the craft

00:46:45.809 --> 00:46:48.140
beer was so
dense at that time.

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:50.590
In fact, I love the Bay Area.

00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:53.570
And
at that time, I really wanted to continue

00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:55.380
living in the
Bay Area.

00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:57.799
But we did it in San Diego.

00:46:57.799 --> 00:47:01.400
I love San Diego
of course, but I thought it was too dense

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:02.400
in the Bay
Area.

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.859
It would be no chance to have success as a
small

00:47:04.859 --> 00:47:07.710
brewer in the Bay Area because there are too
many.

00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:10.869
Now
today, I believe, if you follow that other

00:47:10.869 --> 00:47:15.500
model that I
showed of not sucking following your passion.

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:17.750
If you do a great
job, you can be successful.

00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:20.680
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Thank you.

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:22.880
&gt;&gt;Male #8: Yeah.

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:24.349
All right.

00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:26.559
I just moved out here not too long
ago from the east coast.

00:47:26.559 --> 00:47:30.050
So I've been following Sam and all
his delicious beers for some time and Victory

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:32.210
as well and some of the others out there.

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:33.210
I came out here.

00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:34.619
I was concerned I wasn't going to find these
good beers.

00:47:34.619 --> 00:47:37.200
Then I discovered there's a lot.

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:40.430
As you were just saying, there's a lot of
really good beers out here.

00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:43.280
There doesn't seem to be a lot of crossover
between the east coast and west coast beers.

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.960
A lot of the beers I find here, I didn't find
there on the shelves out there.

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:48.980
And I do find Dogfish Head here a little bit
but only a couple of their varieties.

00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:54.190
Are we still just fairly regional or is it
just difficult to distribute?

00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:56.849
Is there some difference in taste from east
to west coast?

00:47:56.849 --> 00:48:02.339
&gt;&gt;Greg: Yes, yes, yes and plus many other
points on the laundry

00:48:02.339 --> 00:48:05.869
list of the challenges of the beer industry
and beer

00:48:05.869 --> 00:48:06.869
distribution.

00:48:06.869 --> 00:48:13.750
But it does seem to be that west to east
for craft beers flows easier.

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:18.579
You'll find more west
coast beers on the east coast or in the Midwest

00:48:18.579 --> 00:48:19.579
and the
east coast.

00:48:19.579 --> 00:48:24.550
And you'll find a little smaller flow this
direction.

00:48:24.550 --> 00:48:30.200
Traditionally -- traditionally is 15 years
ago, 20 years ago, even today.

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:35.641
East coast breweries have
tended to often make what I will define as

00:48:35.641 --> 00:48:39.440
more polite
beer versus the beers -- I will be the first

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:42.500
to admit at
Stone we make many beers that are considerably

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:45.720
not
polite.

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:50.769
And and so, the polite beers don't tend to
gravitate as much.

00:48:50.769 --> 00:48:56.299
If you're in California and you know
San Diego, you become this superhop head like

00:48:56.299 --> 00:48:58.359
many of us
have become.

00:48:58.359 --> 00:49:03.369
We can appreciate and enjoy those beers,
but we really gravitate back to something

00:49:03.369 --> 00:49:05.549
that's "Ooh yeah".

00:49:05.549 --> 00:49:09.260
Are
you finding yourself that way as you've developed

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:14.559
your
knowledge curve of west coast beers and breweries

00:49:14.559 --> 00:49:18.630
and
have you made a trip back and said "wow this

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:21.589
beer just
doesn't taste the same as it used to to me".

00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:24.529
&gt;&gt;Male #8: I actually haven't been out here
long enough to properly say

00:49:24.529 --> 00:49:25.529
that I suppose.

00:49:25.529 --> 00:49:26.910
I haven't been back to the east coast yet,

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:28.260
since I've come here.

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:29.490
There are just so many out
here.

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:30.519
I haven't tried everything yet.

00:49:30.519 --> 00:49:34.559
But I have
noticed there is sort of a difference in flavor.

00:49:34.559 --> 00:49:37.290
Some of
the east coast beers are maybe a little smoother

00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:38.290
perhaps.

00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:39.290
&gt;&gt;Greg: Smoother -- polite.

00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:43.460
&gt;&gt;Male #8: Even Dogfish Head which is fairly
aggressive.

00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:49.099
It's I
just had some of your IPA and it's a crisper

00:49:49.099 --> 00:49:50.510
sort of
flavor.

00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:53.059
&gt;&gt;Greg: A little more hop forward.

00:49:53.059 --> 00:49:55.310
I will often joke with
Sam.

00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:58.440
When Sam's over brewing at our place.

00:49:58.440 --> 00:49:59.440
We brewed
together before.

00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:04.700
And he'll be out this coming April
brewing with us.

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:08.349
And I know I'll still make the same
crack when we're putting in the hops.

00:50:08.349 --> 00:50:12.589
I'll remind him --
Sam, these are hops. [laughter] He'll be,

00:50:12.589 --> 00:50:14.309
"yeah, Greg I know".

00:50:14.309 --> 00:50:17.640
&gt;&gt;Male #8: This is the guy who says continually
hop.

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:18.890
Just
throwing it, and throwing it, and throwing

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:19.890
it.

00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:21.960
&gt;&gt;Greg: Yeah, it's good natured ribbing, of
course, amongst friends.

00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:22.960
Thank you.

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:24.190
&gt;&gt;Male #8: All right.

00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:25.190
Thanks.

00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:26.190
&gt;&gt;Male #9: Hi.

00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:27.190
Thanks for coming.

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:30.590
I just want to say your
Russian Imperial Stout is what dreams are

00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:31.590
made of.

00:50:31.590 --> 00:50:33.230
It's
one of the best ones out there.

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:37.059
But quick question for
you about kind of the limited release beers

00:50:37.059 --> 00:50:38.380
that we've
seen a trend of.

00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:40.049
Cigar City has their Hunahpu's Day.

00:50:40.049 --> 00:50:42.529
Russian River has their Pliny the Younger.

00:50:42.529 --> 00:50:43.529
Stuff like that.

00:50:43.529 --> 00:50:46.700
And then, outside of that you're seeing
like some of those beers people get them and

00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:49.539
then hork
them on Ebay for 70 dollars.

00:50:49.539 --> 00:50:52.099
What's your take on, you
know, people starting to do that in limited

00:50:52.099 --> 00:50:54.650
allocation
for limited and rare beers.

00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:56.990
&gt;&gt;Greg: Limited and rare beers.

00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:58.140
It's a double-edged sword.

00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:01.590
On the great side of the equation, it's really
special

00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:06.130
stuff, brewed and available to über enthusiasts
who really

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:10.010
love all the nuances and differences and enjoy
being part

00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:13.569
of the culture of limited releases.

00:51:13.569 --> 00:51:15.940
And then, on the
other side -- the negative side -- is when

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:20.490
people, against
the wishes of the brewer, maybe will rebottle

00:51:20.490 --> 00:51:25.410
it, put it in a growler,
put it on Ebay, ship it off and then when

00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:31.140
the person gets it,
they're getting a distant shadow of what the

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:33.030
quality,
because the quality was damaged along the

00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:34.030
way.

00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:38.039
It violates
sort of the honor amongst -- honor to the

00:51:38.039 --> 00:51:41.250
brewer and
that's the negative side.

00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:47.020
And so, hey, name things in
life that don't have a positive side and a

00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:49.720
negative side
to them.

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:51.029
So this is no different.

00:51:51.029 --> 00:51:53.079
So I would -- I
support it.

00:51:53.079 --> 00:51:57.029
I support this idea of being able to go in
all these great directions.

00:51:57.029 --> 00:52:01.279
Sometimes I'll see a
beer enthusiast forum posts and somebody say

00:52:01.279 --> 00:52:03.569
there's just
too many hoppy beers out there.

00:52:03.569 --> 00:52:06.030
Well, if craft beers are
five percent.

00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:10.430
Really über hoppy beers of that five
percent are, I'm going to take a wild stab

00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:12.890
and say, "two
percent?"

00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:16.339
So now we're talking two percent of five
percent and so on.

00:52:16.339 --> 00:52:20.460
So they're complaining about the 0.1
percent of stuff.

00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:21.630
Hey, don't complain.

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:25.059
If there's 0.1
percent of this great wide variety but it

00:52:25.059 --> 00:52:27.900
only makes up this
tiny little slice of the market, celebrate

00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:30.920
the fact that we've
been able to diversify and get that geeked

00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:31.920
out.

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:34.750
That's
how I see it.

00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:37.940
&gt;&gt;Male #9: Cool, thank you.

00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:40.819
&gt;&gt;Male #10: Hey, thanks for coming out here
again.

00:52:40.819 --> 00:52:43.980
Just have a
discussion about what the market dynamics

00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:45.029
I guess of
gear.

00:52:45.029 --> 00:52:48.740
I really like your philosophy of not listening
to

00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:52.740
focus groups and really making what you believe
is best.

00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:55.380
Do you think that there's an opportunity for
craft beer

00:52:55.380 --> 00:53:00.200
to, like, take away some of the larger macro
market even

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:03.170
more so than it has by, you know, just kind
of like

00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:05.800
educating people on this is what beer can
actually

00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:06.800
be.

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:10.140
Or do you think it's more of an enthusiast
this is

00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:13.430
what I believe in my customer base.

00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:17.530
Do you think there's
any way through sponsoring sports events or

00:53:17.530 --> 00:53:22.420
things like that to where people
could just improve their perception of what

00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:23.420
beer is.

00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:28.480
&gt;&gt;Greg: So I use this old joke.

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:31.119
How many psychiatrists does
it take to change a light bulb?

00:53:31.119 --> 00:53:37.510
The answer is one but the
light bulb has to want to change.

00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:43.380
So if you try the
to go out to the masses and say change, change,

00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:44.539
change, and
they're like huh?

00:53:44.539 --> 00:53:45.539
Whatever.

00:53:45.539 --> 00:53:46.539
Leave me alone, kid.

00:53:46.539 --> 00:53:47.809
I'm just
paying attention to the ball game and I just

00:53:47.809 --> 00:53:50.660
want to do
what I've always done with my buddies then

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:52.380
I'm not here
to think about it.

00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:54.150
They're not interested in it.

00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:56.420
So
what we do -- I think what craft beer does

00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:59.859
really well at
is, we make ourselves readily available to

00:53:59.859 --> 00:54:01.890
those who are
interested in change.

00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:02.890
You know what?

00:54:02.890 --> 00:54:04.060
A friend of mine
introduced me.

00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:05.060
I went to a bar.

00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:09.250
I decided on a lark to
actually pick something different off of the

00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:12.769
shelf one
time and something clicked just a little bit

00:54:12.769 --> 00:54:16.450
and now I'd
like to know more.

00:54:16.450 --> 00:54:19.619
And now, there's a lot of avenues to
learn more.

00:54:19.619 --> 00:54:23.589
You can only go out to public so much and
actually get them to pay attention.

00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:27.309
Of course, we have a
very noisy world out there.

00:54:27.309 --> 00:54:33.059
So I think that, you know,
it's -- craft beer is growing so much because

00:54:33.059 --> 00:54:36.780
we --
collective we -- that includes you guys -- great

00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:37.780
beer
bars.

00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:39.920
Great beer shops.

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:41.180
Great online resources.

00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:42.770
Beer
Advocate and Rate Beer.

00:54:42.770 --> 00:54:43.869
Twitter feeds.

00:54:43.869 --> 00:54:47.050
And Google plus
what you're doing with some of your initiatives

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:48.539
and
existing initiatives.

00:54:48.539 --> 00:54:53.720
All of these things allow people
to communicate and it's spreading like wild

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:54.720
fire.

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:57.720
So I
see this exponential curve coming.

00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:02.230
And also, to close
this -- my response to you -- is that today

00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:05.839
a lot of the
decision makers at bars and restaurants, at

00:55:05.839 --> 00:55:10.619
markets and
grocery stores are now digital natives in

00:55:10.619 --> 00:55:11.619
craft beer.

00:55:11.619 --> 00:55:13.510
They grew up in craft beer.

00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:18.000
And so, the old guard as it
changes over who didn't know about didn't

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.269
care about is
being replaced by buyers and decision makers

00:55:21.269 --> 00:55:25.039
in our lives
that affect the behind the scenes equation

00:55:25.039 --> 00:55:28.400
that you guys
don't see and they're craft beer enthusiasts

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:30.730
and it's
being reflected.

00:55:30.730 --> 00:55:32.340
So that's a great thing.

00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:34.170
That
exponential shift is coming.

00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:39.809
We're growing and I think
we're going to be like hold on.

00:55:39.809 --> 00:55:41.470
We're going to start
feeling some G force.

00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:43.660
&gt;&gt;Male #10: Okay, thank you.

00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:47.130
&gt;&gt;Male #11: Yeah, this is kind of a segue
to your previous

00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:48.150
question.

00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:49.150
Craft beer is growing so much.

00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:50.150
You've been in the industry for a while.

00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:53.170
You showed the
graph earlier about the macro group.

00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:55.070
Market share going
down.

00:55:55.070 --> 00:55:57.890
What are Budweiser and AnBev and those type
of people.

00:55:57.890 --> 00:56:00.400
What's their reaction to the growth of craft
beer.

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:03.599
Do
you ever think that they would actually change

00:56:03.599 --> 00:56:06.789
their beer
to be better or would they just more diversify

00:56:06.789 --> 00:56:07.789
by doing.

00:56:07.789 --> 00:56:12.509
&gt;&gt;Greg: There are certain things I won't say
online or in

00:56:12.509 --> 00:56:13.680
public.

00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:16.809
So, let me -- I'm going to try my best to
answer

00:56:16.809 --> 00:56:17.809
that.

00:56:17.809 --> 00:56:20.240
I cannot speak for the big industrial brewers.

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:23.839
But here's -- there's a fundamental dividing
line and it

00:56:23.839 --> 00:56:27.779
doesn't matter whether it's beer, cheese,
restaurants,

00:56:27.779 --> 00:56:29.750
coffee, etcetera.

00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:33.150
There's commodity side and there's
artisanal side.

00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:35.980
They behave very, very differently.

00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:41.820
So, artisinal side,
sometimes will make a mistake and try and

00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:42.960
behave
commodity.

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:47.099
You see a great craft beer you respect and
all of a sudden you go to a promo night at

00:56:47.099 --> 00:56:49.650
a bar and
they've got hired models giving out blinky

00:56:49.650 --> 00:56:50.650
key chains.

00:56:50.650 --> 00:56:51.980
That would be an example.

00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:54.510
And you're like going what's
going on?

00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:55.740
Where did you go wrong?

00:56:55.740 --> 00:57:01.589
And/or, a really big
brewer coming out with something über hoppy,

00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:03.880
which I
don't think they would.

00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:07.520
You know their customer base
doesn't understand it.

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:13.279
And the core customer base are
like don't worry, I'll drink my local one

00:57:13.279 --> 00:57:20.670
instead or the guys
that I believe in.

00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:26.000
In the case of the big brewers, big
brewers in this country are focusing more

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.069
on emerging
markets.

00:57:27.069 --> 00:57:33.510
If you look at it from the stock prices, the
global portfolio and the global direction,

00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:35.619
their growth
is not in the United States.

00:57:35.619 --> 00:57:40.880
Their growth is in the
emerging markets of China, India, and other

00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:41.880
places.

00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:44.160
And
Russia.

00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:48.090
And so, they speak -- you know, I speak in
IBUs

00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:51.319
and they speak in billions of dollars.

00:57:51.319 --> 00:57:54.019
And so, we use a
different language -- commodity language and

00:57:54.019 --> 00:57:55.450
artisanal
language.

00:57:55.450 --> 00:58:04.289
Their -- Anheuser Busch AnBev, . I'm not
speaking for that company.

00:58:04.289 --> 00:58:08.880
I believe this is what I've
read that they are down in their numbers and

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:11.270
they're up
in their profits.

00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:18.569
So they're spending less money trying
to generate or grow the U.S. market and they're

00:58:18.569 --> 00:58:21.390
kind of
taking money out and putting it into emerging

00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:24.769
markets
where the real growth is.

00:58:24.769 --> 00:58:26.579
That's what I've understood as
I've read.

00:58:26.579 --> 00:58:30.339
Again, I'm not speaking for any of those
companies.

00:58:30.339 --> 00:58:31.869
Can't do that.

00:58:31.869 --> 00:58:36.839
&gt;&gt;Male #10: Oh cool, thanks
&gt;&gt;Male #11: So you talked a little bit about

00:58:36.839 --> 00:58:40.990
bringing back some of
your collaboration.

00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:42.109
Or one specifically.

00:58:42.109 --> 00:58:43.970
But I'm
wondering if you had any thoughts of bringing

00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:46.950
back the
other ones that you've done over the years

00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:49.970
since I didn't
manage to get enough bottles of some of them

00:58:49.970 --> 00:58:53.400
in would
really like a way to replenish my supply especially

00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:57.000
the
Scotch Ale from earlier this year.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.890
&gt;&gt;Greg: Well, that one -- okay, so you're
talking about the.

00:59:00.890 --> 00:59:02.109
&gt;&gt;Male #11: Highway 78.

00:59:02.109 --> 00:59:12.240
&gt;&gt;Greg: So that was a collaboration we did
with Firestone Walker and, Randy, help.

00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:13.819
My brain just went away.

00:59:13.819 --> 00:59:15.359
Where is he?

00:59:15.359 --> 00:59:16.869
He can't help.

00:59:16.869 --> 00:59:17.880
He left.

00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:18.880
That's what I'm
trying to come up with.

00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:20.710
Yeah, the Highway 78 Scotch Ale.

00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:21.799
Green
flash.

00:59:21.799 --> 00:59:23.440
Pizza Port Carlsbad.

00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:24.440
Stone.

00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:25.920
Highway 78 Scotch Ale.

00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:33.740
So we intended to originally with the
original recipe age it in scotch whiskey barrels

00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:35.630
that
didn't arrive in time.

00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:40.029
So, when they did arrive, we
decided to rebrew it and it's been sitting

00:59:40.029 --> 00:59:42.359
in the barrels
since this past spring.

00:59:42.359 --> 00:59:43.579
&gt;&gt;Male #11: Where exactly?

00:59:43.579 --> 00:59:46.839
Do you have latitude and longitude?

00:59:46.839 --> 00:59:53.329
&gt;&gt;Greg: [laughter] At Stone try your best.

00:59:53.329 --> 00:59:59.680
So, we will be
re-releasing a barrel aged version of that

00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:00.680
this coming
spring.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:01.680
&gt;&gt;Male #12: Google maps will help you
[laughter]

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:02.680
&gt;&gt;Male #11: What about some of the other ones.

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:06.230
&gt;&gt;Greg: I would say that, you know, 99 percent
of our

01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:09.890
collaboration beers are vertical epic series
beers.

01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:11.599
None
of the vertical epic series do we ever plan

01:00:11.599 --> 01:00:12.789
to brew.

01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:14.910
That's
kind of what that was all about.

01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:16.690
One time things.

01:00:16.690 --> 01:00:20.230
Our
anniversary beers or special one ups.

01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:25.200
Most will never be rebrewed so we can
go brew a new favorite.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:29.210
Every once in awhile, like the Stone 11th
Anniversary Ale became the Stone Sublimely

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:30.210
Self-righteous Ale.

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:36.740
Every once in awhile we redo it or
the Saison du Buff.

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:43.780
But the book has a lot of home brew
recipes for that stuff so you can do it yourself.

01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:45.640
&gt;&gt;Male #11: Thanks.

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:48.599
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: We've got to stop there,
but thanks again for coming.

01:00:48.599 --> 01:00:49.599
&gt;&gt;Greg: Yeah, thank you guys.

01:00:49.599 --> 01:00:49.600
[Applause]
