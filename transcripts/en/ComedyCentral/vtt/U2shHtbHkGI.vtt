00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:04.070
And who is Donald Trump
to be lecturing anyone

00:00:04.103 --> 00:00:06.105
on the treatment of women?

00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:08.107
I mean, between Rosie O'Donnell
and Megyn Kelly,

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.576
I wouldn't exactly say
he's woke on feminism.

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:13.980
Well, here to explain himself,
please welcome Donald Trump.

00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:16.950
(applause and cheering)

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:23.756 line:0%
Your viewers thank you
for having me, Larry.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.692
(laughter)

00:00:26.725 --> 00:00:30.563 line:0%
By the way, happy Mother's Day
to all of the mothers out there,

00:00:30.596 --> 00:00:35.134 line:0%
except the unbelievably mean,
nasty enabler ones.

00:00:35.167 --> 00:00:37.203
Okay, see, see,
that's what I'm...

00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:39.505
That's... that is
completely uncalled for.

00:00:39.538 --> 00:00:42.108
So, listen, why are you blaming
Hillary Clinton

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:43.776
for what her husband did?

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.845
Larry, this election
is a clear choice

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:49.148
between someone
who treats women with class

00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:51.317
-(laughter)
-and those nasty...

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.019
horrible Clintons.

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:56.489
I mean, they're really nasty.
I mean, they're terrible people.

00:00:56.522 --> 00:00:59.492
I said that even back
when I gave them lots of money.

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:02.095
-I mean, I gave them a lot
of money. -Okay. All right.

00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:03.629
Okay, how can you say that?

00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:05.832
I don't know how that's
coming out of your mouth.

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:07.266
Look, you're
on your third marriage,

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.936
and in your book, you even
bragged about infidelities.

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:15.141
Because when your mistresses are
as unbelievably hot as mine...

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:17.577
(laughter, groaning, shouting)

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.612
And they really are hot.

00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:21.781
I mean, unbelievable.
I mean...

00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:24.951
You don't keep that to yourself.
I'm not selfish.

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:27.120
This is what
I'm talking about! See?

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:29.989
I-I don't know how you can say
you're better at treating women

00:01:30.022 --> 00:01:32.358
than Hillary when you say
horrible things like this.

00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:34.060
-Excuse me, excuse me.
-What? What?

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:36.062
I treat my<i> wives</i> horribly.

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:38.064
Okay? There's a difference.

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:40.066
(laughter, shouting, groaning)

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:43.002
But when they're not my wives,
I treat them like queens.

00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:44.704
I mean, every year
for Christmas--

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.706
and I do mean Christmas,
not holidays--

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:49.976
-What...
-my mistresses and exes

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.478
get a box of Trump steaks...

00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:56.015
-(laughter)
-and a beautiful off-brand

00:01:56.048 --> 00:01:57.583
flat-screen TV.

00:01:57.616 --> 00:01:59.819
They're spoiled,
they're spoiled.

00:01:59.852 --> 00:02:01.988
I'm sure they appreciate it.

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:03.890
Look, but let's get back
to Hillary.

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:05.324
How is she an enabler?

00:02:05.357 --> 00:02:07.360
Isn't she the victim
of her husband's infidelity?

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:09.462
I'll tell you who
the real victims are here--

00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:10.830
Bill's mistresses.

00:02:10.863 --> 00:02:12.999
I mean, do they get steaks?
I don't think so.

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:15.234
-Okay?
-(laughter)

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:17.803
And I could have gotten him
a bulk discount.

00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:19.572
Believe me,
I'm very good at business.

00:02:19.605 --> 00:02:21.340
-Okay?
-Okay. This is insane.

00:02:21.373 --> 00:02:24.043
Nobody wants a bulk discount
on your steaks, all right?

00:02:24.076 --> 00:02:27.413
And how can bringing all this up
be a good election strategy?

00:02:27.446 --> 00:02:28.915
You've said horrible things

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:31.050
about every woman
you've come across.<i> Everyone.</i>

00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:33.986
Not true, Larry.
My daughter, Ivanka, okay?

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.655
(loud groaning, shouting)

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:39.425
I mean, it's like
God created an angel,

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:41.861
an angel to have sex with.

00:02:41.894 --> 00:02:44.463
-I mean, beautiful, beautiful.
-Oh, that's... -(jeering)

00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:46.933
Of course, we all know
I can't have sex with her,

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:49.402
obviously, because, you know,
I'm running for president.

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:51.371
(laughter)

00:02:53.205 --> 00:02:55.308
Okay, that is
completely disgusting.

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:58.274
Donald Trump, everybody.
We'll be right back.
