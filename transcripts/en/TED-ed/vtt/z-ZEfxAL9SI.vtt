00:00:06.865 --> 00:00:08.785
For your son’s sixth birthday,

00:00:08.785 --> 00:00:13.095
you’ve promised to get him the cutest 
creature in creation:

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:14.551
the cuddly.

00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:17.971
It’s hard to believe that it’s a cousin of
the terrifying duddly

00:00:17.971 --> 00:00:19.871
or the hideous fuddly.

00:00:19.871 --> 00:00:22.561
They’re all members of the Wuddly species,

00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:27.381
and the process of adopting 
them is deeply peculiar.

00:00:27.384 --> 00:00:32.524
It takes 100 eggs to make a single 
animal in genus Wuddly.

00:00:32.524 --> 00:00:35.603
When 100 eggs are placed together 
in an incubator,

00:00:35.603 --> 00:00:40.583
they undergo egg fusion, and combine 
in the following way.

00:00:40.583 --> 00:00:43.523
Blue and purple combine to make red eggs.

00:00:43.523 --> 00:00:46.313
Red and blue combine to make purple eggs,

00:00:46.313 --> 00:00:49.643
and red and purple 
combine to make blue eggs.

00:00:49.643 --> 00:00:52.523
The most plentiful eggs pair up first,

00:00:52.523 --> 00:00:54.253
and if two piles are even,

00:00:54.253 --> 00:00:57.253
an egg comes from one of them at random.

00:00:57.253 --> 00:01:00.243
They keep combining until 
there’s just one left.

00:01:00.243 --> 00:01:02.263
If the final egg is blue,

00:01:02.263 --> 00:01:04.343
a Cuddly hatches out of it.

00:01:04.343 --> 00:01:06.383
Purple eggs give you Duddlies,

00:01:06.383 --> 00:01:09.293
and Red eggs give you Fuddlies.

00:01:09.293 --> 00:01:13.064
The incubator currently has 99 eggs in it.

00:01:13.064 --> 00:01:18.474
23 are blue, 33 are purple, 
and 43 are red.

00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:24.694
You can begin the process of egg fusion
by adding an egg of any color to the room.

00:01:24.694 --> 00:01:27.884
When all the eggs have combined
into a single egg,

00:01:27.884 --> 00:01:31.974
the creature that hatches will bond 
with you on sight,

00:01:31.974 --> 00:01:34.724
which is why getting a Cuddly 
is so important.

00:01:34.724 --> 00:01:37.744
After all, you made a promise to your son.

00:01:37.744 --> 00:01:41.404
Which color egg should you add 
to the incubator to get a cuddly?

00:01:41.404 --> 00:01:44.314
Pause the video to figure it out 
for yourself.

00:01:44.314 --> 00:01:45.674
Answer in 3

00:01:45.674 --> 00:01:47.244
Answer in 2

00:01:47.244 --> 00:01:49.174
Answer in 1

00:01:49.174 --> 00:01:53.044
It’s easy to get mixed up with all the
cuddlies, duddlies, and fuddlies

00:01:53.044 --> 00:01:54.944
coming from different colored eggs.

00:01:54.944 --> 00:01:58.454
If we ignore how many total eggs
of each color there are,

00:01:58.454 --> 00:02:01.524
and just look at the 
process of egg fusion,

00:02:01.524 --> 00:02:04.984
we might notice something that 
will make this problem simpler.

00:02:04.984 --> 00:02:06.614
When two eggs fuse,

00:02:06.614 --> 00:02:10.844
the number of eggs of each of those 
colors decreases by one,

00:02:10.844 --> 00:02:14.284
and the number of the third 
color increases by one.

00:02:14.284 --> 00:02:17.014
That means they all change parity,

00:02:17.014 --> 00:02:20.814
or evenness and oddness, 
at the same time.

00:02:20.814 --> 00:02:25.954
Right now all three piles are odd, 
but you get to add an egg to one color,

00:02:25.954 --> 00:02:30.154
which means that it’ll be even 
and the other two will be odd.

00:02:30.154 --> 00:02:31.766
Whichever color you choose

00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:36.356
will always be the opposite parity 
of the other two piles:

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:39.028
odd when they’re even and 
even when they’re odd,

00:02:39.028 --> 00:02:43.998
since every egg fusion flips each pile’s 
parity simultaneously.

00:02:43.998 --> 00:02:51.163
We want to end with 1 blue, 0 purple,
and 0 red eggs, or odd, even, even.

00:02:51.163 --> 00:02:54.843
That means we want the blue egg pile 
to be the opposite parity

00:02:54.843 --> 00:02:58.353
of the other two piles 
at the start as well.

00:02:58.353 --> 00:03:00.733
So you add a blue egg into the room,

00:03:00.733 --> 00:03:02.933
and 99 egg fusions later,

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:06.063
only a single blue egg remains.

00:03:06.063 --> 00:03:10.673
The Cuddly that hatches is sure to make 
your 6-year-old as happy as can be.

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:13.367
Just be sure to follow the 
shopkeeper’s warning,

00:03:13.367 --> 00:03:15.427
and never feed it after midnight.
