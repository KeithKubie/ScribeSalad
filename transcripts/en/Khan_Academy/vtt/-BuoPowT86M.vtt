00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.030
We are asked to find
the equation that

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.870
represents this line.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.020
And the easiest type of equation
to find out based on

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.510
just being given a line
is an equation in the

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.280
slope-intercept form, which is y
is equal to mx plus b, where

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.940
m is the slope and b is the
y-intercept, the y-value of

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.240
the coordinate where our graph
intersects the y-axis.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.340
So the y-intercept is
very easy to find.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.600
We can actually figure it out
just by inspecting our graph.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.300
We intersect the y-axis.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.840
That's the y-axis right there.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.040
It wasn't labeled.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.130
Right there, at the point
x is equal to 0.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.370
x is always going to be equal
to 0 at the y-axis.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.750
So x is equal to 0,
y is equal to 3.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.500
So our y-intercept is 3.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.640
And it makes complete sense.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.990
If x is equal to 0, y is equal
to 3, so b is equal to 3.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.680
Now the next thing we need to do
is figure out the slope of

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.340
this line, figure out what m
is going to be equal to.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.870
And remember, slope, which is
the same thing as our m or

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.320
what m represents, that is
our change in y for a

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.390
given change in x.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.420
So let's go from this point to
some other point where we can

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.290
definitely figure out its
coordinates, so that looks

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.910
like a nice integer coordinate
right there.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.510
And let's figure out what our
change in y and our change in

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.860
x was to get there.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.880
So our change in x, we're
starting here at x is equal to

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.150
0, we're moving in the positive
x direction by five.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.160
So our change in x
is equal to 5.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.710
One, two, three, four, five.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.600
We went from x is equal to
0 to x is equal to 5.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.610
So our change in x
is equal to 5.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.990
That's our change in x.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.030
Now, what's our change in y?

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.830
Well, we have to go down two, so
our change in y-- when our

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.660
change in x is positive 5, our
change in y is negative 2.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.870
We're going down.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.690
We're decreasing in y, so our
change in y is negative 2.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.280
So our slope is negative 2/5.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.700
So we figured out the slope.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.010
We figured out the
y-intercept.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.710
We can now write the equation
that represents this line.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:26.130
It is y is equal to, this
character,, negative 2/5 times

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.030
x, that's m right there,
plus b. b is 3.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.150
And we are done!
