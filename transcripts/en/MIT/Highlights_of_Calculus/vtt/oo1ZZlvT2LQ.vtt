00:00:24.206 --> 00:00:25.800
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.460
Well, this is exponential day,
the day for the function that

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.850
only calculus could create,
y is e to the x.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.700
And it couldn't have come from
algebra because, however we

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.620
approach e to the x, there's
some limiting step.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.190
Something goes to 0.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.400
Something goes to infinity.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.170
I've got different ways to reach
e to the x, but all of

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.810
them involve that limiting
process, which we haven't

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.160
discussed in full.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.100
Let me come back at a later
time to the whole theory,

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.630
discussion of limits and just
go forward here with this

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.360
highly important function.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.930
And I'd like to start with
its most important

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.320
property, which is--

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.350
so it has this remarkable
property that its slope is

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.600
equal to itself.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.250
That's what is special
about e to the x.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.550
The slope is equal
to the function.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:51.486
Now, I have to admit that if we
had a function like that, y

00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:55.950
equals e to the x, then 2e to
the x, x would work just as

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.450
well, or 10e to the x.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.720
Those would--

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.600
the factor 2 or the factor 10
would be in y and it would

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.600
also be in the slope and
it would cancel and--

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.310
this is a differential
equation, our first

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.360
differential equation.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.060
A differential equation is an
equation that involves, as

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.910
this one does, the function
and the slope.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:24.720
It connects them.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.040
And that's the fantastic
description of nature, is by

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.580
differential equations.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.180
So it's great to see this one
early and it's the most

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.170
important one.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.210
When you get this one,
you've got a whole

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.510
lot of others solved.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.210
OK.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.080
But I needed to give it a
starting point so that the

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.220
solution would be e to the
x and not 10e to the x.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.960
So where should I start it?

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.700
Well if I want it to be an e to
the x, then when x is 0, e

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.490
to the 0 power, some number to
the 0 power, is always 1.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:13.980
So let me start this y equals
1 at x equals 0.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.390
Differential equations, you have
to tell where they begin.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.800
So that's our starting point.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.070
And do you see what
this means?

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.720
This means that it
starts at 1.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.760
And what's it's slope at
the starting point?

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.200
The slope is also 1.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.720
So it's climbing.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.680
As it climbs--

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.330
so y gets larger because it's
got a positive slope.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.940
As y gets larger, the
slope gets larger.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.080
So it climbs faster.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.560
And then it's gone higher, y is
bigger, the slope is equal,

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.350
so the slope is also bigger,
so it climbs even faster.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.600
It just takes off.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.590
It climbs much faster than
x to the 100th power.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.150
You might think x to
the 100th, that's

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.760
climbing pretty well.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.115
2 to the 100th, 10 to the
100th, but now way.

00:04:14.115 --> 00:04:20.203
It doesn't come close
to keeping up with y

00:04:20.203 --> 00:04:21.453
equals e to the x.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.390
OK.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.300
I've got several things to do.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.530
And one more thing I have to
do, this is a key property,

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.310
but there's another key property
that is true for any

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.740
2 to the x, 3 to the
x, e to the x.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.370
And that key property
is also to show--

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:52.713
I have to show this, that my
function, e to the x, times e

00:04:52.713 --> 00:04:58.892
to the possibly a different
x is equal to--

00:04:58.892 --> 00:05:02.020
do you know what we want here?

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.830
This has got to come out of the

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.930
construction, out of this property.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.260
It's got to come--

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.950
but we want this to deserve,
to be called some number to

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.360
the x power.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.450
If we take some number x times
multiplied by that same number

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.190
capital x times, then
we've got that

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.100
number how many times?

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.860
x plus capital x.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.220
So that's a key property
to be proved.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.150
So what will I do?

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.050
Let me summarize in advance,
outline in advance.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:47.660
I'm going to construct this
function from its property.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:54.030
Then I'm going check that it's
got this property, that

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.690
important equality there.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.160
Then, of course,
I'll graph it.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.830
I'll figure out what e is, and
I'll say something about cases

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.770
where this comes up.

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.380
I could even say something right
away about, where does

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:14.620
this happen that growth is equal
or proportional to the

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.870
function itself?

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:24.010
It happens with interest,
with money in a bank.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:29.260
When you get interest, the
interest is proportional, of

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.050
course, the amount there.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.680
And if they add that interest
in, if you don't take it out

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.440
and spend it but you compound
it, put it in there, then you

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.170
have more money.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.990
When they compute the interest
again, it's computed on that

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:50.470
larger amount and is more
interest than the first time.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.820
And so it goes.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:07:00.400
So money in the bank is a case
of exponential growth.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.820
A hedge fund grows faster than
our bank account does, but all

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.410
following e to the x.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.400
If you just hang on long enough,
you're way up there.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.770
OK.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.120
So here's my job.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.120
Follow this rule and start
at y equals 1.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.990
So can I just do it this way?

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.610
Here is my function, y of x,
that I want to construct.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:28.410
I want to build that function.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:31.120
And I know that it
starts at 1.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.760
But it's going to have
some more things.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.200
Now, this has to equal dy dx.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.720
These have to be the same.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.870
That's my rule.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:52.780
So dy dx is going to
start with a 1.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:08:00.370
But now I can't stop because
if the derivative is a 1, I

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:01.150
better put--

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:06.260
I have to put an x up
here so that its

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.280
derivative will be 1, right?

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.680
Its slope will be 1.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.340
That's that steadily climbing
x whose slope is 1.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:21.650
But now, these are supposed
to be equal again.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:26.100
So I have to put this
x also here.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:31.380
But now, I've got to add
something more on the top so

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.669
that the slope will
be 1 plus x.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:36.220
The slope of the x was 1.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:41.460
What do I need here to give
the slope to be x?

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:47.660
Remember, x squared had the
slope 2x, so I need half of x

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.710
squared so that I'll have 1x.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:54.310
So I need a half of x squared.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.730
Good.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:57.880
The slope of that is this.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.740
But I'm also trying to get
the 2 to be equal.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:02.960
So I better--

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:03.950
I have no choice.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:07.070
I have to put in the 1/2
x squared there.

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:09.980
You see, I'm never going
to catch up.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.840
Or only if I go forever.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.560
That's the point.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.750
I'll have to go forever.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.640
And what will the next one be?

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.640
Oh yeah.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.620
If you see the next one, then
we can see the pattern.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.930
Now what am I doing?

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:33.870
This one has to have
this slope.

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:37.180
I'm fixing the top line now.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.660
If I'm aiming for a slope of
x squared, then I need some

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.010
number of x cubes.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.000
So how many x cubes do I need?

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.420
Well, I need to know, what's
the slope of x cube?

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:56.360
The rule for powers of
x, x to the n, is n

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.330
times one smaller power.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:05.040
The slope of x cube is
3 times x squared.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:11.540
So I had better divide by that 3
so that the 3 cancels the 3.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:16.120
Now the slope of that, the 3x
squared, the threes would

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.740
cancel and I would
get x squared.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.080
But I'm looking for
1/2 x squared.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.300
I need also a 2.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:28.410
Do you see that it's 1/6
of x cube that's

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:29.740
going to do the job.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.520
1/6 of x cubed because
the slope--

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.600
the 3 cancels the 3 and I wanted
to end up with a 2.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.700
And now, do you know
what's coming?

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.040
These are supposed
to be equal.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.140
I have to have this 1/6
x cubed down here too.

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:49.775
And I never get to stop.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:58.570
We have to see, OK, what
is a typical--

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:03.260
after I've done this, say, n
times, I'd like to have some

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:10.660
idea of what is it when I get
up to x to some nth power,

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:14.860
then it's multiplied by some
fraction and I'm looking to

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.840
see, what is that fraction?

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.950
What is that fraction?

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:24.050
And then, of course, they'll all
show up down there again.

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:30.780
Well, if you see this pattern,
this was 3 times 2-- you could

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.380
say 3 times 2 times 1.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.250
This one was 2 times 1.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:36.940
This one was just 1.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:40.200
It's n factorial.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.420
n factorial is what I need.

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:46.620
I need n times n minus 1.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:50.100
I need all these numbers all the
way and I'll throw in the

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.420
1 at the end.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:58.580
And I have to put the
mathematicians take it away

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.870
symbol, the little three
dots that mean

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.230
don't stop, keep going.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:07.090
But do you see that
this will be OK?

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:12.670
This is called n factorial, x
to the nth over n factorial,

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:15.830
because when I take the
slope of x to the nth,

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:17.220
an n will come down.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.810
Cancel that n.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:23.180
x, I'll have one lower power.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.720
You see, when I take the slope
of this, I'll have the n will

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.960
cancel the n.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:33.900
So I'll still have these
other guys down below.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.990
And I'll have x to
the n minus 1.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.470
And that will be x
to the n minus 1

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:40.960
over n minus 1 factorial.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.750
That will be the previous one.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:50.860
But now I have to add in the x
to the nth over n factorial

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:54.850
because y and dy to the x have
to be the same, so I have to

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:55.610
keep going.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:56.640
OK.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:03.010
So you might say, well, you're
going to blow up.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:06.590
Not personally, the series.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:09.830
But what saves you?

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:15.690
What saves you is the fact that
these n factorials, those

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:19.840
fractions, that n factorial gets
to be really large really

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:25.650
fast, faster than this
x to nth could grow.

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:31.370
So altogether, these terms, x
to the nth over n factorial,

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:36.020
they get extremely,
extremely small.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:42.790
And then this series of things,
it comes to a limit.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.270
It doesn't keep going, getting
bigger, and bigger, and bigger

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.620
as I had more terms, because
what I'm adding is

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.935
so small, so small.

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:59.200
And that's the point where we
have to discuss limits later.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:13:59.980
OK.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:04.600
So that's my construction.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.850
Construction complete.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:11.380
The exponential function
e to the x--

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.390
this is e to the x--

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:19.470
is being defined by 1 plus x
plus 1/2 x squared plus 6 x

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:21.350
cubed, and so on.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:22.600
OK.

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.480
I've got a function.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.510
Now, its property.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:34.950
And the key property
is this one.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.780
Can I move to the next board?

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.580
So the next step is, check--

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.370
well, I've asked you.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:44.620
I've got e to the x.

00:14:46.562 --> 00:14:48.715
And let me write again
what it is.

00:14:48.715 --> 00:14:57.810
1 plus x plus 1/2 x squared plus
1/6 x cubed and so on.

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:01.880
And then I've got e to the any
other power, or even the same

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.990
power, 1 plus--

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:08.970
I'll just use capital
x four this power.

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:15.240
1/6 of capital x cubed
plus so on.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.620
And I want to multiply those
and see what I get.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:21.580
OK.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:23.840
I apologize.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:29.360
Here I ask you to believe in
this infinite series, and

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:34.560
yeah, a little dodgy,
but it works.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.730
And now I ask you to multiply
two of the things.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:41.380
You might say, OK, you're
asking a lot here.

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:45.030
But just hang on.

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:47.430
Let's multiply these.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:52.850
e to the x times e to the
capital x, because that's what

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:55.560
I'm interested in knowing.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.810
OK.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.470
Just do all the multiplications.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.750
And we'll see what we get.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.350
OK, so 1 times 1 is 1.

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:10.580
No problem.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.000
1 times x is the x.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.210
1 times this x is the big x.

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:17.490
Now can I keep going?

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:22.640
All right, well, 1 times
1/2 x squared is--

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.620
and now I have x
times a big x.

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.870
And now I have a 1 times
1/2 big x squared.

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:36.570
And more, of course.

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:42.370
Notice the way I'm doing is
like I'm keeping all the

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:45.600
things that have two
x's together.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.020
And then I would keep all the
things that have three x's

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.160
together, and so on.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.140
Now what is it that
I'm hoping?

00:16:54.140 --> 00:17:04.890
I'm hoping that this is the same
as the series for x plus

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:08.240
capital x, OK?

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.750
What's that?

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:12.099
That's my exponential series.

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:16.030
And every time, I have to
put in x plus capital x.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:19.180
In other words, of course,
it starts with 1.

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.210
Then it has the x
plus capital x.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:27.380
And then it has the 1/2 of
x plus capital x squared.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.630
And it keeps going.

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:35.170
And I just wanted
you to say, yes.

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:40.920
I guess I hope you say yes
when I ask, is this big

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.080
multiplication the
same as this one?

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.760
Well, I think it is.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.530
Let's just start to
check, anyway.

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:50.020
The ones are good.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:50.890
The x and the x--

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:56.680
I'm really just putting
parentheses around all the--

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.440
now I'm going to put parentheses
around all the

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:05.360
second degree terms and say,
is that the same as that?

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.330
Yeah.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.080
This is the critical
point here.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:13.690
Do we, at least, start
out correctly?

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:16.730
So we have to remember, how do
you do-- but, of course, you

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:22.000
do remember how to multiply x
plus capital x by itself.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.790
You just do the multiplications.

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:29.990
x, when I multiply that by
itself, I get x squared.

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:32.060
With 1/2, I get that.

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.900
And then, you remember?

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.360
How many x times x's do I get?

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:41.380
Little x times big x, there'd
be two of those.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:44.700
But then the 1/2 factor
leaves me with 1, and

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.030
that's what I want.

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:51.940
And then, finally, this guy by
himself squared is the 1/2

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.520
capital x squared that
I also want.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.770
So far, so good.

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:03.530
Do you want to see
the cubed terms?

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:12.550
Well, I'd rather you did it,
but I should at least show

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:16.260
that I'm willing to try.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.230
So what do I mean by
the cubed terms?

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:24.800
I mean that here, I want to
get-- the next one should be

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:29.360
1/6 of x plus x cubed.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:35.650
And from the multiplication,
I get some separate pieces.

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:38.750
I get 1 times--

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:43.690
when I do that multiplication,
I get 1/6 x cubed.

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:49.750
And then I maybe get some
1/2 x squared times x.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:56.040
You see why I would rather
you did this.

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.210
But I'll finish this
little line.

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:04.500
There's also an x times
1/2 x squared.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:08.780
So that's 1/2 of x times
the big x squared.

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:12.775
And then there is the 1
times the 1/6 x cubed.

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:23.560
So those are the four pieces
that come, third degree, when

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.360
I do the big multiplication.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.570
And they have to match
the third degree

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:30.820
term in the last line.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.270
And they do match.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:40.530
Do you remember the right
words to say now?

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:42.970
Binomial theorem.

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:48.680
The binomial theorem tells you
how to take the nth power all

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:54.180
a sum like x plus capital
x to the nth power.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:58.200
It tells you all the many
pieces you get.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:02.960
And those many pieces are
exactly the pieces that we get

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:10.490
directly by multiplying that
line by that line.

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:15.920
So the binomial theorem, at
long last, pays off and

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.780
confirms our great
property here.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.020
So this is a big deal.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.050
OK.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.880
So let me now come back here,
having checked that.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:41.950
I wanted to say something about
this series, 1 plus x

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:45.430
plus 1/2 x squared, where the
typical term is x to the nth

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:46.900
over n factorial.

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:53.740
This is the, I would say, the
second most important infinite

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:58.510
series in mathematics, the
exponential series.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:06.010
And it's the way I wanted to
construct e to the x by

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:11.460
matching term by term and
seeing that these n

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.260
factorials show up.

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:17.900
You might want to know, what's
the most important series?

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.220
Reasonable question.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:25.380
For me, the most important
series would be the one

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:30.060
looking like this, except it
doesn't have the fractions.

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.230
For me, the most important
series would be the one--

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:35.410
I'll slip it up here--

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:43.500
1 plus x plus x squared, without
the 1/2, plus x cubed,

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:49.570
without the 1/6, plus so on,
plus x to the n without this n

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:52.445
factorial that's making
it so small.

00:22:55.310 --> 00:23:00.200
Can you see this 1 plus x plus
x squared plus x cubed

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.640
plus x to the n?

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.560
That, I think it's called
the geometric series.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.620
Powers of x.

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:14.260
Now, it's simpler because it
doesn't have these fractions.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:19.320
But it's riskier because those
fractions were making the

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.420
exponential series succeed.

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:26.160
Whereas here, with the geometric
series, well, look

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.330
what happens when x is 1.

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:35.550
When x is 1, we have 1 plus 1
plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 forever.

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:36.270
All ones.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:38.710
It blows up.

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:40.960
And when x is bigger
than 1, that series

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.130
blows up even faster.

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:47.350
So in this series, the geometric
series, this most

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:54.260
important one, does succeed but
only when x is below 1.

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:58.050
x equal 1 is the cutoff and
it fails after that.

00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:03.760
There is no cutoff for the
exponential series because of

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:07.940
dividing by these bigger
and bigger numbers.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:09.910
This works for all x.

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:12.290
OK, so those are
the two series.

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:13.540
OK.

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:21.470
So let me ask you, what happens
if I put x equal 1 in

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:25.550
the exponential series?

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:31.630
That gives me e to the first
power, which is e.

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:35.770
So finally, you may say, it's
rather late in the day.

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:41.100
i'm going to figure out what
e is from this series.

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:47.770
Put in set x equal 1 and you
learn that e to the first

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:51.770
power, which is e, is--

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:53.060
can I just put it in?

00:24:53.060 --> 00:25:02.180
1 plus x is 1 plus 1/2 of 1
squared plus 1/6 of 1 cubed.

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:06.470
What's the next term in this?

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:09.160
So these are numbers now, and
I'm getting a number.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:14.290
I'm getting this incredible
number e, named after Euler.

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:16.360
Euler was a fantastic
mathematician.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:21.110
I think he wrote more important
papers then any

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:22.360
mathematician in history.

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:31.620
So he was allowed to name this
number after himself, e.

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:34.890
E-U-L-E-R, his name
is spelled.

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:36.180
OK, what's the next term?

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:40.910
This is 3 factorial, right?

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:41.990
3 times 2 times 1.

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:43.920
The next term will
be 4 factorial.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.570
I'll multiply that by 4.

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:47.140
It'll be 1/24.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:48.750
And then times 5.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:51.090
1/120, and so on.

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:54.310
They're getting small.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:58.090
What can I tell you
about this number?

00:25:58.090 --> 00:25:59.355
It will be a definite number.

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.230
And is more than--

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:06.840
well, it's certainly more
than 2 1/2, because I

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.250
start with 2 1/2 here.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:09.720
And then I add these.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.510
Well, I could even
throw in 1/6.

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:16.350
That's more than 2 2/3,
would that be?

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:19.090
If I quit here, I'd
have 2 2/3.

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:21.460
And then I get a little more.

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:22.740
It's easy to show.

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:25.790
No way you would reach
as far as 3.

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:30.450
These later terms are dropping
too fast. And actually, the

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:32.590
number turns out to be--

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:34.850
so it's 2 point something.

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:36.360
2 point--

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.820
let's see, a little more than
2 2/3, so it's around 2.7.

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:47.290
But it's it's not exactly 2.7.

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:50.530
In fact, it's not exactly
any fraction

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:53.690
or any finite decimal.

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:54.980
It goes on and on.

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:59.800
1, 8, 2, 8, something.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:04.280
I think there are more eights
than you'd expect right here

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:10.370
at the beginning, but then,
in the long run, not.

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:13.010
So that's the number, e.

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:14.025
OK.

00:27:14.025 --> 00:27:16.330
Oh, so now we know e.

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:17.480
We know e to the x.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.340
We know e.

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.810
We know this thing.

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:21.750
I should draw a graph, right?

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.080
That's the other thing
you do with a

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.860
function is draw a graph.

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:26.610
OK.

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:29.740
So here's a graph.

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.410
This is x.

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:36.040
Let me put in x equals 0 here
and x equal 1 here.

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:39.460
And this is going to be
a graph of e to the x.

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:44.820
And at x equals 0, what is it?

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.060
We started with that.

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:46.950
It should be--

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:48.090
so this is y.

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:50.060
I'm graphing y.

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:53.430
And it starts at 1.

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:54.210
That's what we said.

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:58.280
At x equals 0, I've started
at 1 with a slope of 1.

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.920
So I have a slope of 1, but
the slope, the slope, the

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.260
slope is climbing up.

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:05.530
And it reaches here.

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:06.890
That height is what--

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:10.830
e.

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:12.080
That height is e.

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:18.140
Because when we said x equal
1 here, we got e.

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.410
So it's climbing, climbing,
climbing.

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:23.130
And now what about on
the other side?

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:28.470
That had a slope of 1, so
it was more like that.

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:32.890
Now what about when
x is negative?

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:38.770
When x is negative, this is
a highly useful fact.

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:44.010
Suppose I want to think about
e to the minus x.

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:47.240
Well now, let me just
take capital x to be

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.420
minus little x.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:52.410
So I get e to the x times
e to the minus x.

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:54.220
What is that?

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:57.110
What does that equal if I
multiply e to the x times e to

00:28:57.110 --> 00:29:00.090
the minus x?

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:03.310
As usual, I'm supposed
to add these.

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:07.100
I get 0, so I get e to
the 0, which is 1.

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:13.030
In other words, e to the minus
x is 1 over e to the x, which

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:15.670
we fully expected.

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:22.430
So that at x equal minus 1 here,
I'm down to 1 over e,

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:24.770
1/3, approximately.

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:28.120
So it's going down.

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:32.100
In this way, it's decaying very
fast. It almost touches

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.480
that line, but never quite.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.730
This way, it's climbing.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:41.600
It's growing, growing really--

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.243
well, it's growing
exponentially.

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:49.710
And that's what this
graph looks like.

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:55.690
And now I would like to connect
back, at the end of

00:29:55.690 --> 00:30:01.650
this lecture, to the insurance
business--

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:07.680
sorry, the interest business,
the bank compounding interest.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:15.940
Can I take your time with that
important example of the

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.130
exponential function?

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:20.430
And we'll see a new
way to reach e.

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:22.300
I like this way.

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:26.320
I like the way we did it with
the infinite series.

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:29.280
But here's another way.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:37.540
So suppose you're getting 100%
interest. Generous bank.

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:38.870
OK.

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:43.870
And you start with
$1 at 100% now.

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:46.696
It's 100%.

00:30:46.696 --> 00:30:49.450
And the bank gives you
interest at the

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:51.770
end of every year.

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:57.020
So at the end of the first year,
you had $1 dollar in the

00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:00.890
bank, it adds in 100%.

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:02.780
It adds in another dollar.

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:08.360
So now you've got $2 in the
bank after the first year.

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:13.390
At the end of the second year,
it gives you 100% of what

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:14.360
you've got in the bank.

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.500
So it gives you 2 more.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:18.030
It give you 4.

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:22.050
At the end of the third year, it
gives you an additional 4.

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:24.220
You're up 50 to 8.

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.190
And you see what's happening.

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:29.130
It's the powers of two.

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:33.770
Well, that's pretty
good growth.

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:37.140
But it's not calculus.

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:41.660
Calculus doesn't do things
in steps of a year.

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:44.160
Calculus says cut
that step down.

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:48.120
You would want to ask your bank,
couldn't you just, like,

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:51.430
figure the interest a little
more often and put it in

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:53.890
there-- like, figure
it every month?

00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:55.550
So what would happen
if you figured the

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:58.100
interest every month?

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.590
Of course, you wouldn't get
100% interest in a month.

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:06.710
You'd get 100% divided by 12,
because we're only talking

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:08.540
about one month.

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:12.900
So if it was months,
you start with 1.

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:18.350
You have 1 plus 1/12.

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:21.880
That's what you'd have
after a month.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.970
Now, what would you have after
2 months and what would you

00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:29.640
have after 12 months?

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.935
Well, we're going to
follow the rule.

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:39.030
They gave you the 1/12 at
the end of January.

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:41.730
So through all of February,
you've got 1

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:43.680
plus 1/12 in there.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:51.420
At the end of February, they
take 1/12 of that, add it in.

00:32:51.420 --> 00:33:00.400
What you get the next time
is 1 plus 1/12 squared.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:04.860
That's what you have.

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:08.310
Essentially every time, they're
going to multiply what

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:10.860
you've got by this number
1 plus 1/12.

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:13.140
1 to give you--

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:14.320
leave the money in.

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.560
You have to leave your money.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.790
I'm sorry.

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:23.060
Plus 1/12 of it for the
interest. And then twice, and

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:27.060
after 1 year, it's done this.

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:30.360
You see what happens
after 1 year, it's

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:34.540
multiplied 12 times.

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:38.010
1 plus 1/12 to the 12th power.

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:40.720
And that's better
than 2, right?

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:45.000
You've got the 2 only when they
put the interest in just

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:45.630
once a year.

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:51.380
Now we're speeding up the bank
and getting more out of it.

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:55.170
So I don't know exactly what 1
plus 1/12 to the 12th power

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:57.700
is, but I know it's
more than 2.

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:01.080
And actually, I'm sure
it's not more than 3.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:09.420
In fact, yeah, I'm claiming
that it's not

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:12.699
as much as e, 2.7.

00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:18.610
But it was worth doing, to get
them to compound every month.

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:21.790
But, of course, you think, okay,
I'm on to a good thing.

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:22.600
Every day.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.120
Why not?

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.770
So what would every day be?

00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:31.830
1 plus 1/365.

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:34.620
That's the interest you would
get for just that day.

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:39.810
But then they would compound
it 365 times.

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:44.090
So that would be a little more
than this because they're

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:47.600
adding the interest in
more frequently.

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:51.880
And, in general, I'm
going to divide the

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.540
year up into n pieces.

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:59.730
In every piece, they multiply my
wealth by 1 plus 1 over n.

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:01.685
And they do it n times
in a year.

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:11.110
And the beautiful thing is that
as n goes to infinity,

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:15.150
and calculus comes in, because
we're asking them to compound

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:20.450
interest continuously, not just
every month, not every

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:26.100
day, every second even,
but all the time.

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.850
You don't get an infinite
amount out of this.

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:31.430
You get e.

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:35.140
As n gets bigger, that
approaches this number e.

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:39.330
That's another way to construct
e, as the limit--

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:45.000
you see, as n gets bigger, it's
like 1 to the infinity,

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.400
which is kind of meaningless.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.460
I don't want to say
that 1 to the--

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:53.990
I had an email the other day
that said, well, 1 to the

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:56.350
infinity is e.

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:57.140
What's happening?

00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:58.890
That's not true.

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:04.190
It's this thing that's going to
1, this thing that's going

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:05.610
to infinity.

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:08.780
Then the combination
goes to e.

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:09.610
OK.

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:16.030
So that's the application
that shows the

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:18.850
number e appearing again.

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:20.100
OK.

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:25.240
You've got the essence
of e to the x.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:31.780
I just would like to say one
thing, coming back to the very

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:33.310
beginning here.

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:37.730
The great differential equation,
dy dx equal y.

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:39.480
That was beautiful.

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.620
Which we've now solved.

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:46.560
Now I want to ask, what if the
differential equation was dy

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:51.570
dx is some multiple of y?

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:53.620
How would that come up?

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:57.360
Well, up to now, c was 1.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:02.840
We were getting 100%
interest per year.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:06.260
But now, if c is sort of the
interest rate, the growth

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:10.580
rate, or the decay rate of c is
negative, we may be losing

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:15.890
money in this bank.

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:22.090
So can I just tell you what
is the solution to this

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:24.750
differential equation?

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:27.960
When I tell you, and we
learned about taking

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.650
derivatives, you'll see, of
course, that's all it is.

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:33.550
It's just the solution
to this one.

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:35.800
I'll also start at one.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:40.010
The solution to that one
is y of x is e--

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:41.710
e is coming in again--

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:42.960
to the cx.

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:49.790
What I'm doing is like changing
the rate at--

00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:52.490
I've made the rate
of chance c.

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:56.850
And then that c is going to
come up there and in the

00:37:56.850 --> 00:38:03.030
derivative, the slope of this
guy, that c will come down.

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:07.530
The slope of this will be c e to
the cx, which is cy, which

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:09.680
is what that second
differential

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.540
equation tells us.

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:16.460
So that's just a comment looking
ahead, that we've

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:19.290
solved not only the most
important differential

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:21.380
equation with the most important
function that

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:26.680
calculus creates but a whole
collection of related

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:34.390
equations in which the rate can
be any fixed number, c.

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:35.050
OK.

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:35.780
Thank you.
