00:00:09.514 --> 00:00:11.680
MICHAEL PRYOR: Trello is a
visual collaboration tool

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.150
that helps people
create a shared

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.127
perspective on any
project, whether it's

00:00:15.127 --> 00:00:16.740
at work or at home.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.546
We took the whiteboard
that you might

00:00:18.546 --> 00:00:20.170
have in your office
and the sticky note

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.020
and basically built
Trello from that.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.070
You can plan any project you
have by using those cards

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.980
and moving them around the board
to figure out what's going on.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.650
It's super important
for us to be everywhere

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.490
that people are
collaborating, so we

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.400
had to make sure that you had
the best possible experience

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.350
that you could have on
your Android device.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.260
HAMID PALO: When we first
started thinking about Trello

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.540
on mobile, we were faced
with a very difficult design

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.049
problem of how to take
something that is so visual

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:48.590
and condense it into
a smaller screen

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.840
so you still get the same visual
overview of everything that's

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.620
happening.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.570
FYZA HASHIM: Before Material,
Trello seem very inconsistent.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.250
It was hard to navigate.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.870
Material Design has
really helped the design

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.370
and development process, because
the guidelines are so thorough

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.300
and well thought out.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.467
You don't have to go back
and forth with developers.

00:01:06.467 --> 00:01:07.841
HAMID PALO: Our
Material redesign

00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:09.290
has been a huge success for us.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.190
What we have seen
is a 10% increase

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.400
in the number of sessions
per user per week,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.480
a 42% increase in the number
of boards created per session,

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.660
and most importantly
for us, a 63% increase

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.870
in the number of users
added to boards per session.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.050
That tells us that people
are using Trello way more

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.472
than they were using it before.

00:01:27.472 --> 00:01:28.680
MICHAEL PRYOR: Trello is fun.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.690
It's flexible.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.630
There is so much that
you can do with it.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.200
FYZA HASHIM: They can plan
out their meals for the week.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.830
They don't have to go to the
fridge and write down a list.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.710
It's a more natural way.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.209
It's like you're talking to
your spouse or your boyfriend

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:42.000
or your girlfriend.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.400
Instead, you're just
telling it to your watch,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.900
and it'll put it
on the Trello list.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.430
HAMID PALO: A key area where
Trello really, really shines

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.260
is when you use it
with somebody else.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.110
FYZA HASHIM: Material gives you
a better way of communicating.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.776
HAMID PALO: One of
the things that we've

00:01:53.776 --> 00:01:55.920
seen people use Trello
for is planning marathons.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.450
And they can plan
routes, and they can say,

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.160
I've done these
exercises and everything.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.660
FYZA HASHIM: It
helps the user focus

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.870
on what they're doing
instead of thinking about how

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.828
they're going to do it.

00:02:04.828 --> 00:02:07.050
HAMID PALO: If I had any
advice for developers,

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.570
isolate what is
core about your app,

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.300
and then use the Material
principles in the framework

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.990
to come up with a design
that best delivers that

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.860
to your users.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.318
FYZA HASHIM: Work
with Google Play,

00:02:18.318 --> 00:02:20.180
because there are so
many options out there

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.690
for developers and designers.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.330
MICHAEL PRYOR:
After Material, we

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.460
were able to define
Trello's visual identity

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.300
and combine those
things together,

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.470
so we had a clear vision
of what Trello was.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.380
I'm most proud of the
fact that what we've built

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.480
is loved by so many people.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.930
