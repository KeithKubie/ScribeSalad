00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.004
( intro music )

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:08.274 line:0%
I got started just
taking pictures

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:10.410 line:0%
just taking pictures
I wanted to take.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.912
<i> And I just took pictures
 I thought were weird</i>

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:15.648
<i> or different or
 interesting or funny.</i>

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:16.983
<i> A cowboy roping a cat.</i>

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:18.183
( audience laughter )

00:00:18.183 --> 00:00:21.353
<i>Could be a lady walking her dog.</i>

00:00:21.353 --> 00:00:24.557
<i> Bad dogs make excellent
 pictures, it turns out.</i>

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:27.726
<i> Some dogs are a little
 worse than others.</i>

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.662
<i> But it was these
 types of pictures</i>

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:31.197
that got me noticed
by Geographic.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.733
And that was 25 years ago now,
hard to believe.

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.534
<i>As I've gone forward through
 my career</i>

00:00:35.534 --> 00:00:38.103
<i>I started to do more and more
stories on conservation, and</i>

00:00:38.103 --> 00:00:41.274
to me, good pictures should come
from the conservation side.

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:43.009
They could be funny or
humorous, entertaining.

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:44.543
They better be entertaining.

00:00:44.543 --> 00:00:46.245
<i>So, for a story on grizzly bears</i>

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:48.581
<i> I was given eight weeks
 of assignment time</i>

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:50.049
<i> This is day two.</i>

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:51.918
<i> Notice those are
 my boots up the tree.</i>

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:55.354
<i>The tops of those boots are wet,
 don't ask why, exactly.</i>

00:00:55.354 --> 00:00:56.956
( audience laughter )

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:59.091
<i> Of course, reality is
 these are bears at</i>

00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:00.627
<i>basically a Hollywood facility.</i>

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:04.030
<i>They train bears to fake roar
and fake maul for the movies.</i>

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.399
<i>And that bear is actually
 not making sound</i>

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.200
he's just opening wide
to get donut holes

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.103
tossed into his mouth

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:12.939
from a trainer off to the side,
so that's all there is to it.

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.507
<i> So, I loaded up as
 much as I could</i>

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:16.409
<i> for that week,
anything I could think up.</i>

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.544
<i> And when I did go
 to Alaska finally.</i>

00:01:18.544 --> 00:01:20.913
<i>I went to the most visually
loaded place that I could find</i>

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:22.482
<i>where I knew the bears were.</i>

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:23.716
<i>So, what's the story here?</i>

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:26.452
<i> Well, bears actually
 tolerate us just fine.</i>

00:01:26.452 --> 00:01:27.787
<i> We can't stand bears.</i>

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:30.089
<i> Bears love our garbage,
full of food and good smells,</i>

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:31.023
<i> but...</i>

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:34.260
they get a little aggressive,
get into our dumpsters

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.162
they get into our bird-feeders
next and our dog food.

00:01:37.162 --> 00:01:38.631
They break into our cabins and--

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:40.032
<i>A fed bear is a dead bear.</i>

00:01:40.032 --> 00:01:41.701
<i> They end up getting
 shot and sold</i>

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:44.603
<i>at the state of Alaska surplus
sale, twice a year in Alaska.</i>

00:01:44.603 --> 00:01:47.506
So, with bears it's fairly
straight forward, you know

00:01:47.506 --> 00:01:49.942
keep them out of the garbage,
everything is gonna be okay.

00:01:49.942 --> 00:01:51.010
They're, you know,
they don't--

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:53.312
they kill one person a year on
the North American continent

00:01:53.312 --> 00:01:54.981
so they tend to get
a very bad rap

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:58.718
even though we lose many times
that to domestic dog fatalities

00:01:58.718 --> 00:01:59.985
every year in this country.

00:01:59.985 --> 00:02:01.854
<i> What about the more
 quiet species?</i>

00:02:01.854 --> 00:02:03.022
<i> What about wolves?</i>

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:05.858
<i>They're more of an enigma and
this is the problem with wolves</i>

00:02:05.858 --> 00:02:07.660
<i> because people want to
 view them either as</i>

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.330
<i>something cute, like a pet
or a blood thirsty killer.</i>

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.166
<i> What are wolves?
We want to know, don't we?</i>

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:16.235
We're cued every
minute of every day

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:18.904
how to think about everything,
from our news to

00:02:18.904 --> 00:02:21.274
who's good and who's bad
in any reality show.

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:23.276
<i> But with most wildlife,
 including predators</i>

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:24.510
<i>there ain't no such thing.</i>

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.879
<i> Wolves are just wolves.
 That's it.</i>

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.147
<i> Story on koalas.</i>

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:31.216
<i> Shoot the weird,
the different, the idiotic.</i>

00:02:31.216 --> 00:02:32.952
<i>Photograph the cute and cuddly</i>

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:35.255
<i> in the hopes that people
 will see this and say</i>

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:37.323
<i> "Why does that human
mother have a baby koala?"</i>

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:40.759
<i>Well, because this is the
truth for northern koalas.</i>

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:42.862
I was shocked when I
went over there. Really.

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:45.398
I mean, they're confined to
golf courses in the suburbs

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:47.800
and when they come off the
golf course, they're trapped.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.470
<i>They get hit by cars and they
get attacked by domestic dogs</i>

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.004
<i>and it's something awful.</i>

00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:53.673
<i> And still the
 government of Australia</i>

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.374
<i>would not grant the koala</i>

00:02:55.374 --> 00:02:57.776
<i> in the northern part of
 the country protection.</i>

00:02:57.776 --> 00:02:59.912
The nurses at one koala
hospital, I went to

00:02:59.912 --> 00:03:02.248
who would've all gotten fired
had they known we were--

00:03:02.248 --> 00:03:05.051
that their management know we
were gonna make this picture.

00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:07.753
They saved back one week's
worth of koalas in a freezer

00:03:07.753 --> 00:03:10.523
<i>all killed by dogs, including
 that mother and baby.</i>

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:12.292
<i> We ran that picture
 around the world</i>

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:14.527
<i> and the government of
Australia changed the law</i>

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:16.528
<i> and offered protection
 to those koalas</i>

00:03:16.528 --> 00:03:18.363
<i> a few months after
 the story came out.</i>

00:03:18.363 --> 00:03:20.132
Can I say that picture did it?

00:03:20.132 --> 00:03:22.068
Sure didn't hurt,
sure didn't hurt.

00:03:22.068 --> 00:03:23.636
So that's why we do this.

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:26.739
( applause )
