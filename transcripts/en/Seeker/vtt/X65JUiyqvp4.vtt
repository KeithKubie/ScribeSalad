00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.810
This episode of Dnews was proudly made possible
by the all-new 2015 Subaru Legacy - it’s

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.250
not just a sedan, it’s a Subaru.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.730
Driver fatigue causes thousands of deaths
every single year - so what if there was a

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.539
device that could alert you whenever you start
to fall asleep?

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:25.470
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and chances
are, most of the people out there watching

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.470
this own a car.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.570
And if you drive relatively often, then there’s
also a chance you’ve driven in unsafe conditions.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.640
And by unsafe, I don’t mean drunk or bad
weather conditions - I’m talking about driving

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.880
while tired.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.120
About 20% of all car accidents involve a drowsy
driver, which leads to almost 7,000 fatalities

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.140
every year.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.410
Truck drivers, young male drivers, and shift
workers are especially vulnerable to drowsy

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.410
driving.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.430
It lowers your reaction time, and impairs
your concentration and alertness.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.530
But even scarier, is the fact that there aren’t
any laws - at least here in America - against

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.080
driving while drowsy.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.530
Which is why many auto makers and companies
are now trying to develop technology to prevent

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.920
those kinds of accidents before they happen.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.080
Researchers at the Biomechanics Institute
in Spain, recently created a device that can

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.990
monitor cardiac and respiratory rhythms in
a driver, through sensors that are embedded

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.870
in the seat-belt and seat cover.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.240
Heart rate and breathing rate are the two
single most important indicators of fatigue,

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.560
so by monitoring those vitals, this system
can effectively alert you if you’re starting

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.880
to fall asleep at the wheel.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.590
When a driver’s respiratory rate falls below
a certain level, a warning mechanism goes

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.630
off that alerts the driver, avoiding a potential
collision.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.060
The system is also covered in a smart material
to cancel out the effects of road vibration,

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.490
or any driver movements.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.890
According to its creators, they now have a
fully-functional prototype that can be implemented

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:45.920
into any car.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.510
Currently, it’s being tested on closed tracks
only, but those tests have yielded positive

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.280
results, and its creators are hopeful that
they’ll soon be able to test the system

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.690
in real-world traffic scenarios.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.050
Just imagine how many lives we could save
with technology like this.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.200
As someone who once lost a good friend myself
to drowsy driving, I have to say - I do wish

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.250
something like this had come along sooner,
but on the whole, I could not be more excited

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.280
about this.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.830
While we’re on the topic of driving, we
wanna extend a quick thank you to Subaru,

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.230
for making this episode possible.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.230
And especially the all-new 2015 Subaru Legacy.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.640
Every sedan has its benefits, but only one
combines them all.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.030
It’s not just a sedan.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.400
It’s a Subaru.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.349
And hey - be sure to let us know in the comments
below, if you ever get sleepy while driving

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.250
- and what your best remedy is to combat driver
fatigue.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.250
That’s all for me, but as always - thank
you guys for watching!
