OSSAMA ALAMI: Hello, everybody,
and welcome to

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.710
Bring Your App to
the Big Screen.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.560
This session is all about
designing TV applications,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.860
designing for Google TV.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.260
Before we get started, my
name's Ossama Alami.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
I manage the Developer Relations
team for Google TV,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.400
and I'm co-presenting here
today with Michael

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.762
Sundermeyer, who leads
our UX team.

00:00:25.762 --> 00:00:27.190
[SCATTERED APPLAUSE]

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.390
OSSAMA ALAMI: Big
fans of Michael.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.180
So by show of hands, can I see
how many of you are Android

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.230
developers or have built
an Android app?

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.010
Great.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.440
I think that's about half.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.640
And how many of you have built
an app for Google TV, either

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.580
Android or a web app?

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.720
A smattering.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.360
So this session is going to be
a great for those of you that

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.600
have built apps and great for
those of you that haven't.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.430
The biggest thing to building
a TV application is probably

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.550
design, because it's very
different from mobile or

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.730
tablets or even PC
or web design.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.300
Designing for TV is designing
for a different user

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.860
experience.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.710
So as a refresher, I'll go over
what Google TV is for

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.760
those of you that don't know.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.720
Google TV is Android
optimized for TV.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.030
It comes with Google Chrome,
and it comes with Google

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.810
services like search, a
discovery experience called TV

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.910
and Movies, photos, YouTube,
and other applications.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.620
And it comes with live
TV integration.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.290
So Google TV is really about
integrating the live TV with

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.600
the web, bringing the best of TV
and the best of the web and

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.140
trying to make it the best
experience possible, bring as

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.900
much content as possible to the
user where they're looking

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.190
to be entertained when they're
on the couch in

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.980
front of their TV.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.460
So last October, we launched a
major update to Google TV.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.160
We vastly simplified the UI,
the user experience.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.690
We improved search
and discovery.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.290
We released a new YouTube
experience for Google TV.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.420
And critically, for most of you
guys, we launched Android

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.460
Market, now Google Play, and the
ability for you to build

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.655
applications and reach users
on their TVs and distribute

00:02:24.655 --> 00:02:27.680
those applications through
Google Play.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.960
So a lot of what we learned in
simplifying the UI and making

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.150
a better user experience in our
second-generation software

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.400
we're going to teach
you about today.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.864
They're very exciting in
the session next door.

00:02:43.864 --> 00:02:44.780
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.700
OSSAMA ALAMI: There we go.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.270
Yeah!

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.940
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE CONTINUE]

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.320
OSSAMA ALAMI: Thank
you for that.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.270
I'm sure you're all very excited
about our new devices.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.630
We have new devices that
launched this week and over

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.860
the last couple weeks.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.510
They're out in the sandbox.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.850
On this level, I encourage you
guys to check them out.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.970
I'm very excited about
these things.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.700
They all have the
ARM processor.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.120
They're shipping in the US, and
the Sony devices are going

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.520
to be available internationally.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.630
So Sony has released a buddy
box, and they have a Blu-ray

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.220
player that they're demoing.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.760
Vizio released a buddy box
earlier this week.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.890
And LG has a series of TVs
with Google TV built in.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.040
And I'm happy to announce that
later this summer we'll be

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.430
releasing an updated Google
Play store for Google TV.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.670
This will add some the features
you heard about

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.980
yesterday, subscription billing
support, partial

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.050
updates, as well as the ability
for users to purchase

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:48.060
music, videos, and now TV shows
directly from their TV.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.410
This is the first year we're
doing a full track for Google

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.970
TV at IO, and I'm really excited
about this session and

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:53.710
the other sessions.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.310
I'm going to quickly tell
you about the other

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.730
two sessions we have.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.250
If you're interested about DRM,
streaming video, and the

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.492
enhancements that we made to
Google TV there, if you're

00:04:03.492 --> 00:04:06.160
interested about getting your
content on TV, I encourage you

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.720
to check out this session
after lunch.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.070
And today a lot of TV users
are distracted users.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.430
They're sitting on their couch
with a mobile phone or a

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.550
tablet or a PC, a laptop.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.680
And part of the time they're
watching TV, they're also on

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.920
those devices.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.930
So if you want to learn how to
build a unique experience that

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.620
connects the user on their
second screen device, on their

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.910
mobile phone or tablet, as well
as on the TV that they're

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.440
watching, build a cohesive
experience around your

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.225
application, go to this session,
and we'll teach you a

00:04:39.225 --> 00:04:43.550
little about the technologies we
have to make that possible.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.580
So why do you care?

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.240
Why do you care about
building for TV?

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.240
TVs have been around for a long
time, and it turns out

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.180
there are a whole lot of them.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.040
In the US, there are more
TVs than people.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:00.360
On average, 2 and 1/2 people
in a home and 2.93 TV sets.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.830
This stat is actually going up,
even though the rise of

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.030
smartphones and tablets.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.480
People continue to watch TV.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.150
People continue to buy TVs.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.850
This is really about meeting
the user in the

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.000
living room, right?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.630
Meeting the user where they're
looking to be entertained.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.150
And they still want to be
entertained on their

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.310
televisions.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.840
And they watch a whole
lot of television.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.300
In the US, on average, five
hours of TV per day.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.680
So this is an opportunity for
you guys as developers to

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.390
finally meet the users with the
five hours of TV watching

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.160
they're doing per day as well
as the other amount of time

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.920
that the TV sits off.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.340
Think about an experience
that is uniquely

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.060
appropriate for the TV.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.920
And it continues to grow.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.200
So this stat's by
DisplaySearch.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.800
By 2015, over 500 million
connected

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.990
TVs will have shipped.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.920
Connected TVs or smart TVs.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.920
And that year, 47% of flat
panels shipped that year will

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.050
be smart TVs.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:16.210
So Google TV really aims to be
an open app platform for you

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.320
guys as developers to build
applications and for

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.070
manufacturers to build
a smart TV.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.970
Users are become accustomed
having access on the content

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.740
that they love on all
of their devices.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.550
That includes the TV now.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.500
If you have an application that
is meant to entertain or

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.690
maybe inform the user, it's
a great TV application.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.780
And users, as they get more
and more familiar with

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.080
connected TVs and smart TVs,
are really going to

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.730
want that app there.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.420
So reach and delight your users
where they're looking to

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.870
be entertained.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:53.650
And how you do this?

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.330
Well, there are two ways right
now to build for Google TV.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.640
It is an Android device, so you
can build an Android app.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.890
And it does ship with a full
desktop version of Google

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:07.250
Chrome, so you can
build a web app.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.640
When I say build an Android app,
it's really just that.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.380
The Google TV SDK is
the Android SDK.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.230
What we're going to teach you
about in this session is how

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.850
to design that app for TV.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.940
But if you already have
experience building Android

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.540
applications, that's great.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.750
You already know most of
what you need to know

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.210
to build a TV app.

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.960
And you get the advantage of
distributing and monetizing

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.150
that app and discoverability
options through Google

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.780
Play on Google TV.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.850
Or build a web app.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:42.435
Your site's already accessible
on Chrome in Google TV, but

00:07:42.435 --> 00:07:44.920
what we're going to teach you
here today is how to optimize

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.470
that experience for TV viewers,
how to make it really

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:53.130
great on the web browser
that we ship with.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:55.750
Those are the two options for
building for Google TV.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.590
We're not going to go into the
depths of how to build an

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.450
Android app or how to
build a web app.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.870
There's lots of sessions here
at I/O that'll teach you how

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:02.620
to do that.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.400
What we're really going to do
is we're going to teach you

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.130
how to design a great TV app.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.670
And since I'm not the
expert on that, I'm

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:11.073
going to call up Michael.

00:08:11.073 --> 00:08:14.524
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:14.524 --> 00:08:15.774
MICHAEL SUNDER MEYER:
Thank you.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:20.180
Thank you, Ossama.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:20.760
Hello, everybody.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.210
I'm Michael.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.950
I head up the design
of Google TV.

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:26.450
And I haven't been with the team
very long, but I've been

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:29.860
designing for TV and mobile
devices for many years.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.270
So I know enough to be a
little bit dangerous.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.480
So this session is all about the
experience you can create

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.030
with the technology, not about
the technology itself.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:42.010
So unlike most sessions, I'm
not going to show a single

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:43.240
line of code.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.200
So please don't go run screaming
from the room yet.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.010
Hopefully we'll show a few
things that are interesting,

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.300
and you'll learn
something new.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.030
TV is really evolving.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:54.266
Google TV is not your
grandfather's TV.

00:08:54.266 --> 00:08:58.090
TV has not fundamentally changed
in the last 30 years

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:01.040
since cable television came
around until just recently.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.830
And now a few things have
started to move around that

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:06.690
are really changing the
landscape of TV.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.440
First, the TV screens
that we have in our

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.510
homes are getting big.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:10.820
They're getting really
big, huge.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:11.300
They're flat.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.240
They're thin.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.380
They're beautiful.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.330
And they can go anywhere
in your home.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.540
They're appearing in places that
we wouldn't have expected

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.820
before like kitchens and family
rooms and bathrooms.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.020
They're appearing in
our workplaces.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:22.950
So they're appearing
everywhere.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.860
They're more like big screens
that are just omnipresent

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.650
present in our lives.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.325
Second, they are smart.

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:34.740
Right now, more than 30% of all
the TVs that ship in the

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.390
United States are smart TVs.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.830
And that number is growing,
as Ossama said.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:41.690
Pretty soon, pretty much all
of them will be smart TVs.

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:45.310
They'll have a CPU and GPU in
the device itself, which

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:50.230
enables web and applications
and a huge amount of new

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:54.350
content and new capabilities
that we can take advantage of.

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.320
And then third, they're
interactive.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.160
There are new ways
of interacting.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.180
The controllers that we
have have cursors on

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.650
them and track pads.

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:04.540
We're starting to see voice.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.100
We're seeing gesture.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.260
We're interacting with them,
just starting to be able to

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.160
interact with them with our
mobile phones and with our

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.200
tablets and our computers.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.080
So there's a whole bunch of
new opportunities around

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.450
interaction.

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:17.560
So I'm here to talk to you
about how some of these

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.810
disruptive changes to the
landscape of, really, the

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:23.740
living room present new
opportunities for creating

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.940
great experiences for
the home that

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.530
really connect us together.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:28.300
But here's the thing.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:32.180
So I think we're only just
beginning to figure out how to

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.290
create great experiences
on any device.

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:35.750
We're right at the beginning.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.190
We're in our infancy.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.230
I've been doing this for 15
years, and I still learn

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.390
something new every
single day.

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.190
So I don't have all the answers
here, but I'm going to

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:46.890
present some of the things that
we've learned so far and

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.440
leave it in your good hands
to take it from there.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.730
I'll start by talking about the
big screen, what it's good

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.390
for what and what it's
not so good for.

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:56.880
You may not be aware of some
of the differences there.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.850
Then I'll show you a few
applications and how their

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:04.460
developers used different
strategies to bring Android

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.050
applications, web applications
from mobile devices and the

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:10.360
web to the television.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.720
Then I'll spend a little time
talking about designing,

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.460
giving you some design tips for
designing for TV around

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.910
interaction and design
and layout.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:24.030
And then finally, I'm going to
share with you a few inside

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:25.910
trade secrets for how to
actually make a great

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:27.580
application, not just usable.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.810
But I hope to inspire you to go
beyond thinking about just

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:33.260
the basics to creating an
application that's beautiful

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.420
and compelling and cinematic
and that people

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.585
really love to use.

00:11:37.585 --> 00:11:38.460
All right.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.100
So let's start with
the big screen.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.450
So what's different about
the big screen?

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:43.880
Well, it's really big.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:49.620
And it's great for video
and images and simple

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.645
interactivity, anything that's
really visual and cinematic.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.960
The 10-foot experience has been
designed for consumption,

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.870
so people are used to leaning
back a little more.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.880
And I'll talk about that.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.900
And they're connected to
big sound systems.

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:07.140
So it's great for
music and video.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:10.225
But what you may not know is
there's a few things--

00:12:10.225 --> 00:12:12.650
a lot of people think, well,
I just take my tablet

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:14.500
application, and I'll
bring it to the TV,

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.710
and will work great.

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.610
The TV is not a big
tablet, actually.

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.695
There's a few things that
tablets are great for that TV

00:12:19.695 --> 00:12:21.170
is not so good for.

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:25.910
For example, reading a lot of
text is not great on a TV.

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:28.730
Because you're 10 feet away, the
information density needs

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.580
to be less than you might
think on a tablet.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.020
And because it's really a
lean-back experience-- there's

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.470
something that happens when we
sit down in the cushions, we

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:41.160
sink back, we grab a beer and
our controller, we dim the

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.880
lights, and we go to
watch something.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.030
We relax, and we're really
in a different mode.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:47.840
And that may change
over time as these

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.040
devices become more capable.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.560
But for now people really get
into a certain mode, and

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.040
they're not used to doing
certain kind of activities on

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:59.320
a TV that they might do on
a tablet or computer.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.820
So really, we've found that it's
actually better to think

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:09.410
of a TV more like a phone in
terms of design than a tablet.

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:12.340
If you hold a phone about this
far away, that's about the

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:16.320
size in your field of vision
that a TV is 10 feet away.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.260
The amount of screen density,
the amount of text, the amount

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.500
of interactivity is about the
same on a little device like

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.770
this than it is on a big TV.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:28.060
So it's a little surprising
that it's

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.310
different than a tablet.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.120
TVs are also really social.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.550
Just all the same qualities that
make a TV fantastic for

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.990
watching movies, playing games
together make it great for

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:42.580
shared experiences, but one
thing that's different is that

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.340
people are used to using a TV
for entertainment and not so

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.460
much for work.

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:52.400
So it's great for games, for
education, for apps around

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.430
exploration like maps and travel
and food and things

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:58.370
that connect to us personally.

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:01.460
But people aren't so used to
doing their email on a big TV.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.520
Some of you may do it.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:03.840
Many of you may do it.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:04.790
But we're unusual.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:06.565
We're a little different than
the average consumer, who

00:14:06.565 --> 00:14:08.370
still uses the living room
as kind of a different

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.610
space than an office.

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:14.100
You also have to think about
privacy, especially around

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:18.580
social networks and financial
websites and things like that.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:22.790
And you really need to think
about the multi-user and how

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:25.840
different users may use the
space and the applications

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.770
differently in the shared
space, how they use it

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:32.310
separately and together.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:34.860
So not all applications that
are successful on a phone,

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.400
like I said, move over to
the TV successfully.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.930
But it's pretty straightforward
to move an

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:40.475
Android application.

00:14:40.475 --> 00:14:42.590
If you've got an Android
application, as Ossama said,

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.130
you're already soaking
in the technology.

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.260
And then it's really just about
understanding what are

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.990
the main differences between the
two in terms of the design

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.810
and the erection.

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:53.920
Applications take different
paths to get to the TV.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.500
And I want to show you three
different paths in the form of

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.280
application developers that
have done it already.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.210
Pandora is a simple and
elegant music app.

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.540
You probably mostly use it.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:04.880
I love it.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.720
It's really designed
on the phone.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.990
It's already designed
really well.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.790
It's big.

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:11.540
It's visual.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:12.700
It's sort of lean back.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.340
It taps into the sound system.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.550
So moving that to TV was
really pretty easy.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:19.350
This is the phone app on the
upper right and the TV app on

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:20.580
the lower left.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.630
They really didn't have to
change a lot for this

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:23.190
application.

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:25.550
One of the main things they
did is just enable the

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.600
transport controls, the
Play-Pause controls on the

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.220
remote control.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.940
So there's a couple extra things
they had to do there.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.260
So this one is where they really
used a similar design

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.800
for both mobile and TV.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.010
CNBC took a different route.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:41.410
They tapped into the strengths
of each device and did

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:42.480
something slightly different.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.550
So on the phone, it's really
good for interacting with your

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:47.030
stock portfolio.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.920
On the tablet, it's great for
reading in-depth articles.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.920
So there's a lot of
text in articles.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.370
And then on the TV, which is
great for video, they brought

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:55.690
their video window to
the foreground and

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:56.860
made it really big.

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.930
So there are common elements
among all three of the

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:02.520
platforms for this application,
but they've

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.570
highlighted different ones
in different platforms.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:05.890
So they've really taken
advantage of the

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:09.060
strengths of each.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:12.380
Flixster radically simplified
their tablet

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:13.880
application for the TV.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.010
So where their tablet
application has a lot of text,

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.160
they removed almost
all the text.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.650
They made big images, big fonts,
dark backgrounds and

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:26.620
gradients, made it more simple
both in terms of navigation

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.370
and in terms of visually.

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:31.545
So in this case, they just took
their tablet application,

00:16:31.545 --> 00:16:33.790
and they really simplified it
and pulled some things out

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.640
until it was right for the TV.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.760
So those are three really
common strategies

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.470
for moving to TV--

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:43.940
mapping it over pretty directly
if your app is right,

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:47.990
using the strengths of each
application, of each device

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.470
and they're just simplifying
what you've

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:50.720
got on another platform.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:56.000
So now I'm going to dive into
some of the basic design

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.960
considerations for television
in three areas.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.770
The first is interaction.

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:04.690
So the almighty D-Pad has been
around for 30 years, and it

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:05.664
just won't die.

00:17:05.664 --> 00:17:07.040
It's still around.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.750
And even in Google TV, you
need to develop your

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:12.819
applications so that they're
navigable by D-Pad.

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:15.650
In this case, we've got
two different kinds.

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:15.990
I'm sorry.

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.630
These are all three.

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.700
So Vizio, Sony, and
LG all have D-Pad.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:19.500
They're slightly different.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.579
For example, the LG has a scroll
wheel, which is really

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:24.020
nice for scrolling.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:27.470
But the D-Pad is--

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:28.830
it's surprising, actually.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:32.690
There's a reason why it's
stood the test of time.

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:33.920
It's really a lean-back
device.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.720
If you think about it, you
don't have to look down.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.940
You can just put your
arm at your side.

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.510
You can really focus on
what's on your screen.

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:42.430
You can use it in the dark.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:43.520
It doesn't feel like work.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.090
You don't have to think
about it at all.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:47.080
So there's a reason why it's
actually successful even

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.090
though it's so simple, and
that's part of the reason it

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:51.540
is successful is it
is so simple.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.000
But it's surprisingly
different.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.310
So we're designing applications
for both TV and

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:57.680
for tablet and phones.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.200
It's surprisingly difficult to
make them the same sometimes

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.320
depending on the app.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.150
The interaction models are just
oh so subtly different

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:07.400
that you kind of have to decide
in your application to

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.950
go one way or the other, really
make it the same and

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:12.880
kind of designed to the lowest
common denominator of the

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.590
interaction model or really make
them different and take

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:20.310
advantage of the strengths of
touch versus D-Pad and cursor.

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:22.490
These devices all have
cursors as well.

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:25.210
All Google TV remote controls
are required to have a cursor

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:25.900
of some sort.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:26.940
But they have different kinds.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.600
So the Vizio and the Sony on the
left have track pads, and

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.390
they have an integrated
select button.

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.760
You just push on the track
pad wherever you are.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.540
And then the LG has an
integrated wand very much like

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.590
a Wii remote but a little
higher fidelity.

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.872
And so this means that
you do have the

00:18:44.872 --> 00:18:46.220
ability to use cursor.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.080
And it's tempting to use
that to emulate touch.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.600
But cursor doesn't quite
equal touch.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.490
There's a way in which these
devices have such a physical

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:56.520
connection when you touch it.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.560
You reach out, and you're
touching and dragging and

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.610
swiping the thing that you
reached out to touch that

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:03.970
have-- it taps into hundreds
of thousands of years of

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:06.620
evolution of humans making
that connection.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:09.950
Where with a cursor, you're 10
feet away, and it's a little

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:11.870
bit more work to try and
grab the thing you

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:12.950
want and move it.

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:16.000
So it's just slightly
different,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.470
we found, from touch.

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:21.790
And the other thing is that the
way we do cursor on these

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:23.260
different controllers is
slightly different.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.450
So track pad has some different

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.600
strengths than a wand has.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.480
So what I mean is it's not
as consistent as touch.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.310
So for those two reasons, we
recommend that people really

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:38.860
design their apps around D-Pad
navigation first and then use

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:42.790
the cursor as an accelerator
to that navigation.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:45.710
It's best for low-twitch
interactions like Angry Birds.

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:48.300
And you really-- you
kind of want to--

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.290
the developers made
me say this.

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:52.150
You got to stay away from
drag and drop as well.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:54.440
Sometimes the D-Pads--

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.380
I'm sorry-- the track
pads are hard.

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.740
When you click and drag, it
takes a fair amount of force

00:19:58.740 --> 00:19:59.960
on your thumb.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.500
If you use that as a main
interaction model, sometimes

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.500
some people have trouble
with it.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.330
And then finally, you need
big hit targets.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:07.610
The screens are so big.

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:09.830
You think about it, just a
little translation of angle

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:11.980
here moves it a lot
on the big screen.

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.060
And so you really need bigger
hit targets than you might

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.650
have even in touch.

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:21.060
D-Pad is really a linear
interaction model.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:23.170
You think about it
almost like the

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:24.210
old-fashioned cassette tapes--

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.410
I'm dating myself-- where you
had to fast-forward through

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:29.750
four songs to get to
the fifth song.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.720
And then touch is more like
RAM, random access memory,

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.260
where you can just touch
whatever you want.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.050
So because it's linear, you have
to think more about the

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:40.490
navigation that you're
presenting to your users.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.170
The focus states in the layout
help the user predict how to

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:46.850
get from point A to point B. But
they have to think about

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:48.650
it a bit, and you need to
think about it as well.

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:49.680
It needs to be continuous.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:53.410
You don't want the focus to have
to jump across the screen

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:55.490
and between big states.

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:58.890
In an Android, the focus order
tends to follow the way that

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:00.660
the components are laid out
on the screen by a layout

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.200
manager, for example.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.850
And so we find that it's better
if you explicitly

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:07.940
manage the focus in your
application rather than

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.190
letting the system do it.

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:16.130
So there's three types of focus,
three states actually.

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:17.260
So there's selection.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:20.090
There's focus, and there's
focused selection.

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:21.530
So the first is really
familiar.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:23.250
Selection is--

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:24.550
this is a tab, for example.

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:27.820
This is the Shows tab
of a TV movies app.

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.610
The tab or a section of an
application is a more

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:33.920
permanent state-- not permanent,
but it lives for a

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.150
longer time.

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:36.990
The focus state is--

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:41.450
it shows the position of the
D-Pad as the user moves the

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:42.600
focus around.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.510
It needs to be big and
really visible.

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:46.340
Like this blue glowing
rectangle, I actually think

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:47.430
that's not even strong enough.

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.730
Maybe it could be stronger,
because the user needs to be

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:51.830
able to just look up at the
screen and know exactly where

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:53.730
the D-Pad is.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:55.290
Because everything
goes from there.

00:21:55.290 --> 00:22:01.210
And then the third thing is,
like a cursor, you can hover

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:02.990
over a particular area.

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:06.150
And with D-Pad, wherever the
focus is, we do things like

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:10.470
after a second, if the user
keeps the focus on that area,

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:12.330
we can pop up a hover card
like this and give more

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:16.310
information and progressively
reveal more info.

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:19.420
So some views in Android, like
the image views, they're not

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:20.600
focusable by default.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.690
So the one code thing I'll say
is you have to turn on the

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:24.960
focusable attribute
to turn this on.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.130
And we also think you should
explicitly manage

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:28.380
the order of focus.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.110
All right.

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:32.620
Keyboards.

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:35.420
All remotes for Google
TV have to have

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:38.290
a hard QWERTY keyboard.

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:40.650
They started out being big, and
now they're on the back of

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:43.170
the generation of remotes
that happen now.

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:45.530
The one thing to think about
is in the next generation

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:48.500
coming out next year,
we're making the

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.170
hard keyboard optional.

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.330
And so you'll have to make sure
that your applications

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:53.960
support on-screen keyboards.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.910
It'll just be the standard
Android keyboard.

00:22:55.910 --> 00:23:00.140
Each manufacturer will create
their own variation of it, but

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.150
it should work just fine
other than it will

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:05.030
support D-Pad and cursor.

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:05.770
OK.

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:07.490
And the last interaction
model, of course, is

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:08.810
multiscreen experiences.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:10.960
We've seen a lot of great
experiences, like this

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.190
mobile poker app.

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:15.210
Zynga Poker is upstairs as well,
where the table is on

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.950
the big screen, and each person
literally has their own

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:21.160
hand of cards in their own hand
on their mobile device.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.650
But we've only just begun.

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:25.830
I mean, this is brand-new
area of opportunity.

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:26.990
So we're really looking
forward to

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:28.240
what you guys create.

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:33.090
All right.

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:34.600
A couple areas of design.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.900
A couple design tips.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.860
So this is the Google music
beta app from a

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:40.750
while ago on the web.

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:44.871
So what would be wrong with just
putting this on the TV?

00:23:44.871 --> 00:23:48.810
Anybody spot any problems
with this app?

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:51.940
A lot of text.

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:53.760
Not available in Australia.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.660
Make everything available
in Australia.

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.860
Very important design
consideration.

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.715
Yes, there's way
too much text.

00:24:00.715 --> 00:24:02.450
The information density
is very high.

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:04.000
The fonts are really small.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.270
But really one of the big ones
is-- and it's hard to think

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:08.710
about is it's all white.

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:12.370
In the environments where we
watch TV, on these big

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:14.380
screens, as they get
bigger it's like

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:15.300
looking at a light bulb.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.742
You have so much light emanating
at you in a dark

00:24:17.742 --> 00:24:19.890
rook that it can be
really blinding.

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:22.730
So this is one of the biggest
changes from the web, where

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:26.340
most backgrounds are white to
TV, where most backgrounds

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:27.910
really need to be dark.

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:30.300
Also you have to be careful
about using

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.310
certain reds and oranges.

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:35.180
They vibrate and don't translate
very well to TV.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:36.130
This orange might OK.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:37.610
I don't know for sure.

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:40.390
And then finally, this app
is very text heavy.

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:42.670
You really want to think about
how your application can

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:44.560
communicate better visually.

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.640
Visual things are much
better on TV.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.420
Here's an example of the same
app, a different part of it.

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.240
But it's a little easier on
the eyes on the TV and on

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.020
these big screens, where there's
a dark background.

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.640
There's a gradient that gives
it a little bit of depth,

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.150
makes it feel a little
more cinematic.

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:03.540
It's more visual, bigger
fonts, bigger icons.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:07.680
And, really, there's a lot less
chrome and buttony kind

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.650
of things so that the content
can kind of breathe.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:17.660
Layout is a tricky thing because
of the navigation.

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:20.290
The first thing about laying out
an application for TV is

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:22.500
something that's been around
for a long time.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.160
So let's take a simple UI like
this and put it on an

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.610
old-fashioned tube TV.

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:29.830
And what you get is the
edges are all cut off.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:32.660
So those of us who were
designing TV applications 15

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.830
years ago, we had to think about
this thing called, well,

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:37.890
safe area or over scan.

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:41.720
Because the tubes were not
rectangular, the light guns

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.860
couldn't reach the corners.

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:45.310
And so each TV manufacturer had
to reduce the amount of

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:50.080
space that was available.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.220
So it was fine to just design
with the safe area, just

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.560
design to keep your
application in the

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:54.560
middle of the TV.

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:55.950
The problem was every
TV was different.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:59.600
The amount of space that you had
to waste was really large,

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.600
because you had to design for
the worst TV in the world,

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.830
which I don't know what
it was at the time.

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:04.790
But it was must've been bad,
because you had to put a big

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:05.960
space around it.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:09.570
So you'd think that this
situation is no more, but, in

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:10.700
fact, it lives on.

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.140
But it's a little bit better.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:17.220
LED TVs still have this idea
of over scan, but the over

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:20.460
scan is less, because we don't
have tubes anymore.

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.390
And Google TV actually added
something where at install

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:25.795
time, we ask users to calibrate
their over scan.

00:26:25.795 --> 00:26:29.840
So they expand the maximum
visible space of their TV.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.010
So we can use as much space
as is possible on that TV.

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:36.140
It still means that there
is some amount of your

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.750
application that will not appear
on some TVs, but it

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:41.700
means that the top left will
always be visible.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.000
It's guaranteed to be visible.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.600
It's the bottom right corner
that may get cut off.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.010
And what we say is try to design
around the idea-- well,

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:50.920
the moral really is, is use
flexible layouts and try to

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:55.350
design around keeping about 5%
of the bottom and right halves

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:59.230
of your screen not required
to be seen by users.

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:00.480
They may get cut off.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:07.590
Next, there are two densities
that Android provides for

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:08.600
television.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.410
One is XHDPI, which is 1080p.

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:15.000
And the other is TVDPI, which
most people don't know about.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.400
It's fairly new.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.740
It's 720p.

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:18.490
Now what's the differences?

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:20.570
You don't have to develop
for both.

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:23.120
If you develop for 720p,
it will scale up.

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.180
1080 will scale down if
the TV is a 720 TV.

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:27.470
So you only have to
develop for one.

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:29.950
The one thing you need
to know about is

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:31.270
there's a trade-off there.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:33.860
1080p, of course, the image
quality is better.

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:35.430
The video quality is better.

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:40.070
720p, the performance of
animations is better.

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:42.960
Because you're pushing around
roughly a third of the pixels

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:46.840
with 720p, it uses less memory,
less processor power.

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:50.120
It takes less time to open
images and that sort of thing.

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.920
So you just really need to
think about the type of

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.130
application you have.

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:59.120
Google TV uses 1080p for all
of our applications.

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.800
But it may be that if you're
creating a game, you want to

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.610
create 720, because the
animation is so important.

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:04.860
So it's just trade-off
to know about.

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:11.330
In terms of layouts, you want
to keep really simple, basic

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:12.590
zones of layouts.

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:16.310
Because of the wide aspect ratio
of a television, it's

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:18.640
typically better to put the
navigation on the left and

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.020
right than the top
and the bottom.

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.360
If you put it on the top and
the bottom, you leave very

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.260
little space for your content.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:25.180
So in Google TV, we use
this pattern a lot.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:28.170
We use a global navigation
vertically along the left.

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:29.940
We put the content
in the middle.

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:34.960
And then we have an optional
area of contextual menu that

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.250
gives more options
if you need it.

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:37.630
But we typically don't
use that for much.

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:40.710
If you look at the YouTube app
on Google TV, you'll see that

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:42.950
it uses the contextual menu.

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:44.840
There's a number of
other patterns.

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:45.830
Here are some.

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:49.240
There's the shelf model that
scrolls left and right.

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.280
There's the grid model, which
scrolls up and down.

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:51.880
There's tabs.

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:52.580
There's lists.

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.280
There's lots of different
models.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:57.080
As long as you're consistent,
you should be OK.

00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:00.120
The one thing to avoid is
D-Pad interaction traps.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.410
It's something that you don't
necessarily think about at the

00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:04.810
beginning, but you can get the
user in a pickle where they

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:05.860
can't get out of it.

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:08.050
So in this case, I've got
navigation along the top,

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:09.530
navigation along the bottom.

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.580
If I move the D-Pad to the
middle, it's a scrolling list.

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:15.590
So if I hit down, down, down,
it's actually scrolling down

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:16.030
in the list.

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:18.410
If that list has 100 things in
it, you're never going to be

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:22.300
able to get down to the
navigation at the bottom.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.620
It's going to be like that guy
that climbs one rise and sees

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.460
the next rise and climbs that
and sees the next one.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:27.810
They're going to keep trying to
get there, and they won't

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:28.680
be able to.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.930
So you have to be
aware of that.

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:36.430
OK, so, so much for the basics
of designing a usable

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:37.060
application.

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.540
Those are the main
considerations.

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.300
Not a lot, but a few things
to think about.

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:46.740
So how do you make something
that's great?

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:49.930
If only there were a recipe book
for great experiences.

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:51.890
But if there were a recipe book,
if I could just hand you

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:55.780
this, then why aren't
all apps great?

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.830
Why is it so hard to do?

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:59.940
Well, I kind of think about
it like making movies.

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:03.720
When you make a movie, there's
no book to teach you how to

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.680
make a great movie,
a hit movie.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.460
There's lots of books on the
mechanics of it, the

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:12.760
techniques around lighting and
cinematography and acting, but

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.150
there's nothing that puts
it all together.

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:18.710
The greatness really comes in
tapping into the deeper user

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:19.300
motivations.

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:22.720
What really drives people,
what people love?

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.680
So I want to share a couple of
trade secrets in the form six

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.990
design principles that we use
constantly when we're

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:31.470
designing TV applications.

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:33.520
Some of them may be familiar to
you, but it's really in how

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.680
you apply them that counts.

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.800
The first is content is king.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.880
And you've heard this before,
but it is the most important

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.850
design principle in making
a great application.

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:43.270
Content is king.

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:46.690
So much of application
development involves thinking

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:50.860
about layouts and UI and chrome,
buttons, and check

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:54.920
boxes that often we leave the
actual content until the end.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.390
We neglect the content.

00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:59.380
But if you think about it,
really, chrome is just--

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:01.300
not the browser Chrome.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:05.040
The actual Chrome of the UI is a
barrier between the user and

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.870
what they really want, which
is their content.

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:10.050
So we say design the content,
not the UI.

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:12.230
Design the content,
not the UI.

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:15.860
So much so that I'll tell
you a quick story.

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:18.140
Once I was giving a design
talk in the Bay

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:19.540
Area a long time ago.

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:23.290
And I used Bank of America
online banking as an example

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:26.210
an experience that could be
better, to put it mildly.

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:27.540
And I went into the
reasons why.

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:29.030
And after the talk, a guy
came up to me and

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:30.240
handed me his card.

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:34.190
And it said VP of User
Experience, Bank of America.

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:36.750
And I was like, OK, sorry.

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:38.220
But he said, no, no, you're
totally right.

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:40.850
Let's work together
to make it better.

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:42.950
And so we started working
together, and he said, OK, why

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:45.700
don't you guys do a first pass
and send us some wire frames,

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.170
send us some ideas about
what you want?

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:48.600
I'm like, we don't
work that way.

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:49.860
We don't do wire frames.

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:50.710
We design the content.

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:51.880
We need user accounts.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.370
He's like, user accounts?

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:54.850
I can't give you
user accounts.

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:56.025
That's, like, private
information.

00:31:56.025 --> 00:31:58.420
I'm like, well, we design
the content.

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:01.380
And the user account information
is the content.

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.430
Finally, he relented, and
he gave us his accounts.

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:06.040
He gave us all his checking,
banking, credit

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.580
cards for two years.

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:08.860
He gave us all of
his accounts.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.640
And we spent a week-- all of
us designers spent a week

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.400
poring over that data and really
looking at the ebb and

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:17.940
flow of this guy's accounts,
what he spent on and when his

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:21.930
PG&amp;E bill was due and when
his rent was late

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:23.520
and all these things.

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:26.150
And from that, we looked at
patterns and what could we do

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:28.670
to really help a user manage
their finances.

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:31.690
And really, it's a really
clear example of really

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:34.130
starting from the content ,
thinking from the content, and

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:36.870
seeing it through
the user's eyes.

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:38.790
So here's another example
on Google TV.

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:41.320
This is an application
called Redux.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:44.300
It is a beautiful, lovely,
simple video

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.430
app for Google TV.

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:47.590
It really celebrates the
content, which is, in this

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:48.590
case, video.

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:51.330
It pulls YouTube videos
and puts them

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:53.200
into curated channels.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.910
The video is full screen.

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:59.080
The UI is not visible at all
until the user calls it up.

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:02.610
And when it does come up, it
lives very lightly on top.

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:05.200
They use a lot of transparency
and text

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.170
and very simple icons.

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:09.940
It's not big, garish, colorful
buttons that are dragging you

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:10.770
away from the content.

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:13.000
It really keeps you
in the experience.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.770
And really the content's
in charge here.

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:18.260
The content's in charge, and
the UI lives to serve.

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:21.960
It's a great example of
contents is king.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.855
The second principle
is less is more.

00:33:23.855 --> 00:33:25.030
You've heard this before too.

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:27.980
Mark Twain once said, if I had
more time, I would have

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:29.950
written less.

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:31.260
Less is hard.

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:31.880
Simple is hard.

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.300
But simple isn't just
throwing things out.

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.460
Simple is about focus.

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:36.810
It is about knowing
what you're about.

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:39.830
It is about knowing what your
users need and when they need

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:42.570
it and only providing that
at the right time.

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:45.390
So we say focus on 80%.

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:48.490
And what we mean this, we mean
really focus on the 80% use

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:51.940
cases, the things that users do
all the time, most users.

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:52.700
Make those sing.

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:53.370
Make those great.

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:54.910
Don't compromise on those.

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:59.050
And make the 20% edge cases
possible, but don't make them

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:03.100
dilute the power of the
80% part of it.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:03.630
Let's see.

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:07.440
We use visual hierarchy
as well to

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.530
emphasize what's important.

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:11.510
And we use progressive
disclosure to only reveal

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:13.199
things as they're needed.

00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:14.679
And we let the content
breathe.

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:18.719
So an example is here on
the TV and Movies app.

00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:20.679
In the first version,
we built it for

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:22.300
scanning a lot of content.

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:23.880
And so, as you can see,
we threw a lot of

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.570
stuff on the screen.

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:26.580
There's a lot of images.

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.880
There's three lines of text for
every single movie that

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.330
you're looking at or TV
show in this case.

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:34.120
And everything is equal.

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.000
The visual weight, everything's
bold.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.130
The text is almost all
the same size.

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:41.400
And when you look at users
using an application like

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.880
this, you find that their
eyes jump around.

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:45.320
They don't really know
what to focus on.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:48.100
It's hard for them to parse and
hard for them to navigate.

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:51.050
So we redesigned this recently
in a couple simple ways.

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:53.070
One is we got rid
of all the text.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:56.469
You don't need the text until
you need the text.

00:34:56.469 --> 00:35:01.220
And we made this central
shelf bigger.

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:02.740
The icons are much bigger.

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:05.640
And we used-- on this visual
hierarchy, meaning the central

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.780
focus, that central shelf
is brighter, and

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:09.020
the others are dimmer.

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:12.570
And then we added a hover card
so that if your attention is

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:14.560
focused on one thing for more
than a second, then more

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.180
information reveals itself.

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:19.670
So these are just a few simple
ways in which we made the

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:22.520
application feel cleaner and
calmer, and it delivers just

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.990
the right information
at the right time.

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:28.880
The third principle is
movement has meaning.

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:34.090
And a lot of developers seem
to think that animation is

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:37.300
gratuitous, and they leave it
to the end or leave it out.

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:40.740
But we actually use animation in
very subtle ways and not so

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:45.190
subtle ways to really
communicate where somebody is

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:47.060
and help guide and
orient users.

00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.900
So we do this by creating
physical relationships between

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:52.370
the objects on the screen so
that the users have a mental

00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:56.650
model of where everything
lives and where it goes.

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:58.570
Because, again, we've learned
for hundreds of thousands of

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:01.460
years, physical relationships
and real world, that

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:04.260
translates well to the screen.

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.090
So to create an example
of that--

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:08.080
I didn't have, actually, a great
example of this on the

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:10.340
TV that I could have the rights
to use, so we created

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:12.110
our own little example
for you.

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:14.190
And I'm going to run it through
for full time first,

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:16.630
and then I'm going to go back
and try to scrub it with my

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:18.240
track pad here.

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:22.980
So this is a grid of movies
or TV shows in this case.

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:26.040
The user's going to click on
Dexter, and it's going to have

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.800
an animation into
a shelf mode.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:28.860
And there's going to
be piles that open.

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.110
So you see a few things here.

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:45.885
Movies by Ray Fiennes.

00:36:45.885 --> 00:36:49.230
Then we're going to expand
back out to the grid.

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:52.380
OK, so what's going on here--

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:54.310
this looks like just
animated stuff.

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:55.070
But, let's see.

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:56.320
I've got to do it--

00:36:58.832 --> 00:37:00.530
I'm not seeing what you're
seeing, so I'm going to have

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:01.780
to do it here.

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:09.120
OK, so one of these
transitions--

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:11.960
we'll do the pile
animation here.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.830
So there's four steps to this.

00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:15.195
So the user is going to
click on the pile.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.500
Click on the pile.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:21.660
And first thing that's going
to happen is the place that

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.260
it's going to go, the shelf at
the top, is going to zoom off

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:25.130
to the left.

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:25.660
See that?

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.920
It's going to zoom off to the
left at the same time as the

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.130
pile's opening.

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:33.340
Simultaneous to that, the
content of this screen is

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:35.060
going to fade out.

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:37.520
So those three things happen
simultaneously.

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.505
And then fourth, the new
content fades in.

00:37:39.505 --> 00:37:43.120
And it fades a little fast, but
we want it to feel snappy.

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:48.070
So this is a great example of
the movement, giving the user

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:50.420
a good idea of the physicality,
the physical

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:51.150
relationships.

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:52.180
You open the pile.

00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:53.000
The pile opens.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:53.900
It goes to a place.

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:55.050
You know where it came from.

00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:57.620
You know how to get
back to it.

00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:01.990
And we actually are building a
lot of transitions like this

00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:03.560
in Google TV now.

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:05.740
It actually does require-- well,
it doesn't require, but

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:07.170
we're using OpenGL to do it.

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:09.530
So we actually have some
developers that

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:10.410
know how to do OpenGL.

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:14.950
So it helps to have the
lower-level language both for

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:17.170
speed, but also for things
like lighting and

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:17.960
transparency.

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.890
And some of these effects
are easier in OpenGL.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.970
OK, the fourth principle
is make it personal.

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:28.770
Again, we hear this
all the time.

00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:30.860
But one size does not fit all.

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.530
And yet almost every application
that we build is

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:35.470
the same for every user.

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:37.580
And part of it is because
it's hard.

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:42.870
And so one of the things that
we do is we try to have a

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:47.760
little more modest goal, which
is a technique we use to just

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.240
do one thing to make the 10th
experience better than the

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.370
first, just one thing
that makes it

00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:54.330
personal for this user.

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:57.310
And an example again from the
TV and Movies app, we added

00:38:57.310 --> 00:39:00.180
this ability recently to add
your favorite channel.

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:04.560
So you can select to HBO,
CNN, Bravo, Discovery.

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:07.800
But we don't just
show channels.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.750
We show what's on that channel
at any given time.

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:12.630
So that top shelf is what's on
my favorite channels right

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:14.600
now, all together,
all at once.

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.790
And so every time I come into
the app, it feels fresh.

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:20.240
It feels personal, feels
like it's made for me.

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:22.370
And there are dozens of examples
of making apps feel

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:26.640
personal, from remembering
States to learning behavior to

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.400
providing new options.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:31.830
But a way that we could go
farther with this one, for

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:34.050
example, would be if we notice
that you're watching

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:37.740
basketball a lot, we can offer
to make a basketball shelf so

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:40.700
that every time you come into
this, it's got all your

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:43.290
favorite teams right there and
who's playing, who's playing

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:45.290
next, where they're playing,
and how to get there.

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:53.350
So the fifth one, surprise and
delight is something we try to

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:55.600
add to every application.

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.940
And you can't do it everywhere,
because it takes

00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.780
time, and it can be
overwhelming.

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:04.040
But we use a technique called
jewel in the warehouse.

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:06.930
And this is a technique that we
borrowed from architecture.

00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:09.380
Architects know that no building
built in the last 50

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:12.320
years matches their plans
because of time constraints,

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:15.490
resource constraints,
money constraints.

00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:19.090
And so what they do is they
latch onto one element of the

00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:21.940
building that is going to be
their special element.

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.650
They are not going to
compromise on that.

00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:27.330
And so for example, the reason
is jewel in the warehouse.

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:30.690
Imagine walking into this
warehouse, and the architect

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:34.340
had built a beautiful curving
staircase out of

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.490
stone at one end.

00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:40.240
The user's focus would be so
much on that gem, that element

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.040
that they wouldn't notice all
the cruft in the corners and

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:44.940
the things you didn't do
on the sides, right?

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:47.510
So there's a few companies that
I won't name that do this

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:48.380
really well in software.

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:50.710
But the same thing holds
true in software.

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:54.660
And so we really try to pick one
thing that we as designers

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:55.850
in thinking about the
user experience

00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:58.300
won't compromise on.

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:02.550
An example here is the
Google Music app

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:03.660
that has this carousel.

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:07.490
And, yeah, it's kind of flip
and maybe a little bit

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:09.290
gratuitous, but it's
also really fun.

00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:11.040
It's entertaining, and
it really anchors the

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.780
application, gives a center
to the application.

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:18.610
And the final principle number
six is create an

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:20.990
experience, not a UI.

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:23.260
People who design and build
cars think about the

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:26.270
experience that they're
building.

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:27.420
They build a lot of models.

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:28.650
They drive a lot
of prototypes.

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:29.900
They build to think.

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:33.220
They use the building process
to think about what they're

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:35.330
doing through the users' eyes.

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:39.960
And they really solve problems
completely from the users'

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.040
point of view.

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:45.160
So what they do, they use this
technique called looking

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:49.730
through the windshield,
which is really--

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:52.390
the concept car is a great
example of this.

00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:54.130
They act as if they're users.

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:57.870
They know that who they are
and how they think isn't

00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:00.090
necessarily the way their
users think, especially

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:02.290
because they're spending so much
time designing the cars.

00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:06.470
And the same holds really true
for application design.

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:08.240
You really need to get out of
your own head and get in the

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.780
user's head.

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:12.700
And so we do this through
user testing.

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:15.710
So we've begun just recently to
bring in users every single

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:17.010
week into Google TV.

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:20.720
Everything at every level, every
concept, every model,

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.580
every sketch, every mockup,
every prototype, every piece

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:26.590
of code we run through just half
a dozen users every week.

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:29.690
It just takes a few hours, but
it helps us to get out of our

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:32.470
own heads and see it through
other users, through the

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:34.770
users' eyes, from their
perspective, through their

00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:36.020
windshield.

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:42.760
So this is a summary of
these principles.

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:46.140
Content's king, less is more,
movement has meaning, make it

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:48.070
personal, surprise and delight,
and create an

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:50.910
experience, not a UI.

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:51.620
So let's see.

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:54.360
I just want to leave you with
one last thought, which is, if

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:59.010
you have the option, grab your
local friendly designer and

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:00.410
get their help and advice.

00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:02.860
Designers are trained to think
in many of these ways.

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:05.880
We read publications and
websites and content about

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:08.210
this stuff, and we think
about it every day.

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:10.190
Bringing your app to the TV
shouldn't be that hard,

00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:11.680
especially if you're already
in Android or

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:13.860
building in the web.

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:16.060
But it helps to know some of
the differences between

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:21.030
devices and some techniques like
this to make it smoother.

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:22.110
So let's see.

00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:23.370
I'll have Ossama come on.

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:25.180
Thank you very much
for listening.

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:26.676
And I hope [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:26.676 --> 00:43:27.159
challenges.

00:43:27.159 --> 00:43:30.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:31.506
MICHAEL SUNDER MEYER:
Want to go next?

00:43:31.506 --> 00:43:33.440
OSSAMA ALAMI: Yeah.

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.340
I'll note that there is
a Sony party tonight.

00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:38.865
They're giving away 500
of their new devices.

00:43:38.865 --> 00:43:42.150
All you need is a Google I/O
badge, and the first 500

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:44.380
attendees will get
this device.

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:47.290
If you want more detail,
talk to the Sony

00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:49.500
folks at their booth.

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:50.200
MICHAEL SUNDER MEYER: It's
a pretty cool device.

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.010
I've been using it at home for
the last couple months.

00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:52.280
OSSAMA ALAMI: Yeah.

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.810
I love their new remove.

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:55.130
MICHAEL SUNDER MEYER:
All right.

00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:59.170
So we have about 10 minutes for
question if anybody has

00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:00.400
questions and wants
to grill us.

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.300
You guys can't.

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:02.550
You're not allowed.

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:09.730
AUDIENCE: Can I fire?

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:10.180
MICHAEL SUNDER MEYER: Yes.

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:10.633
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:44:10.633 --> 00:44:14.910
You know those devices you
showed with the remotes?

00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:17.990
I don't know whether you
have that information.

00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:21.935
With that cursor touch pad,
can those devices support

00:44:21.935 --> 00:44:26.920
double touch so double touch
actually kind of drags it, and

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:30.260
then single touch actually just
kind of moves the cursor

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:33.070
like we do on the
Apple or other--

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:36.000
OSSAMA ALAMI: You could
build that.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.350
By default, that's
not the behavior.

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:41.570
But in your application, you
could design such that a

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:44.450
double touch activates drag.

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:46.470
AUDIENCE: But the hardware
will support it?

00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:48.018
OSSAMA ALAMI: The hardware
will support it.

00:44:48.018 --> 00:44:49.690
Yes.

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:51.820
MICHAEL SUNDER MEYER: One more
note as you're leaving.

00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:53.860
The design guidelines that
I referenced are

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:55.860
available at this URL.

00:44:55.860 --> 00:45:00.320
And the slides will
be posted as well.

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.240
Next question.

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.230
AUDIENCE: Just quickly, the
update looks really great.

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:05.650
I think it's a drastic
improvement over

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:06.510
the previous UI.

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:08.370
So thank you for that.

00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:10.500
One thing I noticed--

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.020
some small things missing.

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:15.080
Is there a reason why you can't
turn off the screen?

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:18.410
These are hooked up
to audio devices.

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:21.650
Normally you don't always want
the TV on all the time if

00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:23.440
you're listening to music
hours on end.

00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:30.110
OSSAMA ALAMI: That's
a good question.

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:33.870
Google TV sometimes is built
into the TV, so turning off

00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:36.060
the screen--

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:38.370
AUDIENCE: There doesn't seem to
be an intent or anything--

00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:39.900
MICHAEL SUNDER MEYER: Means
turning off the TV, right?

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:40.980
OSSAMA ALAMI: Yeah.

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:42.000
AUDIENCE: But you want
the audio on.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.380
Or similarly, like, listening
to audio while you're

00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:46.240
browsing the web.

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:50.200
Those things seem to be still
tricky to accomplish.

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:51.010
MICHAEL SUNDER MEYER: You should
be able to do both of

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:51.620
those things.

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:55.260
So Pandora, for example, you can
play Pandora and then go

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:57.345
to web browsing, and it should
be able to multitask.

00:45:57.345 --> 00:45:59.834
But yeah, they're
a little tricky.

00:45:59.834 --> 00:46:01.920
OSSAMA ALAMI: Over here.

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:03.770
AUDIENCE: Yes, so I
had a question.

00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:07.900
The Nexus Q was launched
yesterday, and it seemed to be

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:12.090
a cloud player from Google Play,
whereas Google TV seems

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:14.070
much more app-oriented.

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:18.450
Is there any plans to merge the
two and bring Google TV to

00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:21.010
the Nexus Q?

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:23.180
MICHAEL SUNDER MEYER: We can't
comment on plans yet.

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:27.900
The Nexus Q really is a device
for streaming music and video

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.040
from Google Play and
from YouTube.

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:34.250
And Google TV is really a
platform that integrates web

00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:37.500
and applications and linear TV
and is built into lots of

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:39.230
different devices, TVs,
and buddy boxes.

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:43.120
So they're solving different
problems right now, and we

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.985
can't really comment on how or
whether they might merge or

00:46:45.985 --> 00:46:47.235
come together in the future.

00:46:49.570 --> 00:46:52.050
OSSAMA ALAMI: We'll do another
one from here.

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:55.320
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about content.

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:57.850
As you said, content is king.

00:46:57.850 --> 00:47:01.230
And we really don't have
that much content

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:03.900
outside of the US.

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:06.570
And that goes for the entire--

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:08.000
the Play experience.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.620
So Nexus Q is a perfect example
for a device that just

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:15.100
won't work outside of the US.

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:20.770
And Google TV has the same
problem, because people don't

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:25.860
have any incentive to buy
one outside of the US.

00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:34.010
I was wondering if you guys had
a master plan to fix that?

00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:35.470
OSSAMA ALAMI: You know, it's
something that we're

00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:39.240
constantly working on, local
content and bringing more

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:43.200
content to TV, both in the
US and internationally.

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:48.830
I think in many ways, we look to
the developer community to

00:47:48.830 --> 00:47:51.470
help bring that content,
especially local

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:53.910
content, to the TV.

00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:58.540
That's why we built a platform
that you can easily build for.

00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:01.770
But there isn't anything that I
can comment on in terms of a

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:04.800
master plan to work on that.

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:07.900
MICHAEL SUNDER MEYER: I really
believe that a lot of the

00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:09.990
revolution is going to happen
outside of the US, especially

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:12.250
because there's so many
different experiments already

00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:16.030
happening in the UK and France
and Korea where they've got

00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:17.370
pure IP TV plays.

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:19.960
And they've got to Catchup
TV already on the web.

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:23.620
And so we really look to
countries outside the US to

00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:26.520
help propel it as well
as inside the US.

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.845
So you can be sure we're looking
at that very closely.

00:48:28.845 --> 00:48:30.092
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:30.092 --> 00:48:32.400
OSSAMA ALAMI: Why don't we
do a question from here?

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.940
AUDIENCE: Guys, thanks for
rolling out to Australia.

00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:37.040
You might not have
had a choice.

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.680
It would be great if you could
have lunch with the Google

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:41.880
Music people and sort
of encourage them

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:43.120
to do the same thing.

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:44.690
That would be awesome.

00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:46.320
So question--

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:50.010
accessibility in Google TV,
is it early days yet?

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:53.120
I saw a great talk yesterday
about Jelly Bean

00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:55.135
accessibility, and things have
really come forward.

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.440
Obviously the blind and
television doesn't really work

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:04.110
so much, but you've got captions
for hearing impaired

00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:05.670
and so forth.

00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:08.490
Has there been much work
done on that, or is

00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:12.030
it a bit too early?

00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:14.040
MICHAEL SUNDER MEYER: We're
built on Android, so when we

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:16.500
upgrade to the next version
of Android, we get all the

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:16.980
accessibility.

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:20.420
So we're really looking to the
Android team for most of those

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:21.460
platform capabilities.

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:22.550
And we'll take advantage
of them as

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:23.990
soon as they're available.

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:27.510
OSSAMA ALAMI: But stuff that's
uniquely video-oriented is

00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:31.748
stuff that we're focusing on,
like closed captioning.

00:49:31.748 --> 00:49:33.620
Take a question here.

00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:36.040
AUDIENCE: It seems to me
before Google TV can go

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:39.980
mainstream, you probably need
a different input method.

00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:41.990
Something like a
simple joystick

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:43.520
would be a lot easier.

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:48.780
Are you guys experimenting with
different input methods?

00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:50.695
Because a keyboard is--

00:49:50.695 --> 00:49:53.295
you don't want that sitting
in the living room.

00:49:53.295 --> 00:49:53.780
MICHAEL SUNDER MEYER:
Yeah, we're

00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:54.630
definitely aware of that.

00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:57.680
We learned a lot of lessons
from the first generation.

00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:00.140
Although, it's interesting that
a lot of people actually

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:02.860
do want-- it's a narrow
population, but for some

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:04.060
people, a keyboard
is really great.

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:07.890
So as an accessory you can buy
for your TV to do a lot of

00:50:07.890 --> 00:50:08.930
input, it's great.

00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:11.360
But definitely agree with you
that the main interaction

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:13.460
model, we need to evolve that.

00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:17.010
And I would love to bring
something closer to touch, or

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:18.150
we may leap beyond.

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:20.240
But we can't comment on exactly
what we're doing, but

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:22.800
we're definitely spending
a lot of cycles on that.

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.050
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:26.860
OSSAMA ALAMI: Over here.

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:29.210
AUDIENCE: So with respect to
some of the design guidelines

00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:32.485
you gave and taking into account
the fragments API that

00:50:32.485 --> 00:50:35.890
was introduced in Honeycomb to
try and unify the APKs-- like

00:50:35.890 --> 00:50:39.320
Flixster takes advantage of
that to have one APK that

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:42.400
works both on phone
and tablet.

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:45.110
Is there any way that you guys
would hook into default

00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:49.350
fragments that if people use
them, you could sort of build

00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:50.880
in some of these
design things?

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:53.200
Like it would automatically
have a darker

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:53.980
screen behind it.

00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:56.425
It would automatically
transition the text to

00:50:56.425 --> 00:50:59.730
slightly larger in list
view, stuff like that.

00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:02.035
OSSAMA ALAMI: I think
we're careful.

00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.040
We are an Android device.

00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:09.990
So we're careful in not
making assumptions on

00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:12.140
behalf of the developer.

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:17.040
So we do publish samples and
libraries that make it easier

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:21.010
to get started and sort of
have our UI principles

00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:22.610
embedded in them.

00:51:22.610 --> 00:51:30.650
But in terms of changing the
default behavior of certain

00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:34.130
Android widgets and fragments,
that's not something that

00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:37.220
we're looking to do.

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:38.700
MICHAEL SUNDER MEYER: So like
I said, I think we're really

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:40.640
at the beginning of even
figuring out how to make great

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:44.130
designs on TV that can perform
on all these devices.

00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:46.820
And as we learn patterns, we
are really interested in

00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:50.640
figuring out ways to get them
into your hands either if it's

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:53.560
just a document that's written
about how to do it, code

00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:55.480
snippets, examples.

00:51:55.480 --> 00:52:00.360
And so over time, I'm really
committed to trying to get

00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:01.560
that out there.

00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:04.400
We win if the applications
are great.

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:07.310
And whatever we can do to
support that, we will try.

00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:10.150
But we're not at a point
where we have

00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:12.660
anything to announce yet.

00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:13.530
OSSAMA ALAMI: Over here.

00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:17.270
AUDIENCE: So you guys mentioned
that personalization

00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:18.330
is really important.

00:52:18.330 --> 00:52:22.500
But the TV is basically the most
impersonal object in the

00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:26.330
home, whereas everybody
in the family uses it.

00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:28.940
A computer is really good at
handling multiple users.

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:31.810
A tablet is really good at being
a single-user device.

00:52:31.810 --> 00:52:34.780
A phone is being owned
by a single person.

00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:39.120
But the TV, it's something that
everybody wants to use.

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:44.220
So how do you manage the balance
between allowing

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:47.090
everybody to have a very
personal experience with still

00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:50.130
managing the fact they you don't
want to alienate anybody

00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:51.115
that uses the device?

00:52:51.115 --> 00:52:53.440
MICHAEL SUNDER MEYER: Yeah.

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:55.850
Yeah, the fact that it's shared
list doesn't mean that

00:52:55.850 --> 00:52:56.660
it can't be personal.

00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:58.840
I think it can do both.

00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:00.250
Like the shelves that we talked

00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:03.180
about and adding favorites.

00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:05.920
We're looking at ways to add
favorites for each person in

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:06.480
the household.

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:09.560
So it's still personal, but it's
personal to each person.

00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:13.050
Also looking at ways that we
can understand who's in the

00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:16.710
room and give recommendations
that are different for two

00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:18.480
people than might be
for each individual

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.380
person, find overlaps.

00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:21.630
So there's a number
of different ways

00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:22.210
we're looking at that.

00:53:22.210 --> 00:53:22.870
But yeah, you're right.

00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:25.970
It's a shared device, but we
still want to make that

00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:28.300
experience personal for the
people that are in the room at

00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:29.550
any given time.

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:35.380
AUDIENCE: Regarding the cool
transition that you showed us,

00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:37.000
you mentioned you used OpenGL.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.390
Does that mean you had to throw
away all the life cycle?

00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:42.250
And is that something
you recommend, or

00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:44.110
how can you do that?

00:53:44.110 --> 00:53:44.900
MICHAEL SUNDER MEYER:
I can't comment on--

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:46.910
I'm not a developer, so I
don't know exactly how

00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:47.390
they've done it.

00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:49.560
But I know that we're building
some musical libraries

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:53.140
internally based on OpenGL
that are exposed into the

00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:56.860
Android layer so that we can use
them in the right places.

00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:58.390
OSSAMA ALAMI: And we're working
on bringing those

00:53:58.390 --> 00:54:00.478
libraries to the developer
community.

00:54:00.478 --> 00:54:02.190
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:03.470
OSSAMA ALAMI: Go ahead.

00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:05.080
AUDIENCE: Can you comment
a bit on the

00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:07.040
link with linear broadcast?

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:10.240
Because most TVs still consume
linear in the evening when you

00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:12.200
have large [? demand ?]
for it.

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.950
So how does Google TV-- because
you can't really do

00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:17.970
overlays over linear TV.

00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:18.160
OSSAMA ALAMI: Right.

00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.760
AUDIENCE: Commercial
problem, so--

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:22.750
OSSAMA ALAMI: Currently we don't
support any way to embed

00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:26.060
or overlay over linear TV,
although it is a very common

00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:28.780
feature request from the
developer community.

00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:31.580
I think we're trying to solve
the user experience problem of

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:37.690
how to do that right before we
expose it to the thousands of

00:54:37.690 --> 00:54:39.210
apps out there.

00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:42.560
And we want to make sure that
it remains a good user

00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:45.010
experience across
all those apps.

00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:47.085
AUDIENCE: I think you're going
to really struggle.

00:54:47.085 --> 00:54:50.110
Broadcast needs to keep their
commercial boundaries, and

00:54:50.110 --> 00:54:52.040
people overlay adverts
and everything.

00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:56.536
And it's a big security concern
with the broadcasters.

00:54:56.536 --> 00:54:59.150
MICHAEL SUNDER MEYER: Yeah,
we do the inverse where we

00:54:59.150 --> 00:55:00.650
support PIP across
all applications.

00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:03.020
So you can be running Chrome
and still be watching a TV

00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:05.010
show, but the inverse
is harder.

00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:10.290
OSSAMA ALAMI: Go ahead.

00:55:10.290 --> 00:55:12.850
AUDIENCE: Is there any plan to
make the Google TV source code

00:55:12.850 --> 00:55:16.980
available, like making
it open source?

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:19.010
[INAUDIBLE].

00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:20.788
OSSAMA ALAMI: We have nothing
to announce at this time.

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:25.930
AUDIENCE: Is there a reason that
voice wasn't included as

00:55:25.930 --> 00:55:27.630
one of the-- it seems like
the most natural.

00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:28.830
Kinect's doing it.

00:55:28.830 --> 00:55:31.470
Being able to kind of talk to
your TV instead of trying to

00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:32.830
type things in and such.

00:55:32.830 --> 00:55:33.780
MICHAEL SUNDER MEYER:
Yeah, it is.

00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:35.540
I mentioned that it's one of
the interaction models that

00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:37.690
are coming, but it's coming.

00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:41.380
So it's not something that we're
ready to talk about or

00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:43.110
announced or that
kind of thing.

00:55:43.110 --> 00:55:45.190
AUDIENCE: You did allude to the
time frame that the next

00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:46.490
release was coming out though.

00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:47.520
What was that?

00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:51.890
MICHAEL SUNDER MEYER: Just for
the keyboard becoming optional

00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:53.700
in the next release, that was
the only thing specific that I

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:53.890
talked about.

00:55:53.890 --> 00:55:54.205
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:55:54.205 --> 00:55:55.550
Was there a time frame?

00:55:55.550 --> 00:55:56.700
I think you said--

00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:58.200
MICHAEL SUNDER MEYER:
The next generation.

00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:02.200
So the current generation that
you see out there today is

00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:03.190
required to have a keyboard.

00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:05.640
The next generation is not
required to have a keyboard.

00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:06.450
It's optional.

00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:07.820
So you'll see the keyboard
start to disappear.

00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:09.970
But I didn't comment
on the voice.

00:56:09.970 --> 00:56:12.060
OSSAMA ALAMI: It's worth noting
that LG remote and the

00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:16.076
Sony remote both have
microphones now that ties into

00:56:16.076 --> 00:56:18.872
Android search.

00:56:18.872 --> 00:56:20.270
Go ahead.

00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:22.920
AUDIENCE: Yeah, basically, you
guys are dealing with LG,

00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:26.840
Sony, and historically it was
the Logitech and new devices

00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:28.250
going to be coming out.

00:56:28.250 --> 00:56:30.930
Are you doing anything about
those devices which are coming

00:56:30.930 --> 00:56:31.840
out of China?

00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:35.290
I mean, just have the Android
4 on it or 2.3 on it?

00:56:35.290 --> 00:56:39.340
I mean, is there any control
you guys have on those?

00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:42.190
OSSAMA ALAMI: You know, that's
not really something I can

00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:44.070
comment about.

00:56:44.070 --> 00:56:44.980
MICHAEL SUNDER MEYER:
Yeah, I mean,

00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:46.570
Android's an open platform.

00:56:46.570 --> 00:56:47.780
Anybody can use it.

00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:50.202
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it has Google
Play, so you just publish your

00:56:50.202 --> 00:56:53.570
app as Google TV pretty much.

00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:55.420
MICHAEL SUNDER MEYER: As we can
attest, it's very, very

00:56:55.420 --> 00:57:01.040
hard to get everything working
on a TV, all the codecs and

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.660
all the new chip sets
and different

00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:03.690
things you want to support.

00:57:03.690 --> 00:57:07.220
Part of what we do for
developers and for OEMs is to

00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:12.320
do all that work for you and
hand you Android++ that lets

00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:13.750
you focus on the apps
and services you

00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:14.870
want to build on top.

00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:18.630
But if third parties, OEMs want
to build it from scratch

00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:20.590
from Android, then you're
welcome to.

00:57:20.590 --> 00:57:24.150
AUDIENCE: Just a related
question, fundamentally, is

00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:28.810
there a difference between 4 and
the Google TV version of

00:57:28.810 --> 00:57:31.180
it or it's pretty
much the same?

00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:31.480
OSSAMA ALAMI: Between?

00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:34.070
AUDIENCE: Android 4 and
the Google TV version.

00:57:34.070 --> 00:57:36.320
OSSAMA ALAMI: Google TV is
heavily optimized for the

00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:39.510
TV-watching experience.

00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:44.300
I mean, one of the most obvious
differences is that we

00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:45.550
support linear TV.

00:57:45.550 --> 00:57:48.690
So we have an HDMI in, and
we do HDMI pass-through.

00:57:48.690 --> 00:57:53.100
And it's really about bringing
the web to the TV-watching

00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:55.720
experience that users
already have.

00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:56.540
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:58.650
MICHAEL SUNDER MEYER: All right,
thank you, everybody.

00:57:58.650 --> 00:58:00.140
I think we'll call
that a wrap.

00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:00.970
OSSAMA ALAMI: Thanks, everyone.

00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:06.182
[APPLAUSE]
