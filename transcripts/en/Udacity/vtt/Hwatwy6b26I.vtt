00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.140
Both these algorithms it turns out
have been used in the sequential games

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.361
setting, the games.

00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:09.930
&gt;&gt; Most solution concepts are usually
useful in all those things.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.430
You should mention one other thing
which is we actually pointed out

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.140
that something that we talked about last
time was in fact a solution concept.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.100
But Nash.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.531
&gt;&gt; Nash and?

00:00:20.531 --> 00:00:21.810
&gt;&gt; Subgame perfect.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.830
&gt;&gt; Right.
Right, by the way worth pointing out.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.250
That the King Solomon alternative.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.000
That I described before
is subgame perfect.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.180
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.580
Well so let's flip over to that.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.170
Which is mechanism design.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.400
We talked about.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.130
&gt;&gt; Two things in particular.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.000
We talked about peer teaching.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.110
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.950
&gt;&gt; And we talked about King Solomon.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.060
&gt;&gt; Dividing up babies.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.080
&gt;&gt; Baby division.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.640
Never ever divide by zero.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.670
Now what's interesting about mechanism
design, sort of the flip side or

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.690
compliment of what we normally think
about in playing games is that one could

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.970
look at a lot of these solution concepts
as in fact being mechanism design.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.870
Right, you create coco values as
a way of encouraging certain kinds of

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.980
behavior by setting up
binding side payments.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.890
You think of correlated equilibria
as working because you've created

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.110
a mechanism, this shared source of
randomization that will encourage

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.340
behavior that it wouldn't
otherwise encourage.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.810
Therefore all the solution concepts
can be thought of, sort of,

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.750
at least all the ones beyond the kind of
obvious when the natural delivery in any

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.910
way I think about that, can be thought
of as a kind of mechanism design.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:33.690
These extensions,

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.600
these things that we introduce are to
induce certain kinds of behavior.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.160
And so, even if we didn't want to
think too hard about mechanism design,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.530
I wanted to believe it wasn't really
a part of reinforcement learning.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.520
It really is, because all of these
things that we come up with as these

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.940
sort of extensions solution concepts are
really about getting better outcomes.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.650
&gt;&gt; And they're all about
driving behavior using rewards.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.183
&gt;&gt; Right, which is so
much better than Driving Ms. Daisy.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.080
So I think that's everything
that we've learned.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.208
Okay, so what's next.

00:02:02.208 --> 00:02:07.310
&gt;&gt; I think we're done
actually with the material.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.150
We have kind of a wrap up that
we need to do like an outtro and

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.020
so yes we're getting down to
the to the near terminal state.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.610
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.500
Well I think it's good well this is been
fun I mean I guess I will get to see you

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.330
again after this because we do have
a few things that we need to do, but

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.878
I think we've covered all the material.

00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:27.293
&gt;&gt; Wow.
Well done.

00:02:27.293 --> 00:02:27.910
Great.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.272
Well, good job everybody.

00:02:29.272 --> 00:02:32.440
Yeah good job,
I guess I will see you later Michael.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.940
Bye
&gt;&gt; Bye.
