Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab. Our topic today, songs that get stuck in your head and won't unstick. Now in the last section we would got, we've talked about people who were invaded by music and couldn't get the music out of their heads. Yeah. Now let's switch and talk about people who desire more than anything to get a tune a melody into their heads. Oh No, it was just specifically people who are professional songwriters like Pam. Hello, my name is Bob Darrow and I'm visiting here with radio lab. Is that it? What is it? It's radio. Everybody is completely aware of our program, but then again, not everybody would be necessarily aware of Bob Durrow was that good? But you may know this conjunction junction. What's your function, Liz?

Speaker 2:          00:49          I'm just a bill. Yes. I'm only up and I'm sitting here on campus though.

Speaker 1:          00:56          This si low, my hero. How wonderful you are. If you grew up in the 1970s and 1980s which I by the way, did not new. So everything that we've just heard I never heard before. Oh my God, am I heard this? So you know schoolhouse rock. Yeah. And you have Bob Durrow to thank for all the songs that will not eat your head xe. We invited Bob over to my apartment to sit my piano. Talk a little bit about Hook Enos. That's right. What makes a song so sticky, so sticky for your head? How does that happen? No one ever gets that. You get your, he told us a story of getting a call. This was back in 1972 from a felon named David [inaudible] call. He was in advertising executive, the president of a small advertising agency, and he simply said, my little boy can't memorize the times tables, but he sings along with Jimmy Hendrickson, the rolling stones and gets their words, why can't we put the multiplication tables to music? We'll call it multiplication in rock. Why do you think looking at me? And I said, yeah. Did you say ea with confidence? Well, then I did some research. I looked in the math books that I had in my library and then I just came to me as the title three is a magic number. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:26          hey, that's good. [inaudible] match. Want to hear Martin somewhere in the ancient mystic trinity and then I went to look in the Bible and I looked everywhere, right? It is one of the magic numbers and then I thought of Buckminster Fuller. Why button fits because of that GDC film thing? Well, the triangle, the train strongest shake there can be because it can't bend. A square can sag, right, and become a parallelogram or something. But a triangle is fixed match. Very triangular parity, right? Every tracking has three corners. Every tracking has three sides, no more, no less. You don't have to guess when it's three sees the magic number.

Speaker 3:          03:20          That's a badge. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:24          I guess a magic as you can hear from these remakes three really isn't magic.

Speaker 3:          03:29          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:32          In any case, at the end of this conversation, I asked Bob Duro to think back way back before you did schoolhouse rock, before you became a jazz musician, back to when you were a kid. Do you remember the first time you got a really good musical idea when a melody that kind of popped into your head? He said, of course I do. Let me play it for you. No, the doorstep side by side. Since I'm the doorstep when my bread tonight sitting on the doorstep tonight, we'll do the forced. Definitely known that doorstep and that's all there. That's all they are like that was your first song. Not a bad melody. [inaudible] terrible words.

Speaker 1:          04:17          I made it up plowing. I was helping uncle John on the phone. I was riding a heroin. I don't care what you were around here period. So right off the bat, bomb bump on [inaudible]. That's a pretty good hook here. What I care about is weird. Did that come from, from hearing pop music? You pick up the phone even though one school I would say I knew something about songs sub consciously form because it's a, it's the architecture of all those other ones. Yeah. Do these things like when you hit the right one, do they like shout? I'm the one they do. They do. They do. I'm not gonna Forget it. Now I can go to town and shop for groceries, go to a movie, and the next day it'll still be there because it identifies its shelf almost kind of like it feels like it has. Suddenly it has weight.

Speaker 1:          05:12          I it has weight and identity in there. It Ish, it's there. Sometimes I get the melody and then it's just sheer labored and make the word spirit. Where does the melody come from? Melody comes the Muse. You ever met this muse? A lot of people are visited by the Muse and they don't recognize her. When you were plowing that day, way back in a head amuse. Yeah, but did you know that you had one or do you just think it was just something that like, like like new shoes and I thought it was something that just came out of the air to me. I wonder if I stole it.

Speaker 1:          05:55          That would, that would worry, I guess. Yeah. Yeah. Oh that's one of the songwriters mean objectives. When you think of a melody say, am I stealing that? See that. That's how mysterious this is. You don't know whether the idea was yours as originally yours or whether you heard it in some earlier part of your life and it belongs to someone else you don't know. So the muse is a tricky kind of goddess and you know where it really gets extra tricky. Imagine if you write a tune and it has weight for you and people begin to enjoy it where you live. And then very mysteriously it begins to circle the world. And people who don't share your language, don't share yours. Tradition your culture. Share your tune. That is really mysterious. Okay, with that in mind, uh, I got one for Ya.

Speaker 4:          06:44          Here is a delightful English artist, England's popular young recording star at Chula Clark. So let's have a very fine

Speaker 3:          06:51          welcome. This is a tune that was written by a British guy who came in New York, sang by a Parisian who everyone thought was American and what they made. Everybody knows. One of my favorite records to the clock down down though,

Speaker 4:          07:12          listen to the music downtown. And

Speaker 5:          07:17          this particular record has special memories for me. Bitter sweet memories if you like, because, uh, I mean, I'll pull the record out of the case here. Um, there'd be, oh, this is the original single that I would have bought at the time. High records, no scratches. Always looked after. I chewed a glock downtown written by Tony Hatch.

Speaker 6:          07:43          I didn't write downtown specifically for Petula Clark.

Speaker 3:          07:48          Yeah.

Speaker 6:          07:51          Well I'd been to New York in October, 1964 I stayed on central park, turned left from the Essex Challenge and a walk down Broadway. And by the time I got down to Times Square, I feel was strange that there wasn't a song called downtown.

Speaker 4:          08:09          When you're alone and life is making you lonely, you can always go downtown. Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city.

Speaker 3:          08:20          Linger on the sidewalk, new on the signs of prison. How can you be

Speaker 4:          08:28          lovies dally

Speaker 3:          08:37          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          08:37          it had different leanings in different places. But for me on that first trip there, it was the center of life. It was, um, a great place to be. And even though I was on my own, I didn't feel lonely. That's the first line of the song.

Speaker 4:          08:51          When you're real low, none. Life is making you lonely. You can go downtown.

Speaker 6:          08:58          I brought the idea back to the UK and in those days in between recording sessions and mixing down the recording session, I used to have about an hour in the recording studio and I would go and sit in the studio and just a doodle around. It was a good time. After a three hour recording session, the mind was very active and the music was flowing very freely. I actually then wrote the tune to downtown and that was it. I left it.

Speaker 7:          09:23          Well, I remember when Tony Hatch came to the apartment in Paris. That's where I was living at the time. You know, I had moved over to France, I'd married a Frenchman, already had two small children and a life was great. This was I guess in 63 or four and I said, well, I tell you what, I'll go make a cup of tea and you play something to me on the piano.

Speaker 1:          09:47          [inaudible].

Speaker 6:          09:47          I played her the bones of downtown, the, the outline of it and the few words that I had and put the word downtown into wherever it was going to go.

Speaker 7:          09:57          And I was in the kitchen making tea when I first heard the music for downtown and I absolutely adored it. And I came back with a t and I said,

Speaker 6:          10:06          that's the one I wonder record. That could be a fantastic song and a great record.

Speaker 7:          10:11          We were in the studio maybe a couple of weeks later and and recorded a monster.

Speaker 4:          10:16          Right? Right. Now, here's the interesting thing. As the song grew, something happened. The meaning began to change a bit. I mean, here's a song that was initially a celebration of the city. You go downtown, you see the bright lights, you with people, you'll never be alone. Well, after a while, Petula Clark and some of the people who sang it expanded the song to include the exact opposite, meaning instead of comforting, the city is now a haunted place and you are now more alone than ever. Same Song, completely new flavor.

Speaker 7:          10:52          It's got a lot of character and a lot of different angles you could take on it too. One that sprung to mind for us was the kind of blade runner, like a much darker picture of what it's like to go downtown.

Speaker 3:          11:15          [inaudible].

Speaker 7:          11:18          I always thought with the original that it presented a very happy bright lights thing, but you always had this sense of shallowness that if you were on your own and you went downtown, it probably stay on your own and get quite depressed. Actually watching lots of people having fun around you,

Speaker 4:          11:35          right? You got resolved. The noise that early saves your health by just being out on the street, being with other people and seeing the lights. There's a kind of slight desperation in that. How can you, the lights

Speaker 7:          11:54          are much brighter there. You can forget all your troubles. Forget all your care. I liked that line. The lights are much brighter there. You can forget all your troubles again, all your care while you can't actually, but you can go out and try [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          12:08          It takes your mind off stuff. Don't hang around and let your problems surrounding there own movie shows want to go downtown. Maybe you know some little places to go to where they never close downtown.

Speaker 2:          12:30          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          12:30          thank you to Alan hole and the BBC and falling tree productions for that piece you note. I think if our question right now is like when a song falls from Song Heaven, why does it find an audience? Sometimes a global audience? I think it's not really the music in this case. I mean it's catchy. Sure. But the experience of going downtown in New York and you're excited, you want to see the bright lights, you want to be with people and you get there and it still sucks. You still lonely. I think people in Shanghai understand that feeling. People in Bombay, everybody knows that feeling. Yeah. It's like migration music in a way. Yeah. You know, moving from one place to a new place. Yeah, and there is interestingly precedent for this 50 years before they wrote downtown, this was already happening on a much bigger scale than I had ever imagined. Right here.

Speaker 1:          13:16          I learned about this from, from this Guy Aaron, a Fox. He is a professor of musicology at Columbia University in New York and the Damn Country Western league guitar player country, not that rock and roll one too deep. Dan and Aaron n and and turning [inaudible]. I hear that train to come in nitro over and round the bend country music is a genre we normally associate with Kentucky and Nashville, West Virginia, particularly part of America. Boys pick up. Yeah, but it has spread. He says to the most unusual places, so some examples of that and there are quite a few that include the extreme popularity of American country and Western music over the last 50 or 60 years with aboriginal Australians. You mean Hank Williams would be recognizable to somebody somewhere in Western Australia? Absolutely. Really? Dolly Parton being another one elite part. Dolly Parton is this international global star of the world's music, especially in southern Africa. She's a revered like a saint

Speaker 4:          14:18          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          14:18          It's true. Zimbabwe as love. Dolly Parton, you can fill the venue with a band playing Dolly Parton song and everybody will know.

Speaker 4:          14:24          That was fun. Yes, doing good. He was into that rocket job

Speaker 1:          14:27          and most universally evolved. Don Williams, I left Oklahoma [inaudible] if don Williams were to go to Dar es Salaam or to Zanzibar or to Kenya or someplace and book a club, Don Williams has actually gone to Zimbabwe, uh, where he has filled a soccer stadium with 40,000 people twice in a row. Wow. [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          14:54          imagine 40 thousands and Bob Williams crammed into a peak state and down here in the center and the lights is done, we'll use Texas. I just wondering

Speaker 1:          15:08          what exactly are they hearing? I have asked Grenadian Saint Lucian and this Trinidadians or Macon, Norwegian [inaudible] Chinese and American Aboriginal Australian, Thai. Um, why do you like country music? And the first answer is virtually always something along the lines of, it's the stories. Like as in the stories in the lyrics, I was drunk the day my mom got out of prison and I went to pick her up and the rain, but before I could get to the station in my pickup truck, she got run over by a damned old train. Um, that doesn't sound very aboriginal to me. You know how many aborigines are actually run over by trains. Thousands. Actually that's not what Professor Fox is saying. He says ignore the details and listen for the larger story, which has to do with moving, with migration and with regret. Your lonesome for something and the thing you're missing is the old home town, the green, green grass of home, the green, green grass overhaul, Aaron Foxes.

Speaker 1:          16:09          You can boil much of this music down to just this feeling. You look and look around you long for something simpler, something that used left behind and I realized that I was only dreaming what would be the best couple of examples you can think of of I miss the firearm. I miss the crickets. Oh, where do you dark? The first hit country song was in a static reverie for quote old log cabin in the lane performed by Jimmy Rogers and Finland, John Carson. The song was recorded in 1927 and that happens to be the moment. If you look at the u s census cause he'll tell you when the United States crosses the threshold from more than 50% agrarian and rural dwellers to more than 50% urban dwellers. In other words, country music really exploded. And this is not an accident when most people no longer lived in the country.

Speaker 1:          17:03          Country Music is born when the country becomes an nostalgic idea. And so in America anyway, suddenly there was this dreamscape of country places that no longer existed except in heads and the music started just been so. If people in Los Angeles and in Chicago heard country in their minds, it seems just as logical that people who move from the country to the city in Asia, in Africa and Australia might have exactly the same experience that these songs are sung in English. If these people in these far away places don't speak English, what are they hearing? Well, it's important to understand English and the real enthusiasts around the world are English speakers. However, one explanation for its popularity elsewhere is that even if you don't speak English, the message is literally in the music itself. There is grammar here in the vocalization, the singers, this is a very normal country western thing. They actually make a croaky sound that is very distinctive. You know, it's a golden goose.

Speaker 9:          18:05          Ah, oh, long day,

Speaker 1:          18:09          one of the principle vocal articulations is what country singers call it crime

Speaker 9:          18:15          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          18:15          in my book by parcel, the cry break into dozens of different specific articulations. [inaudible] no,

Speaker 9:          18:24          Eh,

Speaker 1:          18:26          and it's not just the voices by the way says Fox. It's, it's the instruments. Instruments seem to be crying. In fact, the steel guitar is the signature sound of country because it's recognized as iconic of a crying human voice.

Speaker 10:         18:40          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          18:41          It's called the crying steel.

Speaker 11:         18:45          Uh, um,

Speaker 1:          18:49          you can hear the loons of there and what seems to come rule is things just aren't what they were before and all over the world where people are leaving from the country to the city and they are an enormous number.

Speaker 2:          19:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          19:06          this is a story. All kinds of people can understand. Country has just as much Grenadian music as it is. Kentucky music is just as much a why and music at it as it is West Virginia music. Is that one, when you feel a football stadium with Dolly Parton listeners, are we saying that they're there in part because the song she's seen, are there stories too? Yup. Yup. This is our music. I've written a lot of songs about the smokey mountains where I grew up. We had a good life back there and heals, and we're all going through some version of, you know, oh, on one to two or 300 year change from being essentially peasants to being [inaudible].
