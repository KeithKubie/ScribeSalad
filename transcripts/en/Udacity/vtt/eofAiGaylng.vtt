00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.233
So, we're interested in exploring the situation where a determinant, b squared

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:08.314
minus 4ac, is negative or less than 0. The reason this is an issue is because we

00:00:08.314 --> 00:00:12.282
know we need to take the square root of the determinant, and right now, we have

00:00:12.282 --> 00:00:16.170
no idea what taking the square root of a negative number means. None of the

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.766
types of numbers we've dealt with so far can express the answer to this

00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:25.012
equation. So, I guess that means we're going to need a new kind of number. Let's

00:00:25.012 --> 00:00:28.691
look back then at all the kinds of numbers we have dealt with. Here's a diagram

00:00:28.691 --> 00:00:32.442
depicting our world of numbers that Julie introduced in the very first lesson of

00:00:32.442 --> 00:00:36.016
the course. I know this looks a little bit different because I decided to use

00:00:36.016 --> 00:00:39.656
rectangles this time instead of circles, but all the sets and subsets have the

00:00:39.656 --> 00:00:43.792
same relationship to one another. You can see that we have the natural numbers,

00:00:43.792 --> 00:00:47.692
which are inside of the whole numbers, which are inside of the integers, which

00:00:47.692 --> 00:00:51.496
are inside of the rationals. And together, the rationals and the irrational

00:00:51.496 --> 00:00:55.882
numbers make up the real numbers. The question I have for you then is where this

00:00:55.882 --> 00:01:00.686
new kind of number we're talking about belongs. We see that the number n is some

00:01:00.686 --> 00:01:05.370
negative real number. Where should we put the square root of n? Does it belong

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.996
in the natural numbers? The whole numbers? The integers? The rationals? The

00:01:09.996 --> 00:01:13.151
irrational numbers? Or outside of the real numbers?
