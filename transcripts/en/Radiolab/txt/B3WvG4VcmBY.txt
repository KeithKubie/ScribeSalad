Speaker 1:          00:00:00       You are listening to radio lab radio from W N Y s t. E n n. P. E. R. Go

Speaker 2:          00:00:12       ahead of the everyday routine. Ooh, ever dream of a life of romantic adventure. Yeah. Wanda, get away from it all. Yeah, we offer you [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:00:26       What do you use them this way?

Speaker 2:          00:00:28       Escape is, I end the free you from the ball walls up today or a half hour of high adventure.

Speaker 1:          00:00:37       Okay, so this is an old time radio show from the 1940s late forties I forget that called escape. It always starts the same way. You know

Speaker 2:          00:00:45       we offer you state

Speaker 1:          00:00:47       that phrase. I love how they say, and here's what's great about this show and why it seems like a good way to start this show. Our show is it immediately after they say that phrase? Yes. They then present you with a scenario from which there seems to be no escape.

Speaker 3:          00:01:02       What are hanging by your fingertips on the sheer face of an ice cliff. Like here's one suspended a thousand feet above incident death with your strength running out and with no chance for escape.

Speaker 1:          00:01:15       There's a million of them

Speaker 4:          00:01:16       pretty alone. I brought a tiny gunk on the ground off the coast of Borneo.

Speaker 2:          00:01:20       You were lost in the London fog. [inaudible] you are the subject of an experiment, actually. Ancient aimless tear, right?

Speaker 4:          00:01:28       You can take your blood. Uh, no.

Speaker 1:          00:01:30       Great. Oh wait, one more. One more just for kicks.

Speaker 4:          00:01:33       You're like trapped in the remote valley of the Andrea Walden by rock. Recommend a landing you closing in on you in the band, the blind man, the one [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:01:49       How could you not listen to that? What is better than like a story where the walls are closing and nonunion? Don't know what you're gonna do. What am I gonna do? What am I going to do? And then suddenly, or Skype, it's like the best story ever. That's true. So you're ready. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:04       This hour we offer you three bizarre scenarios to stories of people and planets trying yearning who, Hey, will they make it? And if they do, what are the escaping? Okay, enough of that. I'm Jad, I'm Robert. This is Radiolab and, uh, to start, let's talk about escape artists because why not, right? I mean, this is an escape show. The most famous escape artist in history is probably Harry Houdini. And our first story is kind of a Houdini story. It comes from our producer pat. Yes. It's about a guy whose nickname is little Houdini. Right? Yeah. I heard the story from my friend Ben. Hello. Like months ago. Oh, your brother Ben, your journalism friend? My journalism friend. Yeah. I'm a reporter with the Tampa Bay Times in Florida, but our story begins

Speaker 5:          00:03:00       at the Attorney Center penitentiary and only Tennessee. That's where we caught up with little Houdini. He was between escapes. A couple of guards walked us into this huge cafeteria, sat us down at this little tiny table and brought out Chris, Chris Gay. That's his name. Yeah. Do y'all have, do you interview my brother and everything? Yeah, we talk then come over here and, sorry. Yeah, I guess the first thing I noticed was he was even smaller than I expected him to be, was going to be little, you know, nickname. But uh, he was a very little reading short little guy. Maybe five. Five, yeah. One 41 30 kids. Prison uniform was pretty baggy on him. He was wearing a white ball cap and a, he's got a big smile stretched across his face. Skyping, I think is it's actually addicted, I think. Addicted. Yeah. I think it is, but I think what's addictive about it, it's, it's, it's a way to, uh, it's a way to punchy. I'm gonna stomach say, Hey, this can be done. I can do this. I might not have been the, y'all might have told me I can't do no, no. My life more people. And I've told me that now I know I can do it.

Speaker 5:          00:04:07       How many times have you escaped?

Speaker 5:          00:04:11       Probably about 13. 13, 1313 out of jail. Yeah. And unfortunate to Arthur k made all 13. I did a little research to see how that compares to other Houdini's and there are a few people who come close as far as I was able to find out. Nobody alive has that many escapes. Could we say pretty safely that he's the greatest jailbreaker alive. I'll go ahead and call him that. Yeah. So I got away from a Amanda pretty much without even asking. Chris began the list of the scape. He has escaped every way you can imagine. Slip my hand, clip off and know what the dire dose, what out the band in between the [inaudible] jumped the fence, poured all my clothes, upset my boxer shorts like handcuffs. He said, picking a handcuff keys, one of the easiest things he's ever done. Sure enough, he's used everything from a pen spring to a safety pin.

Speaker 5:          00:05:02       Even once a zipper thing might hang KP out. My zipper scrambled out. Windows ran out doors, climbed over walls under walls, drilled through them. State suicide twice. He's tricked the cops by drawing up fake escape plans, food their dogs by covering his clothes and pepper. Pepper. Another time he didn't have any pepper, but he had found some roadkill. Stoke. They did smell like a skunk. He rubs it all of his body to a racist scent. Pretty good at hiding too. He's hitting the trees, jumped down a trap door that he cut the floor, his trailer. Once he hit in a grave, I'll, I was a shallow grave beside a dead body. Another time. He ended up in a college campus someplace outside Atlanta and he hit out on top of an air duct for two days until the coast is clear. But one of the interesting things about Chris is that even though he's been doing this for 20 years, there's never a record of him assaulting anyone. No, I'll refuse to do it. Stole things. Pretty much only things to help him run. I always refused to go in somebodies house hours, refused to go in somebody's garage. She says you got rules from self about how he

Speaker 6:          00:06:05       breaks the law. Almost like a coat. In fact, the story that got Ben Interested in Chris in the first place is kind of the perfect example of this. This was a few years ago in 2007 and got a press release from the Florida highway patrol. Be on the lookout for, you know, Chris Gay according to the [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:06:21       press release. Here's what happened. Chris had been locked up in Alabama when he got a telephone call from his family. He said, my mom was a, was dying. She had cancer. So he faked suicide, busted out of the prison transport van that was bringing him to the hospital, stole a truck, and just started driving home. Who's going to see his mom today? His last respects and expected to live there alone as he comes around the bend in the road to where his mom lives. He's driving a Walmart tractor trailer and he's got like a dozen cops on his tail. When I get Dan are running, I'll run off the road crashes truck into a field near his mom's trailer, jumps out of the truck just as I was running toward the house. They start, they've jumped out of the cars and running towards me and just before he makes it inside, they chase him into the woods and he disappears

Speaker 6:          00:07:02       without seeing his mom who had ended up dying before, he could see her few days later,

Speaker 5:          00:07:10       Chris turns up in Daytona beach driving a tour bus that belonged to crystal gale. They picked the country singer. Yeah, he's still crystal. Gail's tour bus in Tennessee and then drove it to Florida. Yeah. So you get this pressure right

Speaker 6:          00:07:26       in any think what I thought, how do you miss with a story like this? So Ben writes a story for the newspaper, Big News, and pretty soon actually tour bus that normally carries TV news people on it that took off and he's an escape artist and something of a folk hero. And soon crispy came something of a folk song. Literally

Speaker 5:          00:07:46       [inaudible] Chris got caught at Grammy Award winning bluegrass picker named Tim O'Brien put out a song called the ballot of Christopher Daniel. Daniel Gay, pretty soon of famous Hollywood director bought the rights to the movie. They were originally trying to get a Johnny Depp to do it, but they fit in the magazines again. It's perfect. You're the underdog making a run for it, for what seemed to dance on them to be really good intentions.

Speaker 6:          00:08:17       And part of me thought, you know, I mean this is awesome, but it's also, I mean there's gotta be more to this story. Absolutely. Who's this guy really? And why does he keep running

Speaker 5:          00:08:31       for booking destination? You want to tell us where we're going. Going to Buckeye bottom road to talk to tare gay is Chris, his older brother. He says he can tell us that whole story about how they grew up.

Speaker 6:          00:08:46       Here we are. Chris grew up in a small trailer out in the middle of nowhere, West Nashville. There are some junk cars off in

Speaker 7:          00:08:56       the woods. If I entirely hanging out with a couple buddies drinking two beers, I'll have any certain things you want to know about or anything or can we start talking about what it was like when they were kids now we lived in a little bitty trailer down there. He points off into the woods, across the street on this land. It was Chris and Tyree. Mom and dad and a little brother named Eddie who went by cotton and then there was Leanne lane gay, the eldest, I mean his older sister, cottons in jail, so we weren't able to interview him, but Leanne and Terry both told us that growing up in that trailer was hard. We grew up like mountain paving you? No, no electricity, no running water did their wash and the river wasn't always much food around. I used to be a big field of plums, a big plant thick. It would go down and woody, but you can't live on plums. And a lot of days we would be hungry. Leanne remembers they're lying in bed. One night night she couldn't go to sleep because her hunger pangs were so bad and tare said, here, this'll help ya. And he ripped up and little dying notebook paper gave it to Leanne. He said, just chew it up real good and swallow it and it'll help ya. And for Chris and his little brother cotton, those were the good days.

Speaker 8:          00:10:07       [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          00:10:07       because when my daddy and her separated, mom and dad got a divorce and the family split apart. Sorry. Leanne went to live with mom. Chris and his little brother Eddie, who are 10 and 11. At that point moved in with her dad and her dad, dad, he really wasn't, you know, I don't guess he just wouldn't know provider. He wasn't around very much. I mean, he

Speaker 9:          00:10:28       was a

Speaker 5:          00:10:29       a deadbeat. Yeah. Yeah, he, he got where he, uh, he would get off work on Fridays and he wouldn't come home for weeks at a time.

Speaker 7:          00:10:36       He'd tell him to go if they was hungry to go steal from churches. Sometimes they'd hike through the woods to their grandfather's house, their mom's Dad, who Chris says hated him and his little brother cotton,

Speaker 5:          00:10:47       let me go down there and he would, he, he got where he started making us fight each other and we could, if we fist out each other in the winter, got some d, You know, he was mean.

Speaker 7:          00:10:57       So that was their life beating each other up for food. We had no kids sick. He goes on this. So one night one of them went and found their dad's rifle and old 22

Speaker 9:          00:11:08       and a tube sock full of rusty bullets and went out behind the barn, uh, lit a tire fire and, uh, made a suicide pact.

Speaker 8:          00:11:20       [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          00:11:20       cotton was going to shoot Chris in the forehead and then shoot himself. And Chris closed his eyes and cotton put the gun to Chris's forehead. Chris heard him whimper and he opened his eyes and concept, I can't do it. And Chris said, well, let me, let me, let me do it. He took the gun and he put the barrel to his brother's head

Speaker 7:          00:11:42       and he couldn't pull the trigger either. And they were 10 and 11 at this point. 10 and 11 man. And Ben says, if you take a step back, you can see that it's right about here at this

Speaker 6:          00:11:53       point that Chris and his brothers started to steal, like really steal. I started that like that on bicycles. And then they went to a little, I guess forwarders and motorcycle is all stuff with wheels.

Speaker 5:          00:12:04       Yeah. Chris remembers going with cotton to sit on a bluff on interstate 40. We would go a wash, the trucks go by and they would dream about getting in a, in a semi and driving far away. Then they went to a, I guess four wheelers,

Speaker 6:          00:12:22       motorcycles and cars, and then gradually got bigger and bigger and bigger to one day. When Chris was 17, he stole

Speaker 5:          00:12:29       a a semi, didn't even really know how to drive it, but um, I kind of decided the keys was in it, so I started it up and from there there was really no looking back. Can I pause you right there before you continue? Let me just name some modes of transportation and you tell me yes or no. What are you still in a semi bulldozer? Yes. Skid steer, skid steer, tractor, backhoe, anything that's the flies. I actually got in a helicopter once and uh, we got in there, started flipping switches and we finally got it. We got the blade rotate, but it was a low, low thing and we got scared and got out of it. Point is, this is his life for more than two decades. The only things that move, getting caught and escaping, stealing things that move, getting caught and escaping until eventually he became bat guy on TV who had police on the rod and six states.

Speaker 6:          00:13:24       But then one night something happened that seemed like it might break this loop forever. He met a girl? Yes. Yes. Her name was missy. She was waiting tables and a little campsite diner. He thought she was cute and Missy, he's a smooth talker. I'll give him that. She liked the way he taught it was taken right off the bat. And a few months later I got pregnant with my daughter and me and him moved in together and for awhile life was really,

Speaker 5:          00:13:55       we still had a little money in a bank and I was working good for a Gregory instruction, had a good paying job, running it up bulldozer. And uh, I was actually going to school in Lebanon to give him a CDO license. We had a nice trailer and it had a refrigerator. Did you like it? Yeah, we ever looked at. Matter of fact, I was talking to my daughter last night. It came real close with my daughters. She remembers it like it was yesterday. He got her a dog. She named him blackjack first puppy. She ever got that right there was the, uh, it was the best moments in days of diapers, days I think for mine in his life I ever worked in. But then things got complicated. The one day when Chris and missy were driving in the car together, we were going right through in the middle of Nashville and, uh, Chris says, look, I gotta tell you something. I stole something cause I start a bobcat tractor from my construction

Speaker 7:          00:14:52       job and to make ends meet. As soon as she heard that missy whipped her head around. And um, I like hitting with a big mat right in the middle of Nashville. And I wanted to for a big man. Yes I did, but it was only funny for a little while. A couple of days later somebody told on me, I got arrested and he stayed in jail for about two years and then escaped. I don't know how exactly right before long, he stole again and ended up back in jail again. And um, and Missy, I stayed by his side again. She, she was determined he'd come home from these escapes saying, Oh, just tell to being locked up. He did being away from you guys didn't want to be away from my kids and I didn't want to be away from messy. He's time. He got locked up. Missy would write him letters. I would send him money cause I work the whole time I was pregnant with my a 13 year old. What kind of work were you doing? I worked on the sand in line, standard rocking chairs. Chris meanwhile was thinking about his next escape and when he came charging through the front door, thinking of roadkill, telling missy that again, he had escaped. I stayed with him again.

Speaker 7:          00:16:00       But this time I started asking for check stubs on a weekly basis and adding hours up that he'd been gone from time he left the house, which I would knock down riding time there in from you were keeping tabs on her? Yes, I was. She even went so far as to take $5,000 out of the bank account that they shared by a trailer for them to live in one that wouldn't move. You know, I was trying try and more or less to make him do. Right and it seemed like it was working. But then one night, Chris came in after work and sat down in the living room with missy and their daughter to watch some TV seminar. We heard loud beaten at the door while, you know, I jump up and he jumps up and um, uh, next thing I know he was, you know, moving that kitchen table and sliding it out.

Speaker 7:          00:16:43       Next thing I know, he raises the rug up off the floor and he jumps down in there and he says, cover it back up. So I cover it back up, put the table back and answer the door. And they came in and they walked all around the house and uh, and they laughed. So you, I bought this house to keep him still and he'd cut a trap door in it. Yep. He stayed up on his fighter the whole time they were walking over top of him. Wow. Yeah. I guess it was more or less I was young, I knowed but I was also in denial. But eventually something happened that kind of forced her to admit just how bad things had gotten with Kris day before Halloween, Danielle and her daddy had went down to Walmart and she had picked out a little, which outfit, but she was old enough and they don't, you know, she was four, you know, trick or treating for a four year old.

Speaker 7:          00:17:31       That was a big thing. The next morning it's Halloween. Her daddy looked at her and said, what baby, I'm going to work. Um, I'll say this afternoon, you know, I'll get home. Well, get you outfit on you and we'll go trick or treating up in Nashville. And that afternoon, Danielle was sitting on the back step and then she just sitting there in a white tee shirt and I asked her, I said, Danielle, what are you doing? How about no, my daddy get home mama? He said, we're gonna go Nashville and we're going to go trick or treating. I said, okay, he'll be back in a little bit. And she sat there and she sat there and um, he never came home that night.

Speaker 7:          00:18:13       You? Um, I don't really hear like, I don't hear a lot of bitterness from you. No. Is that accurate? Yes. Why? What? As far as me being upset with Chris or hating Cruz? Yes ma'am. Is that what you're asking me? Yes ma'am. How could you not forgive Chris? 18 years. That's how long I've known that boy and I have seen firsthand where he lived, how he lived. I'm a fighter. I go to church, my kids go to church. I learned to forgive people. And Chris has had a hard life. He needs help. Help that I can't give him

Speaker 10:         00:19:05       [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          00:19:06       you thought for a while that you could give him that help? Yes, it is.

Speaker 10:         00:19:14       [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:19:14       I should have been there for my kids. Yeah, they take a lifetime. I'm making this up. Yeah. You know, I'm making up what are done

Speaker 10:         00:19:22       [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:19:22       so what do you make of this story, Ben?

Speaker 6:          00:19:25       Well, somewhere along the way for Ben and I, this, this story really became about the symbol question. Can a person like Chris, you know, grew up the way he did? Can a person like that change

Speaker 5:          00:19:40       or do you just never escape the childhood like that? People live with a how they grew up? Yes. Miskiw she says if two kids and a wife that he loves, if we can stopping. I don't know what can, but when we asked Chris, he said, it's in my mind I going to change it on our own. They're going to change. I'm working to change. Really. Of course he has said that before. Truthfully, what's different this time? What? W you know I'm doing places I don't have to take up taking every one of them. I'm taking her anger. I'm taking how to be a better daddy. I'm taking everything about if that will knock them off for pro this month I'm going to, I asked him can I go home a complete another non what for? Wait, is he saying he's going to ask them to keep him in jail? Yeah. The 20 years of running, he's asking the parole board not to let him go, which made me think, I don't know. Maybe. And then what do you think?

Speaker 7:          00:20:32       I don't think there's any way that Chris changes. I think he's, you know, unfortunately doomed to stay in the cycle, which sucks. You know, I'm sort of ashamed that I have that opinion. Why? I mean, why do you think you feel that way? I, I mean my dad was pretty similar to Chris in many ways. Really. My father abandoned me, uh, when I was, when I was a young boy and, um, and I got reacquainted with him when I was a teenager. At that point. He was, um, very sad alcoholic, uh, who often made big mistakes and, and I played high school football and near the end of the, of the year, my senior year, they put out this highlight tape. So I took that highlight tape to his trailer in Slick Oklahoma. And after shooting a lot of Tequila, we sat down on the couch together and I put the tape in and we were watching, you know, watching me play football. And, um, not long into it. My Dad starts sobbing, just bawling, tears running down his face. And I look over at him and, uh, and he says, I wish I could have been there and I wanted nothing more in that moment and today than to ask him, why weren't you?

Speaker 7:          00:22:09       And, um, I think in some way I get that opportunity in this job to ask my dad that question.

Speaker 6:          00:22:21       Ben Says, his dad never answered that question. And after that day where they watched that football tape, nothing changed. Ben got Older, he graduated from college, got married, had kids, and his dad never showed up for any of it. So he says, when he's talking to a guy like Chris,

Speaker 7:          00:22:37       in some ways, I, I, you know, I'm sitting across the table from my own father, which doesn't give him a lot of hope. The only ounce of encouragement that I have, honestly, is if we find out that, that Chris has indeed a, when given the chance to get out of jail, said, no thank you. Maybe that gives me an ounce of hope.

Speaker 6:          00:23:01       And a couple of weeks ago, Ben got a letter from Chris. Can you just, uh, can you read it for me?

Speaker 7:          00:23:09       Yeah. Uh, he says, dear Mr. Montgomery, thank you for your letter. I'm doing well. I went up for parole and yes, I did ask them to let me go through the program. The final decision was to parole me upon completion of the program.

Speaker 11:         00:23:31       I would complete it on October 4th, 2012 so he's staying well, I better get this in the mail. Thank again for writing. I hope to hear from you again. Your friend Christopher Daniel Gay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:00       Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and today

Speaker 2:          00:26:03       we offer you as, hey

Speaker 1:          00:26:08       talking about escape stories about people being trapped and then getting out and getting free. And in our last segment we met a guy, uh, for whom will the escape itself became a trap. But now we're going to take our escape Motif to a much bigger scale. Yeah. And we're calling this, by the way, the outer limit because in this one we're going to the outer limits of the human imagination began for us when we spoke with this writer. Yes, I hear you. And Dolnick is his name. And he told us a story about, so this is Isaac Newton's story for the most part. And it's a story that involves the Earth, the heavens, God, humanity. And you might as well throw in the

Speaker 14:         00:26:44       apple. Um, the one thing everybody knows about Newton is that an apple fell from a tree and bonked him on the head, which isn't true. I was told, right. That isn't an apocryphal. It's probably not true, but, but it's a story that Newton himself told. Oh, really? Because Newton, according to Ed all his life had this notion that he was different from other people. Uh, not only different from, but better. Uh, he had a pipeline to God. God was whispering secrets, the secrets of creation into his ear. Uh, no one else had been blessed in this way. Other people's role in life was simply to, uh, to bog him down. Not what I would call the most modest guy now, but at any rate, what our story begins around 1665, Newton is at Cambridge. He's a student in Cambridge, is hit by the plague. They send everybody home because although nobody understands how the disease works, they know that, uh, if people are crowded together, they tend to, uh, to all get it.

Speaker 14:         00:27:38       So, so everybody go your separate ways. This was a kind of an enforced summer vacation, right? And He's like 19 or 20 at this point in 21, 22, okay. Newton goes home to his mother's farm. Mom's like, cool, now you can help me on the farm. But he says, no, because he has a plan. He'd brought some books home, a bunch of of textbooks and he locks himself in his room and sets himself not only to having mastered all the science that had ever been done, but two plunging on ahead of everyone else on his own, motivated by this religious faith that everything in the universe was set up by a god who wanted someone to crack the code. Newton believes he's the one in. Was He doing in his room? I mean was he that that just sitting there and like with a thousand giant textbooks, all that's known is that he did this. He just went into his room and came out with what we're about. He came out with with the how gravity works, how light works, how rainbows work, how the tides work, and then having done all summer, he did all this. What did you do on your summer vacation jet. I know Mike, my summer I am, I learned how to fold sheets like Marines, which I thought was pretty good too.

Speaker 14:         00:28:48       So after having that, I mean

Speaker 15:         00:28:48       one flash of insight after another. Newton now sets his mind to one of the great problems of all time, which for our purposes we will call the problem of the moon. And just to set this up, what everybody before Newton and Galileo thought is there are a bunch of ordinary things here on earth like rocks and they behave in the ordinary way that we know, you know, pick up a rock, let go, it falls and there are a bunch of much more different mysterious, elegant, perfect things in the sky like the moon, which doesn't fall, it just flutes there. So one could conclude that the moon has its own separate set of laws. There are one set of laws that work here on earth and another set that work in the heavens and there's no reason it should be the same set of laws any more than New York's laws should be the same as Paris's laws can make sense. Actually. Heavenly things float earthly things fall. But then here's where the problem begins. Newton and a bunch people at that time had

Speaker 14:         00:29:42       gotten hold of this new fangled thing called telescope. And one of the things they saw was that the moon wasn't this a mysterious, a heavenly body that they seem it was a big rock, a regular lumpy potato wish rock [inaudible] people were like, Huh, but Newton being of course Newton thought. Now wait a second. If the job of a rock is to fall, and if the moon is just another rock, why doesn't it fall down? Exactly. So what's it doing sitting up there night after night,

Speaker 16:         00:30:15       hello?

Speaker 1:          00:30:17       And it's at this point that Newton sitting in his room or wherever he was, we can imagine, makes a crazy mental leap. He thought back to a little thought experiment. Then Galileo had come up with, which initially might not make much sense the connection, but it pays off.

Speaker 14:         00:30:31       And here's the setup. You've got someone standing in a big field with a gun that he's about to shoot him and next to that person with his gun. Is it person holding in his hand? A bullet. So you've got a person holding a gun and a person holding just a bullet side by side and the bullet in the hand and the bullet in the gun are exactly the same height above the ground and now somebody says, ready, aim, fire eight. At the instant he says fire the man with the gun, shoots that bullet horizontally and at that same instant, the man next to him holding the bullet in his hand opens his hand and the bullet drops. So there's one bullet zipping along, mn falling, and then the other one just falls, right? We shoot the bullet out of the horizontal gun and we dropped the bullet from right decks to the guy at the same time. Yes, both bullets will hit the ground eventually, but when they do they'll be far apart. And Galileo's riddle was, which of those bullets hits the

Speaker 15:         00:31:25       ground first? Well, I mean everybody would know that the one that would hit the ground first and the one that you just dropped because the other one has to go all that. This is, this is, this is a hard drill and the answer is what? Wait. Why is it such a hard riddle? Because I would think that the bullet you drop is just going to hit first. The guns got to go all the way. No, those two bullets both hit the ground.

Speaker 1:          00:31:47       The exact same incident.

Speaker 14:         00:31:50       Really that's, that's an experimental fact. The bullet from the gun and the bullet and things lands at the same time. This bullet that shot horizontally, it doesn't go like Wiley Coyote running off a cliff. It doesn't go straight, shoot straight, straight and then fall. It's curving as it goes.

Speaker 1:          00:32:05       And the thing that causes it to curve as it goes of course, is gravity. It's the same gravity that is pulling the bullet that you drop. Same gravity, same pole, same speed. So counterintuitively, when you drop a bullet and it falls for this long,

Speaker 14:         00:32:21       when you fire the gun, it'll also fall for that long. Even though ends up a mile away. See, that was Galloway was riddle and that's as far as Galileo took it. Yeah. Newton looked at that and he said something smart.

Speaker 16:         00:32:38       Whoa. First thing you said is,

Speaker 14:         00:32:40       okay, this field, let's not pretend that this is some perfectly flat field that goes on forever. No, we're on the earth and the earth is round in. What roundness means is that the ground curves away below horizontal. So really what's happening is that as the bullet is shooting across the field and falling to the earth, the earth at the same time is very gradually curving away from it. Now of course, most guns, you know, they don't shoot the bullet very far and at that short distance, the field is still pretty much flat. But here's what Newton thought. What if you could find just the right gun that could shoot that bullet, not just across the field but across like thousands of miles. And what if as it falls, that bullet curves down towards the earth in just the same way as the earth is curving away from it. In this scenario, the bullet that we've shot, we'll keep falling and falling and falling, but the earth keeps falling and falling and falling away from the bullet. So the bullet falls forever. The earth curves forever. The picture never changes. So the bullet then does what the bullet, he's in orbit

Speaker 10:         00:33:51       [inaudible]

Speaker 14:         00:33:52       hundreds of years before Sputnik and other satellites. Newton has invented the satellite. And on top of that he said when we see rocks like the moon that are not falling, the reason we think they're not falling is because we misunderstand really just as the gun launched a bullet on earth and it goes and never false god who was presumably a terrifically strong pitcher launched the moon around the earth at just such a rate that that would continue in its circle around us forever. This is a perpetual dance. The partners are bound together but they never come close and they never break up either. It's this endless round, round round

Speaker 15:         00:34:43       from which there is no the scheme. What this does, what Newton did is take the moon out of the domain of, of, of poets and, and, and, uh, musicians, the, the golden or in this kind of thing and last Sobek to the same news that we use here on earth. In other words, what he showed is it in a very real way, there's no separation between us and the heavens. The same set of laws does govern everything. It's one universe and I've explained it all. Once you figure out the laws of gravitation, then you can send spacecraft to

Speaker 14:         00:35:29       Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, anywhere out there.

Speaker 17:         00:35:37       If you're a radio lab

Speaker 1:          00:35:37       listener from way back, you might recognize that voice. That's Andrew Williams. One of the first stories we did actually I interviewed her about working on the famous uh, golden record. You remember this? Sure. So the idea at the time was to put this record on the voyage or capsule, send it in the space. And on the record would be all of these sounds that represented, you know, us kiss a mother's first words,

Speaker 18:         00:36:00       your newborn baby. Come on now.

Speaker 1:          00:36:08       In any case, Ann was the one who was in charge of choosing all the sounds to put onto that record. She and Carl Sagan work together on that project. And here's the thing, we stopped our story as the rockets took off, but obviously that was just the beginning of the story. And the voyager capsules right now are about to make a kind of escape that Newton could have only dreamed of.

Speaker 19:         00:36:30       Okay. So record thing. And uh, our producer limb levy has been, sorry, I just turned my headphones off way too. I've been following this story. Oh yeah, you just turn it down. Yeah. Okay. So it can pick it up. Where we, uh, left. Okay. So like in the point of the mission wasn't really to deliver this record, it was to go out and look at all the planets in the outer solar system. So starting in 1977, these two little spaceships to spacecraft, voyager one and two went racing away from Earth snapping pictures.

Speaker 1:          00:37:00       And so every time before you actually would reach another planet, you know, all of the voyager people would get together, go into the imaging

Speaker 19:         00:37:08       room and see the pictures come from the outer solar system. Do you remember seeing them? I remember as a child seeing life magazine, you know, I was seven when [inaudible] was launched. So this is [inaudible] author, professor at Boston University. As a grown up, she became part of the voyager team. All the pictures that, you know, as a kid, you look at the books and to see what, how Napkin, look how Jupiter local,

Speaker 1:          00:37:34       you know, just incomplete revelations. Saturn, the image of Saturn technique color like pink and like reddish, Turquoise, color yellow. And those rings just spectacular. They could see active volcanoes on one of the moons of Jupiter. Finally, that vision of Neptune, this blue jewel, really blue,

Speaker 19:         00:37:57       it's all came from voyager. We had no idea how they look like before voyager. Neptune was the last big cool planet and it was the last thing they were supposed to photograph after that, right. The cameras were going to be shut off till save energy. But Carl Sagan convinced them to turn on voyager back to earth and take a final picture. So on Valentine's Day, 1990, uh, one of the ships slowly rotated so it was facing back to earth

Speaker 20:         00:38:26       and

Speaker 19:         00:38:30       it snapped a picture. One last picture. Describe it. So

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       it's mostly empty. Um, it's, it's pretty dark. You can see sort of streaks of light coming from the sun

Speaker 21:         00:38:46       and then

Speaker 1:          00:38:47       you honestly wouldn't notice it if it wasn't pointed out to you, but down in one corner, kind of a suspended in a sun beam. The rays are very small. Dot Blue, a pale blue dot that with us in Carl sagans words, everyone you ever knew, everyone you ever loved, every superstar, every corrupt politician, just everyone in all of history, everything is. Some total think of the rivers isn't blind, so that one indistinguishable group could have momentary domination over a fraction of that pixel. It was one of those really rare images every single day. I hear from people who take that Pale blue.so deeply to heart. It was, it was a complete reframing after that, they come out of a off, but here's the thing. The ships kept going, going, going, going, drifting through the darkness,

Speaker 22:         00:39:54       going, going, going.

Speaker 1:          00:39:57       Even though they weren't taking pictures anymore, they were using like their other senses, little instruments that detect like how many particles are around, what the temperature is, so they were hurdling through this empty space really fast. Measuring, sending that data back and scientists like that off where they're listening and waiting for what was not clear, but they knew at some point these capsules would get to the edge, the edge of what? The solar system, the solar system has an edge. I thought it was just a big spiral. Has an edge. It's a, it's like a bubble. C The Sun has a wind.

Speaker 1:          00:40:34       Every star has a wing, but the sun has its own wind that blows out through the solar system. It's very fast. It can be between 400 to 800 kilometers per second anyway. It blows out from the sun past all the planets and uh, it keeps everything else out. Oh, so it's like one up a balloon. Yeah, exactly. The wind gives it a shape, right? So these little things are cruising out towards this edge, wherever it is. Scientists don't quite know where it is or what it is. The guys in the control room are like pegging the ships. Like, Hey, what's, what's up? What do you see? Well, the ships are like nothing. Well, how about now? Not much. No. Nothing. And how long before they actually see something. 14 years. Oh Man. It's like driving through Kansas but like a million times. Right. But there comes a day end of 2004 where they stopped listening for a little while because the antenna, NASA only has so many antennas and they have to use them to listen to everything. So for a little while the voyager teams like, okay, you guys over there can use the antennas. We're

Speaker 19:         00:41:33       going to lunch. Yeah. I mean it's not like anything's happen. Nothing's happening anyway. It's been 14 goddamn years. [inaudible] yourself out guys. It's cool. And they come back a few hours later, start listening again and it's happened. Very southern. Everything is totally changed really. All of a sudden, boom. The speed of the wind dropped from around three 80 kilometers per second to a hundred instantly, like just all at once intently. And then everything out there started to get messy. Very Tall,

Speaker 10:         00:42:08       much metoprolol. And before particles are also behaving a very different way and the fields are very, um, we are

Speaker 19:         00:42:26       the fields. Am I kinetic field? So just like the sun has a wind, the sun has a magnetic field as well. The field starts at the sun and then curves out in this kind of graceful arc through the solar system and the how the sun rotates,

Speaker 1:          00:42:40       create what people call [inaudible] cart. You know how like a skirt will flair if you spin around real fast. [inaudible] that's apparently kind of what this field looks like. But way out there, it seemed like the skirt had started to fray, maybe tear a little threads, had broken off and seem to be floating around on their own. Not connected to anything. So what does this all mean? I mean, if the fields are breaking down and the wind is dying down and you said the wind is what actually creates the space of the solar system. Does this mean we're out to no,

Speaker 19:         00:43:13       I kind of thought that was what was happening. But no, it's not out. And it's not quite in, it's in the edge of the bubble. It's in the air. Yeah. But it's not like, I'm not like a little thin edge. It's a, it's a thick, thick edge. All right. So the edge isn't just a little line that you cross at the place.

Speaker 1:          00:43:32       Yeah, and while we listened, the two voyager ships moved through this edge for several years.

Speaker 19:         00:43:42       Zen. Something very interesting happen. Um, is that the weaned on virgin [inaudible] stopped like completely stopped. Yeah. So now we're out. No, no. I mean this is what people thought. But the other measurements like temperature and number of particles, the magnetic field doesn't tell us that we are out of the Bible. Nature surprised us again. So now we think there's a place at the edge of our solar system. Why didn't they add Angie edge of the edge? That's utterly still no wind at all. A pause. People are Connie stagnation layer.

Speaker 10:         00:44:22       Okay.

Speaker 19:         00:44:23       There is a big discussion why this layer exist and how thick it is and by how thick it is, she means when will it end? Because

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       once we get past this, who has anything ever crossed this,

Speaker 23:         00:44:34       the boundary before? No. This will be the first manmade object to live any star and a voyager is like right there smelling, touching that boundary. You know, you only do those things first. Once

Speaker 1:          00:44:51       like your first kiss, your first taste of alcohol, your first time driving a car. The first time you see the ocean.

Speaker 10:         00:44:59       Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:45:00       these things open up a whole new world.

Speaker 23:         00:45:03       First time out of the solar system.

Speaker 10:         00:45:06       Aw.

Speaker 1:          00:45:07       So when is it going to freaking happen? It might have happened while we were talking. Yeah.

Speaker 23:         00:45:10       We're thinking from now. Any moment now. Next couple of months or three years from now, four years from now.

Speaker 1:          00:45:17       It's close. Every day opened my Google alert for voyager and I look and see did it happen today? If it happens before the show goes out? I'm really pissed. Yeah.

Speaker 23:         00:45:27       Every day. That's the first thing you do in the morning. Oh, alright. Like the third thing

Speaker 10:         00:45:47       [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:45:47       all right, so quick update. In 2013, uh, NASA announced that voyager one had finally left the heliosphere but it turns out it is really hard to tell for sure. And scientists are still debating whether it is in or whether it is out or you can find out more about that debate@radiolab.org thanks to producer than Levy Morocco Fair at Boston University and any trillion.

Speaker 23:         00:47:02       Hey, I'm Janet. Boom, run. I remember [inaudible]. This is Radiolab and today we're talking about the escape scan. In this last story, I have a feeling that this guy actually does kind of make it through. This is a true, I think he does honest escape, but he does it in the most original and most unusual way here, where the story is our producer Sean Cole. So the story starts in the late fifties there was this little boy in Richmond named Joe and Aggressi a junior. He's seven or eight years old, and he's just sitting at home dialing various numbers on his parents' telephone just to see what happens. He was on a long distance call to information, you know, five, five, five one two one two, one to just scenario code. This is Phil Lapsley. I first heard Joe's story from him and he heard it

Speaker 24:         00:47:48       very faintly in the background, the tone, and you just started whistling along with it. All of a sudden he heard a critique

Speaker 23:         00:47:56       and the call went away and it turns out that the tone in the background of the phone and his corresponding whistle was 2,600 hertz. Musically it's about seventh [inaudible]. So he has perfect pitch. Yeah. And he was weirdly smart as you'll soon

Speaker 24:         00:48:12       discover anyway, he thinks to himself. That's very odd. Well, that happened once. I wonder if it'd happen again. Does it again?

Speaker 23:         00:48:17       You didn't even really know exactly what it was at the time, but he does it. Yeah.

Speaker 24:         00:48:20       Again, and again,

Speaker 23:         00:48:23       you didn't think it was particularly useful for anything. He does talk about walking past somebody at a pay phone when he was seven or eight years old and whistling this tone and having the phone and the phone call, disconnect on the person. Wow. That's amazing. Super power. That really is. Yeah. Which means he could be a little walking bomb. He could go to grand central station where there many people sitting in phone booths and does, he could make them all lose their phone calls. Yeah. And no one would know. Right. But it was more than just a cool trick for him. This discovery was the beginning of a kind of escape.

Speaker 25:         00:48:58       What were you scared of when you were a little, I bet something scared me. I don't remember how old I was, but

Speaker 24:         00:49:10       it's all we have left of him. In fact, he died in 2007 but he left behind hours and hours of recordings of his voice phone recordings. And as he listened to them

Speaker 25:         00:49:20       that was afraid, you know, something might have like grown out of the bed and went, found the button on the floor and

Speaker 24:         00:49:27       you pretty quickly realized that the little boy in that room who was playing with the phone and he was kind of desperate, he went to this Catholic school for the blind was his mind. He was born blind and when he was there

Speaker 26:         00:49:40       in the fall of 1955,

Speaker 24:         00:49:42       things got pretty bad.

Speaker 26:         00:49:43       A lot of the nuns, uh, me and my sister really hard, you know, and took us only one that will abuse. She used to have me get on the table, then she would get up on the table and lie down. [inaudible] the bad touching

Speaker 24:         00:50:01       things were pretty bad at home too.

Speaker 25:         00:50:03       Daddy would slam mother and hurt her and break things and lots of scary sounds and stuff at night that has my phone up close with the dial tone.

Speaker 10:         00:50:20       [inaudible]

Speaker 25:         00:50:22       I'm on the dial tone. That was always there.

Speaker 24:         00:50:26       It's a nice warm tone. It never yelled

Speaker 27:         00:50:28       at, never fought.

Speaker 25:         00:50:28       What a wonderful thing of telephone in.

Speaker 27:         00:50:32       Well, just a nice way for him to comfort himself

Speaker 25:         00:50:37       those long nights.

Speaker 10:         00:50:41       [inaudible]

Speaker 24:         00:50:42       and so how did exactly did the, the whistling thing he was doing,

Speaker 28:         00:50:46       how did that help him?

Speaker 24:         00:50:48       It takes a few steps to explain, but it turns out that that tone was the key word in a hidden mechanical language that controlled the phone system.

Speaker 29:         00:50:57       Hmm.

Speaker 24:         00:50:58       He wasn't supposed to be able to hear it at all. In fact, it was an internal signal probably bleeding over from another line. And when a long distance line was idle, when there was no call on it, this tone would be being played continuously. Basically the tone means that the line is free and silence on the line means there's someone trying to make a call. So say you're in New York and you want to call La, you pick up your phone, the circuit's got this tone on it and marking the circuit is idle, dial the La number. And at that point your line takes away the tune for just a moment. It goes silent. And La goes, AH, New York wants to make a phone call and then la drops its tone and the New York and La machines talk to each other. So that's one discovery. Another discovery is that you can dial a phone by just having the hook switch, that little button where you hang up, tap that three times delta number three, seven times, dial the number seven. And so then Jo thought we pulses tones. Maybe if you were to make a little bursts of a tone. So something like

Speaker 24:         00:52:07       Joel's demonstrated on a web show called hacks or radio,

Speaker 30:         00:52:10       you were nine. If you were to do something like that, maybe you can actually dial a call and you could actually make it.

Speaker 24:         00:52:21       That's exactly how the phone system used to send calls back and forth. That was its language. That's right. Joe Learned how to speak telephone, which was amazing. I mean, I think that's amazing. Um, but isn't he just dialing the phone with his lips as opposed to using his fingers? Yes, true. But Joe made one more little discovery that would change his life forever. So yeah,

Speaker 27:         00:52:42       if you first dialed a a number like long distance information, five, five, five one, two, one, two. The telephone company doesn't charge for call for information.

Speaker 24:         00:52:51       So what he figured out was that once you get the operator on the line, if you then whistled to disconnect but only for a little bit, only for a second or two, the line nearly disconnects, but it doesn't all the way. It just sits in this kind of limbo waiting for instructions waiting to be used. Huh. And you can

Speaker 27:         00:53:09       the route your call by whistling the digits and wanted to dial and make a free call because the phone company again thinks that you're still connected to information and it's not charging you for that.

Speaker 30:         00:53:22       He was like having an unlimited plane ticket to anywhere Joe

Speaker 31:         00:53:26       could call anywhere he wanted for free. Come coming up and explore the number you have. Code is not connected to listening and so he started calling all over the world, even broken number numbers just to hear the different voices. I'm going to be cold calling that gang.

Speaker 23:         00:53:46       I used to do this by the way. Did you really? My sister and I would get on the phone where you could call information that was a free service. Yeah. And we said, hello information. Can you please contact us with Toronto? And then we get the Toronto operator and let me say [inaudible] could you please get us in comp project with Churchill Ontario, which was way up north. Then the Trisha lady would come on and I'd say, can you please put us in charge with [inaudible] York intuit place and made the transfer you to the northern spice. We would be talking to a person in the Arctic for nothing. Wow. It was the sense of going long distance for free. Now imagine you're a blind kid doing that in an abusive home. You can't even run away. I think the phone represented freedom.

Speaker 27:         00:54:27       Um, it represented a place that was under his control. He can be an expert in it, you know, it was, it was a place that he could do all sorts of things that maybe he wasn't so easily able to do in real life.

Speaker 8:          00:54:39       [inaudible]

Speaker 23:         00:54:39       so what happens next? So things get a little bit better for Joe as he gets older. His mom takes him out of the Catholic school. Once she finds out that the nuns are beating him, he never told his parents about the sexual abuse. He gets more and more savvy with the phone. And then finally he goes off to the University of South Florida where he starts showing off.

Speaker 27:         00:54:59       It started out, Joe told a student that he can whistle her for your phone call and the student said, no you can't. And he said, want a bet? So they bet a dollar and Joe whistled a long distance call for him. And before long there were crowds of 40 kids who were falling them around wanting to see him do this parlor trick. And,

Speaker 23:         00:55:13       and then he whistled up. This one particular fateful,

Speaker 27:         00:55:17       I was trying to whistle somebody in New York, which is area code five one six

Speaker 32:         00:55:23       [inaudible]

Speaker 27:         00:55:23       but instead had wound up in Canada, which is five one four

Speaker 32:         00:55:28       okay.

Speaker 27:         00:55:28       You can see if you're whistling calls, you could easily get off by one or two beeps. So he wound up talking to an operator in Canada. And the operator in Canada put his call through to New York, uh, but then actually managed to listen to the call and then the student was talking about the, the wizkid who put the call through to him for him and telephone companies. Security ended up tracing it back to a University of South Florida.

Speaker 23:         00:55:50       It was just a gossipy operator who told on him. Well, gossipy or security conscious depending on how you view it. Fun Ruining. That's how I view. So Joe Busted and he nearly gets kicked out of school and the whole thing causes just enough of a stir that people find out.

Speaker 27:         00:56:07       The local school newspaper wrote an article about it and it got picked up by a wire service. Next thing you know there are newspaper articles and publicity and yeah,

Speaker 23:         00:56:17       here's the weird thing. As news travels, did you see this article about the blind kid in Florida? You can do this. It turns out Joe wasn't,

Speaker 24:         00:56:24       there were all of these other June Brosius out there hacking the phone system to two one, two, three, nine, six you know you mean I'm not the only one. You mean there are other people who are interested in this as well? They weren't whistling God, no, no. Some of them would use these little machines called blue boxes that would make the tones. A couple of kids actually modified a toy whistle from a box of captain crunch. And because Joe got caught, they all started to find out about each other.

Speaker 33:         00:56:49       That really ended up being the focal point for a whole generation of fun fleets.

Speaker 24:         00:56:55       This is NBC nightly news phone. What phone free

Speaker 33:         00:56:58       phone freaks will tell you. Phone freaking began with a blind young man named Joe and Bresha. One thing he discovered was that he could whistle his own call.

Speaker 24:         00:57:09       Okay.

Speaker 33:         00:57:10       And before long people are actually calling John Garcia and a network starts to form n, um, the phone freak started finding broken, uh, vacant member recording. So for example, you dial a nonworking number and you get the usual telephone company recording. They not working number, but it turns out some of those were broken in such a way that the volume level was very low. And if multiple people called the same number, they could talk right now. Teenage kids would call. Anyway. It turned into a party line. Kind of an annoying one because you had this announcement that was repeating every 30 seconds. Oh my number. But it's still allowed teenage kids to talk to one another at the department I've known. Wow.

Speaker 24:         00:57:48       Oh, so this is it. I mean he found his tribe basically. Yeah. And he would call the conference lines and talk with them about phones and freaking and everything. But that really wasn't what he was after.

Speaker 27:         00:58:00       And I think it's an interesting thing because, so say you're a lonely kid and you start playing around with the phone or you start playing around with scrabble or whatever it is, you get really obsessed about some thing right through the magic of that thing. You end up meeting other people. You sort of have a choice to make at that point. Choice one is embraced the community. Choice two is oh, that size. It's great that there are other people and I get some stuff from that, but you know, I found this thing, my telephone, my scrabble set, whatever it is I'm obsessed by and I'm still obsessed by it and I, it seems to me like he'd sort of made the choice to go for the thing. It's not that he didn't like the community, but he was still searching for something.

Speaker 34:         00:58:43       Esquire magazine, 1971

Speaker 27:         00:58:46       march of 1971 is when he moved to Memphis quarter and that month

Speaker 34:         00:58:49       he had done very little long distance phone freaking from his own phone. He had begun to apply for a job with the phone company.

Speaker 27:         00:58:55       Yeah. He went there intending to get a job and be a man as he, yeah,

Speaker 34:         00:58:58       and he wanted to stay away from anything illegal in gressier quote, any kind of job will do anything as menial as the most lowly operator. That's probably all they'd give me because I'm blind.

Speaker 27:         00:59:09       He wanted to be a telephone man. He wanted to take his lunchbox to work. He wanted to get a paycheck. He wanted to be a real person like everybody else. This is Steven Gip, one of Joe's best friends. He lived in a couple of places. The first one was, you know, just imagine

Speaker 23:         00:59:22       skid row. I mean it was, it was, you know, you woke up one morning when the heat went out and he stepped on a dead frozen rack cause he had ended up sleeping in his coat. I mean you know, that's all we could afford and uh, he can't get arrested in Memphis. Uh, you know, he can't get a job to save his life. So he decides to get arrested literally by, um, doing this very, very elaborate public freak where he gets a bunch of his freaking friends on a conference call and he starts dialing up for an embassies like the armed services and Moscow like and pretended that he was calling as a radio host and that all of his friends were his studio audience high. This is, you know, so and so from this radio show, do you have time to talk and be on the air with us today?

Speaker 23:         01:00:02       Oh Great. Cause he wanted to stay on the phone line so that the phone company could trace him. Cause he was, he says they're not really speedy, you know, he wanted to give them a lot of time to catch them. Two weeks later is when he walked out the door and you know the FBI came up and said Joseph and Rezia and why did he do this? Cause he was trying to try to get the phone company pay attention or something. That's right. That's right. In the hopes that he would get a free meal in jail or no, in the hopes that he would get a job with the phone company. That's right. What a weird way to go about it. And amazingly it worked.

Speaker 23:         01:00:35       Really? Yeah. I've got four job offers, all phone jobs. So he got a job at a little independent Millington telephone company and they started cleaning telephones. Anything from cleaning phones to servicing equipment, any kind of job will do, but any kind of job wouldn't do. You really didn't like it. It's that kind of thing where you realize your lifelong dream and then you think, wait, I can dream anything I want. I can dream bigger than this. And so in 1975 and 76 whatever, he moved to Denver, Denver, where every dream is in reach paid for by the committee to promote Denver. And he started hobnobbing with all the telephone guys and go to the public utilities commission and that's when he stopped working for Mountain Bell Mountain Bell telephone and that's when he started freaking for the man. And so he worked as a network troubleshooter and at this point he had such an intimate knowledge of all the little clicks and pops of the phone system that he could tell from those noises what was going on and we network how your call was being routed. There was a problem somewhere along the line what the problem was and even where it was. Wow. Strictly from listening, strictly from listening. This was listening to the dial tone times. Nearpod

Speaker 10:         01:01:54       [inaudible]

Speaker 35:         01:01:54       no one should go through

Speaker 23:         01:01:56       and he demonstrated his powers on the New York radio station. WBAI there was, there was a show called off the hook.

Speaker 35:         01:02:02       Okay, good old bang. No, just to click now. It'll answer briefly. That was a little funny. CML. It'll stay like that as long as you want to stay on it. Some nice sound. I didn't know always dropped the ball. Fun Number five efs. I forgot.

Speaker 23:         01:02:26       God. Wow. He's like a Jedi master. Yeah, he's made it. Yeah. And so he quit what gave up the job for his friend. But it sounds like you finally got what he wanted. I think like he became the master of the world that he had escaped into, but he never really dealt with the world that he had escaped from. Meaning like that little boy, that broken little boy that he was still needed a kind of fixing in a way that wasn't going to be, you know, no job is really going to solve that. So, so my time, he moves to Minneapolis on June 12th cause six 12 was Minneapolis area code and he basically becomes a kid again, you know, just everything it did from that point on. Other than his phone had to do with children, he'd visit with children who were terminally ill. You just visit with children in general. I've got a recording at home affect those, listening to it. Last night before he came to the interview, I was laughing and giggling because all these little girls were coming up and they were saying, hi

Speaker 10:         01:03:39       [inaudible]

Speaker 23:         01:03:40       when I could hear the parents in the back saying all of this stuff, don't sit on his toys and a, you know, he acts, you start talking about little [inaudible] a little more to me, you know, about his being abused and you know, missing out on his childhood. And he was at a seminar at uplifting seminar and the instructors had something on the order of, I'm paraphrasing, like, tell me how you feel right now. And he screamed and yelled and threw up his arms and said, joy bubbles. And in that moment he decided that he would actually go by that name, Joey bubbles. You may changed his name legally changed his name to joy bubble, all one word. And it was around this time that he decided and announced that he wasn't going to be an adult anymore. His old name and his past was gone and he wanted to be five years old, five years old, forever.

Speaker 10:         01:04:33       [inaudible]

Speaker 23:         01:04:33       and then he started doing this.

Speaker 33:         01:04:34       Gosh, this may already, well, I'm glad to call them stories and stuff. Your storyteller, joy bubble here in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Speaker 36:         01:04:45       You know the recordings I mentioned at the beginning, they're all from the show that Joe recorded every week. He called it stories and stuff and instead of broadcasting it, he'd record the episodes to an answering service and then you'd call a number and listen to it on the phone.

Speaker 26:         01:05:02       Hello, kids and Thai adults. I think the title is part tiled and part of, don't worry. Hello. Hi. Hello. If the story isn't the stuff you've read, the stories and stuff is by both here in, that's all one word. No, don't you dare. But at Joey a bubble,

Speaker 36:         01:05:20       and this may be too armchair psychoanalytical, but it really feels as though it's the kind of show that he needed to hear when he was a kid. Like the new five-year-old was trying to go back and say something to the five-year-old from the early fifties. Something akin to, it's okay in the end it's going to be okay.

Speaker 37:         01:05:46       Yeah, there is help. If you had like an imaginary friend, a bunch of them come that are just looking for somebody to love and play with and talk to. And so all you have to do is any quiet day, just get quiet and ask for one. The kind of like the calm and, uh, they'll be with you for as long as you want up and bond the Finito for lifetime and beyond.

Speaker 38:         01:06:20       [inaudible]

Speaker 36:         01:06:20       thanks to producer Shawn Cole and to Stephen Gibbs and Phil Lapsley, who is now finished a book on freaking and run. I remember Krulwich thanks for listening.
