00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; Female Speaker: From the library
of Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.470
&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb: This is
a change in the program.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.640
Doctor Levon Avdoyan [assumed
spelling] will not be able

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.270
to moderate the panel.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:45.420
He's just had the flu and so,
I invited Doctor Marius Deeb,

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.990
[assumed spelling] my husband,

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.820
[laughter] to come and
moderate this panel.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:01:01.660
Marius Deeb holds a BA and MA from
American University of Beirut,

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.290
and a doctorate from
Oxford University.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:11.750 position:56%
He has written extensively, and is
writing a book on Eastern Christians

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.830
of the Mid East, going back
2000 years, so it was fitting

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:28.290
that he should moderate
this panel on Assyrians

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.500
and birth of Christianity.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.350
So, now, we need the speakers
on this panel to join us.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.970
And, they will be introduced.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.900 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Marius Deeb: Thank you Mary Jane.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.430
I'll follow exactly the
order which is in the panel,

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:14.670
starting with Doctor
Mark Dixon -- Dickens.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.080
Which the panel is, of
course, as you know,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.470
composed of three panelists.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.660
Dr. Mark Dickens is a Kings
University [inaudible]

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.060 position:56%
and former [inaudible] and religious
studies program at the University

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.570
of Alberta, where he took
also his researches --

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:44.230
he researches the connection
between [inaudible] Christianity

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.100
in Central Asia, including
[inaudible] sources.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.030
He was part of the
research team at SAIS,

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.070
School of advanced international
studies, University of London.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.470
The [inaudible] from Western
China, and [inaudible]

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.130
from the Berlin [inaudible]
collection.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.430
So, [inaudible] Dickens.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.400
&gt;&gt; Dr. Mark Dickens: There you go.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.700
Thank you very much
for the opportunity

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.270
to speak at this symposium.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.890
This talk will focus on a time
when a church of the east,

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.780
which is the name I will use
to refer to what is now known

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.830
as the Assyrian Church of the
East, was not a national church,

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.900
but rather an international church.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.760
I'd like to start with a quotation
from patriarch Timothy the first,

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.960
writing in 792 or 93, to
the monks of the Monastery

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.190
of Marmaronen, the
modern Maronite's.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:59.320
For behold in all the lands of
Babel, Baghdad, Parse, Persia,

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:05.430
and [inaudible], Assyria,
and in all the eastern lands

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.730
and amongst [inaudible], Indians,
and indeed amongst [inaudible],

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.710
the Chinese, amongst
[inaudible], the Tibetans,

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.960
and likewise amongst [inaudible],
the Turks, and in all the domains

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:22.650
under this patriarchal throne, that
one who is this half of hypostasis,

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.100
in other words, Christ, is
proclaimed indeed in different

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.420
and diverse lands and
races and languages.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.480
So, in this topical travel, east
to central Asia, looking at people

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.640
and places under the patriarchal
throne of the church of the east

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.200
between the second and
the fifteenth centuries.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.080
Central Asia is sandwiched between
Iran, India, China, and Russia,

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.940
comprised of modern territories of
northern Afghanistan, Turkmenistan,

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.380
Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan,
and Kirgizstan, [inaudible]

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.920
and inner Mongolia, both
of the latter two in China,

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.730
and many scholars would include
Mongolia with that, as well.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.040
Central Asia includes some of the
tallest mountains in the world,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.340
bounded as it is to the
south by the Hindu Kush.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.980
[inaudible] and [inaudible]
mountain ranges as well

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.630
as the [inaudible] range

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.500
that divides the former
Soviet Central Asia

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.210
from Chinese Central Asia,
contains a huge variety

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.110
of land forms including some

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.290
of the most awe-inspiring
vistas in the world.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.680
Like here, the Orkhon
Valley in Mongolia,

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.460
the original homeland
of the Turkic people.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.350
It also comprises some
of the harshest desserts

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.490
and lowest depressions on Earth.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.510
Places like the Gobi Desert, in
Mongolia, the Turpan Depression,

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.770
and the Forbidden [inaudible]
Desert in Western China.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.930
Although there are places
where adequate water supply

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.370
and good soils make
agriculture possible,

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.800
the economy has typically been
based on pastural nomadism

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.110
and transcontinental commerce,
along with trade network,

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.740
now called the Silk Road.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.350
Silk Road refers to a network
of trade routes connecting China

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.110
with the Mediterranean
via Central Asia.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.170
Heading west through the
Gansu or Hexi Corridors,

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:21.000
it splits into three branches at
the eastern end of the Tarim Basin.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.920
Two routes skirt the Taklamakan
Desert meeting up at Kashgar,

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.840
in the west from whence various
routes lead or led south and west.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.360
The Silk Road was actually the core
of the extensive transcontinental

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.240
and indeed, intercontinental trade,
which took place during antiquity

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.350
and the Middle Ages, enabling
not only goods like silk, horses,

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:48.060
slaves, glass and paper, but
also art, technology, philosophy

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.570
and religion to travel between
Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.920
Central Asia has historically been
home to speakers of Indo-European,

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.550
Turkic, or Mongolic languages.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.450
By way of example, this
linguistic diversity can be seen

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:07.450
in the 20 plus languages and
20 plus scripts found at Turpan

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:13.560 position:56%
in China including here, examples of
Sogdian, Mongolian, Middle Persian

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.710
in the Manichaean scripts,
Bactrian in the Hephthalite script,

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:21.560
and [inaudible]in the [inaudible]
script shown in this slide.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.520
Central Asia is also
religiously diverse.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.800
Native to the area are
both Zoroastrianism

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.690
and Animism or Shamanism.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.260
Those are both problematic terms

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.510
from an academic perspective
but useful nonetheless.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:38.100
Practiced by the Iranian
speaking and the Turkic

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.790
or Mongolian speaking
peoples respectively.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.850
Four major missionary
religions were introduced

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.660
into Central Asia along
the Silk Road network.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.660
Buddhism from India and
Monachism from Iran,

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.110
in addition to Christianity
and Islam, of course,

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:57.470
both of which we'll be
discussing in this talk.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:01.490
It was from Persia that Syriac
Christianity spread eastward

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:02.950
into Central Asia.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.250
Our first references come from
Bardaisan's "Book of the Laws

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:10.700
of Countries," from about year
196, which mentions Christians

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.890
in Beth-Kashan, which
refers to the Kushan empire

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:22.420
in Bactria Afghanistan present
in the first and second century.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.350 position:56%
The Syriac of the doctrine of the
apostles written probably about 250,

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:30.200
mentions country in the East
being evangelized by [inaudible],

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.980
very well known in the
Church of the East as sort

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:39.870
of the original apostle, even as
far as "the land of Gog, and Magog"

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.840
but no specific location is given.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.000
You can see a map there
where Gog and Magog are

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.540
in the lower corner behind the
mountains that often trapped them.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.800
More tangibly, the Synodican
Orientale of the Church

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.360
of the East [inaudible]
records informs us of bishops

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.790
from [inaudible] and
[inaudible], now in Turkmenistan

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:05.490
and Afghanistan respectively at
the Senate of [inaudible] in 424.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:09.750
Due to his location on the Eastern
flank of the Persian empire,

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:13.900
Merv was extremely strategic
city, first for the Persians,

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.690
and later for the Muslims.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:19.430
It was also a key station post for
missions sent out by The Church

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.980
of the East, into Central Asia.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.510
According to a legend,
[inaudible] in Syria, Sogdian,

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.050
and Christian Arabic texts.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:32.520
Christianity was established
in Merv by Mar Abba.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.340
Here we see examples of his
name used as a personal name

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.480
in the [inaudible]
inscriptions at the top.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.500
I'll talk more about that
later, and founded several

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.530
of the Christian manuscripts
from Turpan.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:47.610
Merv and Herat continued to
play vital roles in the growth

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:50.850
and expansion of The Church
of the East for centuries.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:54.570
Only a few Christian artifacts
have been found in and around Merv.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:58.350
A large building excavated
there, called [inaudible],

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.640
has been interpreted
as a Christian church,

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.170
but this is disputed by some.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:07.770
[inaudible] in the [inaudible]
Christian topography,

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.500
written in the middle sixth century
describes Christian communities

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:16.980 position:56%
and clergy amongst the Bactrians and
Huns, referring to the Hephthalites

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.820
who ruled in the fifth and
sixth centuries, north and south

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:25.290 position:56%
of the Oxus, or Amu Darya river, and
you will see why I have a picture

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:29.840
of Mar Abba, the Bishop
[inaudible] right now.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:34.870
The biography of Mar Abba, this is
the first patriarch by that name,

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:38.880
Mar Abba the first, describes
how the Hephthalite ruler sent a

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.390
Hephthalite Christian priest
to [inaudible] the first,

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:48.850
around 550 requesting that the
patriarch Mar Abba ordain him

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:52.000
as a bishop of the whole
kingdom of the Hephthalites.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.020
The patriarch did this,
and as the account says,

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:58.010
joy increased amongst
the people, [inaudible].

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:03.150
So, the Hephthalites bishop's
seat was probably in Badghis,

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.470
or [inaudible]- an
important Hepthalite center,

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:09.850
now in North West Afghanistan.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:15.970
It -- referred to in the Senate
of [inaudible] the first in 585,

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.160
which also mentions
for the first time,

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.160
a metropolitan named [inaudible].

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.310
By this time, however, the
Hephthalites have been conquered

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:26.190
by the Persians and Turks.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:30.740
From Bactria, south of the
Amu Darya, or the Oxus River,

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.800
Christianity spread northward
into Sogdia or Sogdiana,

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.100
the homeland of the Sogdians,

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.490
speakers of an Eastern
Middle Iranian language.

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.840
The heartland of the Sogdians
included the cities of Sami Khan

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.000
and Bukhara, but their cultural
influence extended north

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.020
into [inaudible] valley,
and to Chache, or Chache,

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.420
the ancient name of [inaudible].

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:55.460
Indeed, their influence spread
along the trade routes into China.

00:11:55.460 --> 00:12:00.650
This mural from Afrasiyab,
the ancient site of Samarkand,

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:05.420
now Uzbekistan, dates from around
the year 660 and depicts Sogdians,

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:11.970
Turks, Koreans, Chinese, and
others very clearly showing the

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:16.870
multicultural world that Central
Asians lived in at that time.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.300
Now one of the questions we have is

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.140
when did Samarkand
receive a metropolitan,

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:24.440
meaning an arch bishop?

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.980
[inaudible] suggests
several patriarchs

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:32.600
who might have established a
metropolitan for Samarkand,

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.280
but they are either too
early, coming from the fifth

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.820
or sixth century, or too late,
coming from the eight century.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.920
By contrast, another
Christian writer,

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.910
[inaudible] says it took
place during the patriarchy

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.210
of [inaudible].

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.940
Unfortunately, he doesn't tell
us which of the three patriarchs

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.590
by that name he means, but
they all come from the sixth

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:57.330
or seventh century, so we can
assume it was during that time.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:04.530
Now, these were turbulent
times, as we have the eastern

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:08.060
and western Turkic
Khaganates, the Chinese,

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:13.230
the Persian Sassanian empire,
and then, coming on the scene,

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:16.010
the Arab [inaudible],
all competing for power

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.400
in the region of Central Asia.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:22.170
Around this time, the
Byzantine author,

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:26.660
[inaudible] mentions Turks captured
by the Persians in the year 591,

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:31.440
who had had crosses tattooed on
their foreheads by the advice

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.700
of Christians to ward
off the plague.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:39.380
Around the same time, we hear from
the Syriac Khuzestan Chronicle

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:42.810
about the conversion and
baptism of a minor Turkic ruler

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:46.820
and his army somewhere
around the year 644

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.300
by the metropolitan of Merv.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:53.230 position:56%
This was accompanied by a display of
[inaudible] Turkic priests, right.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.020
It's quite an interesting account.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:00.070
Now we come to the [inaudible]
Stele, or the Nastorian Stele,

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:03.350
as it's sometimes referred
to, dated to 781.

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:06.260
This records the mission
of [inaudible] dispatched

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.520
by patriarch [inaudible]
the second, to China.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.820
And it would have traveled

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:16.190
through central Asia before
arriving in China in 635.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.080
Most of the names in Syriac script

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:25.150
on the Stele are standard
Syriac names, Adam, Abraham,

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:26.880
Zach, that sort of thing.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:32.080
But there are also several middle
Persian names that you can see

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.290
on there, indicating that members

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.720
of the mission were
Middle Persian background.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:42.040
By contrast, the donor
of the Stele, his father,

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.070 position:56%
his name was Yaz Bozid [assumed
spelling], good Middle Persian name,

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:48.190
and his father was
from Bahl in Bactria.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:54.420
Another [inaudible] found
in China a little bit later,

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.750
from the ninth century
describes a Christian community

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.960
in the other capital of Luoyang.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:03.070
And here, based on the surnames,

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:06.780 position:56%
we know that all the people involved
were from the Sogdian or places

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:09.460
like Bukhara or Samarkand.

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:11.540
So, the Arab conquests

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:15.360
of the Persian empire lasted really
only a little bit over two decades

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.120
until the death of Shah
Yazdgerd the third in 651.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.260
It took much longer to
bring Central Asia north

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.970
of the Amu Darya under control.

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.850
Turning first to Bukhara,
Narshakhi's "History of Bukhara,"

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:36.430 position:56%
which, by the way, was translated by
Eden's late husband, Richard Frye,

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:39.500
mentions a Christian church
converted into a mosque,

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.680
after Arab forces captured
Bukhara in 709.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:48.130
This image is actually of the
mausoleum of the [inaudible],

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:50.750
an important Persian dynasty.

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.890
We really don't have
any Christian artifacts

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.120
from that time, from Bukhara.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:01.010
But we do have artifacts from
similar periods from the seventh

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:05.190
or eighth centuries, from other
places nearby including this

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:06.490
[inaudible] or [inaudible]

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:09.310
from [inaudible], which
is now Tajikistan.

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:14.350
This has portions of psalms one
to two written on it in Syriac,

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:16.760
but it's got spelling errors,

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.910
which indicate the scribe was
probably a Sogdian speaker.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:23.560
And on the right, very interesting,
a processional cross from Herat,

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:27.040
or at least it mentions
the Church of Herat,

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.420
inscribed in [inaudible]
or Middle Persian.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.790
And this can prolyl date --
this can probably be dated

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.830
to the mid eighth century.

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:38.660
Speaking of [inaudible], just
very briefly, I'll mention India.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.310
There are a number of ninth
century crosses in India

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:45.600
with Middle Persian inscriptions
reminding us of the long ties

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.910
between the Church of the East

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:51.830
in the Persian empire,
and in southern India.

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:55.780
Returning to Central Asia, there's
evidence of Christian adaptation

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:59.510
to local Zoroastrian customs,
in the use of ossuaries

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:02.120
to contain the bones
of the deceased.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.590
And they've been discovered in
various places, including this one

00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:10.810
from Afrasiab in now
modern day Samarkand.

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:14.250
Also of interest, again, from the
same period, about the seventh

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:18.730 position:56%
or eighth century, there are large
number of coins with crosses on them

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:22.900
from -- that have been discovered
in Samarkand, Bukhara, Tashkent,

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:27.260
and elsewhere, and these suggest
that there were Christian rulers

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.390
at this time, both before
and after the Arab invasion

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:34.220
since only rulers can mint coins.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.970
Also of Sogdian prominence,
there's several silver plate

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:38.870
with biblical scenes dating

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.380
from between the seventh
and the tenth centuries.

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:45.390
These have been found up in the
Ural region of what's now Russia.

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:49.430
The one on the left probably
depicts siege of Jericho.

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:54.140
The one on the right, with
Syriac script written on it,

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:59.030
shows scenes from the life,
death, and resurrection of Christ.

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:02.470
Well the [inaudible], the
first Caliphate were overthrown

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:05.290
by the Abbasids in 750.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:09.410
The Abbasids then went on to defeat
the Chinese at The Battle of Talas,

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:12.410
in what's now Kirgizstan in 751.

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:17.530
Thereby securing control of
Central Asia for some time

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:20.810
until the ninth century when
things began to break down

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:23.280
and other dynasties rose.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.980
And so now we've gotten back to
the time of Timothy the First.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.600
And just revisiting the
letter I mentioned earlier,

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.020
there's two letters in
which he mentions the Turks.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:37.620
In the first, from the 782 to 783,
he refers to the King of the Turk,

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:41.730 position:56%
[inaudible], who, along with most of
his territory, has become acquainted

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:46.480
with Christianity and the fact
that he's this king was asked

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.140
for a metropolitan to be appointed.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:52.470
In the second letter,
written ten years after that,

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:56.620
792, Timothy speaks there.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:00.550
The spirit having anointed a
metropolitan for the Turks,

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:03.090 position:56%
and the fact that he's getting ready
to anoint one for the Tibetans.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:07.180
We don't actually know if
the latter ever took place.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.000
So, who were these Turks
that Timothy referred to?

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.090
There's several Turkic tribes
in Central Asia at the time

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:15.040
as this image from a
computer game indicates.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:20.170 position:56%
You know, you use what you can find.

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:24.750 position:56%
It was probably the [inaudible] that
you see right there in the center.

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.040
And that does accurately
represent where they lived,

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.280
on the step north of
what's now Tashkent.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.370
Several Muslim historians describe
how the [inaudible] capital

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:38.210
of Talas, now Taraz and
Kazakhstan was captured in 893

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:42.300
by the [inaudible] ruler whose
mausoleum we saw earlier,

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:46.690
after which the church there was
converted into a cathedral mosque.

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:50.680
Various Christian artifacts
have been discovered in Talas,

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.730
which support the idea of
a Christian presence there,

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:57.240
including this clay pot, which has
the names Peter, spelled Petra,

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.140
not Petros, as one
usually finds, and Gabriel.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:04.370
And again, sort of an
abbreviated form of what --

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:06.480
of the name as one usually finds.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:11.170
And also the finding of a clay
vessel with a cross on it.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.090
So, not much, but at
least indications

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:16.230
that there were Christians
indeed in the area.

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:19.670 position:56%
We don't know, as I said, if Timothy
ever consecrated a metropolitan

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:23.750
for the Tibetans, but there
is a Sogdian inscription dated

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:25.520
to the mid-ninth century
from [inaudible]

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.270
in Northern Pakistan,
a company by a cross.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.400
The inscription probably
based on the contents,

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.710
it was left by a Buddhist, but
the cross was definitely left

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:39.430
by a Christian traveling between
Central Asia and India or Tibet.

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:43.760
And that map shows you where
[inaudible] is located, right?

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:47.750
In the middle in present
day Jammu Kashmir.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:52.500
Also of interest, is a cross
drawn on a Tibetan manuscript,

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.950
with three pearls on
the tip of each arm.

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:58.030
This is very typical of
crosses traditionally used

00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:59.560
in the Church of the East.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:05.330
The manuscript itself contains a
Buddhist phrases, so we don't know,

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:08.400
was the cross an indication
of the scribe's faith?

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:12.100
Was it actually, perhaps,
somebody else?

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:16.980
Not a Buddhist transcribing
this manuscript?

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:18.540
Or had he seen it somewhere?

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:19.840
We just don't know.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.310
There are numerous other references
to Christianity in Central Asia

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:25.490
from the ninth and tenth centuries.

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:28.970
[inaudible] of Merv, who actually
was a bishop of [inaudible],

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:32.040
in Northern Iraq, but
came from Merv,

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.240
was a very important
biblical commentator

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.950
in the Church of the East.

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:42.000 position:56%
Muslim geographers also refer to
Christians, like [inaudible] writing

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.250
in the early tenth century, talks
about the doors on the Church

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:51.060
of Samarkand on his list of the
most impressive sites on Earth.

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:55.310
Another Muslim scholar by the name
of El Biruni [assumed spelling],

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:58.200
who spent most of his
life in Central Asia,

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:04.270
including his native Juarezum,
which you can see on the map there,

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:08.620
gives us important information
about Christian festivals

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:13.290
from the Nestorians, as he
calls them, and the Melkites,

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:16.960
who were the Syriac
speaking Greek Orthodox

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.390
in Juarezum from the year 1000.

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:24.730
I'm going to skip that
one to move to this slide.

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:28.810
Writing in 988, the Muslim
geographer [inaudible],

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:32.480
mentions three Christian sites in
Central Asia, including a monastery

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:38.080
in Sogdia recently excavated near
Urgut, not far from Samarkand.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.280
And there're dozens of
Syriac inscriptions left

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:45.050
on cliffs near the excavated
church building suggesting

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:48.580
that many Christians visited the
vicinity and held this vigil there.

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.950 position:56%
Here you can see a shady scholar of
ill repute attempting to make a name

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:54.170
for himself by reading
these inscriptions.

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:56.270
There's one of the inscriptions,

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:58.220
the name Ab Desho [assumed
spelling] is inscribed

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:00.990
in one of the three caves.

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:05.060
An eighth to ninth century bronze
[inaudible] with local scenes

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:09.240
on it was found near Urgut,
actually, about a century ago.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:13.950
And on the right, you can see
a mold for casting crosses,

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:17.170
metal crosses found nearby.

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:18.500
Amongst the Syriac inscriptions

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.350
and Syriac script is this
beautiful little cross.

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:23.500 position:56%
Next to the word [foreign language],

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.880
Persian word meaning luck,
or fortune, or blessing.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:31.960
Not surprisingly, we have wearable
crosses of gold, silver, bronze,

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:35.280
copper, nephrite, and bone,
dated from the seventh

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.630
to the fourteenth centuries

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:41.280
that have been found
throughout the area of Sogdiana.

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.620
There's abundant evidence
of Christians also

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.210
around the Tarim Basin
in Chinese Central Asia

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.260
from the tenth to eleventh
centuries.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:53.450
This satellite image shows
the vast Taklimakan desert,

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:59.700
which makes up the
center of the Tarim Basin.

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:03.880
This is a site of the -- what would
have been a Christian monastery,

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:08.310
from which come the Turpan
documents, Christian documents.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:14.560
A couple examples there, a salter
in Middle Persian on the left,

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:18.200 position:56%
and a salter in Syriac on the right.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.910
And I've been told
that my time is up.

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:24.780
I'll just end by saying that these
are two other Turpan documents,

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:32.430
on the left, a document in Sogdian
script containing part of a hymn

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:37.090
and a translation into Sogdian of
the Nicene Creed and on the right,

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:41.000
a Syriac salter, which is actually
transcribed or transliterated

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.270 position:56%
into Reeger script because the monks

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:45.860
at that time could no
longer read Syriac,

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.970
but they still needed
to recite the liturgy.

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:53.300 position:56%
More that I would have liked to
shown you, but the time has elapsed,

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.510
and so I will turn it
over to the next speaker.

00:24:55.510 --> 00:25:04.270
[ Applause ]

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:06.830
&gt;&gt; Marius Deeb: Our next
speaker is Professor Professor

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:09.010
Jonathan Loopstra.

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:10.960
He's Associate Professor of
History at the University

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.260
of Northwestern in [inaudible].

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:16.920
He previously taught at the Medical
University of Iraq [inaudible]

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.900
and at The Capital
University in Columbus, Ohio.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.230 position:56%
He researches the literary and
religious culture of the [inaudible]

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:28.710
and late antiquity, with
particular focus on [inaudible]

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:33.930
and their recitation of the Bible
in East Syrian Christianity.

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:36.250
His published works
include the first volume

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:41.860
of an East Syriac Masora,
an East Syrian manuscript

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:50.690
of the Syriac Masora dated 1899,
which was published in 2014/2015.

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:52.510
Professor Loopstra.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:59.360
[ Applause ]

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.810
&gt;&gt; Prof. Jonathan Loopstra:
All right, Thank you again

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:06.000
for the organizers, and for Doctor
Eden for inviting me to give a talk

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.220
on this subject of the
transmission of ancient knowledge.

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.060
When she first invited
me to talk on this,

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.020
I was rather flummoxed actually.

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:17.120
As you'll find, there's a lot of
material here with the transmission

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.040
of ancient knowledge in Syriac.

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.420
She assured me she
wanted an overview,

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.740
and so as I tell my
students in survey classes,

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.530
you're going to get an
overview at 30,000 feet.

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:29.970
But I hope I'll show you some of
the peripheries and directions

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:32.630
of the transmission of
this ancient knowledge.

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:35.830
Reasons why this knowledge is
transmitted in the ancient world.

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:40.050
So, looking to the
region located as a word,

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:42.080
geographically and politically.

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.350
Syriac heritage, Christian
communities have always found

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:49.370
themselves at the crossroads
of cultures, at the periphery

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:52.620
for the transmission of knowledge.

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:55.850
Of course, as you see here,
part of the reason for this was

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:59.640
that Syriacs became communities
were found on both sides

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.590
of the shifting borders
of the ancient world.

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:06.970 position:56%
For our topic today, this means that
it was a fairly easy then, for ideas

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:11.490
and knowledge to pass from one
part of the Syriac speaking world

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:15.750
to the other, across
political and cultural borders.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:21.070
This should also suggest, and I say
this Syriac was a valuable medium

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:23.580
for the transmission
of ancient knowledge.

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:26.360
In part because Syriac,
if you think of it,

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.980
has never been the
official language of empire,

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.710
at least in late antiquity.

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:33.770
Syriac was not associated
with a single empire, say,

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:39.390 position:56%
as Latin was with the Romans, or the
concept of Romanitas, or roman-ness.

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:42.960
This freedom from association
might have allowed for knowledge

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:46.610
in Syriac garb to cross regional

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:50.030
and political boundaries
with relative fluidity.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:53.860
In addition, it might be suggested
that this lack of state support

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:57.960
for the translations into Syriac,
may have also played a role

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.970
in determining which
works were translated

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:03.500
into Syriac, and which were not.

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.510
That is, without state support,
Syriac scribes may have tended

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:09.090
to translate items
that mattered to them,

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:12.400
and not items that
mattered to the authorities.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.880
As my colleague [inaudible]
of the University

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:19.330
of Tokyo has recently suggested,
this might be a helpful model

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:23.290
in understanding why and how Syriac
scribes preserved some ancient

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:24.770
works, but not others.

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:28.020
And the example he gives is
the birth of translations

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:30.930
of geographical material
we find in Syriac.

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:34.420
Possibly because they had not
the need to be able to rule

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:37.840
over long and complex regions.

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.890
So, which do we go first?

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:44.560 position:56%
Let's look at the types of knowledge
that we begin to find in Syriac.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.380
And at first it might
be worth considering,

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:51.020
as I put it here, echoes
of antiquity.

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:54.440
That is, world views,
concepts, genres.

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.410
This Syriac scribes
inherited in part

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:58.540
and parcel of the ancient world.

00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:01.420
If you will, ideas they
breathed in with the air

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:04.440
in the early periods
of Christianity.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.260
So, first, let's look at
one area they inherited

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:09.170
in the ancient Mesopotamian world.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:11.380
And we said quite a
bit about this today.

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:16.880
One example, one fine illustration
of this are so called disputes,

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.890
or dialogue poems many of
you might be familiar with.

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:23.510
If you're not familiar with them,
Sebastian Brock, [assumed spelling]

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:27.240 position:56%
at Oxford, has made a case for their
connection to ancient Mesopotamia.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.750
His 1979 article, with
the terrific title,

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:32.860
called "From Sumer to Syriac."

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:34.440
You might remember this.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:38.900
We have over 50 of these,
again, quite often, fun poems,

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:41.020
dialogue poems which survived.

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:44.020
Often they put different figures.

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:48.280
Two antagonists, the Tigres
and Euphrates River, or say,

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:53.860
death and Hades against each other
in this fascinating type of genre.

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:57.800
This genre is continually
used, even in [inaudible]

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.440
as some of you might know today.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.060
Another echo, if you will,

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:06.460
of ancient knowledge I might
consider are Jewish elements

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:08.800
of cultural interpretation.

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.540
And this is not surprising,
because as we know,

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:13.030
early Christians were surrounded

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:15.930
by ancient Jewish communities
throughout this region.

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:20.790
In fact, second century translation
of the Bible from Hebrew,

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:24.070
known as the Peshitta,
incorporates for some early books,

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:26.610
elements of this Jewish
interpretation.

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:28.440
And as many of you might also know,

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:32.160
our earliest Syriac
Christian interpreters,

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.820
such as the East Syrian
[inaudible], or [inaudible],

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.630
or Ephram of [inaudible]
also incorporates elements

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:42.610
of Jewish [inaudible]
and interpretation.

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:46.660
Thirdly, another echo of antiquity,
it might be worth remembering,

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:50.370 position:56%
is that Syriac speakers were heirs
to the age-old traditions of writing

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:52.520
and speaking the language
of Aramaic,

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.910
as often been mentioned here.

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:58.090
We should keep in mind then,
that by the time the dialect

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:02.970
of Syriac emerged as a written
language, Aramaic had been in use

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:04.390
for well over a millennium.

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:08.900
And this is significant for
what we're talking about today

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:12.960
because in some ways this
antiquity of Syriac is different

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.480
than when compared to
other Christian languages

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.780
of the near east.

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:19.890
So, for example, in Armenia and
Georgia and to a certain extent,

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:21.190
[inaudible], the development

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:24.450
of written language is closely
associated with the arrival

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:27.100
of Christianity and
Christianization.

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:29.930
Syriac speakers on the other
hand, inherited a language

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:34.370
and linguistic traditions that
crossed regional boundaries

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:35.670
and have been translating --

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:38.580
already transmitting knowledge
for well over a millennium.

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:39.880
So, it's a unique difference.

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.180
And they knew this.

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:46.070
Just some examples -- Syriac
is first called [inaudible],

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:49.480
because it originally, we believe
[inaudible] in the regions,

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:54.520
and this is just a little example
of graffiti I shot a few years ago

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.030
when I visited this
town in southern Turkey.

00:31:57.030 --> 00:31:59.450
And if you look up on
top of this pillar,

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:01.160
some of you might know
it from the town.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:04.910
A pillar that overlooks the
city you'll find [inaudible].

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:10.250
You also find some very
famous old mosaics.

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:12.350
So, for example, here,
you find Syriac,

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:17.580
or a derivative upon this mosaic
of Orpheus, again, in Greco Roman.

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:21.630
If you look below, you have
another mosaic in Persian garb.

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:24.690
So, you have again,
at the cross roads

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:26.540
of ancient cultures
and civilization.

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:29.560
It should also be mentioned
along the same lines

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:32.190
that Syriac preserves
some of the classics

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:34.250
of ancient Aramaic heritage.

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:37.770
Most notable, for example,
part of the story of Ahikar,

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:41.580
the Assyrian sage, which is
preserved in Syriac translations

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:43.760
in five different recensions.

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.490
And we could also mention
other legends, folk legends,

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:49.100
Alexander legends and
[inaudible] others.

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:52.640
And it should be mentioned on
these slides that The Church

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:55.000
of the East specifically,
this Persian

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.950 position:56%
or Eastern influence is particularly
important because we spend a lot

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:01.400
of time talking about it because
it means that they evolved

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:06.250
in an Iranian context and this
affects parts of liturgy and parts

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:10.010
of interpretation in the early
days as opposed to what happened

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:14.020
in the west Syrian
communities as well.

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:16.460
Other areas of knowledge
preservation --

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:20.060 position:56%
it should also be mentioned that
Syriac Christians helped to preserve

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.530
and record the histories
and traditions

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:25.230
of neighboring Christian
communities.

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:30.770
So, for example, we have Byzantine
transmission, we have Armenian,

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:34.180
[inaudible] communities and even
[inaudible] Indian communities,

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:37.220
as Mark pointed out,
that are transmitted.

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.880
And without these Syriac sources,
we would often be the poorer

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.980
for our knowledge of
neighboring communities.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:46.250
Much of this has to do
with the work of Syriac

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:48.470
and East Syrian historians.

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:54.440
And if we have more time, we could
talk at length about the importance

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:58.550
of these types of chronicles and
world histories in the transmission

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:02.180 position:56%
of knowledge, say, the coming of the
Mongols, as Mark was talking about.

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:06.610
Or even the arrival of
the Islamic movement.

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:11.080
For example, the chronicle
of [inaudible] you see here,

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.170
a late chronicle, eleventh century.

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:14.470
Fascinating.

00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:16.110
This is actually universal
chronicle.

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:18.610
When you look at the manuscript
in the British Library,

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:21.860 position:56%
you'll find that it actually
contains something akin to footnotes

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:25.600
to over 60 sources, only
30 of those, I believe,

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:30.090
that we still have -- that
we still know what they are.

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:32.970
So, again, these are
records of early traditions.

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:38.270
But, if you think about it, what
we've talked about so far means

00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:42.630
that the Syriac community was
heir to ancient Aramaic traditions

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:46.620
of the east, then the majority
though, of Syriac translations

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:51.410 position:56%
from ancient works are actually from
Greek, not from other languages.

00:34:51.410 --> 00:34:53.120
And why is this?

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:56.290
And there's a number of reasons
for this, but let mention two.

00:34:56.290 --> 00:35:01.030 position:56%
For one thing, as Christians, Syriac
transfers naturally wanted access

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:04.740
to many of the Christian writings
in the Western Greek world.

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:08.370
Then, a quite different perspective
than the situation in the east,

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:11.990
where there are fewer Christian
works written in Persian.

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:14.310
Secondly, y the fifth century,

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:18.170
Greek was considered a high-status
language of the elite, that is,

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:21.950
a high profile of Greek learning,
combined with the movement

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:25.980
of Christians to the non-Greek
speaking areas, eventually led them

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:31.090
to begin translating Greek -- even
secular Greek material into Syriac.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:34.540
So, as early as the fifth century
we have non-Christian Greek works

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:37.850
beginning to be translated using
their ethical works, collections,

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:41.940
the same literature,
[inaudible], geographic names,

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:46.570
even "Aesop's Fables", sixth
century BC, which is preserved

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:48.390
in three Syriac manuscripts.

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:52.480
And one of these actually claims
sixty-four of these sayings.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:56.930 position:56%
So, we have a spread of these
non-Christian works being translated

00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:58.750
by the fifth century.

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:00.120
And should be noted
that although many

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.240
of these works are
being translated first

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.250
in Byzantium territories,
it quickly moved east.

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:08.480
And some have made the point that
this was aided by the movement

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:13.980
of east Syrians after the counts
of [inaudible] and closing

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:18.600
of the school of [inaudible] in
the fifth century towards the east.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:23.330
And we often know that Persian
rulers, and officials welcomed many

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:26.230
of these scholars and
translators to the east.

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:29.520
One of the key figures in this
movement was a west Syrian

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.360
by the name of Sergius [inaudible].

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:36.650
Again, located in North Syria,
we're later told by [inaudible]

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:43.330
that he translated over 30 works
of Galen, the ancient Greek writer.

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:47.450
And in fact, we're told that he
used text books that were prevalent

00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:50.420
in the medical school of
Alexandria at the time.

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:54.180
Some of his translations of
Galen are actually addressed

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:57.170
to a certain [inaudible],
and again there's divisions

00:36:57.170 --> 00:37:00.530 position:56%
in the scholarly community about
who this is, but it's been suggested

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:04.200
that he was bishop on the
Diyala River, if you know that,

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:07.740
it's near the border between
modern day Iraq and Iran.

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:11.490
So, if this is true, we already
know that even in this early stage,

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:17.480
we have the movement of Galen
into the east by sixth century.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:21.000
One fascinating example of
this, again, we could talk more

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.060
at length later on
if you're interested.

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:27.990 position:56%
This is a newer finding, this is the
[inaudible], which means the text

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:33.240
that you see here on my right,
is actually super imposed

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:36.130
over the earlier texts and erased.

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:41.040 position:56%
And the text on the right are hymns,
later hymns, but if you notice

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:46.790
on my left, you'll find that when
they applied ultra violet light

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:50.150
to this manuscript, they discovered
underneath, low and behold, what?

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:55.260
An early fifth century translation
of Galen's pharmacological work,

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:57.580
"Mixtures and Powers
of Simple Drugs."

00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:59.300
Again, we could talk
at length about this.

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.750
There's an article on this.

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:02.260
But why is this important?

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:07.510
A, it's important because this
Syriac text underneath predates any

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:09.490
existing Greek texts.

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:14.560
Second, it also shows how
later east Syrian translators

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:19.310
like [inaudible] may have used
Sergius's earlier translation

00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:23.610
together with other Greek works
in order to translate into Arabic.

00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:26.490
Again, some fascinating
things going on with this.

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:29.980
Where did these types of
early medical texts go?

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:34.150
Briefly, they went to many
of the east Syrian schools.

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:36.380
One of the most famous
for the reception

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:41.730
of medical works was [inaudible]
in the east, as you see here.

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:46.260
This becomes well, very
famous for a medical school

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:49.400
that develops particularly
under the Abbasid era.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:53.350
But we're also given clues
that [inaudible] the first,

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:57.370
encouraged these refugees from
the west to translate Greek

00:38:57.370 --> 00:39:00.710
and Syriac text to the
[inaudible] in this early period.

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:05.850
We also have indications that in
this school that developed here,

00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:10.750
we have texts coming from
India, possibly China, right?

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:12.640
To come in and be translated.

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:16.250
One of the examples of this in the
seventh century is the India tale

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:18.920
of Khalela Wudemna, [assumed
spelling] which makes its way

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:21.840
into [inaudible], and
then eventually

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.990
into Syriac and other forms.

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:27.820
So, again, a fascinating movement.

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:29.780
Moving on, we have
other Greek works,

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:32.300
obviously besides medical works
that are being translated,

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.810
particularly in philosophy
and logic.

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:38.030
Here again, Sergius of
[inaudible] is an important figure

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:39.400
in this movement.

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.950
But we also should mention we
have East Syrian figures, such as,

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:47.500
the [inaudible] Mar Abba and
also, a certain Paul the Persian,

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:52.220
who were writing commentaries
on Aristotle's Organon as well.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:54.640
And so, you see, for
example, Paul the Persian,

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:57.020
we believe that his earliest
text is written actually

00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.910
in Middle Persian, not Syriac.

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:00.470
He's a very interesting figure.

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:02.730
We don't know a lot about him.

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:06.120
But all the same, we have a
lot of different commentaries.

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:11.150
If you look on this chart
of the -- of Aristotle in --

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:14.630
the first part of Aristotle's
work in Syria.

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:16.280
Why is this?

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.780
And there's a number of
different ideas that are floating

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:22.370
around about why Syriac
writers were fascinated

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:25.060
by these early logical texts.

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:29.960
Past scholars have argued,
and it's just the assumption,

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.130
that a primary motivation
for the translation

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:35.490
of these Greek logical works, was,
as one scholar [inaudible] wrote,

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:39.530
"weapons for the theological
dialectics."

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:42.070
And yes, in other words, in
this here Aristotle was put

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:43.370
into a service

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:45.970
of the inter-confessional
debates of the Christology.

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:47.580
That's one view.

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:51.490
More recently than King [inaudible]
has questioned this assumption

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:54.400
that Greek learning
was initially used

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.730
for polemical confessional uses.

00:40:56.730 --> 00:40:59.520
As King argues, evidence
instead, tends to suggest

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.820
that the pre-Islamic use

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:03.780
of philosophy was more
pedagogically oriented

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:05.870
in schools and other settings.

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:09.520
Interesting example of this is
actually from a west Syrian,

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:12.910
Severus Sebokht, another
translator who explains in one

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:15.090 position:56%
of his works, why he is translating.

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:16.520
And this is worth quoting in full.

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:19.790
He says this, it's
kind of arguments,

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:22.130
"The Babylonians were the
first inventors of knowledge

00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:24.800
and not the Greeks,
as all the writings

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.860
of the Greeks themselves testify,
and after the Babylonians,

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.260
came the Egyptians,
and then the Greeks.

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:34.160
I do not think that
anyone will dispute

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:38.300
that the Babylonians
were the Syrians.

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:40.570
Those who say that the
Syrians can know nothing

00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:42.310
at all are in great error.

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:45.220
Seeing then, that the Syrians
were the first inventors

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:47.450
and teachers of these things."

00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:51.460 position:56%
So, Severus then, the right to steal
from the Greeks, has less to do

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:55.300
with his defense of a particular
Christology, and more to do

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:58.440
with his right as one of
Syriac heritage, to preserve

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:02.370
and retain knowledge that was
built upon his own ancient roots.

00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:06.780
So, it should be mentioned as
well, that many of these works went

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:09.550
to the East Syrian schools.

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:12.000
And I want to mention
another school in particular,

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.780
known more to the north,
The School of Nisibis,

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:18.590
in which we have records
of [inaudible] logic.

00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:22.910
Just show you briefly, this
[inaudible], still on the border,

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:25.320 position:56%
this picture I took a few years ago.

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:28.390
Still on the border between
Turkey and Syria even today

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:31.740
as it was Roman Persian
ancient world.

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:36.030
And if you look here, where at
the ancient Church of [inaudible],

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:38.160
and if you look, my
colleagues there are looking

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:40.910
at the lentil of the church.

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:46.130 position:56%
And even here, on the lentil, you'll
see, we have Syriac on one side,

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:48.620
and what do we have further on?

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:50.670
Again, Greek writing on the other.

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:52.890
So, again, this is a cross-ways

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:55.750
of cultural languages
throughout this region.

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:59.130
It is studied at the
School of Nisibis,

00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:00.730
and Adam Becker [assumed
spelling] has argued

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:07.000
that a mere platonic Aristotle
was in his words, "retro-fitted"

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.020
to older pre-existing and
Syriac intellectual frameworks.

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:14.060
This is a pretty bad
illustration, but I was thinking

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:17.310
about this the other day when
I was painting my basement.

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:22.210
In this case, the Greek Aristotle
will be the final paint layer

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:23.510
to beautify.

00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:25.150
You put over the solid primer

00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:27.550
of this Syriac tradition
of Ephram and others.

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:29.680
This is a bad illustration, I know.

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:34.930
A better illustration might be,
again, that this can be found

00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:37.330
in the system of logical
reading marks we find

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:39.580
in the Syriac Bible
-- East Syriac Bible.

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:42.580
And this is also very
important because it develops

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:44.030
into Lexicographer studies,

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:46.110
which goes to impact
other language tradition.

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:48.830
Let me give you an example.

00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:52.330
These reading dots you see here
on the Syriac Bible were used

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:56.350 position:56%
for punctuation, [inaudible]
intonation, and meanings and stress.

00:43:56.350 --> 00:44:00.120 position:56%
And scholars still debate whether
some of these marks first originated

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:02.860
with earlier Greek models, or based

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:07.040
on an ancient Aramaic
heritage of notation.

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.090
But we believe that Joseph
Hoziah [assumed spelling],

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:13.150
an East Syriac [inaudible] and
teacher of reading in Nisibis,

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:17.910
appears to have taken the basics
of this borrowed earlier tradition

00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:22.490
and put it into a form adding
Greek notation as well.

00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:26.990
So, for example, in many of these
reading marks, we find species

00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:31.460
of discourse, also found
in [inaudible] commentaries

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:35.140
on the enunciate sentence
derived from Aristotle.

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:37.940
So, in other words, what Joseph was
doing in the sixth century here,

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:42.640
was revising his sixth century
Syriac notation in part,

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:45.300
on Aristotelian terminology.

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:47.090
Let me give you an example of this.

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:51.090
This is Galatians 4:23-30, from one

00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:55.350 position:56%
of our earliest Syriac New Testament
manuscripts in the British Library.

00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:57.990
We can see here, many of
these dotted reading marks.

00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:01.050
For example, here, [inaudible]
that connects to clauses.

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:02.350
By the way, none of these are

00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:05.730
in published editions
of the Assyrian Bible.

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:10.240
You see here [foreign
language] mark an exclamation.

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.990
And also, then, you see here what?

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:14.800
This other mark.

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:17.700
The [foreign language],
which is actually the marker

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:20.210
of the [inaudible] sentence.

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:24.240
And when you look at how the
Persians introductional logic,

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:29.520
is commentary on Aristotle, we find
that this is the exact term used

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:35.190
in his commentary for
Aristotle's logical dialectic.

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:39.380
So, again, we find [inaudible]
being brought into use,

00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:43.120
even in the reading traditions
combined with ancient Aramaic

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:49.600
or Greek traditions of doxology or
recitation of the scriptural text.

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:53.550 position:56%
We look at other earlier East Syrian
manuscripts, we find the same thing.

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:57.680
So, for example, here,
Morgan Library in New York,

00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:01.100
regular has the [inaudible] --
remember this is the same word used

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:07.460
for the Aristotelian texts, and
again, we have similar dots used

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:09.520
for the recitation of the Bible.

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:10.820
Again, so, what does this mean?

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:13.460
It means that we have,
again, these reading dots

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:16.720
in the Syriac Bible itself,
they're brought forward

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:19.680
with the native Aramaic
influences, modified slightly

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:22.870
by the introduction of
Greek philosophical concepts

00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:25.510
to form this hybrid system.

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:30.300
And many scholars believe this
system of dots was later adopted

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:35.010
by Sogdians, but also by
Hebrews and also possibly

00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:37.970
by Arabic linguists as well.

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:42.200
So, this leads us to
the Islamic era.

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.810
Right? So, the Islamic
era, this is where we begin

00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:47.490
to see the appropriation
of Greek philosophy

00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:49.490
into professional debates.

00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:53.260
And this also leads us, with
as Mark said, [inaudible],

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:55.820
Timothy the first,
and in his letters,

00:46:55.820 --> 00:47:00.530
this is where we find the
beginnings of the understanding

00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:05.510
of the Greco-Arabic translation
movement, which eventually,

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:10.140
you know, will result in the
translation of hundreds of works

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:12.980
of Greek literature into Arabic

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:16.770
through many times the
medium of Syriac as well.

00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:19.080
And Timothy himself
attests to the prevalence

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.710
of Greek literature in his world.

00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:24.260 position:56%
So for example, in his letter to
the students in Mosul, at one point,

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:27.610
he writes, "The Syriacs have
become inheritors of logic

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:32.210
and of orthodox teaching," that
is logic, Aristotelian logic,

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:35.290
many of the works which he
lays out in his letters,

00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:38.510
but also orthodox teaching,
by which he means the writings

00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:42.690
of the Greeks are brought
into it in Arabic.

00:47:42.690 --> 00:47:45.560
Lastly, we leave you
with Hunayn ibn Ishaq,

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:48.680
the far end of this
translation movement.

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:52.290
So in his works, again,
over 100 different works

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:55.290
that translate the
knowledge of the Greeks

00:47:55.290 --> 00:48:00.940
into Arabic using earlier
sources such as [inaudible],

00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:05.250
and eventually his own
works will be published

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:08.850
in the libraries of the West.

00:48:08.850 --> 00:48:14.150
So this brings us full circle then
back to Greece and back to Europe

00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:18.460
where Hunayn ibn Ishaq becomes
an acknowledged medical authority

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:19.760
and doctor in his own right.

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:21.560
Thank you very much.

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:33.040

&gt;&gt; Marius Deeb: Our next speaker is
Tala Jarjour, is Assistant Professor

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:40.550
in the Department of
Music Anthropology

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:42.390
at the University of Notre Dame.

00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:47.550 position:56%
She spent academic year 2015-2016
at ale University as a Senior Fellow

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:51.090
at the Institute of Sacred Music
and Visiting Assistant Professor

00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:54.570
in the Music Department
in the Spring of 2016.

00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:56.670
Her forthcoming book
is under contract

00:48:56.670 --> 00:49:00.340
with Oxford University
Press with the working title

00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:03.730
"Chanting Blessed Edessa,
Syriac Spirituality

00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:06.730
and the Economy of
Musical Aesthetics".

00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:15.120
She will be a speaker at the Gates
Cambridge Biannual 2016 Event

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:18.170
on a panel titled "Heritage
in Peril".

00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:22.430
Now the two speakers -- the first
speaker talked about the church

00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:30.570
of the East and the -- and
along the Silk Road Network,

00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:32.460
and the second church of the East

00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:34.880
and transmission of
ancient knowledge.

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:38.350
Now it culminates the third
speaker with Syriac chant

00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:43.510
as a cultural heritage, rightly so.

00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:45.310
Please?

00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:50.400
[ Applause ]

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.740
&gt;&gt; Mrs. Tala Jarjour: Thank you
very much for the introduction.

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:55.170
It's -- and for the
invitation to be here.

00:49:55.170 --> 00:49:57.490
It really is a great pleasure.

00:49:57.490 --> 00:50:01.290
Yes, indeed, my talk will
just fast forward in history

00:50:01.290 --> 00:50:09.180
to the current time and to
current concerns about the future.

00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:12.160
So we're moving forward
very quickly in time.

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.940
I'm just going to take a
second to set things up here

00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:17.500
so that I can put my computer --

00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:23.400
if this can move backwards
just -- oh, that's great.

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.700
Thank you.

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:33.340
Lovely.

00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:41.930
Yeah, that's good.

00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:44.230
Thank you very much.

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:50.280
Great. So I should also
apologize because we were supposed

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:56.380
to have somebody who would
give a chanting presentation

00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:59.500
or a demonstration, but he was
unfortunately not able to come,

00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:03.130
and I was informed of
that just as I arrived.

00:51:03.130 --> 00:51:07.160
So I'm not going to sing, but
hopefully if there is time,

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:10.360
I will play an excerpt
at the very end.

00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:12.520
I'd be happy to do so.

00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:15.620
So what I would be doing today
is talking about Syriac chant

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:21.030
as cultural heritage from
the perspective of projects

00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:23.040
of collection and preservation.

00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:26.570
So there's a lot of concern
about the living communities,

00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:30.370
and I should also give a very
brief caveat about the fact

00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:34.820
that my specialty is Western Syriac
chant, so Syrian Orthodox chant.

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:37.920
But I'm hoping that my talk today
will be rather comprehensive.

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:42.770
So thus far, the typical way in
which Syriac chant has been treated

00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:45.710
as cultural heritage has
been through a small number

00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:49.590
of recording collections, most
of which belong to some form

00:51:49.590 --> 00:51:53.640
of archival preservatory
[sic] undertaking or another.

00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:57.990 position:56%
In this context, the concept of
archive appears and is rather strong

00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:59.580
and is more overarching

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:02.640
than it might be considered
in particular projects.

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:07.330 position:56%
As such, I use it today in a general
sense in reference to existing forms

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:11.660
of Syriac chant, collection,
and preservation.

00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:14.340
The concept of archive is
an independent discussion

00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:17.520
in its own right, which I
will not have the chance

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:19.650
to fully address today.

00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:23.490
What I -- what I do hope to
do, however, is pose questions.

00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:27.820
I will not provide answers
simply because I don't have them.

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:31.380
But those are important questions
to state because my rationale

00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:35.450
in thinking about cultural heritage
problematizes issues of meaning

00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:39.690
and value, especially in relation
to the people whose heritage is

00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:43.740
at stake and more specifically
to their pain.

00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:45.790
I want to think about
creating collections

00:52:45.790 --> 00:52:50.210
of a musical cultural heritage as
an undertaking that takes place

00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:56.170
in conjunction with and
because of the pain of others.

00:52:56.170 --> 00:53:00.040
So allow me to put forward
a number of questions

00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:03.190
that information my interrogative
thoughts on the matter.

00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:07.180
Those title-type statements,
as I said, will not be unpacked

00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:09.170
in this -- in the next few minutes.

00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:11.610
The issues they entail
are far too many,

00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:16.230
but the following discussion
makes more sense in light of them.

00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:20.230
The purpose of a music
collection or archive,

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:23.960
the reasons behind the
existence of an archive,

00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:28.350
the politics of building an
archive, the ethics of election,

00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:32.240
the politics of inclusion and
exclusion, the significance

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:38.270
of what is cast aside, why, by
whom, and how, the aesthetics

00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:45.990
of preference, the economies of
choice, and the list goes on.

00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:47.880
Take Walter Benjamin, for instance,

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:50.700
who created his own
personal archive.

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:52.750
According to him, the action

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:58.420 position:56%
of archiving involves keen awareness
of, quote, strategic calculation

00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:00.800
and ethos of an archivist,

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:04.950
both of which comprise
intentional components

00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:08.260
of a constructed posterity.

00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:11.730
On another note that happens
to come from Germany --

00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:14.040
we are talking about
archives, after all --

00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:17.790
archives are historical --
are a historical matter.

00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:21.490 position:56%
The creation of archives, such as
those of East Germany, for instance,

00:54:21.490 --> 00:54:23.940
have a bearing on the development

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:27.210
of Eastern German cultural
history and scholarship.

00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:30.420
Not only are the material
of such archives reflections

00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:34.210
of the directions in which
this scholarship progresses.

00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:37.830
They are part and parcel of the
construction of official histories

00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:41.490
as well as the contemporary
understanding of complex issues

00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:46.170
of the past, namely the
construction of the past.

00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:47.580
But I digress.

00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:50.310
Let me return to Syriac chant.

00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:53.390
From a wide perspective,
my paper is concerned

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:55.740
with theorizing the
operation and context

00:54:55.740 --> 00:55:00.390
in which Syriac chant has been
and is being documented, archived,

00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:05.140
and as many would have
it, preserved.

00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:07.430
The trend of safeguarding
the musical traditions

00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:10.610
of Eastern Christianity
in general is not new.

00:55:10.610 --> 00:55:13.660
Indeed, examples of it date back
to the earliest written accounts

00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:16.020
on the subject, but
the sense of need

00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:18.540
for safeguarding has
gained increasing urgency

00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:22.700
in recent decades, more so in
the recent handful of years,

00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:24.760
owing to the number
of recent conflicts

00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:26.300
that have struck the Middle East,

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:31.640
leaving a particularly detrimental
effect on its Christians.

00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:35.690
While I will not be -- while I will
not be putting particular emphasis

00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:37.230
on Syriac chant -- I'm sorry --

00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:40.810
while I will be putting particular
emphasis on Syriac chant,

00:55:40.810 --> 00:55:43.730
my proposition applies to
Eastern Christian traditions

00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:46.780
in general and possibly more.

00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:51.540 position:56%
Over the last 200 years or so, since
the first European written account

00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:55.130
of this ancient Aramaic oral
tradition was published using music

00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:57.840
transcriptions, many in
account have attempted

00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:01.040
to capture its musical
sounds and norms.

00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:03.860
Some accounts pursued
systematic analysis,

00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:07.190
systematic as in systematic
musicology, for the purpose

00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:10.100
of which they created
hundreds of transcriptions.

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:11.460
Examples are Husman
[assumed spelling]

00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:14.720
and Jannan [assumed spelling],
while others deposited samples

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:17.570
of Syriac chant in sound
archive collections

00:56:17.570 --> 00:56:20.720 position:56%
such as the Berlin Phonogramm-Archiv

00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:22.020
and the Museo du Lome
[assumed spelling].

00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:27.530
Whether with the explicit purpose
of creating an archive or not,

00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:31.570
and this would apply to Eastern
Christian music as it would to any,

00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:35.770
documenting or conserving a musical
tradition is a process involving a

00:56:35.770 --> 00:56:37.560
number of tasks.

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:40.310
One of these tasks is selection.

00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:44.000 position:56%
Since it would be difficult to
include every piece and/or variation

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.050
of a piece in a given collection,

00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:50.300
no matter how representative a
sample may be, it remains a sample

00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:52.280
that is created by a process

00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:56.000
of selection involving
election and elimination.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.690
Choices such as what
goes in and what stays

00:56:58.690 --> 00:57:01.650
out of any collection
may be informed

00:57:01.650 --> 00:57:03.750
by a varying number of factors.

00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:06.620
Those factors range from
the availability of material

00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:10.500
to the accessibility of sources,
the ability or willingness

00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:14.970
of source guardians, the
collector's technical agility

00:57:14.970 --> 00:57:18.820
and available technological
capacity, personal

00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:22.070
and collective taste,
philosophical approach,

00:57:22.070 --> 00:57:25.950
ideas held to be important,
aesthetic considerations,

00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:32.270 position:56%
and the relative value of a selected
material, to name only a few.

00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:36.250
One level of these decisions may
be made by the tradition bearers,

00:57:36.250 --> 00:57:39.820
in the case of a -- of say a
vernacular musical tradition,

00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:43.910
or by such source owners as
book or manuscript collectors,

00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:48.280
both of which I implied
earlier under source guardians.

00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:52.200 position:56%
Another level of the decisive
selection process is the prerogative

00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:55.800
of the collective --
collection builder.

00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:59.040
Thus, one might imagine a
given musical collection

00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:03.690
as a construction, constituted of
various elements which an architect

00:58:03.690 --> 00:58:08.390 position:56%
of sorts, the collector, selects and
puts together to form this thing he

00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:10.510
or she will call a collection.

00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:15.230
This process in create -- involves
a creative or a curatorial level

00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:20.150
of decision making, which is
essentially a work of design.

00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:22.640
So two main components
of the process

00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:26.020
of creating collections
are selection and design.

00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:28.910
Put together, selection and
design constitutes a process

00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:30.930
of representation.

00:58:30.930 --> 00:58:34.690
Now what I am concerned with today
is the point at which memory,

00:58:34.690 --> 00:58:39.650 position:56%
history, and experience interact
with the individual, the collective,

00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:42.860
the process of collection, and
the collection as end product.

00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:46.360 position:56%
I look at this point in Syriac chant

00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:50.090
through one particular
perspective, that of pain.

00:58:50.090 --> 00:58:54.190
I want to ask questions pertaining
to conceptions of the authority

00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:57.770
of representing musical
traditions, which fall now

00:58:57.770 --> 00:59:02.380
in a severely endangered
cultural category.

00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:06.150
Those cultural categories are
endangered because their bearers,

00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:08.530
the Christians of the Middle
East, are facing dangers

00:59:08.530 --> 00:59:10.870
to their existence as such.

00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:15.260
At the risk of redundancy, I point
out that inherent to this state

00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:20.210
of endangerment is a human
state of being, namely pain.

00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:24.470
Put simply but not simplistically,
thinking about the authority

00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:27.850
of representing cultural
heritage involves such questions

00:59:27.850 --> 00:59:34.110
as who represents whom,
what, why, how, where,

00:59:34.110 --> 00:59:36.400
by which means, and to what ends?

00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:39.510
I shall hope to touch on
some of these questions

00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:42.800 position:56%
in the remaining minutes by offering
brief comments from philosophical

00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:46.560
and archaeo -- and anthropological
works that have discussed issues

00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:51.470
of archives, agency, and pain,
the three essential elements

00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:54.170
to my discussion of the
authority of representation.

00:59:54.170 --> 00:59:57.750
My aim is to contribute
to our thinking

00:59:57.750 --> 01:00:02.470 position:56%
about cultural representation, which
employs multifaceted perspectives

01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:06.290
and does not shun the complexity
of the contexts from which

01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:13.010 position:56%
such projects extract the music, but
embrace it with aware sensibility,

01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:16.140
or should I say sensitivity.

01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:18.690
Let me turn next to the
what, the collection.

01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:22.320
In this time and age of
digital media and ease

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:25.110
of information dissemination,
the creation of collections,

01:00:25.110 --> 01:00:29.150
a task which once required
efforts on institutional

01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:33.500
and even national levels, is now
fully feasible with modest means,

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:38.720
namely basic computing material
and a decent amount of dedication.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.410
Take the case of Syriac chant,

01:00:40.410 --> 01:00:43.860 position:56%
which to my knowledge no single
library has yet attempted to compile

01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:46.500
in any comprehensive sense.

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:50.010
With a simple Internet search,
one can find a staggering number

01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:53.660
of websites offering diverse
choices of chant samples

01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:55.070
in a variety of categories.

01:00:55.070 --> 01:01:00.090
Looking at them, one is struck by
the so-called democratic character

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:03.790
of the process of collecting
this ancient Aramaic tradition.

01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:08.320
Most websites -- most websites
containing collections are created

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:11.920
by individuals from their
private collections.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:15.830
However, by going just a little
under the surface, one would notice

01:01:15.830 --> 01:01:18.610
that most of these acts
of collecting, ordering,

01:01:18.610 --> 01:01:22.870 position:56%
and dissemination create an
archive or sorts, and in many cases,

01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:26.760
the individual websites actually
state the explicit purpose

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:29.490
of creating an archive.

01:01:29.490 --> 01:01:32.300
So here are some thoughts
from philosophy,

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:35.350
specifically from Derrida's
discussion on archive

01:01:35.350 --> 01:01:37.160
and implication --
and the implication --

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:40.880
and its implication on authority.

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:44.030
By the way, Derrida's relevance
to the issue of archive, pain,

01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:47.110
intimacy, and contestation
of ownership rights

01:01:47.110 --> 01:01:49.930 position:56%
and authority is a worthwhile matter

01:01:49.930 --> 01:01:53.740
that I will also not
be able to get into.

01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:56.180
In the opening of his
book "Archive Fever",

01:01:56.180 --> 01:02:00.990
"Mal d'Archive" Secretary
Derrida writes, "Let us not begin

01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:03.300
at the beginning, nor
even at the archive,

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:08.090
but rather at the word archive,
archive, and with the archive

01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:10.770
of so familiar a word," end quote.

01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:14.170
He then reminds his reader
that archei, the Greek word,

01:02:14.170 --> 01:02:17.600
names at once the,
quote, commencement

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:21.050
and the commandment, end quote.

01:02:21.050 --> 01:02:26.530 position:56%
This name coordinates two principles
in one, the principle according

01:02:26.530 --> 01:02:31.190
to nature or history, there
where things commence, physical,

01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:34.900
historical, or archaeological
principle,

01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:39.570
but also the principle according
to the law, there where men

01:02:39.570 --> 01:02:43.380
and gods command, there
where authority,

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:46.670
social order are exercised.

01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:53.970
In this place from which order
is given nomological principle.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:00.210 position:56%
So the idea of creating a collection
necessarily implies a claim

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:04.720
to authority, which brings
us to the question who.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.500
The differences between a number of
the Syriani community -- between --

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:12.490 position:56%
sorry -- a member of the Syriani
community creating an online archive

01:03:12.490 --> 01:03:16.130
of their church songs and a Western
academic institution creating an

01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:18.270
archive of the chant of
the Syriac speaking church,

01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:20.900
for instance, is worth noting.

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:24.380
The full question in this case
is not only who is collecting,

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:27.320
but also whose music
are they collecting?

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:31.300
I will not go into post-colonial
issues, such as orientalism,

01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:33.520
but I will suffice
the current discussion

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:36.900
with mentioning them
passingly, as I just did.

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:39.540
What I would like to
dwell on is the ethical,

01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:43.830
or to complicate things a bit more,
the premise of authority inherent

01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:48.400
to the process of representing
the pain of others.

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.990
To anchor my discussion
in relevant scholarship,

01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:53.810
I refer to anthropologist
and theorist Talal Asad,

01:03:53.810 --> 01:03:56.740
particularly his work
on agency and suffering.

01:03:56.740 --> 01:04:01.370
In this article, Asad puts the
term "agency" under a new set

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:05.740 position:56%
of analytical tests commonly used to
express the assumption by the weak,

01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:10.430
the victim of a voice,
or an ability --

01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:14.940
or of an ability of some active
resistance or mere resilience.

01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:19.440 position:56%
The term agency has been confined to
-- by anthropologists, Asad notes,

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:22.670
to assume self-empowerment
and responsibility

01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:26.700
in giving agency a
triumphalist vision of history.

01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:30.550
He criticizes this view and
says that rather than consider

01:04:30.550 --> 01:04:34.650
that seeing agency within
individuals or groups who have been

01:04:34.650 --> 01:04:39.210 position:56%
on the receiving end of injustice,
disempowerment, or most importantly,

01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:42.590
pain and suffering, as a
form of self-fulfillment,

01:04:42.590 --> 01:04:45.850
triumphalism of liberated
individuals.

01:04:45.850 --> 01:04:50.760
Agency can include creative forms
of existing through pain and,

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:58.590
as he puts it, ways to live sanely
in a state of inevitable suffering.

01:04:58.590 --> 01:05:03.740
Agency in this sense is
not only not triumphalist.

01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:07.010 position:56%
It is also not passive or defeatist.

01:05:07.010 --> 01:05:10.600
It is the way in which such
groups as the impoverished Shia

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:13.910
of Southern Lebanon command a
spirituality that embraces pain

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:18.230
through rituals based in mourning
and self-flagellation practices,

01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:22.420
but also through forms of emotional
and social solidarity essential

01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:26.160
to which is their combined
view of faith, suffering,

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:28.570
and active collective
forms of support.

01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:33.350
In a similar vein, he sees
the emotional and moral affect

01:05:33.350 --> 01:05:38.940
of cassette sermons in Cairo's
massive Muslim conscience

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:42.490
as the basis for a moral
construction of collective agency

01:05:42.490 --> 01:05:45.470
in which suffering and
spirituality are part and parcel

01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:49.370
of a pious ethical
form of existence.

01:05:49.370 --> 01:05:52.980
Through such examples as the two
studies of Shia forms of piety

01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:55.590
in Southern Lebanon and
the Islamic Counterpublics

01:05:55.590 --> 01:05:57.590
of urban Cairo I just mentioned,

01:05:57.590 --> 01:06:01.860
as it offers an interdisciplinary
analysis of a number of accounts

01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:06.530
from mythology, literature,
ethnography, and religion,

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:08.710
shedding light on agency in history

01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:12.890
as collective memories
of various local pasts.

01:06:12.890 --> 01:06:16.110
In these states of existence and
collective creation of memories

01:06:16.110 --> 01:06:20.200
and religious experience,
pain, representation, religion,

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:24.630
and the sense of the
collective feature prominently.

01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:30.430
So let my tie things up
together to conclude.

01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:33.610
Preserving cultural heritage
by creating historical sources

01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:36.480
for an oral tradition that
is as steeped in history

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:41.440
as history itself is to many
akin to creating an archive,

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:45.030
a collection of sorts, a
collection of memories,

01:06:45.030 --> 01:06:49.430
a collection of memories
and sounds of pain.

01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:54.410
In embarking on such a process
of representation, one must pause

01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:57.000
and ask some difficult questions.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.850
Whatever the answers, if available,
one can no longer be satisfied

01:07:01.850 --> 01:07:06.060
with what to record,
where, how, and when.

01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:09.250
As humanity is thinking and
rethinking its conception

01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:13.650 position:56%
of purposefully created collections,
what we traditionally call archives,

01:07:13.650 --> 01:07:16.180
we have started thinking
about archives in nuanced

01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:21.780
and increasingly sophisticated,
dare I say even sensitive, ways.

01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:25.890
There are studies about personal
archives, such as Derrida's,

01:07:25.890 --> 01:07:29.520
creations of archives
as works of art.

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:32.910
Recent scholarship talks
about archiving the body,

01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:37.710
or the body as archive, about power
relations and the dynamic nature

01:07:37.710 --> 01:07:41.050
of archives, the materiality
of archives,

01:07:41.050 --> 01:07:43.660
even the silenced archives.

01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:48.020
Perhaps then the question I want
to ask today is how do we account

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:52.440
for pain, even if only in the
sense of historical circumstance,

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:55.530
when we attempt to
capture what we conceive --

01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:59.680
perceive as an endangered
musical tradition?

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:03.730
Wouldn't we risk sentencing those
few left to doom by deciding

01:08:03.730 --> 01:08:07.800
to devitalize, to dehumanize
their spiritual song,

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:10.190
the tradition they carried
through over two millennia

01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:13.270
of human presence,
historicity, and faith,

01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:17.050
in being primarily preoccupied
with how -- thank you --

01:08:17.050 --> 01:08:21.210
with how to convey it
to recorded objects?

01:08:21.210 --> 01:08:26.410
To be sure, necessitating its
death in the process of deciding

01:08:26.410 --> 01:08:30.210
to mummify a tradition is
neither the aim nor the purpose.

01:08:30.210 --> 01:08:34.640
But perhaps by thinking more
dynamically about traditions

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:37.970
which live through pain
then, rather than trying

01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:41.190
to capture their last throes,
we might promote their life

01:08:41.190 --> 01:08:44.320
and the continuation of
their dynamic existence.

01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:46.120
Thank you.

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:59.060
[ Applause ]

01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:01.910
&gt;&gt; Marius Deeb: We have
15 minutes for questions,

01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:05.370
and please address the panelists.

01:09:05.370 --> 01:09:07.580
Of course, address what --

01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:11.710
the contents of the
papers, but please go ahead.

01:09:11.710 --> 01:09:14.010
Who's the first to ask?

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.340
Yes?

01:09:28.050 --> 01:09:29.350
&gt;&gt; Female Speaker: Thank you.

01:09:29.350 --> 01:09:34.380
As someone who's a total
novice about the Syriac chants,

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:39.170
could you very briefly
describe their origin?

01:09:39.170 --> 01:09:40.470
&gt;&gt; Mrs. Tala Jarjour: Their origin?

01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:41.770
&gt;&gt; Female Speaker: Yes.

01:09:41.770 --> 01:09:43.080
&gt;&gt; Mrs. Tala Jarjour: You
couldn't possibly have asked a more

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:44.380
difficult question.

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:46.330
[ Laughter ]

01:09:46.330 --> 01:09:48.640
Help me out, please, historians.

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:54.830
In musical terms, this is an
-- in the Western tradition,

01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:58.050
again there are more people in
this room who know far a lot more

01:09:58.050 --> 01:09:59.630
about Eastern traditions that I do.

01:09:59.630 --> 01:10:03.290 position:56%
But in the Western tradition, there
has never been -- a used at least --

01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:07.490
an employed form of
notation or transcription.

01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:11.070
So the music has always
been an oral tradition,

01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:19.380
which means that it has always been
kept as closely and as faithfully

01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:23.290
as the people who have kept
it have made sure it was kept.

01:10:23.290 --> 01:10:27.360 position:56%
So this leads to people saying it
sounded exactly the way it did 2,000

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:30.510
years ago, even more for
people who connect the --

01:10:30.510 --> 01:10:33.900
who relate the tradition
to older times.

01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:39.410
And it also says that the music
itself has been much subject

01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:41.220
to memory and what memory does.

01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:42.760
This is a huge discussion.

01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:48.460
There are many factors that
played in its development

01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:50.690
and in its changing over time.

01:10:50.690 --> 01:10:53.540
There were many cultures
that were mixing,

01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:57.170
as we heard, only on this panel.

01:10:57.170 --> 01:10:59.500
So musical influences
went in and out

01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:01.850
in various sorts of
ways and directions.

01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:06.210
So this is a very,
very complex question.

01:11:06.210 --> 01:11:13.900
What is certain is that people have
put their sacred texts to music,

01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:16.300
to musical sounds that they are --

01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:19.960
to ways of chanting that
they considered very valuable

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:21.290
and very important.

01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:23.930
And that is the reason
why it survives today.

01:11:23.930 --> 01:11:29.290 position:56%
And if one observes living tradition
as I do, as an ethnomusicologist,

01:11:29.290 --> 01:11:33.530 position:56%
I am continuously struck by how
strongly and importantly people feel

01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:37.570
about keeping their music alive.

01:11:37.570 --> 01:11:41.700
Where it came from, how it changes,
you know, those are questions

01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:44.300
that can be addressed in
various forms and ways.

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:46.770
So I'm sorry to have not
answered your question

01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:48.270
by trying to answer it.

01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:50.760
But this the best that we could do.

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:52.060 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Prof. Jonathna Loopstra: Can I --

01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:54.830
Can I answer from the East
Syrian perspective a little bit?

01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:56.130
&gt;&gt; Mrs. Tala Jarjour: Yeah, please.

01:11:56.130 --> 01:11:57.430
&gt;&gt; Prof. Jonathna Loopstra:
In addition,

01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:58.730
I agree wholeheartedly
with what you say.

01:11:58.730 --> 01:12:00.030
In the East Syrian
perspective, it's interesting.

01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:04.850
We do have early histories,
accounts that there was some --

01:12:04.850 --> 01:12:06.740
something akin to a
musical tradition.

01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:12.060
We have, for example, West Syrians
who go into an East Syrian village

01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:15.760
and accuse them of corrupting the
minds of the youth by getting them

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:18.980
to chant certain melodies, you
know, and these types of things,

01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:21.230
which we don't know
how true that it.

01:12:21.230 --> 01:12:25.520
But one interesting thing is,
again, those dots I pointed out.

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:28.940
We see those in the Syriac
Bibles, East Syrian specifically,

01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:32.460
all the way from the time of
Joseph Hosea [assumed spelling]

01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:34.960
in the sixth century
all the way forward.

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:37.000
So something happened there,
and these are retained

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.630
until the printing press.

01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:43.420
And some scholars have argued those
dots signified ancient Aramaic hand

01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:45.920
motions from music.

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:47.220
They call it kuranami
[assumed spelling].

01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:49.650
Again, we don't know
how true that is.

01:12:49.650 --> 01:12:51.620
It's a debated point.

01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:53.280
Others argue it comes
from the Greek,

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:56.250
like Olibach Mertz
[assumed spelling].

01:12:56.250 --> 01:12:58.970
And I think the answer
is somewhere in between.

01:12:58.970 --> 01:13:02.120
But what's interesting there is
eventually these are modified,

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:06.730
as I mentioned, and they are
continued in Syriac scriptures

01:13:06.730 --> 01:13:12.000
over time to the point where even
some early Byzantinists have argued

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.130
these in Syriac represent
phonetic numes [assumed spelling],

01:13:15.130 --> 01:13:20.160
may have even influenced
Byzantine numes,

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:22.100
meaning then you would
have some type

01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:25.810
of chanted scripture here
retained for over a millennium,

01:13:25.810 --> 01:13:27.670 position:56%
or the indications that it occurred.

01:13:27.670 --> 01:13:31.720
So if that's true then, the East
Syrian scriptures might have

01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:33.020
been chanted.

01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:35.200
If these are numes, they
might have been chanted

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:38.330
from this period onwards, although
they later forgot what they

01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:40.120
actually meant.

01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:41.420
But --

01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:42.720
&gt;&gt; Marius Deeb: Other questions?

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:44.020
&gt;&gt; Dr. Dr. Mark Dickens: Oh, could
I just add to that just to mention

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:46.940
that we have those
musical recitation marks

01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:57.830
in bilingual Syriac Sogdian
lectionaries from Turfan

01:13:57.830 --> 01:14:01.120
where they have the -- so obviously
they were following the chanting

01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:04.280
marks all the way over there
in Western China as well.

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:05.580
&gt;&gt; Prof. Jonathan Loopstra:
For example, along those lines,

01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:08.320
you can look at the Sogdian Romans,

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.350
and you can actually see the
[foreign language spoken],

01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:14.920
the three marks of possibly
exclamation or raised into a nation

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:18.320
on the exact same scriptural
passages in Sogdian that you have

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.050
in the East Syrian Bible.

01:14:20.050 --> 01:14:21.650
So something's happening there.

01:14:21.650 --> 01:14:22.950
Yeah.

01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:24.250
&gt;&gt; Marius Deeb: Please, go ahead.

01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:27.780
&gt;&gt; Female Speaker: Yes, I wanted to
ask Dr. Mark Dickens in particular

01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:32.950
about the excavations in Central
Asia that are turning up Christian,

01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:37.610
specifically Syriac, material
or Christian in general,

01:14:37.610 --> 01:14:43.080
and I wanted to know that given
that ISIS is blowing up anything

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:47.880
that is either Christian
or even Assyrian today,

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:50.530
how do the Central
Asian governments,

01:14:50.530 --> 01:14:53.760
which are basically Muslim,
deal with these excavations

01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:56.980
that unearthed a Christian past?

01:14:56.980 --> 01:14:59.040
&gt;&gt; Dr. Dr. Mark Dickens:
Well, the thing about most

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:02.260
of the Central Asian
governments is that they're --

01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:05.160
they are more post-Soviet
than they are Muslim.

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:10.550
And so, they are -- their main
concern actually are anything

01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:14.980
like Daesh or ISIS that -- Muslim
terrorism, that that's their --

01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:16.370
actually their biggest concern.

01:15:16.370 --> 01:15:20.460
So they tend to clamp
down on those people.

01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:23.930 position:56%
More troubling is the fact that, for
example, that church I showed you

01:15:23.930 --> 01:15:26.800
that was excavated in Urgut.

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:29.610
My friend who did the excavation,

01:15:29.610 --> 01:15:31.320
once they had taken
all the pictures,

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:34.200
they then had to cover it back up.

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:36.100 position:56%
And so, there's bricks lying around.

01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:38.900
It's like -- it's next
to a rural farm.

01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:41.940
There's a sign saying that it's
a protected archaeological site.

01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:43.240
There's nobody guarding it.

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.330
So anybody could walk in
there and do anything,

01:15:45.330 --> 01:15:48.030
not that I think anybody
would because it's --

01:15:48.030 --> 01:15:50.120
most people probably
living in the area just --

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.320
it just doesn't mean
anything to them.

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:54.080
Now this is one of the
problems, of course,

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:57.430
when you have a cultural
heritage which -- where you --

01:15:57.430 --> 01:16:01.350
where you don't have people still
living there that have any sense

01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:05.140
of ownership of it, that it then
becomes kind of meaningless.

01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:12.140
In China, same thing, you --
places like Turfan, the --

01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:16.180 position:56%
if you can get the Chinese
government involved in them thinking

01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:19.060
that it would be good for them
to have this place excavated,

01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:21.100
then they might do
some more excavations.

01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:24.470
But they would probably be more
interested in looking for evidence

01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:29.040
of Chinese, you know, cultural
heritage rather than Syriac.

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:31.340
&gt;&gt; Marius Deeb: Go
ahead, ma'am, please.

01:16:35.170 --> 01:16:37.780
&gt;&gt; Female Speaker: I was
curious about the fact

01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:45.770
that Christianity seems to have
been taken directly a descendent

01:16:45.770 --> 01:16:49.730
of the earlier God worship of
whatever the earlier gods were.

01:16:49.730 --> 01:16:52.790
I don't know anything about
this history, and I'm accustomed

01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:56.130
to thinking of the
Christian tradition as coming

01:16:56.130 --> 01:16:59.190
out of the Jewish tradition,
and I think you firstly --

01:16:59.190 --> 01:17:01.330
finally mentioned the
Jewish tradition somewhere

01:17:01.330 --> 01:17:06.610
that they were Jewish communities
around where this was happening.

01:17:06.610 --> 01:17:11.730
And since the Messianic tradition
is so central to Christianity,

01:17:11.730 --> 01:17:16.290
I'm wondering where that
originated since it seems --

01:17:16.290 --> 01:17:22.290
did the previous non-Jewish
ancestors of the --

01:17:22.290 --> 01:17:26.210
of the Christian tradition
in the Syriac areas --

01:17:26.210 --> 01:17:29.170
where did they get the
Messianic ideas from?

01:17:29.170 --> 01:17:32.820
I hope this is relevant.

01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:35.540
&gt;&gt; Marius Deeb: Who's
going to answer?

01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:37.240
&gt;&gt; Prof. Prof. Jonathan
Loopstra: So you're asking when --

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:40.790
how did the Christians
get the Messianic?

01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:42.100
&gt;&gt; Female Speaker: Yeah, yeah, how
did [inaudible] because I'm used

01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:44.710
to thinking of it coming
from the Jewish tradition,

01:17:44.710 --> 01:17:49.750
which seems to have been
eclipsed or kind of vaulted

01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:54.370
over in this business from the
earlier gods right to Christianity.

01:17:54.370 --> 01:17:57.740
&gt;&gt; Prof. Jonathan Loopstra: One of
the interesting things in the study

01:17:57.740 --> 01:18:04.610
of early Syriac Christianity
is that there was -- there's --

01:18:04.610 --> 01:18:08.260
we really don't have the evidence
for what was actually happening

01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:10.590
on the ground, say in
places like Edessa.

01:18:10.590 --> 01:18:13.660
There must have been a Jewish
community alongside a growing

01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:14.960
Christian community.

01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:19.640 position:56%
And -- but the question is did the
-- was the Christian community maybe

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:23.800
in your words like
Messianic in some regard?

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:27.530
Were they -- did they cut off
from Jews, or were they separate?

01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:30.550
This is a big issue that's
being discussed and debated.

01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:31.900 position:56%
Think, for example, what I mentioned

01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:34.640
with the Syriac Bible,
right, the Peshitta.

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:38.680 position:56%
The question is what -- it was
translated from the Hebrew, we know,

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:40.930
in the first or second centuries.

01:18:40.930 --> 01:18:43.490
Did non-Jewish Christians
know Hebrew well enough

01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:44.790
to be able to translate that?

01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:46.350
Probably not.

01:18:46.350 --> 01:18:50.240
Was it Jews who translated
the Hebrew for the Christians?

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:54.750
Well -- or was it the Jews who
weren't quite defined, you know,

01:18:54.750 --> 01:18:58.750
or were this middle ground
between Judaism and Christianity

01:18:58.750 --> 01:19:00.680
that translated --
knew enough Hebrew

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:02.420
to translate for the Christians?

01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:04.410
And so, there's a debate on that.

01:19:04.410 --> 01:19:06.640 position:56%
The questions of what was
happening on the ground in the first

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:09.950
and second century
are hotly debated.

01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:12.540
But the point is that
it's very interesting.

01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:14.500
Look at Aphrahat [assumed spelling]
and Ephram [assumed spelling].

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:16.870
They're familiar with
Jewish traditions.

01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:19.120
Sebastian Brock has
written a lot, for example,

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:23.120
on the use Talmudic
literature interpretations

01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.450
in early Christianity
and early Syriac.

01:19:25.450 --> 01:19:28.740
So they're definitely living
side-by-side in some ways.

01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:30.210
This is a continuum of thought.

01:19:30.210 --> 01:19:34.250
But at the same time, if you
look at say Aphrahat's writings,

01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:38.830
while he uses the types of
interpretation you'll find

01:19:38.830 --> 01:19:41.670
in Jewish literature at the --

01:19:41.670 --> 01:19:45.660
at the time, he also will use
it against the Jews, right?

01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:49.670
So you have him using the
very tools against his --

01:19:49.670 --> 01:19:52.660
those that are competing for the
faithful in this period of time.

01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:55.050
And you can go on with
Ephram and some

01:19:55.050 --> 01:19:56.900
of his other memra
[assumed spelling]

01:19:56.900 --> 01:20:00.040
on [inaudible] what's
happening in Edessa as well.

01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:03.240
So this is -- this is in
between area, what was happening

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:05.340
in the first and second centuries.

01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:09.440
But there is evidence that
there was conversation going on.

01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:13.970
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker: I've got
a question for [inaudible].

01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:19.440
I'm very interested in scripts

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:23.720
and how the writing system
has -- and for both of you.

01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:28.340
Obviously, the script of
Syriac was very influential

01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:31.910
in various Iranian languages
and also some Turkic.

01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:36.170
So I'm curious to see both in
Pahlavi and then Sogdian, Hotanese,

01:20:36.170 --> 01:20:39.350
and other languages the
role of the Syriac script

01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:45.830
in preserving actually a lot of
Iranic or Persian related heritage

01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:50.280
and also the role that
the Persian Empire --

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:56.230
Empires or dynasties may have
had, both in the pre-Christian era

01:20:56.230 --> 01:21:02.090
and the propagating of Aramaic as
well as also after Christianity

01:21:02.090 --> 01:21:04.970
and the use of the church
of the East or the church

01:21:04.970 --> 01:21:08.730
of Persia essentially, its role
as it went through the empire.

01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:12.590
So I'm just curious to hear
your thoughts looking at it,

01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:15.480
how it impacted the Persian
world or the Persian-speaking

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:16.780
or Iranian-speaking peoples.

01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:18.080
Thank you.

01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:19.380
&gt;&gt; Marius Deeb: This
is the last question

01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:20.680
because everybody's hungry, okay?

01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:21.980
[ Laughter ]

01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:23.280
Go ahead.

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:24.580
&gt;&gt; Dr. Dr. Mark Dickens: Okay.

01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:25.880
So just briefly, the
-- pretty much all

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:28.490
of the Iranian scripts were based

01:21:28.490 --> 01:21:31.960
on the Aramaic alphabet
before Syriac had developed

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:33.270
as a separate alphabet.

01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:38.330
So Pahlavi, Sogdian,
from Sogdian came Uighur.

01:21:38.330 --> 01:21:40.720
From Uigher came Mongolian script.

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:49.800
Hotanese was actually often written
in the Brahmi script from India.

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:55.330
But as far as the Syriac script
that was carried eastward,

01:21:55.330 --> 01:22:01.560
the languages that were
used to -- the Christian --

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:03.020
to produce Christian material

01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:06.350
in using the Syriac
script were Sogdian.

01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:09.720
So Sogdian was -- Sogdian
Christian material is found both

01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:13.090
in the Sogdian script, the native
Sogdian script that comes directly

01:22:13.090 --> 01:22:16.260
from Aramaic, and in
the Syriac script,

01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:21.060
and also Turkic material is
found both in the Uighur script,

01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:23.720
which is dependent on the
Sogdian script, which is dependent

01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:26.540
on Aramaic, and in
the Syriac script.

01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:30.190
And there are a couple of
fragments in New Persian,

01:22:30.190 --> 01:22:32.990
which are also written
in the Syriac script.

01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:36.650
But the only Middle
Persian material we have is

01:22:36.650 --> 01:22:39.390
that Saltar [assumed spelling], and
it's only in the Pahlavi script.

01:22:39.390 --> 01:22:41.920
&gt;&gt; Marius Deeb: Let's give them
a -- the speaker [inaudible].

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:43.720
Thank you very much.
