00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.160

Many of these commercials are so popular they repeat them every year

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.700
- how crazy is that? An ad campaign you don't even have to change because people love the nostalgia so much.

It was surreal, whimsical, and beautifully animated.

[Critic]: Number 6.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.280
Another ad I've talked about before, but certainly deserves a spot on the list.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.760
In many respects, it's not even really a Christmas ad.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.220
Christmas is never mentioned.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:24.240
But the idea of a snowman, coming in from the cold, and getting warmed up by soup...

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:28.420
...How can this NOT lead to a lot of warm fuzzies that connect you with the holidays?

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.440
I think what makes it work is the contrast.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.580
...It's not just cold, it's sideways snow cold.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:38.220

To make the story behind it even more interesting,

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:40.880
the brand manager, John Dunne, was tasked with making several whimsical Herschey commercials,

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.220

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.720

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.040
In 1914, on Christmas during World War I,

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:24.380

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.200

...anything they had.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:41.820
To make the ad even more powerful, it was released exactly 100 years after the event took place.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.200
They actually tried so hard to get this right that they teamed up with the Royal British Legion to get the details down.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:53.120
There's even a "Making Of" the commercial on Youtube to show how hard they tried to get it.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.040
The chocolate bar, as well, was sold in stores.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:01.320
And the profits all went to the Royal British Legion, to benefit their armed forces and their families.
