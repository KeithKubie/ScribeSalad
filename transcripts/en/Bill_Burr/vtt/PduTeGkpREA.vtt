00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:02.460
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.550
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.580
April 18th, 2016 was going on to Hawaii.

4
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.610
Um, I don't know. I don't even know what,

5
00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:16.800
I don't even know where to start on this fucker one.

6
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.540
Um, how do, how do you begin? This one is still be sensitive, sensitive.

7
00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:27.630
There's so many sensitive stories out there and when there is,

8
00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:30.220
when there's feelings there in

9
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.670
bold, um, this fucking

10
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.180
lie down at the zoo in Palm Beach, Florida, rest,

11
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.150
her soul got attacked and killed, got mauled, uh,

12
00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:50.850
by a fucking tiger,

13
00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:55.410
sometimes referred to as the tiger whisper, Yada, Yada, Yada, Yada, Yada,

14
00:00:55.411 --> 00:00:58.950
Yada, Yada and all that fucking shit. These, I don't know what it

15
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.570
is about people who fall in love with wild animals. This,

16
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.320
there's nothing you can do to cure it. It's fuck it.

17
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:15.180
It doesn't give a fuck about you. It's not a dog.

18
00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:18.390
You know, falling in love with a wild animal.

19
00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:22.370
It's like falling in love with a stripper. Yeah.

20
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.220
It's just not going to end well. It's not going to end well.

21
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.180
Fucking unbelievable. None. There's another story.

22
00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:34.440
This fucking scout leader takes a bunch of boys scouts,

23
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.320
takes a bunch of children into the fucking woods.

24
00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:41.130
He goes into a cave and there's a fucking bear in there.

25
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.700
So the whole story's always an amazing that the boy scouts kept their fucking

26
00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:50.310
cool. The guy knew, the scout leader knew.

27
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.350
He pulled his shirt up over his face and then curled up into the fetal position,

28
00:01:55.351 --> 00:01:58.500
which I guess is the international bear signal like, hey man,

29
00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:00.300
I don't want any part of this man.

30
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.940
And then the bear lost interest in walked away.

31
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.740
But at no point during all of this does anybody say,

32
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.510
Hey, what the fuck are you bringing a bunch of kids around with his bears just

33
00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:13.500
walking around.

34
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.970
It's bad enough if you take your kids to the fucking zoo,

35
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.960
the amount of times he's Goddamn, things get loose. Or at the very least,

36
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:24.630
some fatties going to walk up to some polar bear cage,

37
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.810
go over the fucking thing and stand there, you know,

38
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.830
and then get fucking snatched by this thing. And what is she saying?

39
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.750
What for you? She fucking blow your brains out. You're dope. Right.

40
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.920
So I'm not saying the lady who died in Florida was a dope. I'm just saying that,

41
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.230
um, I don't know.

42
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.010
You Insert yourself into this situation and there's no good way to insert

43
00:02:47.011 --> 00:02:50.430
yourself into a mauling to death by a tiger. Cause you know what that means.

44
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.080
There was also, they always just say malt. You know, like it came up like,

45
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.020
like some prison shit and just stuck you with the shank. It didn't,

46
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.050
it fucking crushed your neck and then it started feeding on your innards.

47
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.100
That's fucking brutal.

48
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.523
<v 1>Okay.</v>

49
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.230
<v 0>Hang on a second, Nia. Okay.</v>

50
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.540
What are you doing? You coming in? All right. Did you lock me in?

51
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.443
<v 1>No.</v>

52
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.430
<v 0>Okay. Sorry. She just got, she's freaking me out. They're like, well,</v>

53
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:32.520
I got these new locks on the door. I thought she was locking the door.

54
00:03:32.521 --> 00:03:34.740
It's still early here and I just woke her up. So, uh,

55
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.270
she's going to be a little grumpy. Mia, if you want to come in on the podcast,

56
00:03:38.271 --> 00:03:41.780
let me know. Oh,

57
00:03:41.781 --> 00:03:44.600
that sandwich spoke volumes. You know, I'll tell you right now,

58
00:03:44.601 --> 00:03:47.300
getting married is kind of like a falling in love with a wild land.

59
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.760
You know as much as you love them, don't get too close to the fucking in close.

60
00:03:55.761 --> 00:03:58.940
Yeah. Um, yeah. Let me get back there.

61
00:03:58.941 --> 00:04:01.370
Why the fuck would you take a bunch of kids out like no.

62
00:04:01.371 --> 00:04:03.680
At no point does anybody address that.

63
00:04:03.681 --> 00:04:08.060
This guy took a bunch of fucking children out to where there's bears and then

64
00:04:08.061 --> 00:04:12.410
they watched him get fucking mauled for half a second before he took his izod

65
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.100
and yanked it over his head. That's what you're supposed to do.

66
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

67
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.670
<v 0>How have I been on the earth this long and not known that that's what you do</v>

68
00:04:20.671 --> 00:04:21.810
when you run into the bear?

69
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.370
Is it because I'm not in scouting or is it because most people are smart enough

70
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.930
to not be around bears?

71
00:04:27.931 --> 00:04:31.350
To not reenact the fucking scene from the Leonardo DiCaprio movie?

72
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.610
What was it called? A rake on? I don't know what the fuck it is. The revelent,

73
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.310
the irrelevant, whatever the fuck it was called.

74
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.760
I hate when they take some big word that already exist and just makes you feel

75
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.250
like it's like, did they make that word up? And it's like, no,

76
00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:47.520
that word is existed. The revenant. Right.

77
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.000
<v 1>Okay.</v>

78
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.400
<v 0>That word is existed your entire life.</v>

79
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.610
Just you and everybody you know is too dumb to walk around and use it on a daily

80
00:04:56.711 --> 00:05:01.450
basis and yeah, that's, it's a sad feeling. Just sad fucking feeling. Um,

81
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.590
I forgot what I was looking. Oh yeah.

82
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.810
What to do if a bear attacks you,

83
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.281
I can tell you right now,

84
00:05:09.281 --> 00:05:12.790
this is going to be 99.9% white people look in this shit up.

85
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.180
Let the, that go out there. I hate to do def jam material,

86
00:05:18.181 --> 00:05:19.290
but it's fucking true.

87
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:20.623
<v 1>Okay.</v>

88
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.300
<v 0>Jesus fucking Christ 2016 and he get mauled by a grizzly bear.</v>

89
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:31.270
There's no excuse for that. And you know why? You know,

90
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.030
hallmark doesn't make a card for it. There you go.

91
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.080
You can go through all of that whole sympathy section. Sorry for your loss.

92
00:05:38.081 --> 00:05:42.940
Sorry. It got this disease. Sorry, I was a Douche yesterday. There's no,

93
00:05:42.941 --> 00:05:47.830
wow. Fucking sorry. You got mauled by a bear. They don't because it happens so,

94
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.950
so little. So few times. There's no reason for it.

95
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.040
They should really make one of those, you know, and, and make it even better.

96
00:05:55.041 --> 00:05:56.120
It should like rhyme. Yeah.

97
00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.180
<v 1>I hate</v>

98
00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.020
<v 0>to look, I hate to stare, but your face got mauled by a bear.</v>

99
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.680
I'm really fucking sorry. Uh,

100
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.880
I know something about a trolley. Go Fuck Yourself. I'll help you feel

101
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.260
tension. All zookeepers out there. Uh, those are not your friends. Uh,

102
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.660
and they don't want to be there.

103
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.390
And I think a lot of them realize the situation.

104
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.840
Then I just sit there fucking waiting for you to give them another fucking pile

105
00:06:27.841 --> 00:06:31.410
of cube steaks. They're sitting there, even if they were born in captivity,

106
00:06:31.411 --> 00:06:35.370
I guaran fucking tee you that they are sitting there with this strange feeling

107
00:06:35.371 --> 00:06:39.480
that there has to be more than this. Look at me too. Look, I mean,

108
00:06:39.481 --> 00:06:43.020
if you're a fucking tiger, even you're a tiger born into captivity, right?

109
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.380
You're rolling around with somebody dressed in a safari outfit. Okay.

110
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.310
And you bond with that person like it's your fucking mother. Right?

111
00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.260
It's some fucking point at some point,

112
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.130
you know, just g eagle alone with all those people showing up,

113
00:06:58.131 --> 00:06:59.900
just to look at you taking your picture,

114
00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:02.660
there's no weed and there's no way to keep your four feet on the ground,

115
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.740
you know, and not be like, dude, uh,

116
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.133
<v 2>okay,</v>

117
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.600
<v 0>why am I in a cage right now when everybody's coming up? You know,</v>

118
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.900
all I do is lay around every day and these people can't get enough looking at

119
00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:15.734
me. I mean,

120
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:16.940
<v 2>okay</v>

121
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.610
<v 0>man, I'm the fucking shit. You know, when you just start,</v>

122
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.460
your ego just goes fucking cradling. Then you start looking like, you know,

123
00:07:24.461 --> 00:07:28.050
I don't know, you'd start tested, they come in a little bit,

124
00:07:28.051 --> 00:07:28.950
you give him a little growl,

125
00:07:28.951 --> 00:07:32.820
you see it in their face and they got some broom handle. I get back to back,

126
00:07:32.821 --> 00:07:36.350
right. You just Sorta, you know, first time with your park test,

127
00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:40.170
the strength of that fucking little broom handle. Like, dude,

128
00:07:40.171 --> 00:07:44.090
I could snap that thing. This guy's fucking shoulders, guy's a pussy.

129
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.390
You know what they're doing, tiger push up, you know?

130
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.100
And then one day you just like, you know what?

131
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.310
As much as I'm enjoying this fucking raw meat,

132
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.280
I have it every day and I need to switch up the Diet.

133
00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.720
You know when I mall you and use your belt as some dental school.

134
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:04.350
<v 2>Okay,</v>

135
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:07.330
<v 0>I know, I know what you're thinking right now. You probably think it pill.</v>

136
00:08:07.331 --> 00:08:09.450
This is really fucking insensitive. Well you know what,

137
00:08:09.451 --> 00:08:11.100
this is how I deal with sad shit.

138
00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.280
I joke around about it cause I don't feel like they get about everybody that

139
00:08:14.281 --> 00:08:16.390
loved that woman that now can never see her again.

140
00:08:16.391 --> 00:08:17.940
So I mean what am I supposed to do?

141
00:08:17.941 --> 00:08:22.941
And then also I like to feel that I'm being responsible by giving you some tips

142
00:08:23.041 --> 00:08:27.840
on how not to a, yeah. You know, well you know, get mauled to death by a bear.

143
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:30.540
I just don't understand that.

144
00:08:30.541 --> 00:08:33.660
Like what's so fucking funny about these goddamn scouts,

145
00:08:33.661 --> 00:08:35.130
it's like why don't you just go in the woods?

146
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.880
You don't have to go into the Goddamn wilderness. You know,

147
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.400
fuck brings a bunch of kids out there. I'll tell you,

148
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:43.540
it brings a bunch of kids out there,

149
00:08:43.541 --> 00:08:46.960
kind of guy that goes out and just walks into a fucking cave,

150
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:49.580
gets mauled by a fucking bitch.

151
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.590
Who the fuck walks into a cave in the middle of the forest? What kind of,

152
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.960
I mean, I'm not in scouting. I never was. I can't start a fire without a match.

153
00:08:57.961 --> 00:08:59.070
But I can tell you right now,

154
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.760
my general instincts say is that says that you know,

155
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:07.340
there's no apartment buildings out in the fucking forest. Okay,

156
00:09:07.341 --> 00:09:11.060
so a cave is like, that's like a townhouse in Brooklyn.

157
00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:17.000
You know, half the people have to fucking dig into holes in the Goddamn ground,

158
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.990
curling up to hibernate. And then here's a fucking cave. All right,

159
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:24.410
so you think everybody who lives out there, that's like fucking,

160
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.430
that's like Beverly hills level property. So who's going to get it?

161
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:33.080
The strongest, sickest, craziest motherfucker out there. And that's a bear.

162
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:33.891
You know,

163
00:09:33.891 --> 00:09:36.890
you're not going to walk in there and there's going to be a little fox in there

164
00:09:36.891 --> 00:09:39.950
like it isn't. It's going to be some fucking,

165
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:44.330
it's got to be the king of the forest. Which is a bear as far as I know.

166
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:49.220
Although I did see a mountain lion give it a couple of fucking, you know,

167
00:09:49.221 --> 00:09:52.370
personnel Whitaker's, you know, Mimo fast. That guy was,

168
00:09:52.371 --> 00:09:54.770
they would just fucking right on top of this head.

169
00:09:54.771 --> 00:09:56.510
And the bear just sat there and taking, you know,

170
00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:01.520
he had like the head movement of light of late Mike Tyson rather than early in.

171
00:10:01.521 --> 00:10:05.480
He just took a few and then he just sorta started running away was a sad day,

172
00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:08.920
you know? Um, anyways,

173
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:12.020
just imagine if you ran into a badger or a fucking wolverine.

174
00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:14.240
Those are the lunatics,

175
00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:19.460
badges and wolverines still like the Irish and the Scottish of the fuck it

176
00:10:19.461 --> 00:10:20.810
forest. You know what I mean?

177
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:22.640
<v 1>Okay.</v>

178
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.980
<v 0>Those things don't even quit. Even, even if they're losing,</v>

179
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:32.570
they just got dead. I don't give a fuck, you know, blood all over their face.

180
00:10:32.571 --> 00:10:34.220
They're not stopping. They're going to keep coming.

181
00:10:34.221 --> 00:10:36.920
Just like the Irish and the Scottish fucking loaded ticks.

182
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:41.510
You don't want any part, any part of that? Well, you know,

183
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:44.330
I don't know what I mean. You know,

184
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.820
I never even looked to say Kate bear encounters in back country.

185
00:10:46.821 --> 00:10:50.720
If you encounter a bear on the trail or in your campsite. Yeah,

186
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.590
cause you're cooking food. Basically the dinner bell of anything within fucking,

187
00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.690
oh my God. Look at the size of this fucking bear. Oh,

188
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.480
there's a lady fucking walking in. There's a bear in the background.

189
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.580
Guess what color she is. Alright. Be Safe and bear habitat.

190
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:12.710
Oh God. This is the first sentence. The level, I mean,

191
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.710
as dumb as I am, the level of dopes that have to become to this website. Listen,

192
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:21.110
this is the first sentence. It's normal. It's normal.

193
00:11:21.111 --> 00:11:25.850
T I said normal. It's normal to be frightened when you encounter a bear.

194
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.330
That's how this, this is. This is the jump off point.

195
00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:33.320
The reality is that most encounters with bears rarely,

196
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:37.520
rarely lead to aggressive behavior. And attacks are even rarer. Here.

197
00:11:37.521 --> 00:11:42.260
They go sucking you into the forest and you know, I mean it happens,

198
00:11:42.261 --> 00:11:44.900
but generally is, here's a great lie.

199
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:50.060
They're actually more afraid of you than you are of them. Yeah.

200
00:11:50.061 --> 00:11:53.720
And what are they doing when they get, when they're afraid. Okay?

201
00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:59.490
They either take off running or they fucking maul you to death and go, hey,

202
00:11:59.491 --> 00:12:03.390
you know, here's a bonus. The threat is gone and now I have a midday snack.

203
00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.980
Remember, most bears prefer to avoid contact with humans.

204
00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:09.400
<v 1>Okay,</v>

205
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.280
<v 0>that's hilarious. Still like the champion that doesn't want to fight. You know,</v>

206
00:12:12.281 --> 00:12:16.040
just trying to hold onto the belt back paddle in the entire time until you

207
00:12:16.041 --> 00:12:16.990
corner the fucking thing.

208
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.010
And any bear you do see is probably just as frightened as you are there.

209
00:12:21.011 --> 00:12:25.660
It is every fucking, you know what it is.

210
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:28.630
The bears don't have access to a mirror.

211
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.370
They're living in their heads, you know, they're out there by themselves,

212
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:38.010
you know, talking to themselves account man, you know,

213
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:42.120
not to find a cave or some shit, man. Right? And all of a sudden,

214
00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:46.110
so they finally find it, nobody else is in here. You can fucking chill out,

215
00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:49.140
put an l shape couch over here, get a flat screen.

216
00:12:49.141 --> 00:12:52.440
And all of a sudden this fucking guy comes walking in and his God damn shorts.

217
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.080
You know what he's thinking, he's thinking to catch a predator.

218
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.770
He's probably seen that show too. He comes this fucking pedophile,

219
00:12:58.771 --> 00:13:00.600
the bear thinks he's going to get fucked in the ass.

220
00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:03.120
And next thing you know he's on top of this guy, right?

221
00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:05.940
And a fucking dudes dodge yanking his shirt over his head.

222
00:13:05.941 --> 00:13:09.930
And then the bear is like, what the fuck? Sky's a bottom. You know,

223
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:13.530
I thought this guy was trying to rape me. Now all of a sudden he's acting like,

224
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:16.050
well, make it love here. And he's being all submissive.

225
00:13:16.051 --> 00:13:17.490
This is fucking weirded me out.

226
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:22.560
What if he tells his friends the bears all homophobic and then he kills him and

227
00:13:22.561 --> 00:13:26.370
why? You know what? There's a bunch of little kids watching it. All right?

228
00:13:26.371 --> 00:13:28.440
And that's what camping is. And I think, you know what?

229
00:13:28.441 --> 00:13:30.240
I have to haven't worked that out right there.

230
00:13:30.241 --> 00:13:34.170
I think scouring should be illegal. You know what I mean? We want to get doing,

231
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.320
first of all, you know, dressing those little boys up like little French maids,

232
00:13:37.321 --> 00:13:39.600
you know, Darryl scarfs running around. I mean,

233
00:13:39.601 --> 00:13:43.650
it's just you wonder why you got all those sexual predators, sex predators,

234
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.850
sexual predators. I don't. It's sexual chocolate. Um, anyways,

235
00:13:47.851 --> 00:13:51.570
remained as composed as possible and follow these simple guidelines.

236
00:13:51.571 --> 00:13:55.170
Whenever you're in bear country, soon you will,

237
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.430
you two will have more composure when siting a bear because you know what to do

238
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.720
a scream bloody murder and run in the other direction. Actually,

239
00:14:03.721 --> 00:14:07.260
it's exactly the exact opposite of what you want to do. You want to remain calm.

240
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:11.160
It take a step towards the bear that shows a level of confidence.

241
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.290
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

242
00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:17.010
<v 0>fucking dopes. Alright, first one, avoid. Avoid, avoid.</v>

243
00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.550
Yeah. Light. By staying in civilization,

244
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:25.800
the best way to prevent an unpleasant and unpleasant bear encounter is to avoid

245
00:14:25.801 --> 00:14:26.670
them all together.

246
00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:30.900
Bears usually avoid people and most people don't even know when they,

247
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.120
they've come close to a bear. Exactly.

248
00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:38.570
To insure a surprise or an to ensure a surprise or unpleasant encounter with a

249
00:14:39.481 --> 00:14:40.530
bear doesn't occur.

250
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:45.740
Avoid moving through bear habitats silently and alone traveling groups.

251
00:14:46.171 --> 00:14:47.310
The larger the better.

252
00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:51.950
And make lots of noise by talking or singing and put the iPod away and pay

253
00:14:51.951 --> 00:14:56.410
attention to your surroundings. Ah,

254
00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.370
Jesus Christ. I don't know about that.

255
00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:04.030
What if the bears have an a slow fucking couple of days and is hungry and you

256
00:15:04.031 --> 00:15:08.440
starts, you know, um, get into Rhames school. Lido.

257
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:13.360
We do what we do. Zip Petito does it. Beatty. Yay. You know,

258
00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:18.340
and the bear starts sick. You like, you know what? I think it's worth the risk.

259
00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:23.170
Even though I'm scared. I think I could take that fucking 140 pound dope.

260
00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:26.430
All right. When it happens, she,

261
00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.680
they wrote that instead of when you're getting mauled by the bear and you fail,

262
00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:34.830
it's breath and his fucking incisors ripping at your neck when it happens.

263
00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.980
That's another way of saying that. Remain calm and ready.

264
00:15:38.981 --> 00:15:43.210
Your bear spray or other deterrent. What is it?

265
00:15:43.211 --> 00:15:47.020
Your underarm here, uh, stay together. If you're in a group,

266
00:15:47.021 --> 00:15:50.290
you will appear larger and more intimidating. If you stick together,

267
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:54.450
try to figure out whether the bear is a grizzly or a black. Hey,

268
00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.650
let's fake run that is 40 miles an hour.

269
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.800
If a dog that's over right fucking over,

270
00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:02.250
try to figure out whether the bears a grizzly or a black bear.

271
00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.480
As you will see below,

272
00:16:03.481 --> 00:16:07.320
grizzly bears and black bears tend to behave differently in a given situation,

273
00:16:07.321 --> 00:16:10.230
so it helps to know which species you're dealing with as it's running.

274
00:16:10.231 --> 00:16:13.650
After you give me a fucking break, I just click here to see the difference

275
00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.310
bears at a distance. Dude, it's a fucking bear.

276
00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:21.030
Look at these fucking things.

277
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.690
Do the fact that one of these things could pick up Lawrence Taylor at the height

278
00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.470
of his fucking career and throw him through the uprights. You

279
00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:37.390
gotcha. Bear Smart Society. These, these fucking people like I don't get it.

280
00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:38.590
I mean there has to be,

281
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.980
why can't you just go out and your backyard just set up a tent? I mean you,

282
00:16:41.981 --> 00:16:46.060
you are still outside. As long as you don't go inside, you are camping.

283
00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:51.310
It's not the same thing, man. I've got to get out there where there's bears.

284
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.810
I know what to do, right? If it's a black bear, black bear,

285
00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:58.870
they usually lead with the left. You know what I mean?

286
00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:01.960
The traditional of Grizzlies is south park,

287
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:03.370
so it's going to be a little bit weird.

288
00:17:03.371 --> 00:17:06.640
They definitely have a reach advantage considering when they stand up.

289
00:17:06.641 --> 00:17:07.990
They're about eight feet tall.

290
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:12.190
So what you want to do is you want to stay outside his wheelhouse. Okay.

291
00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:15.190
And you want, you want to circle away from his power pants.

292
00:17:15.191 --> 00:17:18.610
You want to circle to your left staying away.

293
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:22.810
He's the craziest want to load up that left that go for the big shot.

294
00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:26.740
They tried to steal around. I don't know. I'm sorry.

295
00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:31.320
Am I beating this to death here? I'm just, there's no fucking reason.

296
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:36.030
There's no reason to get killed by a tiger in the United States of America.

297
00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.140
They don't live here.

298
00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.750
There are only one place there at the fucking zoo at uh,

299
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:45.510
you know they're in cages self.

300
00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:52.140
At some point you went into the fucking thing. You do just you, I don't know.

301
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:57.710
Oh my God. What is the fucking thought when you get yanked in the second year?

302
00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.170
Oh No, it's gotta be it. Oh No,

303
00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:05.520
make it quick. I mean, just shit that would go through your head. I'm sorry.

304
00:18:05.521 --> 00:18:10.230
This is getting fucking morbid. Um, so anyways, my condolences to the,

305
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.220
uh,

306
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:14.790
friends of families or the lady down there in Florida and made condolences to

307
00:18:14.791 --> 00:18:15.451
the, uh,

308
00:18:15.451 --> 00:18:18.510
the girl with the members only jacket that he yanked up over his fucking head.

309
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:21.450
Uh, you know, good. I knew, sir.

310
00:18:21.451 --> 00:18:25.140
I hope I wish you more luck as you bring children into the fucking woods.

311
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.410
Fucking idiot.

312
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.450
What is it about putting on a fucking uniform that all of a sudden you think you

313
00:18:33.451 --> 00:18:36.070
know something? I just don't get it. Oh, I are you off.

314
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:41.970
I have all my badges on my shirt. I've been trained

315
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:48.730
thanks Phi. He's a jolly good fellow.

316
00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.400
That's so they should be singly sure thing that, you know,

317
00:18:50.401 --> 00:18:52.860
we're never going to see you again. Music, right before you go in the woods,

318
00:18:52.861 --> 00:18:57.720
just to fucking remind you of what you're walking into. Um, anyways,

319
00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:02.970
so, hey, um, the official, finally

320
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:05.393
the official hour, um,

321
00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:09.870
I'm allowed to finally say F is for family has been picked up for a second

322
00:19:09.871 --> 00:19:14.730
season. Um, I actually got the news back in January,

323
00:19:14.731 --> 00:19:17.550
but for whatever reason, the way Netflix promote stuff,

324
00:19:17.551 --> 00:19:21.390
which I would never question considering they're dominating the universe.

325
00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:25.830
They wanted to wait until last Friday. So it is now official. Uh,

326
00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:26.910
we are working right now.

327
00:19:26.911 --> 00:19:30.510
That's the stuff I've been alluding to that a I'd been working on and I'm,

328
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:37.320
uh, I wasn't going to say, ah, actually, this weekend I was writing an episode,

329
00:19:37.321 --> 00:19:39.780
so I missed all the fucking hockey.

330
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:44.820
I saw the series that I'm watching in St Louis First,

331
00:19:44.821 --> 00:19:48.060
the Black Hawks, and when I saw game two,

332
00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:51.930
I threw in the fucking towel. I was like, that's it.

333
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:55.980
You gave a game to the black cock. She cannot give a game to the hawks.

334
00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.130
You know, you had your foot on their fucking neck. He had the goal.

335
00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.890
The goal was fucking called back or whatever. I can't remember what happened.

336
00:20:01.891 --> 00:20:03.960
The goal got called back, right?

337
00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:08.190
Or Tara Cincos Gore got called back and then it's just like,

338
00:20:08.191 --> 00:20:12.910
that coach should have gone down the bench. No, let down. No let down. Right.

339
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.750
What do they do? They go out there. They're pissed terrorists.

340
00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.960
Sanko takes a stupid fucking penalty. The black cock score,

341
00:20:18.961 --> 00:20:21.780
the goal and they steal the fucking game and I was just like,

342
00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.250
and I was texting my buddy. I was like,

343
00:20:23.251 --> 00:20:27.540
that right there is why the Blackhawks win every fucking year in St Louis loses

344
00:20:27.541 --> 00:20:29.190
every fucking year. Whatever.

345
00:20:29.191 --> 00:20:34.191
The Blackhawks have that ability to remain calm when they're down St Louis for

346
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:37.950
my whole fucking life has never had that right.

347
00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.640
The rain half day set all of that shit. What are they doing?

348
00:20:41.641 --> 00:20:44.550
Game three I didn't see the game. I just looked at the highlights.

349
00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:49.480
You know they took three quick penalties in the first period.

350
00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.680
Chicago scored on the first, on the first one. If I was watching that game,

351
00:20:53.681 --> 00:20:55.150
I'd be like, here we go, here we go.

352
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:57.870
Chicago's going to win like the next for the next four to five and then I'm

353
00:20:57.871 --> 00:20:59.740
going to give them, they're even St Louis Seal right there.

354
00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:01.871
Fred St Louis came back,

355
00:21:01.871 --> 00:21:06.190
tied it up one one Chicago scores a goal in the second period, two to one.

356
00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:11.020
They're going into the third period in Chicago. This is always said,

357
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:16.570
you know, it's over for the blues. It's always been that way since,

358
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.850
I don't know how long it's been going on forever now.

359
00:21:18.851 --> 00:21:20.740
Like the Blackhawks were good my whole life. I mean shit,

360
00:21:20.741 --> 00:21:21.880
they went through a nice drug too.

361
00:21:21.881 --> 00:21:25.660
But like the new Blackhawks like this series is over and,

362
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:30.280
and fucking St Louis came back, tied it up to two and then went ahead three,

363
00:21:30.281 --> 00:21:31.780
two with like six minutes left.

364
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:37.000
And so a big congratulations to uh,

365
00:21:37.001 --> 00:21:39.550
the St Louis Blues, that huge fucking victory.

366
00:21:39.551 --> 00:21:42.510
And I can't wait to see the next game cause I know the black and [inaudible].

367
00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.490
Then I just got to go out like that. Right. You know,

368
00:21:45.491 --> 00:21:49.600
they're going to tie it up. They're going to go into St Louis. This might go a,

369
00:21:49.601 --> 00:21:53.020
I don't know, I'll make go seven. I'm open for seven. You know,

370
00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.990
I don't give a shit, but I'm, I'm pulling for St Louis. I think they,

371
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.280
my team over Dallas, just because, you know, Dallas was the north stars,

372
00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:05.440
right? They've only been Dallas stars for like, what, like 20 years. Eh,

373
00:22:05.441 --> 00:22:08.560
you know, I mean those people down, they, they a bunch of cowboys who's kid who,

374
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:12.570
you know, they getting plastic surgery, you know, they get their oil welded,

375
00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.760
wife's wearing too much makeup. I mean the different Dallas, the big D,

376
00:22:15.761 --> 00:22:20.440
it's a football town to football state. I love the fucking stars.

377
00:22:20.441 --> 00:22:24.150
I love the people on the stars. But like I also like they're fucking colors.

378
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:28.180
They got Celtic colors. I like to, I still like to stars, but you know, I think,

379
00:22:28.181 --> 00:22:31.270
I don't think it's time for the blues. They've been around since 67.

380
00:22:31.271 --> 00:22:33.580
They never want shit. So that's the team I'm pulling for.

381
00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:36.550
[inaudible] how come you not rooting for the Boston Bruins?

382
00:22:36.551 --> 00:22:40.750
Because we didn't make the playoffs. Um,

383
00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:46.630
but who would've thought a black cock sit down two games to one to the blues and

384
00:22:46.631 --> 00:22:50.950
the kinks are down o two to the San Jose shacks.

385
00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:56.830
Um, and actually a buddy of mine who writes onF is for family before this all

386
00:22:56.831 --> 00:22:59.440
started. He goes, I don't give a fuck. He goes,

387
00:22:59.441 --> 00:23:01.870
the Stanley Cup goes through Chicago or la.

388
00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.580
And that's what everybody was saying. Now, granted,

389
00:23:03.581 --> 00:23:07.210
we're only a couple of games in here and granted the kings are playing the

390
00:23:07.211 --> 00:23:09.670
sharks and, and you know,

391
00:23:09.671 --> 00:23:13.870
the sharks are like the San Diego chargers if they were skates, you know,

392
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:18.190
every year coming out having this wonderful fucking regular season,

393
00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:22.570
and then they go in the playoffs and they just shit the bed. So we'll see.

394
00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:26.290
They were up two games to none. Um, I think game four,

395
00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:30.490
if you haven't been watching is Tuesday night, uh, the Black Cox first to blue.

396
00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:35.230
So I will definitely be checking that out. And, um, I think that's it.

397
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.960
I think that's all I had on hockey, right? My Celtics,

398
00:23:37.961 --> 00:23:39.190
I watched some lose game one,

399
00:23:39.191 --> 00:23:42.790
but I'm just so psych they're in the fucking playoffs and are there young team,

400
00:23:42.791 --> 00:23:45.070
they should've won the game. They should've been able to close it out.

401
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.620
They didn't, but they hung in there. They got had that just a little young.

402
00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:54.830
They just got to learn how to fucking a filler, hopefully. You know what I mean?

403
00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.280
Oh, no, you don't. I'm hoping, I'm hoping that we get Kevin Duran.

404
00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:02.380
He would be a great fucking Celtic. Uh, whether he does that or not,

405
00:24:02.381 --> 00:24:06.210
I mean there's always someplace, uh, you know, what's this?

406
00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:10.700
This is the most crucial time. Yeah. And I,

407
00:24:10.701 --> 00:24:15.560
since I can remember for the Los Angeles Lakers where Colby just fucking

408
00:24:15.561 --> 00:24:20.180
retired. Okay. Their owner fucking died too. Now they got the son

409
00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:25.280
Fuck head that he is sorry, that had nothing to do with the Lakers.

410
00:24:25.281 --> 00:24:30.281
I was just quoting what movie was that and then your son Fuck head that he is

411
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:32.010
<v 3>okay.</v>

412
00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:36.800
<v 0>Left drivers less to romance. Um, yeah,</v>

413
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:38.240
they have to make something happen.

414
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:41.420
They got to throw their fucking money around. I Dunno,

415
00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.970
they don't have the coach, they don't have it. This could be for the first time.

416
00:24:43.971 --> 00:24:47.990
You realize that the Lakers have one more fucking championships since 1970 than

417
00:24:47.991 --> 00:24:51.590
any other team in any other major sport. Um,

418
00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:56.610
so I gotta respect what they've done more so than what anybody else has done

419
00:24:56.611 --> 00:24:57.444
prior to that.

420
00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:01.980
Because prior to that was the 23 skidoo years where the shit was in fucking

421
00:25:01.981 --> 00:25:06.270
basically black and white, you know, segregated leagues.

422
00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:09.720
The Stanley Cup was the size of a shot glass. You know,

423
00:25:09.721 --> 00:25:13.560
the Celtics used to win that would be like fucking five white guys against five

424
00:25:13.561 --> 00:25:16.890
white guys or maybe five against four white guys.

425
00:25:16.891 --> 00:25:19.260
And then Bill Russell was out there. You know what I mean? It's just,

426
00:25:19.261 --> 00:25:23.220
it's just a completely different time, you know? Um,

427
00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.800
I don't know. We'll see. So anyways, let me do a little bit of advertising here.

428
00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:31.220
Sorry. My brain is all over the place and I just still can't get over.

429
00:25:31.221 --> 00:25:36.020
How fucking people getting mauled 20 1620 fucking 16.

430
00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:37.873
I mean,

431
00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:42.630
to get mauled to death by a fucking tiger in 2016 it's,

432
00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:47.350
it's like, I don't know, I have to take it.

433
00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.690
I think the probability of getting run over by a stagecoach is,

434
00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:56.750
is just as probable. Like how many people get, you know what I to look that up,

435
00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.610
death by stagecoach is, you know, this can be somebody. Some wow.

436
00:26:01.611 --> 00:26:06.220
What show when Oklahoma fell off the chuckwagon. Okay. You know,

437
00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:11.320
it's going to be a guy to man killed under stage coach.

438
00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:17.840
Let's see if we get to see we get, did you mean man killed under stage coach?

439
00:26:17.841 --> 00:26:21.950
One word. I guess I did unsettling events.

440
00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:27.140
Stagecoach robberies, police id man killed in, stole crash,

441
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:32.450
fatal crash on stagecoach road.

442
00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.880
72 year old man was killed Sunday morning after a crash in

443
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:42.940
West Lake Lynn Township and the authority said a vehicle traveling northbound on

444
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:48.210
road. Ah, I guess it doesn't happen and whatever.

445
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.330
Somebody get kicked by a horse or something stupid.

446
00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:52.320
Something that should be happening during this time.

447
00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.740
But why can't you just admit that you are wrong? All right, I was wrong.

448
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.970
It's more probable to get mauled to death by a tiger. All right, let's uh,

449
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.930
let's do treat some of the advertising here. I do Ali Shave Club.

458
00:27:28.291 --> 00:27:30.120
What are you doing with your life?

459
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:34.470
One reason is because they deliver amazing razors right to your door for a third

460
00:27:34.471 --> 00:27:37.320
of the price of what the greedy razor corporations charge.

461
00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.720
That means when you join DSC,

462

you can afford to shave with a fresh blade anytime you want,

463
00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:47.910

Um, you get a first class shave when you use the executive blade without hurting

465
00:27:52.591 --> 00:27:57.080
your wallet. Another reason is Dr Carver's shave butter can't bleed.

466
00:27:57.170 --> 00:28:00.120
It's not carvings. I'm using it with the executive.

467
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.720
Makes the blade glide gently for the smoothest shave ever.

468
00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.540
Dr Carver's shave butter.

469
00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:09.330
Dr Caddies isn't your average shave cream.

470

Trunk Club,

478
00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.700
Trunk Club Trunk Club was started to solve a simple problem.

479
00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:45.300
Shopping for clothes in stores is overwhelming and inconvenient.

480
00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.420
It's not overwhelming. It's sucks. Who wants to do that?

481
00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:51.750
[inaudible] at least I don't. I don't want to fucking do that.

482
00:28:51.751 --> 00:28:53.850
So if I don't want to do that, then I assume everybody else doesn't.

483
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:55.230
Thank God for Trunk Club.

484
00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.560
Cause with trunk club you'll discover great clothes that are perfect for you.

We send you clothes only when you ask zero sign up or monthly fees.

491
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.560
Yeah, you can't ask for anything more than that. Look at that. You know,

492
00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:23.820
they'll send you a shirt whenever you want.

493
00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:29.120
We sent trunks refrain from saying boxes eludes to subscription service.

494
00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:33.240
I didn't. I said, what the fuck you wrote?

495
00:29:33.241 --> 00:29:36.710
Why would you put that sentence in the copy? You know, I'm going to read it. Uh,

496
00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:40.980
don't talk about price. Talk about quality. Hey,

497
00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:43.650
don't tell me what the fuck to do. I'm reading. Why don't you just write,

498
00:29:43.651 --> 00:29:45.930
what the fuck you want me to read? You assholes.

499
00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:50.100
How did this go from copy to them wagging their finger at me?

500
00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:54.810
I'll talk about whatever the fuck I want to talk about. You know,

501
00:29:54.811 --> 00:29:57.060
if you want to go to the fucking mall, this is the great thing. Okay?

502
00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:00.510
They gotta, I mean, I can paraphrase all this. They have an expert stylist.

503
00:30:00.511 --> 00:30:01.344
In other words,

504
00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:04.530
someone who eventually will actually get paid at decent amount of money to pick

505
00:30:04.531 --> 00:30:06.990
out these clothes. But right now they're new to the business.

506
00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:11.280
So take advantage of their talents while they still work for trunk club. Okay?

507
00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:15.150
You tell them your basic styles. I like concert tee shirts and flip flops,

508
00:30:15.151 --> 00:30:17.790
whatever your fucking deal is. And then they'll get somebody to go out.

509
00:30:17.791 --> 00:30:20.760
They pull a bunch of shit, they stick it in the trunk, they send it to you,

510
00:30:20.761 --> 00:30:23.040
you keep what you want, you take everything else you don't want.

511
00:30:23.041 --> 00:30:25.950
You throw it back in the fucking trunk and you send it back to them and that's

512
00:30:25.951 --> 00:30:28.920
it. And they don't send you any more shit until you ask them to consider down a

513
00:30:28.921 --> 00:30:32.310
subscription service. All right. If you'd like to take advantage of this,

514
00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:35.700
go to fucking wherever the hell it is. Trunk Club

515
00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:42.580
please. No mention of competitors. I don't even understand this. There's,

516
00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:47.560
this is like a, this was more a letter giving me shit for what I've been doing.

517
00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:50.440
<v 3>Okay.</v>

518
00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:50.611
<v 0>All right.</v>

519
00:30:50.611 --> 00:30:54.750
I'm going to say it's trunk club.com/birth that's what I would go with a MVMT

520
00:30:54.751 --> 00:30:56.790
watches. You know,

521
00:30:56.910 --> 00:31:00.030
it's been a few weeks now since I cracked open these sharp looking, Eh,

522
00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:04.810
Jesus Christ. Why do they keep doing this to me?

523
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:06.870
Why do they keep they,

524
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:10.690
they probably sent this copy out to every person with the podcast and everybody

525
00:31:10.691 --> 00:31:11.021
goes, you know,

526
00:31:11.021 --> 00:31:14.230
it's been a few weeks since I cracked open these sharp looking movement.

527
00:31:14.231 --> 00:31:16.990
Watch boxes. I did. I saw them. They're fucking great.

528
00:31:16.991 --> 00:31:18.910
They look like expensive watches and you know,

529
00:31:18.911 --> 00:31:21.310
but I am a fucking 48 year old man,

530
00:31:21.311 --> 00:31:23.680
so I have an expensive watch and I'm going to continue wearing that.

531
00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.670
If I was in my twenties or my early thirties, if I had gone through a divorce,

532
00:31:27.671 --> 00:31:29.650
these are the fucking watch for you, okay?

533
00:31:29.651 --> 00:31:34.120
So you can still attract some expensive tail. All right. Without, you know,

534
00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:37.030
you'll still have money to buy her a drink. That's basically it. All right.

535
00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:40.360
If you haven't a chance to experience how movement watch fits around your wrist,

536
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:43.630
this is the chance movement. Watch you start it. Just $95.

537
00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.410
See when movement cut out the middleman with the huge big bank brand markups,

538
00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:52.270
the price of a watch. Finally got affordable. Imagine that. Exclamation point.

539
00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:57.010
A watch with the department store quality for a fraction of the price. Okay,

540
00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:00.610
so if you want one of those things, go to MVMT. Um,

00:34:59.361 --> 00:35:03.830
Nashville's up two games to none of a fucking anime. Oh, this sucks. Bad.

587
00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:07.130
Fucking the kings and the ducks are going to get knocked out. No playoff hockey,

588
00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:11.720
bro. Fucking freckles out here. There. Dallas is up two games to none.

589
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:13.543
Um,

590
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:17.360
I'm completely in the dark with all of this bullshit cause I'm going to be in a

591
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:20.210
writers room. I'm in the writer's room for the next olds.

592
00:35:20.211 --> 00:35:24.140
18 weeks total to write the uh, the second season. And believe it or not,

593
00:35:24.141 --> 00:35:26.390
I'm actually finding that I love being in the writers room.

594
00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:31.190
I thought it was something that I was not going to enjoy because of the freedom

595
00:35:31.191 --> 00:35:32.360
that I has as a comedian,

596
00:35:32.361 --> 00:35:35.210
but it turns out I really like writing scripts and I like writing dialogue and

597
00:35:35.211 --> 00:35:37.200
all of that Shit and, uh,

598
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:40.440
we're having a great time and I think you guys hopefully are gonna enjoy it.

599
00:35:40.441 --> 00:35:43.260
So now your next question should be built. How many episodes did they give you?

600
00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:47.850
10, 10 episodes for, um, season two.

601
00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:52.050
And when is it going to be at? When is it going to come out? Probably uh,

602
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:57.210
this time next year. It's animation. That's how long it takes. Um,

603
00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:00.930
I think they're saying may of next year is when it comes out, unfortunately.

604
00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.120
But uh, that's how it works. But it's going to be worth the wait.

605
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:06.570
But I hope it now that we're kind of going, that once we do this,

606
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:09.750
when we can immediately go into season three, I don't know how it fucking works.

607
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:11.790
I guess that wouldn't make sense.

608
00:36:11.791 --> 00:36:13.500
They got to see how many people watch season two?

609
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:15.783
<v 1>I don't know.</v>

610
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:18.650
<v 0>I think by the time we finished season five, I'll be 60.</v>

611
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:22.340
That's what I'm guessing. All right, let's do some questions here for the week.

612
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:27.920
Uh, come to Prague, come to Prague. Um, I'd like to go to pro.

613
00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:32.420
Hey Billy. Wingnut just so you know, we started using your songs at circle time.

614
00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:37.730
Circle time is every morning at nine 15 after yoga. It is, it is.

615
00:36:37.731 --> 00:36:42.530
Songs in words and learning English. All the kids singing our check kids,

616
00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:44.660
please come to Prague.

617
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:46.800
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

618
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.120
<v 0>the fuck is circle time.</v>

619
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:49.373
<v 1>Okay.</v>

620
00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:53.490
<v 0>Sounds oddly filthy. Uh, circle time.</v>

621
00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:57.800
<v 1>Prague,</v>

622
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:02.530
<v 0>Prague, link, linguistics circle homepage.</v>

623
00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:10.250
The fuck. I don't, I ain't know what that means. I can't tell you this.

624
00:37:10.251 --> 00:37:14.660
So I've stuck with the French have 51 fucking days and now it's starting to just

625
00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:19.460
be in my head. I still can't speak it. Well, if somebody's speaking it, I,

626
00:37:19.461 --> 00:37:23.630
I pick out a few words, but like reading it, I'm crushing it. Reading.

627
00:37:23.631 --> 00:37:27.980
I read the, I transcribed this whole fucking article about the pope saying that,

628
00:37:27.981 --> 00:37:31.790
you know, as much as the Catholic church has been against condoms,

629
00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:35.630
there are certain instances, you know,

630
00:37:35.631 --> 00:37:40.520
that they don't think it's bad to use them. Um, you know, especially preventing,

631
00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:45.310
um, the spread of HIV, aids, whatever, you know,

632
00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:49.540
and they said something about, you know, unprotected sex with male prostitutes.

633
00:37:49.541 --> 00:37:50.770
I think that that's what it said.

634
00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.530
I couldn't tell if it was that or men going to prostitutes.

635
00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:58.930
I couldn't quite get the translation. So, uh, I'm sticking with it. And um,

636
00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:02.800
cause on dual lingo too, if you, if you do a hundred days in a row,

637
00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:05.740
they give you a couple of trinkets, whatever the fuck that means. So I'm, I'm,

638
00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:09.220
I'm over the hump of Brian Downhill now. And um,

639
00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.910
I dunno, I just think I'm just, I'm really doing it.

640
00:38:12.911 --> 00:38:15.730
Not only did I want to learn how to do it, but I just think it's funny.

641
00:38:15.731 --> 00:38:20.731
If someone is dumb as me becomes completely fluent in French and then that gives

642
00:38:21.071 --> 00:38:25.690
me the opportunity to go to France or go to Montreal and act like the dumb

643
00:38:25.691 --> 00:38:29.110
American and then listen to what they're saying about me and then just fucking

644
00:38:29.111 --> 00:38:32.680
hit them over the head with some fucking, I can't say perfect French,

645
00:38:32.681 --> 00:38:36.160
but like fluent French. Just watch their fucking,

646
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:39.190
their little fucking pocket squares get all fucking in a bunch.

647
00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:43.150
That's why I'm doing it. I'm doing it. I was going to take,

648
00:38:43.151 --> 00:38:44.830
I don't know how long it's going to take me. I just,

649
00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:49.000
I want to have that moment just once in my life where I could just sit there and

650
00:38:49.001 --> 00:38:51.850
have somebody trashing me in a different language and they don't know that I can

651
00:38:51.851 --> 00:38:52.420
hear everything.

652
00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:55.090
I understand everything that they're saying just so I can look at them and then

653
00:38:55.091 --> 00:38:57.700
fucking come back and I'm like, GVD buddy. They basically saying like,

654
00:38:57.750 --> 00:39:01.390
I knew exactly what the fuck did you said? Right. Um, all right. Sorry.

655
00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:05.560
Most people want to learn it so they can communicate. Not me, not me.

656
00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.050
I want to do it so I can have an argument on the other side of the world.

657
00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:12.790
What does that say about me? Alright, a cooking question. Dear Billy,

658
00:39:12.791 --> 00:39:14.260
the butter basting bitch.

659
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.720
<v 1>Ah, that was</v>

660
00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:24.090
<v 0>a, Oh, see, there you go. There you go. Something original.</v>

661
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:27.740
I liked that made fun of my cooking. You kept the alliteration going.

662
00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:31.980
You called me a bitch in the end of it. I give that one four stars. Four stars.

663
00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:36.930
All right. Uh, anyways, uh, I am a huge fan and I blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

664
00:39:36.931 --> 00:39:40.200
Yada, Yada, Yada. My question is, thank you for blowing through all that.

665
00:39:40.201 --> 00:39:43.560
My question is, you used to talk about cooking all of the time,

666
00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:48.090
but now you rarely do what gives. Did you stop cooking? Uh, if not,

667
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:50.880
what have you made lately? Please make more cooking videos.

668
00:39:50.881 --> 00:39:55.080
Like the pie crust one you made. I need something new to jerk off to.

669
00:39:55.081 --> 00:39:59.790
Thanks and go fuck yourself. Um, yeah, I haven't been cooking. I've, um,

670
00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:01.680
when I, uh,

671
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:06.330
when we write these episodes for afters for family,

672
00:40:06.331 --> 00:40:09.660
I'm so fucking relieved I can finally talk about this shit. Um,

673
00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:14.070
it consumes my life. I mean, I basically, I go in at 10 30 every morning.

674
00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:16.260
There's usually some other bullshit I have to do.

675
00:40:16.261 --> 00:40:20.550
So I'm usually in there by 10 in the morning and then we fucking right all day

676
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:25.050
til about seven. And by the end of it, I just come home.

677
00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:29.250
I pull out a scotch, I stare at the wall, I fall asleep,

678
00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:33.450
my dog wakes me up at seven. I take her for a walk,

679
00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:35.520
I come home, I have breakfast,

680
00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:38.520
I try to bang out a podcast and maybe do a little bit of French,

681
00:40:38.521 --> 00:40:42.360
and then I go right back to work. So I don't have time to fucking do anything.

682
00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:46.810
Um, you know, I should do, I should start using blue apron. You know,

683
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:50.970
I saw Mark Marin, he actually cooked a meal on it. It looked fucking delicious.

684
00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:56.360
Um, but I, uh, I should really start doing something like that because I have,

685
00:40:56.510 --> 00:41:00.540
I've been eating like a sort of in a good way, in sort of bad way.

686
00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:05.540
I had the best mother fucking Burger I've ever had in Los Angeles and that is

687
00:41:06.301 --> 00:41:10.320
saying something and if you'd like to know where to go the next time you see me

688
00:41:10.321 --> 00:41:13.650
when you're in Los Angeles, you ask me. I will tell you where the places,

689
00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:18.270
but I'm not saying it on a podcast because I hate when Anthony Bordain does that

690
00:41:18.271 --> 00:41:22.470
and this is cool fucking spot. And then he makes it, he makes it fucking,

691
00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.600
you know, every Tom,

692
00:41:24.601 --> 00:41:27.560
Dick and Harry's got to go out there and then it comes on a new management.

693
00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:29.880
The whole thing gets fucked up. So,

694
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:33.560
or even if I'm out on the road from on the road,

695
00:41:33.561 --> 00:41:36.890
just yell it out during my show. You Hey bell with that good burger spot.

696
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:38.780
You in La, you know, you bought a ticket, I'll tell you.

697
00:41:38.781 --> 00:41:43.280
Then he listened to this podcast for free. You don't get the information.

698
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:46.940
Oh, is it delicious? The fries were okay. The Soto was, you know,

699
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:51.680
they had the Mexican fucking coke in the, a fan to orange with the real sugar.

700
00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:56.270
Incredible credible tasting. That's what's where this country is right now.

701
00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:00.410
Coca-Cola is made better in Mexico than it is in the United States.

702
00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.930
What does that say about us? You know, and it's Donald Trump,

703
00:42:02.931 --> 00:42:07.280
Hillary Clinton or fucking Bernie Sanders even approach that at any point during

704
00:42:07.281 --> 00:42:11.420
the this, this campaign they might have. Lord knows I'm not watching.

705
00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:15.680
All right. So, um, no where I last left,

706
00:42:15.681 --> 00:42:19.160
I was trying to learn how to make Gnocchi and I failed miserably.

707
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:23.150
And my own wife, the woman who's supposed to love me unconditionally,

708
00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:27.870
sickness and health in good times and in bad. And when I made Gnocchi,

709
00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.890
it was a bad time. And what did she do? Did she stick by me?

710
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:35.270
Did she say it's okay and rubbed my head? Nope. You know what she said?

711
00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:39.230
She leaned over and she goes, hey. And I was like, what? She got right me here?

712
00:42:39.231 --> 00:42:44.210
And she goes, you shouldn't make pasta anymore. She said,

713
00:42:44.211 --> 00:42:47.120
you shouldn't make pasta anymore. You know,

714
00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:50.460
maybe she knows me well enough to know that it's,

715
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:53.630
when somebody says something like that to me, that just makes me go, all right,

716
00:42:53.631 --> 00:42:57.170
I'm going to fucking master this shit. You know? I mean, it's not like,

717
00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:59.450
you know, if somebody says you shouldn't sing anymore,

718
00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:03.710
well you shouldn't dance anymore. I maybe I understand that. I mean, I fucking,

719
00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:06.770
there's just certain things, but I mean, cooking is just one of those things.

720
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.040
Like, you just do it. You'll, you can learn how to do it.

721
00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:13.760
Like all these fucking people on the food network, they don't have any,

722
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:16.340
they don't have any talent. It's just, they just, you know,

723
00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.710
they didn't have any friends and they just fucking, you know,

724
00:43:18.711 --> 00:43:23.630
they started off making cereal and then they just kept progressing. I'm kidding.

725
00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:25.970
I know. It's an art form. All right. Fucking relax. Okay.

726
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.560
Put your apron back on and go fucking make a souffle. All right. So, um, yeah,

727
00:43:30.561 --> 00:43:32.900
so I'm kind of stuck on that. But the next time I go to New York,

728
00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:37.730
I met somebody. Um, I met somebody, it's very special.

729
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.800
I met somebody in New York, uh,

730
00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:45.260
a chef at this Italian restaurant and he told me, he's like the real deal,

731
00:43:45.261 --> 00:43:48.050
like right off the boats and anytime he come to New York he goes,

732
00:43:48.051 --> 00:43:50.470
I'll show you how to make pasta from scratch, blah blah blah.

733
00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:54.660
Cause I took a pasta making class and uh, uh,

734
00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:57.620
they were supposed to then email a bunch of shit to help you out and they never

735
00:43:57.621 --> 00:43:58.610
had any follow through.

736
00:43:58.611 --> 00:44:00.830
And then I waited too long to try it again and I finally,

737
00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:04.580
I kind of forgot some of the tricks. So, um,

738
00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.490
that's where I'm at with the cooking thing.

739
00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:09.800
And as far as making like the cooking videos,

740
00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:11.720
I did the pie crust thing cause that was another thing.

741
00:44:11.721 --> 00:44:12.471
I just thought it was funny.

742
00:44:12.471 --> 00:44:14.790
Someone like me knows how to do something like that, but like I,

743
00:44:14.791 --> 00:44:16.790
I can't cook better than most of the people out there,

744
00:44:16.791 --> 00:44:19.690
so I don't understand the point of it. Um, maybe if I,

745
00:44:19.691 --> 00:44:22.700
if I learned how to make Gnocchi, I'll teach you guys how to do it,

746
00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:27.020
but I have to do it for a long time before I'll feel like confident enough to

747
00:44:27.021 --> 00:44:29.990
make a video. Maybe if I fuck it up, it'll be funny. I had no idea. All right,

748
00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:33.480
let's, let's keep reading here, shall we? Okay. All right. Garden.

749
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:36.180
We do, we top soil.

750
00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:40.470
One of my favorite things you used to talk about was your garden and your steps

751
00:44:40.471 --> 00:44:41.850
towards getting off the grid.

752
00:44:41.851 --> 00:44:45.600
My question is do you still have a garden and are you still taking steps to get

753
00:44:45.601 --> 00:44:50.490
off yourself off the grid? Um, ah, that,

754
00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:55.730
I mean I have a lemon and a lime tree so I'll never get scurvy.

755
00:44:57.490 --> 00:44:58.323
<v 3>Um,</v>

756
00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:00.990
<v 0>no, I just,</v>

757
00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:04.830
the level of like commitment that that takes and you have to have like a fucking

758
00:45:04.831 --> 00:45:07.260
henhouse and shit, you know,

759
00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:11.160
I don't have time to become Mr. Green jeans and then what do I have to have a

760
00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:15.400
Henhouse guy? I have to have the chicken guy. You know what I mean?

761
00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:20.260
It's like as you accumulate shit, then you have to get the something guy,

762
00:45:20.290 --> 00:45:24.820
right? Yeah. You buy a fucking house, you immediately, he,

763
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:29.140
you'd have a plumber. You got to have a fucking electrician, you know,

764
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:31.900
you got to have a, basically a handyman. Okay. Then what?

765
00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:32.711
Then you have a garden.

766
00:45:32.711 --> 00:45:35.800
Then you got to have a fucking landscaper gardening guy because you're too busy

767
00:45:35.801 --> 00:45:39.700
doing whatever you do for a fucking career, a living. You get a pool,

768
00:45:39.701 --> 00:45:43.180
you need the pool guy, you know, you get a dog,

769
00:45:43.181 --> 00:45:46.180
you got the fucking dog guy, the vet guy, all of that shit.

770
00:45:46.181 --> 00:45:49.100
It's just more money flying out of your fucking wallet. And I'm

771
00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:50.803
<v 3>okay.</v>

772
00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:55.220
<v 0>I am very envious of people that have their own gardens and that type of shit.</v>

773
00:45:55.221 --> 00:45:58.700
But, uh, I, you know, I have my little piece of fucking

774
00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:04.210
La out here, which is not much. We all live on top,

775
00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:07.030
which I'm literally looking out my window right now and I see the roof of the

776
00:46:07.031 --> 00:46:11.710
person's house next to me. That's just basically how it works,

777
00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.180
you know? And I look out the back,

778
00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:15.970
I look out my back window and I see the apartment buildings,

779
00:46:15.971 --> 00:46:18.340
the back of the apartment buildings from the street over.

780
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:22.750
There's really not a place to plant some turnips, although I wish there was.

781
00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:26.020
And I don't think I could really get away with like having fucking chickens and

782
00:46:26.021 --> 00:46:29.340
shit. Some rooster crowing every morning cause uh,

783
00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:33.310
the noise ordinance is noise is not supposed to leave your property.

784
00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:35.950
Although most people the second they turn on their stereo,

785
00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:39.490
they break that fucking thing. But um, I would love to do it.

786
00:46:39.491 --> 00:46:44.110
I'd love to get solar panels and be off the grid, but you really can't be,

787
00:46:44.111 --> 00:46:47.200
you still have to give them a little bit of money. I forget.

788
00:46:47.201 --> 00:46:49.660
I don't know how it works, but they have some, so I know how it works.

789
00:46:49.661 --> 00:46:52.780
The president makes 400 grand a year, so he, they go, yes, listen, fuck,

790
00:46:52.781 --> 00:46:56.860
oh you want the second term, make this a law. We said break it a lot, right?

791
00:46:56.861 --> 00:46:57.371
Next thing you know,

792
00:46:57.371 --> 00:47:00.070
it's a law because there's people live in the middle of nowhere.

793
00:47:00.071 --> 00:47:01.930
The electric company finds them. And then they like,

794
00:47:01.931 --> 00:47:06.010
they show them and like you have to give us money every month, which is,

795
00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:09.250
I just don't understand how that is.

796
00:47:09.251 --> 00:47:13.600
Legal debt goes around so many things that this country is allegedly about.

797
00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:18.880
If someone would force you, I understand taxes. So like, yeah dude,

798
00:47:18.881 --> 00:47:21.250
you want to live here? You got to kick in for the puddles. I get that.

799
00:47:21.251 --> 00:47:25.150
But you have to buy power from this fucking no, don't fuck off.

800
00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:28.810
But that's not how it works. It's not our works. If you guys know how to do it,

801
00:47:28.811 --> 00:47:30.160
if you how to get off the grid,

802
00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:34.150
by all means not cause I want to be off the grid now cause I give a fuck that I

803
00:47:34.151 --> 00:47:37.750
give money to the power companies. I just, you know, when the shit hits the fan,

804
00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:41.440
I would like to be that beacon of light that all the zombies run to right.

805
00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:49.150
He's still got a fletch. Great. Um, alright girlfriends. Wait.

806
00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:54.070
Oh Jesus. Here we go. Dear Bill, I'm a 21 year old guy. My girlfriend is 20.

807
00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:55.930
We've been taped.

808
00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:59.920
We've been talking for about six months now and we just recently decided to make

809
00:47:59.921 --> 00:48:04.600
it official. Now here's the part where I need your expert advice. Old Jesus.

810
00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:08.110
How should I go about telling her? I think she needs to lose weight.

811
00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:11.920
She's not a fat ass by no means, but she could lose a few pounds.

812
00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:15.820
Now I sound now I sound like an ass. I know. I sound like an Asshole,

813
00:48:15.821 --> 00:48:19.440
I think is what he's supposed to say. Yeah, I know he sound like an asshole,

814
00:48:19.441 --> 00:48:24.120
but I care about her and want to see her be more confident. Thanks for the help.

815
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:26.820
I enjoyed the show in Long Beach. Um,

816
00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:33.360
I didn't say she could lose it there. There is no way a,

817
00:48:33.361 --> 00:48:38.361
what I would do is I would get yourself in great shape and start getting her

818
00:48:38.681 --> 00:48:40.930
into hiking with you and like, uh, you know,

819
00:48:40.931 --> 00:48:44.590
but you can't make somebody work out. You can't make somebody get in shape.

820
00:48:44.591 --> 00:48:48.460
They either want to do it or they don't. And um,

821
00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:49.950
<v 3>okay.</v>

822
00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:52.860
<v 0>You know, that's like a major, major, major fucking,</v>

823
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:57.630
you know, you tell telling a woman she needs to lose a few pounds.

824
00:48:57.631 --> 00:49:01.410
It's like that, like that's the female equivalent of them saying to you like,

825
00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:02.940
you know, your Dick could be a little

826
00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:04.383
<v 1>bigger.</v>

827
00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:09.010
<v 0>It's devastating. Um,</v>

828
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:14.350
I wouldn't say it to her, but, uh, you know, you also got to think, you know,

829
00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:18.760
at 20th they could lose if they're already getting out of shape at 20 years of

830
00:49:18.761 --> 00:49:22.400
age, you know, then what?

831
00:49:22.401 --> 00:49:25.130
Then they have a couple of kids that going to be a fucking house. I mean,

832
00:49:25.131 --> 00:49:26.120
that's just something you get,

833
00:49:26.121 --> 00:49:30.170
you gotta be honest about if someone doesn't take care of themselves,

834
00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:33.170
you know, and this works both ways too, ladies.

835
00:49:33.171 --> 00:49:35.960
Like if you're with some guy and he's in his twenties and he's sitting there and

836
00:49:35.961 --> 00:49:40.760
he's already getting man tits, it's, it's not going to get better. And,

837
00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:45.320
uh, you got to sit there and, and really just be like, how much do I, uh,

838
00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:46.251
love this person?

839
00:49:46.251 --> 00:49:49.160
Because I'm going to watch them slowly eat themselves to death.

840
00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:53.570
Cause that's what you're doing. And unfortunately, um,

841
00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:56.270
you chicken start coming home to roost in your forties,

842
00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:57.830
whatever the fuck you did,

843
00:49:58.490 --> 00:50:02.810
whenever you started to go off the rails at 16 or 17 with drinking, drugging,

844
00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:03.770
eating, or whatever,

845
00:50:03.771 --> 00:50:08.630
right around when you get to your forties is when the first like,

846
00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:13.240
like God damn that happened to him. I thought that was some old man shit.

847
00:50:13.241 --> 00:50:14.860
And you're like, oh wait, we're in our forties,

848
00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:17.170
because you'll still feel like you're in your 20s. So,

849
00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:19.723
<v 1>um,</v>

850
00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:23.140
<v 0>I dunno, I would go a positive route.</v>

851
00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:27.110
I would just tell her how I would tell her. Uh, Oh,

852
00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:29.660
you tell her how good she looked at me. That's just fucking, I don't,

853
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:32.600
there's no way to do it that that is, there's no,

854
00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:37.220
that's a fortress in, there's no door in. You know what I mean?

855
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:39.370
There's no door in on that one. You just have to just,

856
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:42.080
if you're going to say it, if he just fucking say it,

857
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:47.030
then you're really risking like, uh, hurting her really bad.

858
00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:49.780
<v 1>You know what I mean? Um,</v>

859
00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:53.430
<v 0>and who wants to do it? You don't, you don't want to fucking do that, you know?</v>

860
00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:55.860
I wonder if women ever feel that way about guys.

861
00:50:55.861 --> 00:50:57.840
Like if there's anything like this, like, you know what?

862
00:50:57.841 --> 00:51:01.170
You just can't say that to a guy because that will hurt them too much.

863
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:05.910
Do they ever think shit like that? I think shit like that with women.

864
00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:08.670
This just certain things you just, you just don't fucking say like,

865
00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:13.230
what is all I'm going to do is hurt her in ruiner for the next person when she

866
00:51:13.231 --> 00:51:17.010
fucking eventually comes to her senses and dumps me. Um,

867
00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:20.190
and then you'll be that, you know what this guy said to me one time,

868
00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:24.370
<v 1>we were going into weapons</v>

869
00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:31.590
<v 0>and I ordered a double cheeseburger. Eddie interrupted. He said, no, no, no.</v>

870
00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:34.170
She wants the single,

871
00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:37.030
<v 1>you don't being that guy.</v>

872
00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:42.920
<v 0>No, I dunno. I Dunno what to tell you. I can't tell you this.</v>

873
00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:46.060
So I feel like when you are, you know,

874
00:51:46.061 --> 00:51:48.790
aside from just owning it to yourself to try to stay in shape,

875
00:51:48.791 --> 00:51:50.160
when you're in a relationship with someone,

876
00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:55.210
to just fucking let yourself go and just become a fad, fuck. And you know,

877
00:51:56.420 --> 00:52:00.400
just not have the consideration that somebody is sort of obligated to have sex

878
00:52:00.401 --> 00:52:04.300
with you to just try and remotely keep yourself looking halfway decent.

879
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:07.720
It's really a selfish fucking thing, you know?

880
00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:10.480
But we live in the age of, um,

881
00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:15.370
a lot of times the victim is, is the, is not, is,

882
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:17.940
is considered like the antagonizer.

883
00:52:19.330 --> 00:52:20.163
<v 1>You know what I mean?</v>

884
00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.590
<v 0>I would never do that to me.</v>

885
00:52:22.591 --> 00:52:25.170
I would never just fucking put on a a hundred fucking pounds,

886
00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:30.360
just come waddling into the fucking bedroom, you know,

887
00:52:30.690 --> 00:52:32.310
rollover on top of her.

888
00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:36.240
Since she would be completely grossed out in every woman listening to this,

889
00:52:36.241 --> 00:52:37.680
probably just went, Eh,

890
00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:41.850
picture that me a 100 pounds heavier,

891
00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:46.980
naked sweating on my upper lip crawling into fucking bed. Yeah,

892
00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:51.420
exactly. Isn't that disgusting? Well that, that's a two way street sweetheart.

893
00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:55.740
You know, we don't want to see you come fucking waddling into the room.

894
00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:58.860
You know, you hips taken out the fucking door jam. You know what I mean?

895
00:52:58.890 --> 00:53:03.240
It's just, it's not a, it's not fair to either person.

896
00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:08.180
Yeah. When you really look at it and nobody understands that more than gay guys.

897
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:13.990
I would say that gay guys have the most respect for the fact that someone's

898
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:15.710
going to hook up with them. You know what I mean?

899
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:21.080
I wonder if they had pound for pound in the best fucking shape than anybody else

900
00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:26.820
or is it because they're trying to attract guys and they know guys are,

901
00:53:26.821 --> 00:53:30.060
I can't even say that shallow cause they always say that guys is shallow when it

902
00:53:30.061 --> 00:53:33.120
comes to that. We are, but like you fucking hold up something shiny.

903
00:53:33.121 --> 00:53:36.360
A woman's like, hey what that, you know, they're just as bad. Right?

904
00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:42.450
Oh Christ. I'm all over the map. All right. On trial for a joke. All right,

905
00:53:42.451 --> 00:53:43.170
Bill,

906
00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:47.760
did you hear about the entertainer who might get prosecuted for his poem that

907
00:53:47.761 --> 00:53:51.770
trashed ahead of State? Uh, what country a,

908
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:55.950
they're calling him a comic, but I think maybe Europe's version of a comic,

909
00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:59.580
not the traditional standup. Well, it depends on where you go. In Europe.

910
00:53:59.581 --> 00:54:04.530
Europe is a, uh, you know, it's not the biggest continent, but that's,

911
00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:08.220
it's a long fucking trip from Paris over to Moscow. I think.

912
00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:09.970
Moscow's technically still in Europe, isn't it?

913
00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:14.980
I know the west coast of Russia now you start getting into eastern Europe dude.

914
00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:16.693
And you know,

915
00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:20.640
I mean they still have vampires out there so you can only imagine how that would

916
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:23.430
affect the artist standup comedy. I don't know what I'm talking about.

917
00:54:23.431 --> 00:54:23.820
All right.

918
00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:28.820
And Angela Merkel gave the go ahead to the Turkish prime minister to make an

919
00:54:30.391 --> 00:54:31.224
inquiry,

920
00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:35.700
which basically means put on trial all because of a stupid poem.

921
00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:38.820
Thoughts. I hate when people do that.

922
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:43.770
Thoughts talk about that. Um, yeah.

923
00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:47.220
Lace a bunch of countries that are just getting their first taste of standup

924
00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:51.690
comic comedy and they are going through their Lenny Bruce years.

925
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:56.760
Um, which is what happens that happened. Lenny Bruce, he was put on trial,

926
00:54:56.761 --> 00:54:59.670
he was arrested for obscenity and all of that type of stuff.

927
00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:01.170
This is what happens.

928
00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:06.710
And once the government realizes that it's just jokes and that a standup comic

929
00:55:08.911 --> 00:55:13.830
doing an hour of jokes is not going to cause a revolution and that they can

930
00:55:13.831 --> 00:55:18.831
relax and continue to fuck over their own countrymen and sleep well at night

931
00:55:19.051 --> 00:55:22.780
doing it, then they usually ease up on it. And, uh,

932
00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:27.210
people are allowed to, um, you know, do standup comedy.

933
00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:31.410
Like what's funny now is what's happening is there's this new, you know,

934
00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:35.670
sort of, I dunno what you would call it, Lenny Bruce time,

935
00:55:35.671 --> 00:55:38.400
but it's just more through people in the crowd though.

936
00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:41.250
But it's not the government anymore, so it's really no big deal. It's just,

937
00:55:41.251 --> 00:55:46.050
you know, people with agendas and websites and shit like that, you know,

938
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:49.680
clickbait, clickbait people. Right. All right.

939
00:55:49.681 --> 00:55:54.300
Boyfriend wants to have sex with other girls. Um,

940
00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:58.200
I want, if there's a way to basically support that person, Angela Merkel,

941
00:55:58.201 --> 00:56:01.560
can I help pay for the lawyer kick in, you know,

942
00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:06.270
all the comics around the world take four can throw 20 bucks at it and they

943
00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:10.260
could tie it up in the Turkish courts. Can that happen? I don't fucking know.

944
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:11.550
Oh, you know what, I'm going to look that up.

945
00:56:11.551 --> 00:56:14.160
I'm glad you brought that to my attention. I know that there was some,

946
00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:15.450
somebody in Canada,

947
00:56:15.451 --> 00:56:18.240
the same thing happen and it's one of those things where it's like you want to

948
00:56:18.241 --> 00:56:18.841
talk about it,

949
00:56:18.841 --> 00:56:23.380
but you also don't want to feed that fucking beast and give it all,

950
00:56:23.381 --> 00:56:26.230
all types of notoriety. But then you're also going,

951
00:56:26.231 --> 00:56:28.180
well that's a fellow comic going through that Shit.

952
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:33.390
There's gotta be a way in a stealth way to hopefully put that fire up.

953
00:56:34.210 --> 00:56:37.270
Um, you know, when I was in India, the podcast I did, the guys over there,

954
00:56:37.271 --> 00:56:39.130
they were going through some shit because they had a room,

955
00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:41.440
they did a roast and everything was fine.

956
00:56:41.441 --> 00:56:44.680
Everybody laughed and then they put it up on youtube and you know,

957
00:56:44.681 --> 00:56:48.180
there's like 40 million different religions there and somebody complained and

958
00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:50.593
<v 1>you know,</v>

959
00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:55.830
<v 0>they were in a, definitely a a, what's the word I should use? They were in a,</v>

960
00:56:55.831 --> 00:56:59.660
they weren't a situation over there when I, you know, which is hilarious.

961
00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:01.120
Then I'm fucking walking down the street with them.

962
00:57:03.590 --> 00:57:04.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

963
00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:06.980
<v 0>Like, how am I going to get fucking arrested because I'm with you guys.</v>

964
00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:12.020
You know what's fucked up? I only spent 24 hours in India and I already miss it.

965
00:57:12.021 --> 00:57:13.070
I really want to go back.

966
00:57:13.071 --> 00:57:16.730
I had such a good time in the 24 hours despite the fact I had to get a piece of

967
00:57:16.731 --> 00:57:19.340
paper to leave, which was really fucking creepy. But um,

968
00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:21.200
<v 1>okay.</v>

969
00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:23.120
<v 0>I know it was weird man. I I didn't,</v>

970
00:57:23.121 --> 00:57:25.950
I didn't know what I was thought I was gonna think when I went there. But I,

971
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.480
I felt an odd connection when I went there. Um,

972
00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:33.290
which is one of the coolest things when you travel. Like when you go,

973
00:57:33.291 --> 00:57:35.660
every place you go to, it's going to be great when you actually go to a place.

974
00:57:35.661 --> 00:57:40.330
Like why is this fucking place feeling like a like feeling like Whoa,

975
00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:40.941
like a home.

976
00:57:40.941 --> 00:57:45.320
Like I relate to these people more so than a lot of countries I've been to.

977
00:57:45.321 --> 00:57:46.250
I was over there going like,

978
00:57:46.251 --> 00:57:48.920
Oh that guy reminds me of rich foss maybe cause I hung out with a bunch of

979
00:57:48.921 --> 00:57:53.690
comics. I have no idea. Anyways, boyfriend wants to have sex with other girls.

980
00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:57.110
Hi Bill. Hi Bill. Um,

981
00:57:57.140 --> 00:58:00.170
my boyfriend and I had been together for over two years.

982
00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:03.410
Recently we had broken up for a little less than a month,

983
00:58:03.411 --> 00:58:04.670
but we started talking again.

984
00:58:04.671 --> 00:58:08.180
We broke up because although he loves me and wants to be with me

985
00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:14.390
[inaudible] um, he still wants to have sex with other girls.

986
00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:18.470
Our sex life isn't a problem because we fuck on a daily basis.

987
00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:22.700
Most of the twice a day she was supposed to right time.

988
00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:24.170
She was supposed to write time most of the time,

989
00:58:24.171 --> 00:58:27.860
twice a day and he always says on the best he will ever slash will have.

990
00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:32.240
He also believes that there is a very slim possibility that there might be

991
00:58:32.241 --> 00:58:36.170
something better for him and then he wants to experience other people before

992
00:58:36.171 --> 00:58:38.330
possibly spending the rest of his life with me.

993
00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:43.160
He's 25 years old so he is pretty scared about staying with one person for the

994
00:58:43.161 --> 00:58:44.060
rest of his life.

995
00:58:44.330 --> 00:58:47.180
We are both not ready for marriage or that type of relationship,

996
00:58:47.181 --> 00:58:51.140
but I feel that ending a two and a half year relationship over his urges isn't

997
00:58:51.141 --> 00:58:54.860
the right thing. Especially since he still loves me and wants to be with me.

998
00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:56.360
He's pretty unhappy,

999
00:58:56.361 --> 00:59:00.740
but he knows that being with other people won't help because he will feel the

1000
00:59:00.741 --> 00:59:03.560
exact same way as he does. Now.

1001
00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:07.400
He tells me that I am amazing and beautiful and he wants to have a perfect

1002
00:59:07.401 --> 00:59:08.234
relationship,

1003
00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:11.750
so I don't understand why he wants to leave that for something that is most

1004
00:59:11.751 --> 00:59:13.610
likely going to be shittier.

1005
00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:16.970
I can't go through another breakup with him because it was horrible.

1006
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:21.950
A while we were broken up, he did have sex with one girl and to multiple girls,

1007
00:59:21.951 --> 00:59:25.970
but I didn't feel any better and he was still unhappy without me. Please help.

1008
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:30.860
I don't know what to do and maybe this can help them as well. Thanks a bunch.

1009
00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:33.710
Ah, well first of all, I'm not a fucking relationship expert, but, uh,

1010
00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:36.140
first of all, I got to give him Kudos for just being honest,

1011
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:41.390
saying that this is what I want to do. Um,

1012
00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:45.260
well I'll talk to you cause he, you, he didn't write in.

1013
00:59:45.261 --> 00:59:47.570
So I would just say that, um,

1014
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:53.630
unfortunately this is where he is at 25 and um,

1015
00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:54.500
you are not.

1016
00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:59.420
So if he wants to fucking go out and do whatever the fuck he wants to do,

1017
00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:03.170
you know, let him and then I think you should get on with your life.

1018
01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:07.480
But I don't think it's healthy for you to have him keep,

1019
01:00:07.481 --> 01:00:11.240
keep calling you during this time when he's out there fucking other people,

1020
01:00:11.241 --> 01:00:13.190
but still fucking with your emotions.

1021
01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:18.820
So I think you let them go and let him go do whatever the fuck he wants to do

1022
01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:22.670
and, but there's, you don't have any contact with them. Um,

1023
01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:26.780
that might be a guy thing where you need some sort of closure or some shit and

1024
01:00:26.781 --> 01:00:29.980
gradually talk and then talk less and less and less. I Dunno,

1025
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:34.250
I'm a fucking psycho when it comes to that shit. So that's what I would do.

1026
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:37.070
Um, I would say at this point,

1027
01:00:37.071 --> 01:00:39.770
what he's doing is he's trying to do what's right for him.

1028
01:00:39.771 --> 01:00:43.490
So you have to do what's right for you. Um,

1029
01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:47.430
he's putting himself first and his wants first,

1030
01:00:47.431 --> 01:00:51.360
so you should do the same thing and there's nothing wrong with what he's doing.

1031
01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:52.110
Um,

1032
01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:55.110
he could have fucking lied and said that he didn't have urges and then gone and

1033
01:00:55.111 --> 01:00:57.390
fucked around and you know,

1034
01:00:58.800 --> 01:00:59.460
<v 2>okay.</v>

1035
01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:02.520
<v 0>I know, no matter what, he was going to end up hurting it, but he did it.</v>

1036
01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:07.080
He did it. He did it the right way. He told you he broke up with you. And

1037
01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:12.500
um, yeah, he's got to go figure some shit out.

1038
01:01:12.501 --> 01:01:15.500
But I don't think he needs to be calling you up and re talking to you after a

1039
01:01:15.501 --> 01:01:20.080
month and getting your heart going again and giving you hope. And then,

1040
01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:23.120
<v 4>but I don't know what I want to do, but I do love you. But again,</v>

1041
01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:28.100
<v 0>yeah, go fuck yourself with your wishy washy shit. All right. You know,</v>

1042
01:01:30.090 --> 01:01:32.850
you're beautiful, you're young, you've got your whole life ahead of Ya.

1043
01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:38.330
You know, fuck them. Just fucking,

1044
01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:40.093
I don't know.

1045
01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:44.810
Why don't you have a little you time over the next two to three months,

1046
01:01:44.811 --> 01:01:47.660
see what you're at. Make a little list, figuring out what you want out of life.

1047
01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:50.870
You know, who knows, who knows? Maybe he'll come back to, you'd be like,

1048
01:01:50.871 --> 01:01:53.780
you know what? It sucked and you want to take him back. Maybe you won't, but a,

1049
01:01:53.781 --> 01:01:56.930
I think you need to focus on yourself and not him. That's a,

1050
01:01:56.931 --> 01:02:00.770
that's what I would do. Um, cause you didn't pull the trigger. He did sell.

1051
01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:03.470
There's no guilt on your end, but um,

1052
01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:07.580
it's a shitty thing to do to do that to somebody and then come back like a month

1053
01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:11.330
later and in drag you through that hell all over again,

1054
01:02:11.331 --> 01:02:15.140
but then not get back with you and make some sort of a commitment to just go

1055
01:02:15.141 --> 01:02:16.010
back and be like,

1056
01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:20.490
<v 4>oh, you know, I hooked up with one person. It's still miss you.</v>

1057
01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:23.730
<v 0>You know, cause then you're going to be like, yeah. So what does that mean?</v>

1058
01:02:23.731 --> 01:02:26.280
Does that mean he loves me? And you gotta sit there playing that mental tennis.

1059
01:02:26.281 --> 01:02:30.960
Fuck all that. Fuck all that. Yeah. Right there. Wishy washy. We'll see ya.

1060
01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:32.273
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1061
01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:36.590
<v 0>Just tell them what you need. You need, yeah, 100% commitment. That's it.</v>

1062
01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.710
You're either in it or you're out of it. I respect you.

1063
01:02:39.711 --> 01:02:41.930
The fact that you're honest, but you know,

1064
01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:46.460
I know I don't need you fucking hemming and hawing every fucking four weeks

1065
01:02:46.790 --> 01:02:50.390
dragging me back down to that emotional pit. I'm done. Get on with your life.

1066
01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:55.100
That's what I would do, you know, as fucking jackass.

1067
01:02:55.101 --> 01:02:57.430
And then the second you're getting on with your life, he won't want to lose you.

1068
01:02:57.460 --> 01:03:00.980
Then he'll come back and just so we won't lose one of those fucking guys.

1069
01:03:00.981 --> 01:03:05.140
That's what I'm thinking. Um, yeah, I would,

1070
01:03:05.141 --> 01:03:07.030
I would get on with your life. That's what I would do.

1071
01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:10.490
I hope that's good advice. I had no idea. All right,

1072
01:03:10.491 --> 01:03:11.660
that's the podcast for this week.

1073
01:03:11.661 --> 01:03:14.360
Thank you guys for listening and thank you to everybody from the bottom of my

1074
01:03:14.361 --> 01:03:18.080
hat who watched the first season of emphasis for family. Uh,

1075
01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:21.290
we're really gonna try to outdo what we did in the first season and, uh,

1076
01:03:21.350 --> 01:03:23.420
try and make them as funny as possible. All right. That's it.

1077
01:03:23.421 --> 01:03:26.760
Go fuck yourselves. And I'll check in audio on Thursday. See Ya.
