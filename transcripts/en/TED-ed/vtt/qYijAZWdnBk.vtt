00:00:09.218 --> 00:00:12.554
This is the microraptor,

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:17.060
a carnivorous four-winged dinosaur
that was almost two-feet long,

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.271
ate fish,

00:00:18.271 --> 00:00:21.209
and lived about 120 million years ago.

00:00:21.209 --> 00:00:26.176
Most of what we know about it
comes from fossils that look like this.

00:00:26.176 --> 00:00:29.970
So, is its coloration here 
just an artist's best guess?

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.286
The answer is no.

00:00:32.286 --> 00:00:35.414
We know this shimmering 
black color is accurate

00:00:35.414 --> 00:00:40.608
because paleontologists have analyzed
clues contained within the fossil.

00:00:40.608 --> 00:00:44.828
But making sense of the evidence
requires careful examination of the fossil

00:00:44.828 --> 00:00:50.031
and a good understanding of the physics
of light and color.

00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:53.692
First of all, here's what we actually see
on the fossil:

00:00:53.692 --> 00:00:58.386
imprints of bones and feathers that have
left telltale mineral deposits.

00:00:58.386 --> 00:00:59.830
And from those imprints,

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.436
we can determine that these 
microraptor feathers

00:01:02.436 --> 00:01:07.572
were similar to modern dinosaur,
as in bird, feathers.

00:01:07.572 --> 00:01:11.237
But what gives birds their signature
diverse colorations?

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:15.827
Most feathers contain just one
or two dye-like pigments.

00:01:15.827 --> 00:01:18.403
The cardinal's bright red
comes from carotenoids,

00:01:18.403 --> 00:01:21.409
the same pigments 
that make carrots orange,

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.745
while the black of its face
is from melanin,

00:01:23.745 --> 00:01:27.028
the pigment that colors our hair and skin.

00:01:27.028 --> 00:01:30.462
But in bird feathers,
melanin isn't simply a dye.

00:01:30.462 --> 00:01:34.154
It forms hollow nanostructures
called melanosomes

00:01:34.154 --> 00:01:37.267
which can shine in all the colors
of the rainbow.

00:01:37.267 --> 00:01:39.188
To understand how that works,

00:01:39.188 --> 00:01:41.666
it helps to remember 
some things about light.

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:46.935
Light is basically a tiny electromagnetic
wave traveling through space.

00:01:46.935 --> 00:01:49.323
The top of a wave is called its crest

00:01:49.323 --> 00:01:53.485
and the distance between two crests
is called the wavelength.

00:01:53.485 --> 00:01:58.235
The crests in red light are about
700 billionths of a meter apart

00:01:58.235 --> 00:02:01.481
and the wavelength of purple light
is even shorter,

00:02:01.481 --> 00:02:06.160
about 400 billionths of a meter,
or 400 nanometers.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.241
When light hits the thin front surface
of a bird's hollow melanosome,

00:02:10.241 --> 00:02:13.747
some is reflected and some passes through.

00:02:13.747 --> 00:02:18.110
A portion of the transmitted light
then reflects off the back surface.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.553
The two reflected waves interact.

00:02:20.553 --> 00:02:22.487
Usually they cancel each other out,

00:02:22.487 --> 00:02:24.667
but when the wavelength
of the reflected light

00:02:24.667 --> 00:02:27.839
matches the distance between
the two reflections,

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:29.762
they reinforce each other.

00:02:29.762 --> 00:02:33.044
Green light has a wavelength
of about 500 nanometers,

00:02:33.044 --> 00:02:36.328
so melanosomes that are 
about 500 nanometers across

00:02:36.328 --> 00:02:38.283
give off green light,

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:40.758
thinner melanosomes give off purple light,

00:02:40.758 --> 00:02:43.551
and thicker ones give off red light.

00:02:43.551 --> 00:02:45.987
Of course, it's more complex than this.

00:02:45.987 --> 00:02:49.711
The melanosomes are packed together
inside cells, and other factors,

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:54.371
like how the melanosomes are arranged 
within the feather, also matter.

00:02:54.371 --> 00:02:56.824
Let's return to the microraptor fossil.

00:02:56.824 --> 00:03:01.033
When scientists examined its feather 
imprints under a powerful microscope,

00:03:01.033 --> 00:03:04.307
they found nanostructures 
that look like melanosomes.

00:03:04.307 --> 00:03:09.156
X-ray analysis of the melanosomes
further supported that theory.

00:03:09.156 --> 00:03:13.384
They contained minerals that would
result from the decay of melanin.

00:03:13.384 --> 00:03:16.784
The scientists then chose 20 feathers
from one fossil

00:03:16.784 --> 00:03:20.961
and found that 
the melanosomes in all 20 looked alike,

00:03:20.961 --> 00:03:25.041
so they became pretty sure this dinosaur
was one solid color.

00:03:25.041 --> 00:03:29.369
They compared these microraptor
melanosomes to those of modern birds

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:32.938
and found a close similarity,
though not a perfect match,

00:03:32.938 --> 00:03:37.115
to the iridescent teal feathers
found on duck wings.

00:03:37.115 --> 00:03:40.998
And by examining the exact size
and arrangement of the melanosomes,

00:03:40.998 --> 00:03:45.880
scientists determined that the feathers
were iridescent black.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.897
Now that we can determine
a fossilized feather's color,

00:03:48.897 --> 00:03:54.060
paleontologists are looking for more
fossils with well-preserved melanosomes.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.853
They've found that a lot of dinosaurs,
including velociraptor,

00:03:57.853 --> 00:03:59.522
probably had feathers,

00:03:59.522 --> 00:04:04.857
meaning that certain films might not be
so biologically accurate.

00:04:04.857 --> 00:04:06.557
Clever girls.
