00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.500
Microservices architectures,
what does that term even mean?

00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:08.420
&gt;&gt; Well, microservices is just
a architectural approach to designing

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.840
applications in a way that's modular,
easy to deploy, and scale independently.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.870
&gt;&gt; But given all the benefits,
doesn't make sense for

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.770
everyone to just move to them?

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.180
&gt;&gt; A lot of the benefits of
the microservices design pattern

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.965
applies to any application,
even your traditional web application.

00:00:24.965 --> 00:00:28.070
Microservices just happen to benefit
more from rapid deployments and

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.640
continuous delivery.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.915
Microservices also push the limits
of most automation tools and

00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:35.555
infrastructure in place
today to their limits.

00:00:35.555 --> 00:00:38.030
&gt;&gt; Okay, that makes sense now.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.665
Microservices are one of the reasons we
need advanced tools, like Kubernetes.
