00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.860
Hey, it's me Destin

00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:02.040
welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.920
I'm currently sitting in an airport

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.280
with my oldest son and we're on our way to Idaho.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.040
Destin: Where does superman get his Superpowers?

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.920
Son: Krypton

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.900
Destin: The planet Krypton.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.940
What about Batman? How did he get his superpowers?

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:13.960
Son: He learnt (learned) his.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.940
Destin: Do you think people can learn superpowers?

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.900
Son: Yes sir.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.340
Destin: Yea, me too.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.460
Now, here's the deal; today's Smarter Every Day is in collaboration with

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.700
Bill and Melinda Gates, who every year write a letter

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.800
about how to make the world a better place

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.880
This year the letter is about "Superpowers for good"

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.260
If you could have a superpower for good, what would it be?

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.100
If you've watched smarter Every Day for any length of time,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.560
you'd know that my superpower to be flight

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.200
but not like Superman- I would want to become a pilot.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.920
I'm actively working on it actually.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.340
When I was younger I read this book, and it's called

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.980
Through Gates of Splendor by Elisabeth Elliot and in the book

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.600
I met a guy named Nate Saint. This was the first time

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.760
I realised (realized) you could use your technical abilities to

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.960
help other people.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.600
When ever there's a natural disaster like a Tsunami or an Earthquake,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.340
often governments will send aid to these really tiny nations

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.000
who don't have the infrastructure to get it out to the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.500
isolated people that need it.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.820
That's where Superheroes come in, these guys

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.620
fly the aid up into the bush and give it to the people who need it.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.860
So today on Smarter Every Day,  I want to go to the organisation (organization)

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.660
that Nate worker for, it's called the Mission Aviation Fellowship (MAF)

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.260
and learn how these guys train to become real life superheroes

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.740
Okay, here we are, we are here at MAF headquarters

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.240
at Nampa, Idaho and this is Aaron.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.780
He let me stay at his house last night.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.740
and we're going to meet Brian, right?

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.580
Aaron: Brian... yep!

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.220
Destin: Alright, cool.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.840
Destin: Are you Brian? I am Destin.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.500
Brian: Nice to meet you.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.560
Destin: Nice to meet you, how are you doing?

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.540
Meet Brian Shepson, Chief Training pilot for the MAF

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.000
I figured out pretty quickly that Brian is an extremely humble man

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.620
despite the fact that he spent over a decade flying in the jungles of Equador

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.080
which makes him somewhat of a legend.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.660
Now he travels all over the world teaching the next generation

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.340
of pilots and mechanics who they can fly safely in crazy conditions.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.760
Destin: So you basically train Superheroes, right?

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.760
Brian: Well, pretty much every day by your definition, yes!

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.920
Destin: *laughing*

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.880
Brian: We go to places that are hard to get.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.080
If roads come in or other transportation systems come in,

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.540
We leave, we go another part of the world that is hard

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.100
to get to.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.180
This airplane is a good combination

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.780
between being able to carry and being able to get

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.340
in and out of a short airstrip.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.260
We have a heavy duty gear

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.980
the tire is a bigger size, we have gravel guards

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.000
to keep rocks and things from hitting the tail.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.380
We have a rubber abrasion boot on the tail

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.440
to deflect rocks.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.320
Tip extenders on the wings.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.700
A fuel tank for extra range if we need it

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.140
Destin: A fuel tank in the tip, here?

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.740
Brain: Yes, an extra 15 gallons (57 Litres) on a side.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.680
This cuff here, it adds a little bit more areodynamic

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.660
grip at a slower and higher angles of attack.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.480
We have a mirror over here so that we can see if we have any

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.680
smoke, fire or oil

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.420
We have a cargo pod underneath.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.200
We can put cargo in the aircraft without having to tie it down

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.360
Here we can just open the door and slide in stuff

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.420
Pigs, chickens and things that need

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.360
Destin: You are not exaggerating, you ship life stock.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.460
Brain: Oh yeah, we carry anything.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.740
Crocodile, snakes, you name it.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.940
If it needs to be transported, we can transport it.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.480
Destin: Brian agreed to take me up into the mountains

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.680
to teach me a little bit about flying in rough terrain.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.920
We strapped in and headed out to the wilderness

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.660
of central Idaho where the first thing he wanted to teach me

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.020
was how to fly through a valley if you are forced to fly

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.160
below the mountain tops.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.740
Brian: The untrained pilot in terrain would fly right through the middle of that pass.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.980
The trained pilot knows "I need to be able to turn outta here".

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.700
Destin: Yeah, because if he got through the middle and you take a turn left or right...

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.980
Brian: he has have of the valley to work with.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.800
So what we do is, we work with the whole valley

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.380
Then we have the whole valley to turn with

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.560
Destin: How do you do that?

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.160
Brian: We move over to one side, or the other

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.660
Let's go ahead and move over to the right side here

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.560
And so the whole idea is - you see how much room I have over there to turn around in?

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:33.880
Destin: That's your out

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.160
Brian: That's my out, but I have to be able to turn to get there

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.200
Brian: Nothing out there, clear. Let's go ahead and turn

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
Just add about 4" of manifold pressure.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.120
Destin: You're pulling back to maintain altitude

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.860
Brian: 45Â° of bank, yep.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.660
Brian: Finish the turn.
Destin: You didn't even use a third of it.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.220
Destin: Think about what Brian is saying here

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.220
if you lose an engine, you're gonna start to descend

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.580
Even though it feels more dangerous because you're so close

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.360
hugging the mountains is your clearest bet for survival

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.340
Destin: How many people would you say that you have saved over the years

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.360
from things like disease or your medical extractions, and things like that?

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.580
Brian: Oh my goodness, I don't even know if I can hazard a guess

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.720
We actually

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.440
would do teams that would go in and administer vaccinations for kids

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.100
Almost all of the kids

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.700
in the - in the jungles of Ecuador, where I flew

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.960
They receive their vaccinations because

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.780
we flew the doctors there

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.800
Destin: When you're transporting a vaccine, you have to worry about what's called Cold Chain Management

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.720
If a vaccine warms up it loses it's potency

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.280
so even if the medicine is in country, you can't get it to the people who need it in time

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.480
if you have to hike for days across rough terrain and through water

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.800
This is why airplanes are like having a superpower

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.660
You can get the vaccine to people who need it in minutes instead of days

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.780
Brian: There was a meningitis outbreak in a - in a - in a - valley that was completely

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.220
isolated because of snow on the roads. Couldn't get to it

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.120
for like 4 months out of the year

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.280
And the nurse in the village called

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.740
and we were able to package up 300 - uhh...- viles of the treatments - the serum

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.540
fly up there

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.640
and drop those out of the airplane

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.820
and only one of the little viles broke out of 300

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.920
I think they did a good job of packaging those

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.820
Destin: That's amazing, it's like the egg drop competition in school only

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.720
with vaccines that are gonna save somebody's life.
Brian: That's right.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.120
Brian: Only Life and death, that's right

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.880
I can tell you from experience that the hardest part of flying is making a good landing.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.320
So I asked Brian to show me an example of the airstrips that jungle pilots might have to land on

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.700
These strips are often cut into the jungle with machetes, so they're very short

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.080
and very narrow

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.160
The craziest thing about these runways is that you often have to commit

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.960
either they're so short that you have one chance to take off

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.960
or there's a mountain in the way and you can't do a go round if you miss the approach

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.300
Once you commit, you either have to do it right or you crash

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.800
This is the width of the Atlanta runway

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.900
and this is the width of the dirt runway that Brian's about to land on.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.960
I looked it up. It's one tenth as long and oh by the way

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.480
just to make it interesting it's pointing uphill with a huge bump right in the middle

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.580
This means that instead of gently gliding down to the ground

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.400
we have to pull up at exactly the right second and start flying uphill

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.120
or we're gunna smash and pancake into the dirt

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.280
The geometry says that the hill rises faster than the plane can pull out so you're committed.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.300
You either land or you don't.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.000
Usually understanding the physics of whats about to go down

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.420
makes me calm, but in this case

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.680
it made me nervous

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.060
Brian: Little sinker, and we're committed.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.380
Brian: .. Flair.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.160
Brian: Just touch it.  And. Good hard brakes.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.900
Brian: Now we got stopped by the wind sock

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.420
Destin: You are a boss.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.180
Brian: That just shows what slope can do for us

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.900
Destin: That's impressive. 
Brian: And dirt

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.900
you can brake as hard as you want on dirt, you're not going to hurt anything

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.900
on asphalt you'll slide and flatten the tires.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.900
Destin: There's no threat of tipping over.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.360
It's skills like making these landing every single day

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.320
which helps the MAF get help exactly where it's needed

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.640
The main thing I learned though, wasn't about the pilots

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.800
it's that people who learn these skills

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.920
can use them to save people in a desperate situation.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.920
and basically become superheroes.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.540
Technicians build the planes

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.540
IT Professionals, Radio Operators,

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.540
logisticians, engineers, medical professionals.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:00.790
Every technical skill

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.430
becomes a super power if you choose to
use it not to build yourself up

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.520
but to help others in their time of need

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.880
Alright that's what my superpower would be, a big
thanks to MAF for helping me learn a

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.040
little bit about how they become super
heroes anyway if you would like to talk

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.840
about your super power for good

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.450
I'll leave a link in the video description is
the first link, go read the gates letter

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:24.150
understand what the superpower for good
is all about. Use the hashtag and tell

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.330
people what your superpower for good would be.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.800
Anyway I'm destin you're getting smarter every day, have a good one

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.960
Brian: for snake bites and venoms, we'd fly live snakes up to a serpentarium

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.860
where they could do the milking and make a venom that would work particularly for our area.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.100
Destin: You would fly snakes in the plane with you.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.880
Brian: snakes on a plane

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.160
son: Wait, there's a planet really named Kypton?

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.160
Destin: No it's not
