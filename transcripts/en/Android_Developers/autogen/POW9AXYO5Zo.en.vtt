the rule of thumb the main tip that I

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189
the rule of thumb the main tip that I
 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.859
the rule of thumb the main tip that I
would like to give is it should not rely

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869
would like to give is it should not rely
 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.929
would like to give is it should not rely
on lot of the service high risks rather

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:20.420
the name of the resource ID so you could
see how confused will before a user if

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430
see how confused will before a user if
 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.429

their app now the final tip I would like

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050
their app now the final tip I would like
 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.050
their app now the final tip I would like
to give this you should also make sure

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060
to give this you should also make sure
 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.969
to give this you should also make sure
that our app works when the auto service

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:28.979
that our app works when the auto service
 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:30.589
that our app works when the auto service
requires authentication so what that

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599
requires authentication so what that
 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:30.950
requires authentication so what that
means

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960
means
 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.260
means
well most puzzle managers they don't

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270
well most puzzle managers they don't
 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.029
well most puzzle managers they don't
return the user data right away because

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039
return the user data right away because
 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:36.439
return the user data right away because
the data might be encrypted there might

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:36.449
the data might be encrypted there might
 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:38.420
the data might be encrypted there might
be locking somehow so they're gonna ask

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430
be locking somehow so they're gonna ask
 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.860
be locking somehow so they're gonna ask
the user to authenticate

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870
the user to authenticate
 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.570

activity that belongs to this service on
 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.670
activity that belongs to this service on
top of your apps stack so the user is

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680
top of your apps stack so the user is
 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.140
top of your apps stack so the user is
going to do the authentication and when

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150
going to do the authentication and when
 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.690
going to do the authentication and when
user finished your activity resumes so

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:56.700
user finished your activity resumes so
 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.370
user finished your activity resumes so
for most likely apps this is not going

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.380
for most likely apps this is not going
 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:59.900
for most likely apps this is not going
to be a problem but if your app is doing

00:06:59.900 --> 00:06:59.910
to be a problem but if your app is doing
 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.910
to be a problem but if your app is doing
something weird on the on the resume

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:01.920
something weird on the on the resume
 

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.540

let's say you're invalidating rebuilding

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:05.550
let's say you're invalidating rebuilding
 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.740
let's say you're invalidating rebuilding
the view hierarchy or you uses some

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:06.750
the view hierarchy or you uses some
 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.390
the view hierarchy or you uses some
webview to do some JavaScript code

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400
webview to do some JavaScript code
 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.880
webview to do some JavaScript code
dynamically so basically this you might

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:10.890
dynamically so basically this you might
 

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:12.350
dynamically so basically this you might
break it out of you as we're going to

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360
break it out of you as we're going to
 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.690
break it out of you as we're going to
see the next slides so again to test

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:14.700
see the next slides so again to test
 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.640
see the next slides so again to test
this to make sure that your app works on

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:16.650
this to make sure that your app works on
 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.140
this to make sure that your app works on
this scenario you need out of reserves

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.150
this scenario you need out of reserves
 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.000
this scenario you need out of reserves
that requires a hesitation and the

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.010
that requires a hesitation and the
 

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.100
that requires a hesitation and the
simplest way to do that is using the

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.110
simplest way to do that is using the
 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.890
simplest way to do that is using the
debug service so when you launch the

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:24.900
debug service so when you launch the
 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.710
debug service so when you launch the
settings for the debug service actually

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:27.720
settings for the debug service actually
 

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.390
settings for the debug service actually
first you need to enable auto fuel and

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.400
first you need to enable auto fuel and
 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.340
first you need to enable auto fuel and
select the surface so you can click on

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:31.350
select the surface so you can click on
 

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.980
select the surface so you can click on
the bottom and select debug service you

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:33.990
the bottom and select debug service you
 

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.510
the bottom and select debug service you
see the bug erosive service is one of

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520
see the bug erosive service is one of
 

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.790
see the bug erosive service is one of
the options we provided that sample then

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800
the options we provided that sample then
 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.020
the options we provided that sample then
you can select this authenticate

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:39.030
you can select this authenticate
 

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.480
you can select this authenticate
response your options it's on the top

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:41.490
response your options it's on the top
 

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.900
response your options it's on the top
now when you go back to your app when

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:44.910
now when you go back to your app when
 

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:46.370
now when you go back to your app when
when you trigger out a few instead of

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:46.380
when you trigger out a few instead of
 

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.960
when you trigger out a few instead of
getting the data unlock it you're going

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:47.970
getting the data unlock it you're going
 

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.150
getting the data unlock it you're going
to be ahead get this prompt to

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160
to be ahead get this prompt to
 

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.100
to be ahead get this prompt to
authenticate so when the user taps this

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:52.110
authenticate so when the user taps this
 

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.170
authenticate so when the user taps this
prompt we launch an activity in this

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:54.180
prompt we launch an activity in this
 

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.780
prompt we launch an activity in this
case is just ask for yes or no so now

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:56.790
case is just ask for yes or no so now
 

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.240
case is just ask for yes or no so now
when you click in yes in this case let's

00:07:59.240 --> 00:07:59.250
when you click in yes in this case let's
 

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.710
when you click in yes in this case let's
say it in front is a screen shot I'm

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720
say it in front is a screen shot I'm
 

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.370
say it in front is a screen shot I'm
using a sample app where I'm split early

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:03.380
using a sample app where I'm split early
 

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.720
using a sample app where I'm split early
we created a view hierarchy on start

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:05.730
we created a view hierarchy on start
 

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:08.210
we created a view hierarchy on start
so basically when I click yes we return

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:08.220
so basically when I click yes we return
 

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.800
so basically when I click yes we return
to our activity but now from the

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:09.810
to our activity but now from the
 

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.600
to our activity but now from the
framework point of view all the data is

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:11.610
framework point of view all the data is
 

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.280
framework point of view all the data is
different so they don't know that they

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:13.290
different so they don't know that they
 

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.230
different so they don't know that they
have the lock the data for your active

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:15.240
have the lock the data for your active
 

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.820
have the lock the data for your active
for your username field because it's a

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:16.830
for your username field because it's a
 

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.740
for your username field because it's a
different ID so it's gonna show the tap

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:18.750
different ID so it's gonna show the tap
 

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.630
different ID so it's gonna show the tap
to authenticate response again so when

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:20.640
to authenticate response again so when
 

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.400
to authenticate response again so when
the user click there it'll launches they

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:22.410
the user click there it'll launches they
 

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:24.110
the user click there it'll launches they
authenticate and say yes sure one

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:24.120
authenticate and say yes sure one
 

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.450
authenticate and say yes sure one
authenticate and then you go back asked

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:26.460
authenticate and then you go back asked
 

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.490
authenticate and then you go back asked
authenticate again so basically the loop

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:28.500
authenticate again so basically the loop
 

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.680
authenticate again so basically the loop
the user is now on this a groundhog loop

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:30.690
the user is now on this a groundhog loop
 

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.930
the user is now on this a groundhog loop
where it never goes forward and it's

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:32.940
where it never goes forward and it's
 

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.940
where it never goes forward and it's
kind of frustrating so the solution for

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:34.950
kind of frustrating so the solution for
 

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.830
kind of frustrating so the solution for
this case just wanna make sure that you

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:36.840
this case just wanna make sure that you
 

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.870
this case just wanna make sure that you
don't you create a view hierarchy on

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880
don't you create a view hierarchy on
 

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.030
don't you create a view hierarchy on
create so now when the user is tapped

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:41.040
create so now when the user is tapped
 

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.070
create so now when the user is tapped
authenticate we still launch the tenth

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.080
authenticate we still launch the tenth
 

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.410
authenticate we still launch the tenth
gauge authenticated activity user say

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:45.420
gauge authenticated activity user say
 

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.840
gauge authenticated activity user say
yes now when we go back we show the

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:47.850
yes now when we go back we show the
 

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:49.850
yes now when we go back we show the
unlock data and the user select the data

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:49.860
unlock data and the user select the data
 

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.890
unlock data and the user select the data
and we are a few and everybody is going

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:51.900
and we are a few and everybody is going
 

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:52.460
and we are a few and everybody is going
to be happy

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:52.470
to be happy
 

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.700
to be happy
so these are my main tips that would

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:55.710
so these are my main tips that would
 

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.290
so these are my main tips that would
like to give from this session so

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:57.300
like to give from this session so
 

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.760
like to give from this session so
basically make sure you are not

00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:58.770
basically make sure you are not
 

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.890
basically make sure you are not
interviews for out a few you test you

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:00.900
interviews for out a few you test you
 

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.020
interviews for out a few you test you
the standard services and make sure they

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:03.030
the standard services and make sure they
 

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.550
the standard services and make sure they
work with the service authentication so

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560
work with the service authentication so
 

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.820
work with the service authentication so
I have some links here we have if you go

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:07.830
