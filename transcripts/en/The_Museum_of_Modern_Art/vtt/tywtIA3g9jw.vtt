00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.120
Hi, Corey D'Augustine here from the "In The Studio" session.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.740
Nope, not a "session."

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.740
Take two.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.660
Hi, Corey D'Augustine here from the "In The Studio" series.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.000
I want to wish you a Happy New Year, and I hope you made a New Year's Resolution to paint more in 2018.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.700
I want to let you know that we will be here
with a Live Q&amp;A session

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.500
Wednesday, February 7th at 3:00 p.m. New York time.

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.010
I will be responding to some of the questions
left over from our last session in September,

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.470
live questions, obviously, and if you can't
make that session please feel free to drop

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.330
a question down in the comments section below.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.520
I'll do my best to get to it.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.090
A couple of questions that we will be featuring include one from Cecelia Beck who asks about

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.947
de Kooning's paintings and how they fare over time.

00:00:39.947 --> 00:00:42.020
De Kooning used some unorthodox paint

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.520
mixtures as you know, and we'll talk about
some of the ramifications of that as his paintings age.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.920
Argendiego asks about how to increase the
canvas tension after painting on it with a

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.080
palette knife, stretching a canvas having a nice taut
surface, losing some of that tautness by scraping, etc.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.760
How do you get it back?

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.360
I have a couple of good ideas for you.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.940
Another viewer asks "Why not paint like yourself?"

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.000
In fact, we touched on this a bit last time, but it's a really important question.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.390
In fact, you can't do anything but paint like yourself

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.390
as much as you might try.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.409
Anyway, we'll delve back into that and explore
that in a little bit more depth.

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.900
So again, that's Wednesday February 7th at 3:00 p.m. New York time.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.660

we go live, so you don't miss us.

I look forward to seeing you then.
