[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.900
WALLY BRILL: Hi, I'm Wally
Brill from Google's Conversation

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.430
Design Team.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.200
Today we're talking
about persona,

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.710
the personality of any
conversational interaction.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.920
Now Webster defines persona
as your public image.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.990
It's the face you
show the world.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.940
Think about when an
actor assumes a character

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.740
for a role in a film
or on the stage.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.380
Here's an example.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.560
When Leslie Howard and Norma
Shearer played Romeo and Juliet

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.100
in the 1930s, it was very
different from the performances

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.060
of Leonardo DiCaprio and
Claire Danes in the 1990s.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.830
Yet, it was the
same material, just

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.310
interpreted with very
different personas.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.940
Before you write a
line of dialogue,

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.580
it's necessary to
define the persona.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.420
The documentation you
create will be a North Star

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.370
to keep the writing
consistent and clear.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.370
It also becomes the
description of the character

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.280
the voice artist will play.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.200
Everyone has a unique persona.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.760
It's there from the
day you're born.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.790
And it develops and morphs
throughout your lifetime.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.260
It's the who of who you are.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.040
It defines us as individuals
to the outside world

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.080
and differentiates
us from one another.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.010
So today, I'm going to show you
how to understand and define

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.090
the right persona for
your product and brand.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.980
Now, we live in the future.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.960
Communication channels
are ubiquitous,

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.120
so people have high
expectations for what

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.760
intelligent assistants
can do and how and where

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.690
we can interact with them.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.420
So when we talk
about persona, we're

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.310
not just talking about a voice.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.780
We're talking
about communicating

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.720
with AI that seamlessly
flows across surfaces,

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.300
from the Google Assistant
on your mobile devices,

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.350
to your car, your smart
speakers, and your smart home.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.900
So we also have to consider
that persona is expressed

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.720
through audio content,
visual content, interaction

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.920
design, and even typography.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.950
But for a voice-first medium
like the Google Assistant,

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.740
let's focus on just why
a clearly-defined persona

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.000
expressed in audio
is so important.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.390
In "Wired For Speech," Clifford
Nass and Scott Brave said,

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.070
"When people hear
any voice, they

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.330
automatically and unconsciously
assign a personality to it."

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.060
Within less than two seconds,
the listener automatically

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.270
creates a mental image of
who they're listening to.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.070
They identify attributes
like age, gender, education,

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.570
where the speaker's
from, and register,

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.640
or their role in
relation to the listener.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.140
Did you ever notice how people
refer to the Google Assistant

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.830
as "she," "he," or
"they," rather than "it"?

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.330
She told me a joke.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.340
I'll ask him for the weather.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.830
That's because we can't
help creating a character

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.720
from those attributes.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.760
We go on to make
assumptions about traits,

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.410
like intelligence,
trustworthiness,

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.270
and likability.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.910
You start to see how important
the perception of the persona

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.510
can be.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.230
And now, more than ever, the
experience of the persona

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.890
is the brand.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.100
They'll be inextricably
linked the mind of the user.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.740
And remember, each
interaction is

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.930
a brand impression,
just like a billboard,

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.880
or an ad, or the website.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.580
That's why leaving the persona
to chance just isn't an option.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.370
If you don't design
your persona,

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.520
the user's imagination will.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.110
So how do we go about it?

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.940
How do we create the
perfect representative

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.100
for the task or brand?

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.740
To answer that question
and show you the steps,

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.230
I thought I'd tell you
a tale of two airlines.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.170
First, Important
Airlines-- they're

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.280
something like a
national carrier.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.500
They're a bit traditional
and no-nonsense.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.410
Their strapline,
"We're important,

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.460
and we will get you there,"
shows their practical approach.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.410
On the other hand,
Millennial Airlines

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.180
is clearly more fun and upbeat.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.840
Their strapline, "It's
an awesome day to fly,"

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.490
kind of says it all.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.500
These are very different brands
with very different styles.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.550
So how do we create the
perfect persona for each brand?

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.180
First, we need to understand
the brand dimensions.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.390
We'll interview stakeholders,
people from marketing, brand,

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.070
and customer experience.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.680
We'll want to review the
brand book and any advertising

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.730
materials, print, TV,
radio, online, outdoor.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.890
And we'll need to
experience the product.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.232
In this case, take a trip.

00:04:12.232 --> 00:04:13.940
We're distilling the
essence of the brand

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.250
into a few attributes.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.140
In the case of
Important Airlines,

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.230
they're solid, confident,
expert, reliable,

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.105
straightforward, and safe.

00:04:23.105 --> 00:04:26.120
You know just what you're
getting-- no surprises.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.070
On the other hand,
Millennial is very different.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.510
They focus on being bold,
hip, fun, youthful, friendly,

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.199
exciting, and delightful.

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.740
Next, we want to know everything
we can about the passengers.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.490
Who are they?

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.920
What are their
expectations, et cetera?

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.470
We'll want to understand
the customer demographics,

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.430
the intended target segments,
and their frequency of use.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.870
In the case of
Important, they're

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.110
catering to business
travelers, mid-30s and up,

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.200
high value, frequent flyers.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.830
Once again, the Millennial
customer is very different.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.680
They're holiday makers or young
families in their late teens

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.990
to mid-30s who are
budget conscious

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.550
and who, for the most
part, fly infrequently.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.180
Now we want to determine the
tasks our persona will perform.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.690
In this case, we're providing
flight status and information.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.010
Is my flight on time?

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.330
Has it been delayed?

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.770
When is it expected?

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.140
Here's the fun part.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.870
We're going to write biographies
for imaginary characters who

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.000
might be a good fit.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.370
Often, we'll make the register
different between them.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.010
One character might have a
more dominant personality

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.950
versus a character
that's more subservient.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.650
First up is Important Airlines.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.900
We mention register as
one of the attributes

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.020
we can discern from the voice.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.520
Register is the social
standing of the persona

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.930
in relation to the listener.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.300
So is the persona going to
be someone very familiar

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.640
like a peer?

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.710
Will it be an employee, perhaps?

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.360
Or will it be my
superior, something

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.670
like a mentor or advisor?

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.190
It's all about what will be
most appropriate for the brand

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.290
and task at hand.

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.210
For Important, we
wanted our personas

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.040
to be more of a butler.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.440
So that's exactly
what we designed.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.000
Meet Terrence Butler.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.090
He's 56 years old, solidly
built, and comes from just

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.860
outside London.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.540
The age indicates experience.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.790
His size determines
how big-- and perhaps,

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.820
how deep-- his voice will sound.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.330
We want to know
what influenced him,

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.500
so we make his parents a
hotel manager and a nurse.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.400
Terrence knows hospitality
and how to provide help.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.410
Now let's flashback to
the brand attributes

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.030
of Important Airlines--

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.150
solid, confident, expert,
reliable, straightforward,

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.590
safe.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.650
You'll notice that a summary
of some of his biographical FAQ

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.500
shows how his persona
ties directly to the brand

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.610
attributes.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.860
His very occupation implies
professional confidence.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.970
He's been working for the
same family for 30 years,

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.150
indicating reliability
and expertise.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.210
All-in-all, Terrence is a solid
fit for the Important brand.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.180
Now we create some content
for the character to say.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.920
We write a monologue
and some samples

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.500
dialogues to record with
proposed voice artists

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.470
if we're using
custom-recorded human speech.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.960
If instead we're
using text-to-speech

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.040
we produce the monologue using
a selected text-to-speech voice.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.630
These recordings
provide the writers

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.300
with a strong sense of
who they're writing for

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.520
and gives the voice
actor a powerful tool

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.140
to help her or him
get into character.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.140
The monologue can be a paragraph
or two of the persona telling

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.610
a story to a friend.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.340
It can be about anything at
all, something that happened

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.500
at work, a hobby, anything.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.360
It helps to set
the tone of voice.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.792
So here's Terrence Butler's
monologue about being a butler.

00:07:41.792 --> 00:07:44.360
TERRENCE BUTLER: I quite
enjoy this occupation.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.040
It's extremely gratifying to
know that one is indispensable.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.930
If sir is stepping
out of an evening,

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.770
I shall have prepared sir's
dinner jacket and accessories.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:57.820
And I shall, of course, assist
him in tying his bow tie.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.065
The work of a gentleman's
gentleman is never done.

00:08:01.065 --> 00:08:02.690
WALLY BRILL: You get
quite a good sense

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.730
of who he is, don't you think?

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.710
Although he's rendered
in text-to-speech voice,

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:09.740
his persona is solid
and well-represented.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.950
Now here's an example of this
persona in an interaction.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.690
It's called a sample dialogue.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.540
And basically, it's
a script, like a play

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.857
with two characters, a
user and the persona.

00:08:20.857 --> 00:08:21.440
Have a listen.

00:08:22.175 --> 00:08:25.460
OK, Google, talk to
Important Airlines.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.080

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:27.830
TERRENCE BUTLER: Good morning.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.485
You are through to
Important Airlines.

00:08:29.485 --> 00:08:31.456
Am I speaking with Wally?

00:08:31.456 --> 00:08:32.539
WALLY BRILL: That's right.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:33.664
TERRENCE BUTLER: Thank you.

00:08:33.664 --> 00:08:36.679
And do you require information
regarding your flight to London

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:37.789
today?

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:38.809
WALLY BRILL: Yes.

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:42.260
Notice his language, "Do
you require information

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.059
regarding your flight?"--

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:45.920
very formal.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.920
Now let's shift over
to Millennial Airlines.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.250
Remember their brand attributes,
bold, hip, fun, friendly,

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.235
exciting, delightful?

00:08:54.235 --> 00:08:55.610
So what kind of
person would they

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:58.340
hire to serve their passengers?

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.160
Meet Helen Haighwater,
a 26-year-old gate

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.280
agent at San Francisco
International Airport.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.900
Helen is super hip and stylish.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.420
She shares a three-bedroom
flat in San Francisco

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.240
with a software developer
and a med student.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.250
She's single but
currently dating Gary,

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:15.950
the drummer for a band
called the Ironic Three.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.220
They're ironic, because
there are four members.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.890
Helen studied drama and English
at school with a goal in mind.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.500
Her dream is to be
a stand-up comic.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.800
Her attention to detail comes
from her dad, a bank manager.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.900
And her love of language
comes from her mother,

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.700
an English teacher.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:36.300
And here's how we tie her
back to those brand values.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.852
Now here's her monologue
rendered in text-to-speech.

00:09:39.852 --> 00:09:41.310
HELEN HAIGHWATER:
I use everything.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.740
And believe me, when you
deal with the passengers,

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.570
there's endless
amounts of material,

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:47.340
like the woman who
was going to Boston,

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.160
but her luggage was on its
way to Austin or the parents

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.770
off on holiday who each
expected the other one to bring

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:54.049
the kids to the airport.

00:09:54.049 --> 00:09:56.340
Then there's the guy who
thinks he deserves an upgrade,

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.250
because he was in some obscure
rock band from 20 years ago

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:00.084
or something.

00:10:00.084 --> 00:10:00.750
Let me tell you.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.550
It's great training
for a stand up.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.630
And I get paid for it.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:06.150
And if I can deal
with them, there

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:09.540
isn't a heckler in the
world who can bother me.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.750
WALLY BRILL: And here's
the sample dialogue.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.535
OK, Google, talk to
Millennial Airlines.

00:10:14.535 --> 00:10:16.035
GOOGLE: Getting
Millennial Airlines.

00:10:18.647 --> 00:10:20.230
HELEN HAIGHWATER:
Millennial Airlines.

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.060
It's an awesome day to fly.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.400
Is this Wally?

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.370
WALLY BRILL: Yup.

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:25.370
HELEN HAIGHWATER: Great.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.967
Do you want info about your
flight to London today?

00:10:27.967 --> 00:10:29.050
WALLY BRILL: That's right.

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:32.290
Notice how she says,
"do you want info?"--

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:36.290
very similar content but
very different language.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:37.280
So that's it.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.310
As you can see, persona
makes a huge difference

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.830
to the perception of the brand.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:42.820
Thanks for watching.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.570
