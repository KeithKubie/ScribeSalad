00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.310
Frank wants to fill
up a spherical water

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.800
balloon with as much
water as possible.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.710
The balloons he
bought can stretch

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.940
to a radius of 3
inches-- not too big.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.490
If the volume of a sphere
is-- and this is volume

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.290
as a function of radius--
is equal to 4/3 pi r cubed,

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.320
what volume of water
in cubic inches

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.580
can Frank put into the balloon?

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.340
So this function
definition is going--

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.700
if you give it a
radius in inches,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.280
it's going to produce a
volume in cubic inches.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.470
So let's rewrite it.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:42.270
Volume as a function of radius
is equal to 4/3 pi r cubed.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.910
Now, they say the
balloons he bought

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.680
can stretch to a
radius of 3 inches.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.670
So let's think about, if the
radius gets to 3 inches, what

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.110
the volume of that
balloon is going to be.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.030
So we essentially would
just input 3 inches

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.770
into our function definition.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.940
So everywhere where we see an
r, we would replace it with a 3.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.730
So we could write--
and just to be clear,

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.230
let me rewrite it
in the same color.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.400
V of-- that's not
the same color.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.400
We do it in that brownish
color right over here.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:23.890
So V of 3 is equal to 4/3
pi-- and instead of r cubed,

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:31.640
I would write 3
cubed-- 4/3 pi 3 cubed.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.390
This is how the function
definition works.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.620
Whatever we input
here, it will replace

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.830
the r in the expression.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.070
So V of 3 is going to
be equal to-- so this

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.450
is going to be equal to 4/3 pi
times-- 3 to the third power

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.030
is 27.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.130
27 divided by 3 is
9, so this is 9.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.890
9 times 4 is 36 pi.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.170
So this is equal to 36 pi.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.590
And since this was
in inches, our volume

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.510
is going to be in inches
cubed or cubic inches.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.900
So that's the volume
of water that Frank

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.750
can put in the balloon--
36 pi cubic inches.
