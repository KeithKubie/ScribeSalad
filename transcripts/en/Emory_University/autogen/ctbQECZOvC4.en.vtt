00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:00.610
leaders have gone through there and our
 

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.880
leaders have gone through there and our

was one of progressivism and not one of
 

00:37:00.109 --> 00:37:02.290
was one of progressivism and not one of
violence and so every time that the city

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:02.300
violence and so every time that the city
 

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:04.450
violence and so every time that the city
got close to violence it retracted from

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:04.460
got close to violence it retracted from
 

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:07.000
got close to violence it retracted from
that line in order to maintain its

someone else and this solidified it was
 

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:48.510
someone else and this solidified it was
symbolic and it became a cultural myth

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:48.520
symbolic and it became a cultural myth
 

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.910

that relationship combined with the fact
 

00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:59.880
that relationship combined with the fact
that many of the african-american

00:37:59.880 --> 00:37:59.890
that many of the african-american
 

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:02.670
that many of the african-american

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:08.950
African American consumers all of these
 

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:11.040
African American consumers all of these
relationships were exploited during this

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:11.050
relationships were exploited during this
 

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:12.840
relationships were exploited during this
period in very unique ways in very

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:12.850
period in very unique ways in very
 

00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:14.910
period in very unique ways in very
specific ways which we can talk about if

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:14.920
specific ways which we can talk about if
 

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:16.500
specific ways which we can talk about if
you're interested that allowed Atlanta

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:16.510
you're interested that allowed Atlanta
 

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:19.080
you're interested that allowed Atlanta
to make it through this period as a very

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:19.090
to make it through this period as a very
 

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:20.310
to make it through this period as a very
different place than the rest of the

different place than the rest of the
 

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.310
different place than the rest of the
region and so I think those lessons are

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:23.320
region and so I think those lessons are
 

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.650
region and so I think those lessons are
worth keeping in mind when we talk about

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:24.660
worth keeping in mind when we talk about
 

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:27.690
worth keeping in mind when we talk about
situations and they are levers which can

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:27.700
situations and they are levers which can
 

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.990
situations and they are levers which can
be continued to be exploited now just a
