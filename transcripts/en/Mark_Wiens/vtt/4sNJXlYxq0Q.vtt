00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.859
I have been told by multiple local Malaysians
that when they travel outside of their home

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.889
country, it's the food they miss more than
anything, even more than their family.

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.300
Nasi lemak, which literally translates to
fatty rice, is one of the ultimate examples

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.300
why.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.789
Near Dang Wangi LRT station in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, is a little heavenly food stall,

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.499
a gem culinary contribution to the world,
RA nasi lemak.

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:36.600
To my overjoy, RA was set up as a welcoming
self service buffet, meaning self control

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.739
was hardly an option.

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.620
Though I wanted to consume everything the
popular eatery had on display, it would simply

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.309
be impossible on a single plate, and so I
chose as much as I could.

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:57.469
It's called nasi lemak, and it's a coconut
infused steamed rice, with a bunch of different

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:58.570
toppings on top.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.320
I'm ecstatic to start digging in here.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.520
First, I don't even know where to begin but.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:16.070
I got some squid which is stewed in sambal,
red chili curry and a little bit of vegetables.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:27.690
I'm going to try the squid first.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:42.210
It's a little bit sweet, spicy, that is exceptional,
and then a stewed piece of chicken, rendang,

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.780
and it's stewed in coconut milk and spices
and that's also on top of my rice.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:02:06.990
Let me grab a piece of the chicken.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:26.480
That is approaching perfection on 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.230
a plate.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.550
That was stunning, I don't even want to do
anything for the rest of the day, I just want

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:50.090
to relax and sip on tea.
