00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This was actually a really tricky question.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So let's, first, mark down the answers,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and now we can talk about why.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So these were the answers and let's think about why.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We have some really interesting behavior over in some of these graphs,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and it's nice to think about what's causing that behavior.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So let's start with number 2.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Pretty straight forward. The robot does exactly what we want.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It starts off away from the track, then it approaches it, and stays right on the track.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
That's exactly what we want PID to do, so this is no problem.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Number 3 looks similar to number 2 but not quite because now you can see the line

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that we're approaching is not actually the track.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
That's because we're reaching the steady state where the robot's upward drift

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
is being balanced by its downward tendency caused by this term,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and though we reach some sort of steady state, it's not the steady state we want,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
which would be right on the track.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The key to understanding number 4 was realizing that the robot

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
starts by moving upwards.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
This is the only case for the robot started going up,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and what's happening here is the drift is dominating since the toe p is equal to 0,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
there is no initial term that steers the robot towards the goal,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and without that, the drift is going to take over.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Of course, as we accumulate error that gets corrected for and we steer down,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
but eventually we get into this sort of oscillating behavior.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The oscillations are not as frequent, however, as they are in case number 1.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
If we think of this differential CTE term as a sort of smoothing term,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
which damps out these wild oscillations.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Then we can see how, if tow d is equal to 0, we would expect these sort of

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
growing oscillations, and this behavior is characteristic of any PID controller

00:01:43.000 --> 09:59:59.000
where the differential term is too small.
