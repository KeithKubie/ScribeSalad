00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.080
Comic book fans are a fickle bunch.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.710
They can’t wait to see their favorite characters
come to the big screen, but if things aren’t

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.930
just the way they should be, things could
get ugly quick.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.350
While the genre has no shortage of excellent
offerings, there are more than a few that

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.380
can split opinions right down the middle.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.030
Controversial adaptations abound in Screen
Rant’s 10 Comic Book Movies That Divide

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.130
Audiences

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.130
Man of Steel

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.480
Zack Snyder’s Superman reboot is the foundation
on which the DC Extended Universe is built,

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.390
but not everybody is thrilled about that.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.680
The film proved to be extremely polarizing
upon release, with the dark tone to blame.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.410
Some appreciated the updated modern spin on
the mythos that made Superman a more relatable

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.800
and human character than ever.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.690
Others thought the feel of the movie clashed
with Kal-El’s traditional values, creating

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.989
something that didn’t fit.

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.760
Snyder has tried explaining his decisions,
but he hasn’t won everybody over yet.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.760
Watchmen

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.040
Snyder adapted Alan Moore’s ambitious graphic
novel to the big screen, and the results were

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.430
decidedly mixed.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.230
Many praised the film’s stunning visuals
and its loyalty to the source material, engrossing

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.380
viewers in the world of the Watchmen and bringing
the pages to life.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.331
But then there are those who believe the movie
can’t hold a candle to the comic, which

00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:11.490
some considered unfilmable to begin with.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.299
It also didn’t help matters that Snyder
changed certain aspects of the story, including

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.080
the ending, and that didn’t sit well with
longtime fans.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.520
Though Watchmen was well-received, it struggled
somewhat at the box office.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.350
The Dark Knight Rises

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.560
After The Dark Knight redefined superhero
films forever, moviegoers everywhere could

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.560
not wait for the sequel.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.659
While it got plenty of strong reviews, The
Dark Knight Rises wasn’t nearly as acclaimed.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.549
Many pointed out several plot holes and gaps
in logic, which made the story somewhat messy

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.810
– a stark contrast from the tight execution
of the first films in the trilogy.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.750
However, several fans were able to look past
the flaws and appreciate the finale as a rousing,

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.840
emotional end to one of the finest film series
in the 21st century.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.219
There’s no denying that the movie is exciting.

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:50.219
Iron Man 3

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:54.189
Shane Black stepped in for Jon Favreau for
Iron Man 3, looking to bring the series back

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.159
to the limelight after the second film let
fans down.

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.520
Unfortunately, Black couldn’t recapture
the magic of the 2008 original.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.529
It’s true that RDJ was in top form and the
film delivered plenty of comedy and action,

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:08.739
but the twist involving the Mandarin infuriated
longtime readers of the comic book, upset

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.370
at the handling of Iron Man’s nemesis.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.590
It was also seen as a wasted opportunity to
create a legion of suits only for them all

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.651
to be destroyed at the end.

00:02:15.651 --> 00:02:18.200
And taking out the shrapnel from Tony’s
chest?

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.750
That’s a big no-no.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.920
The Amazing Spider-Man

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.990
Rebooting the franchise just five years after
Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man 3, the marketing

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.250
for The Amazing Spider-Man promised “the
untold story” about Peter Parker.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.870
What they got was more or less a remake of
Raimi’s 2002 original, playing back several

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.590
of the same story beats to set up Peter Parker
as the iconic web slinger.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.091
This didn’t sit well with many, but there
are those who prefer Andrew Garfield’s take

00:02:40.091 --> 00:02:43.420
on the character, seeing him as a better Spider-Man
than Tobey Maguire.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.730
Garfield’s performance was a strong point
of the films, but the mixed reaction to the

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.350
series as a whole has caused the studio to
go in a different direction.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.350
The Wolverine

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.840
Following 2009’s disaster X-Men Origins,
2013’s The Wolverine was sure to be an improvement…

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.100
up to a certain point.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.790
The first two acts were very well-received,
with fans praising the story and Hugh Jackman’s

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:03.790
performance as the titular mutant.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.130
But how one enjoys the overall movie depends
on their perception of the third act.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.320
Many took issue with what was seen as a generic
comic book movie fight as Wolverine went toe-to-toe

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.070
with a version of the Silver Samurai.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.680
It was hardly the most compelling set piece
and threatened to derail the movie.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.490
Hopefully Wolverine 3 can be a more consistent
effort – with or without the R rating.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.680
The Incredible Hulk

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.290
Hulk solo movies are hard to do.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.120
Ang Lee’s version failed in 2003, and the
2008 reboot didn’t do much better.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.569
Rebooting the character to fit within the
Marvel Cinematic Universe, it was seen as

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.540
a marginal improvement at best.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.150
Fans enjoyed star Ed Norton’s turn, and
the Hulk action was fun to watch on the big

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.150
screen.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.350
Still, some criticized the film for being
just a basic superhero film that didn’t

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.610
dive too deep into substance, trying to distance
itself from the criticisms of the 2003 movie.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.430
It’s no surprise that a Hulk standalone
sequel hasn’t been made yet, though characters

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.520
from the film are starting to pop up again
in the MCU.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.560
Batman Returns

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.640
Tim Burton helped usher in superhero movies
for a new generation with 1989’s Batman,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.720
but the sequel wasn’t as big a hit.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.011
Though many gravitated towards the darker
tone and performances of the leads, there

00:04:04.011 --> 00:04:05.570
were plenty who were not impressed.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.130
Batman Returns upset a number of parents,
who felt that the violence and sexual references

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.290
throughout the film were unsuitable for youngsters.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.730
As a result, McDonald’s shut down their
Happy Meal promotion and the film took in

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.060
less at the box office, setting the franchise
down a dark road it took years to recover

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.060
from.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.350
This is why studios like to make things family
friendly.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.350
Ant-Man

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.460
A solid entry in the Marvel canon, Ant-Man
was seen by many as a fun heist film propelled

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.210
by a standout performance from Paul Rudd.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.130
The smaller scale was also greatly appreciated,
after many MCU movies put the entire planet

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.130
at risk.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.169
However, the lingering question about Ant-Man
will always be what Edgar Wright would have

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:37.169
done with the material.

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.970
That’s not to take anything away from Peyton
Reed, it’s just that some moviegoers feel

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.780
that the product we got could have had a more
unique spin if the Corneto trilogy director

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.780
was at the helm.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.969
We’ll never know for sure, but at least
Ant-Man wasn’t a disaster.

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:51.219
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:52.219
We’ll admit.

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:54.629
There aren’t that many fans of this movie.

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:57.909
Still, the portrayal of the Silver Surfer
character was well received, and many were

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:01.960
hoping that one day the character could get
his own spinoff film to flesh him out further.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.129
Those wishes were dashed when the film underperformed
at the box office and was panned by critics,

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:07.819
a result that killed the franchise instantly.

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:10.930
We’re still trying to figure out what they
were thinking with Galactus.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.830
Fox still doesn’t know how to properly handle
this property, so it could be a while before

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.180
the Silver Surfer gets his shot at cinematic
redemption.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.539
Those are our picks for the most divisive
comic book movies.

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:20.960
Are there any we missed?

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.139
