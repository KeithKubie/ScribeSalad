00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.445
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.570
- Welcome back to
Inter Sections.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.210
We're now beginning
panel number two

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.930
which will be moderated by
Dr. Erik Ghenoiu who will now

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.290
come to the podium and tell
you about the panel so welcome

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.644
back.

00:00:21.644 --> 00:00:23.632
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.470
- So panel two--

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.530
we now want to open up the
discussion to questions

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:39.460
of the relationship of the
city to our concept of nature

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.340
and the role that
technology can play

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.720
in mediating and reinforming
that relationship.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.030
So we're all familiar with the
kind of ecological problems

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.730
and technological
opportunities that

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.230
are faced by the contemporary
city in that the city kind

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.840
of creates and
conditions around it.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.210
We talk about it all the time.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.120
But within that, we
mean not only kind of

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.820
like pollution and
the what's happening

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.680
to natural landscapes,
but also the kind

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.370
of social issues of social
justice and long term

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.970
viability of the
planet that's become

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.180
kind of a touchstone for modern
debates about the environment.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.110
But in relationship
to that, I think

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.810
something that helps us maybe
move a little further forward

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.690
in that discussion
is an emerging

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.360
debate from many fields
calling into question

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.900
the terms with which we
discuss these things.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.400
So I think of people
like cultural critics

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.990
and social scientists
who question

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.890
the idea that our effects
on the environment

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.680
are all kind of one thing,
but rather kind of identifying

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.560
the specific actions,
even historically,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.300
the kind of role of capitalism.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.200
The specific and more
recent and taking apart

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.320
the package of man's
impact on the world

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.930
into the kind of
political realities

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.290
that generated that impact.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.100
And I think of people like the
philosophers and environmental

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.760
theorists who call into
question the very idea of nature

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.310
as something that's
not real that's.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.290
That was always
a kind of conceit

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.370
of a pure pristine thing
that we can be other than

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.790
and that we can kind of
hold up on a pedestal

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.750
that kind of frees us from
the dirty responsibility

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.340
of participation and a critical
engagement with an environment

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.190
of which we are, after
all, also a part.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.670
And so thinking in
that kind of tradition,

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.190
I think the question that
we want to look at today

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.080
is what does it mean in light
of these kind of grand problems

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.340
that we all face and in
light of a kind of critique

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.650
of the idea of the
natural and what role

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.960
man's actions, both
cultural and technological,

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.000
can play in relationship to it?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
What role is there for critical
practice in different fields?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.890
And so to ask that question, we
have our distinguished guests.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.480
So in order that
they will speak,

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.990
we have Dilip da Cunha,
the architect and planner

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.170
who's really one of
the leading voices

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.590
to think about the relationship
of natural and cultural

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.220
landscapes in much more
than just an ecological way,

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.010
but in many ways.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.310
Anna Schuleit Haber,
the artist, who's

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.430
explored a lot of questions
around the meaning

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.160
of our relationship
to the environment.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.910
If the urban is always the
sort of relationship of us

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.480
to these physical spaces
and places and memories,

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.520
then kind of exploring
the implications

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.740
of that that can be kind
of carried further forward.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.160
And then third, we'll hear from
Anja Thierfelder and Matthias

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.740
Schuler who work kind
of across the kind

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.040
of technological relationship
with climate and nature

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.912
both on the kind of massive
scale of real advising

00:04:01.912 --> 00:04:03.370
of huge projects
that are going on,

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.820
but also in the most aesthetic
and critically informed

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.060
kind of refined ways, as
well, through their art

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.650
and architecture installations.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.199
So without further ado, let me
hand over the podium to Dilip.

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.649
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.790
- Thank you very much, Erik,
and thank you for inviting me.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.870
When we see water doing
what water is doing today,

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.080
I think it is time to not
just think differently.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.090
It's not just time to
see things differently.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.140
I think it is time to see
different things so I'm

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:59.100
going to make sort of lay
out a possibility, perhaps

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.900
a bold possibility.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.100
I'm going to pause at, actually,
the possibility that we have

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.240
got nature wrong to
begin with or perhaps,

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.080
we've got the wrong nature.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.260
Now I'm going to share with you
actually two projects that we

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.360
see here on the
left and the right.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.330
Projects each opening
the possibility

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.720
of a different nature.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.090
Now, it won't follow
this structure,

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.150
but if I just move to the next
slide, what I'm going to do

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.670
is actually I'm going to
have convention on the left

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.000
and I'm going to have
possibility on the right.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.130
So first, Bombay.

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.200
I know Sooni's sort of
pointed out the fact,

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.740
actually, that Mumbai is
associated with the Shiv Sena

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.696
and it has cultural
connotations.

00:05:43.696 --> 00:05:45.070
I mean, the way
I'm using it, you

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.390
will see is the
possibility that maybe we

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.460
can see a different place.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.770
And so what I am
suggesting, actually,

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:59.290
is that Bombay is the island
city that the British saw

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.090
and that we still
continue to see

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.840
as an island and a
city that is an island.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.570
But Mumbai, opening the
possibility that Mumbai

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:08.740
is an estuary.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.470
And what does that do,
actually, to planning

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:12.910
and the shift in thinking.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.410
The way in which
we see an estuary--

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.650
I mean, we know of an
estuary as the mouth

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:23.140
of a river like a delta, except
that the sea comes in as much

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.280
as the water goes out.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.970
But in a delta, its more the
river that dominates the sea.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.620
But what I want
to suggest here is

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.667
that in India during
the monsoons when water

00:06:31.667 --> 00:06:33.250
is everywhere, water
doesn't have time

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.812
to find lines on the map
and so it just flows off

00:06:37.812 --> 00:06:39.770
and so you have an estuary
all along the coast.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.040
So it's a meeting ground,
actually, of land and sea,

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.800
if you will.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.010
So on the one hand, you see
and plan and you see and plan,

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.730
you draw a line.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.610
I mean, that's how we got
the coast and the coast

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.550
is actually solidified
into the strong line

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.880
as you can see in this
trajectory of maps.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.030
On the other hand, an
estuary is open to the sea

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.400
and so it calls for
seeing in section.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.990
It calls for seeing depth.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.130
It calls for seeing
actually in time

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:12.250
so there's a rhythm, actually,
as opposed to this divide.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.510
So on the one hand, we
have marginalized the sea

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:20.650
by drawing that line and
so you have land and sea.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.990
But then you've also
marginalized the monsoon

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.030
because then the monsoon
comes as a visitor,

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.920
visits land and goes on.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.150
That's the way we see it.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.310
So this is a place
where I would like

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.220
to see the monsoon as a
resident, not as a visitor.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.130
So what does it mean,
actually, to shift our mindset

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.040
to an estuary that is
home to the monsoon

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.370
and not to the place
for the monsoon

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:47.440
to be an annual visitor because
in that particular role,

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.300
actually, the
monsoon is becoming

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.210
more and more a kind
of enemy and you're

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:53.900
waiting with anxiety
for the monsoon

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.410
because it brings flood--

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.484
that's what it does.

00:07:57.484 --> 00:07:59.650
Then on the one hand, I
mean the convention actually

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.200
could suggest instead of viewing
and plan, you see land use.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.020
You see land use, you see
land divides and so the island

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.180
that you saw there
becomes a smaller island

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.490
and then it divides
into smaller places

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:10.870
and that's how you plan--

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.997
planning is in plan.

00:08:13.997 --> 00:08:15.580
It's not just
foresight, it's actually

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.650
comes with a particular
perception and reading

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:21.310
of ground and terrain that
may stem from geography,

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.950
but then, perhaps, geography
is problematic to begin with.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.580
So what happens, actually,
when you see in section

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.160
and you begin to see
there are practices?

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.800
You don't see land uses,
you see practices in time.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.049
And so when you get the boat
pulled up in the monsoon,

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:37.539
you get activities
in Bombay that

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:39.580
operate actually on
the basis of time,

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.169
not on the basis of space.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:45.167
And so that's what you
see in an estuary--

00:08:45.167 --> 00:08:46.750
at least I want to
suggest that that's

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.339
what you see in an estuary.

00:08:48.339 --> 00:08:50.380
So what do you have,
actually, are two paradigms.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.310
On the one hand,
you have a flood

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.790
in drain paradigm where
you're actually draining water

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.190
off the land because
that's the divide that you

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:00.530
[? had educated ?] into because
you separated water from land,

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:03.159
flowing, draining,
et cetera, flooding.

00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:03.700
It's a flood.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.720
There's nothing
but water crossing

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.950
a line that were drawn.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.830
Flood-- if anybody tells you
it's natural, don't believe it.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:09.470
It's not.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.277
It's water crossing a line
that has been drawn so it's not

00:09:12.277 --> 00:09:14.110
about where you draw
the line, it's the fact

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:16.300
that you do draw a line.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.180
On the other hand, you
have a whole soak paradigm

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.850
and an estuary, actually,
where water is held.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:25.895
And so when I hold rain,
it's very different way

00:09:25.895 --> 00:09:26.710
of actually seeing.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:27.970
I don't see flowing.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:29.200
I don't see draining.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.560
I don't see rivers,
actually, I just see rain.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.560
It requires a certain
dryness to see rivers

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.592
and I want to suggest--

00:09:36.592 --> 00:09:38.800
I think I'm just going to
pass over this because this

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:43.960
is what happens, actually, in
a project where possibility

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.320
defies convention.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.790
We look differently,
we see differently,

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:52.510
and we draw differently and
then we appropriate the ground

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:53.440
differently--

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.970
I won't have time
to actually spend

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:58.630
on the details of this
project, but you will find it

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:02.080
in various articles--

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.210
but walking by
anchors, holdings,

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:07.270
things that live lightly
in a ground in an estuary

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:12.040
rather than this master
planning that just

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.080
fails again and again.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.270
So if I had to generalize
from this paradigm

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:21.750
now into what I really
mean, actually, perhaps

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.830
more universally, I would
suggest that taking [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:29.820
cycle, water cycle, that we
have actually chosen on the left

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:33.120
by convention to inhabit one
particular moment in time

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.630
in the hydrologic cycle when
water can be held in a place

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.070
so it's the realm of flows.

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:43.050
So I had to look at the water
cycle as going this way--

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.670
the flow formation,
evaporation, cloud formation,

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:48.300
and precipitation--

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.730
we have chosen this moment
to construct a reality

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:55.020
and we made all the other
moments of water ephemeral.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.750
And so rain is a
visitor, snow's a visitor

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.100
and they're not residents.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.782
I want to suggest,
actually, that there's

00:11:01.782 --> 00:11:03.990
a possibility of actually
changing the moment in time

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.970
in which we construct reality,
in which we construct nature.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:10.050
So if rivers are not
natural, perhaps rain is.

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:14.250
And then you get a
completely different ground.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:16.140
So what does it mean,
actually, to design

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.940
with ubiquitous
wetness as opposed

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.890
to the land water divide?

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:22.770
And would that suggest a
completely different set

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:27.690
of disciplines by which we
learn a different understanding

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:31.680
of the world, really?

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.260
So this I suggest for the
ground of the monsoon,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.520
but I also suggest that it is
a possibility across the world

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.270
that we choose a
different moment in which

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:45.990
to construct reality and to
make other moments ephemeral.

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:47.357
How much time do I have?

00:11:47.357 --> 00:11:47.940
Oh, it's here.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.410
OK, I do have time.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:52.290
So on the one hand,
what I'm suggesting is

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:55.680
that our nature is by choice--

00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:00.030
that nature is not a given.

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:02.440
This is a subject of
study for the last five,

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.680
six years now and it's turned
into a book that suggests that

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:11.340
rivers are inventions and
that they had been made over

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.940
the years, actually, by literacy
that has separated water from

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.150
land that cannot be
assumed to be natural.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:19.340
So what does that mean?

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.040
And you know, it
goes back, actually,

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.060
to the school of Miletus in
the sixth century BC where

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.790
this act of drawing the line
and separating water from land

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:30.210
was a necessity, actually,
for the Greeks of the school

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:33.690
of Miletus and they imposed
it in a set of disciplines

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:34.510
across the world.

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.240
So you know Alfred
North Whitehead

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.460
is famous for saying
that all philosophy is

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.760
a footnote to Plato, but then
if you look at what Plato was

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.006
a footnote to,
we'll find that he

00:12:44.006 --> 00:12:45.630
was a footnote to
the school of Miletus

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:47.160
and their laying
out of an Earth.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.580
Some so material actually
came before philosophizing,

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:56.570
if you will, if I can sort of
make a kind of claim there.

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:59.400
So what I'm suggesting over
here is another moment,

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.230
another time, and
another nature.

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:07.970
Well, just to give you another
project, in coastal Virginia,

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:10.860
we're working
there on the coast.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.860
So here I want to suggest,
actually, that on the one hand,

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:18.430
you have a coastline
where the water's coming

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.820
and we have been in
a community meeting

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.420
where people have been
to a drumbeat saying

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.860
water's coming, water's
coming because it is coming.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.870
In Norfolk, they feel
the seas coming in,

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.960
but that's because we made the
sea an outsider and an enemy.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.210
So what is this paradigm
that has actually

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:40.184
constructed that people have
this rising fear of the sea?

00:13:40.184 --> 00:13:41.850
And I want to suggest,
actually, there's

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:45.180
a whole other way of looking
at this place at Norfolk

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.230
and really looking at the
tide-- you might know what

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:50.370
is tidewater
country which refers

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:53.130
to the whole of the
Southern Chesapeake.

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:56.040
So on the one hand, you have a
coastline that have been drawn

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.250
and it actually was drawn only
when the Europeans actually

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:00.510
arrived here.

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.520
It was a series
of frontiers that

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.000
came that came across and then
went across the United States,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.266
but there was always a line
that began with the East

00:14:08.266 --> 00:14:09.390
Coast of the United States.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:11.910
And the further you went,
the more reinforced this line

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.580
became between land and sea.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.610
And so there are only two
choices then one has over here

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:21.630
and that is either attack
the sea or defend or retreat,

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.910
I should say, defend
against a sea of retreat.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:25.890
So you're talking
with levees, they're

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:27.780
talking about the
mouth of the Chesapeake

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:31.710
with gates and all kinds
of ideas like that.

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:34.590
Oh, and somebody
told me and they say,

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:36.660
I've got a solution for Norfolk.

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.900
Take all these people and
put them in West Virginia.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.940
I mean, from that sense
of the retreat following,

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.710
this thing has its own
sort of absurdities.

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:49.380
But what we suggest
is turn the coast.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.090
Instead of looking
at the line this way,

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.800
look at the line this way.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.600
Turn the point, I should say.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.180
Instead of joining
the points like that,

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:00.530
open the points this way so
that you allow the sea in.

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:02.250
And then what does that mean?

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:04.320
I mean you get a completely
different paradigm.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.921
So here you have barriers
and gates and retreat

00:15:06.921 --> 00:15:08.670
and then you have high
ground, low ground,

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:11.220
so water doesn't actually
flood, doesn't cross the line.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.380
Water just rises and
falls and that's the way,

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.640
actually, the Indians
lived in the Mississippi

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.720
or the Native Americans lived
in the Mississippi as opposed

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.770
to this one where you
actually then have a levee

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:22.017
and you live across the line.

00:15:22.017 --> 00:15:24.100
But this goes into all
deltas and it goes actually

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.380
to the coast, as well.

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.770
So you have a paradigm of
fingers of high ground.

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:31.100
It would be called fingers
of ground and on this side,

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.960
you have levee systems
like New Orleans,

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.980
but you might be a little
more intelligent today

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:40.210
and actually divide Norfolk into
a number of bowls, if you will.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:41.710
So if one floods,
the other doesn't.

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:44.680
But this is actually
constructing risk.

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.860
And so what is a
system that one wants?

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.670
Does one want to define
risk in this manner

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:54.770
or actually allow for
resilience not to take place

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:59.425
and, in fact, I missed
that slide earlier on.

00:15:59.425 --> 00:16:02.136
Yeah, here, where they talk
about two kinds of resilience--

00:16:02.136 --> 00:16:03.760
one is a recovery
from disaster and one

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.310
is not getting to disaster
in the first place.

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:08.650
And it's difficult to
actually argue that,

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.110
but it's easy to
design it, if you will.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.890
So what happens here?

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:18.380
This is just a project that
suggests how this can be done

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:22.396
and we do it in two
places, two sites.

00:16:22.396 --> 00:16:23.770
What does it mean
down the coast?

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.800
How does one work with
communities in order to do it?

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.840
How does one do it over--

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.580
like I always say, it's taken us
500 years to get into the soup,

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.760
it will take us another
500 years to get out of it.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.910
So why don't we start
with that structuring,

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:40.587
but it requires a completely
different mindset and approach

00:16:40.587 --> 00:16:42.670
that goes down to, actually,
the way we understand

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.840
our disciplines.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.460
So this just gives
you a sense, actually,

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.940
of how the project develops
and evolves over time

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:56.290
and how we can sort of
meet the sea in points,

00:16:56.290 --> 00:17:01.600
like that, as opposed to a
line, like that, and accommodate

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.072
water treatment
systems with the sea.

00:17:04.072 --> 00:17:05.530
There are many,
many different ways

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:08.710
by which we allowed
this meeting ground

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:12.460
to occur in a more open manner.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:15.130
So you see, actually,
the existing condition

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:17.079
here on the left.

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:19.380
To some extent,
this is recovering

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:22.161
what we have lost by the
filling of our creeks

00:17:22.161 --> 00:17:23.619
and the destruction
of high ground.

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:25.869
I mean, Boston is a
classic example, actually,

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:28.750
of the flattening of terrain
and now we're doing everything

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:29.720
to regret it now.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.980
You What do we do to
recover our high grounds

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.340
and to recover creek systems
that were pooling systems,

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:39.090
not flowing systems-- pooling
systems with fantastic

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:44.020
ecologies which we
can recover, but it

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.090
means recovering low
ground and you can only

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:49.630
recover low ground if you start
reconstructing high ground.

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:53.050
So I won't go into how we
are doing it in Norfolk.

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:57.580
There are many ways
that we can and we've

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:00.070
established that possibility.

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:02.320
I think I've reached
the end of my show here.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:08.205
And this is I dared to take on
Einstein a little bit here so I

00:18:08.205 --> 00:18:10.330
say that we cannot solve
our problems with the same

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:10.930
thinking.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:12.346
I mean, he said
the same thinking,

00:18:12.346 --> 00:18:15.400
I'm saying you cannot solve the
problems with the same nature

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.460
that went into creating them.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.760
So what I'm
suggesting is that we

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.740
got to start thinking of
another place, another time.

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:24.588
Thank you.

00:18:24.588 --> 00:18:27.028
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:39.110
- It is such an
honor to be back.

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:41.690
I love this place
and its people and I

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:44.930
thank the staff so very
much for having organized

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:48.350
this conference with these
incredibly inspiring colleagues

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:49.340
of mine.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.530
Thank you for being here.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:57.740
I am going to give you a
glimpse of my creative process.

00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:01.370
Some of the projects that touch
on urbanism, specifically,

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:07.140
and some that, perhaps, hope
to expand the concept of it.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.435
My work often
begins with a site,

00:19:09.435 --> 00:19:15.340
a setting that needs to be
explored, that can be wandered,

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:18.240
of which I then
become the wanderer.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.300
They're public and
not so public sites.

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.450
I'm drawn to the
more hidden corners

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.810
of public life, the blurred
edges of our communities,

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:30.120
large and small.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.160
At the Rhode Island School
of Design, I studied painting

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.270
and if you held
a gun to my head,

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:36.520
I would say that's what I am--

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:37.920
I am a painter--

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:42.120
but everything that I've
done since studying painting

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.360
and graduating as a
painter has sort of

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:50.700
explored the edges of
painting and wandered off

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.790
into larger media.

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:57.000
I had to accept painting
as a two dimensional medium

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.830
and wondered how that medium
would relate to the surrounding

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:05.280
world, it's outside sources.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.370
So I came to my work as a
pedestrian with the wish

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.770
to somehow capture the
enormous architecture

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:14.820
I was interested in at that
time as a young student,

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.910
specifically
psychiatric hospitals,

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.430
through drawings and paintings.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:23.880
From across the
overgrown lawn, I

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:28.140
recorded my walks using
them as my hand-drawn record

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.990
of my interaction with the site.

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:33.620
Based on my interest in
map reading and mapmaking,

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:39.450
they became a form of
remembered orientation in space.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:44.670
And my first works were
a failing of painting

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:48.030
and that I realized
there's really no reason

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:51.920
to paint these buildings but to
collect what's already there,

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.700
to gather what's already there.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:58.410
And passing through each
room in these institutions,

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:00.420
I would take a paint sample--

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:03.330
it was all lead paint.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:08.370
So this is my walk through
the building in linear terms

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:10.620
from left to right.

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:14.790
And the larger boxes
are larger spaces,

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:18.490
the smaller ones, the square
ones, are patient cells.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:26.270
In its widest sense, I'm
curious about the imprint

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:30.290
that the urban environment has
on us as its users, citizens,

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:33.230
and the members of
the communities--

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:37.080
how we navigate our environment,
how we make sense of it,

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.080
how we derive meaning
from it, and how

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:43.250
we give back meaning to it.

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:51.220
I found this place in outside
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.180
This is the Dixmont
State Hospital--

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.970
the center of it, before
it was torn down--

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:59.520
and the oculus
that you see there

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:04.080
has, as Dorothea Dix, the
reformer of the 19th century

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.320
said, one of the most beautiful
views of North America.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:14.570
The French philosopher
Gaston Bachelard

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:17.210
described the
motionless daydreamer

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:20.330
as experiencing an
immensity of being.

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:23.540
He said immensity
is within ourselves.

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:27.080
It is attached to a sort of
expansion of being that life

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.230
curbs and caution arrests,
but which starts again

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:31.640
when we were alone.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:36.500
As soon as we become motionless,
we are dreaming in a world that

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:37.790
is a man's.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:44.320
Indeed, immensity is the
movement of motionless man.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:49.900
So my first project, one
that is I think breaking away

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.470
from urbanism, was
a daydream to me

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:59.230
and it was cited here at this
hospital, Northampton State

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:03.340
Hospital, with its
vast interiors,

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:08.600
hallways that would allow
a car to pass through.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.350
It was a large scale
science specific sound voice

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:13.120
performance at
Northampton State Hospital

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.560
spanning 414,000 square feet
of connected space using

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:22.560
the hallways and rooms of
the abandoned structure.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.070
Like the insides of an
instrument, a sound body,

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.680
this was my first
project that took me

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.420
beyond the parameters
of painting

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:33.460
clearly and placed me in a more
experimental and performative

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:36.360
realm.

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.820
It was a form of
architectural dreaming

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:42.960
without touching the building
at all because sound lives in it

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.480
and then disappears again.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.580
I was able to work with
the entire building

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:52.170
without moving an inch
of it or any of it.

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:54.540
I realized the painting
was not large enough,

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:56.920
not inclusive enough.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.650
Sound was the only
medium for me.

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:01.990
I thought I could animate
the entire architecture

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:05.110
without disturbing it,
interrupting it, reshaping

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:06.140
it, or reducing it.

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:14.690
So this was the set up we strung
thousands of feet of cable

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:18.860
through the building and
connected the entire hospital

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.250
with itself.

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:26.140
And this is the back wards.

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:31.410
This is where patients
used to be who were violent

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:34.710
and often there
for decades on end.

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:38.790
And the sound was meant to be
bounced through the building

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:41.040
by bouncing it off
a surface first.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.020
We didn't let it get
out of the windows

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.660
right away, but rather
using the building

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:52.170
to take on its
color, it's solidity,

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:53.670
and changing the sound thereby.

00:24:56.570 --> 00:25:01.320
The sound I chose was Johann
Sebastian Bach's Magnificat

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.620
because I had been a
choir girl and because I

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:08.400
love that piece of music
and because I remembered it

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.390
every time I was
in this building--

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:15.500
like a physical memory,
it came back to me.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.750
So this is the
solarium it was called

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:24.760
in one of the easier units where
patients had small freedoms.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.370
And then we invited
an unknown public

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:29.560
to come and listen to this.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.050
The entire thing
was only 28 minutes.

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:35.050
It took four years
to do and we didn't

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:37.810
know who was going to come,
but the state hospital

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:41.320
was long closed and there was
no trespassing, of course,

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:46.060
and we broke the rules for that
one day for that one half hour

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:47.260
and thousands showed up.

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:51.530
This was in Northampton,
Massachusetts.

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:54.140
And I didn't let people
into the building

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.620
for, obviously,
liability reasons,

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:59.360
but I also didn't want
them to play haunted house.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.120
I wanted them to give
the building its presence

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.470
and allow the building to sound.

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:07.690
And this is how some of
the people experienced it.

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:17.130
I went back to painting so
back to recording my walks

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:23.070
and I didn't know
how after doing

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:27.120
that, after connecting with an
entire community of volunteers,

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:32.760
sound engineers, politicians,
lobbyists, students,

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.520
I would then go back to
being a single painter.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.820
And I decided that that's
just all I wanted to do,

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:42.270
but the next project was
a project which I'm just

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:44.850
going to show two slides of.

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:48.210
It was for the Massachusetts
Mental Health Center

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:49.860
here in Boston.

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.770
The same sort of building,
but very different.

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:59.280
50 years later, it closed
and Harvard Medical School

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:02.730
Department of Psychiatry
asked me to do the music again

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:04.800
and I decided I wasn't
going to do that--

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.870
that was site
specific, but I was

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:10.140
going to work with a building
in a different way and by then,

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:16.680
I had experienced hospitals
as a visiting artist

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.980
and I realized that patients
were not receiving any flowers.

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:25.440
So we gathered-- we, my
team of 80 and myself--

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:30.610
gathered 28,000
flowers and spread them

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:33.820
throughout the building in
a gesture of giving back

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:35.320
to the building
that which had been

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:40.030
missing since patients
in psychiatry rarely

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:43.140
receive flowers.

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:47.940
The project existed for four
days, not 28 minutes, four days

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:52.410
and afterwards, we returned all
the flowers which were potted--

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:53.560
none of them were cut--

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.760
to people behind bars.

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.420
So what I learned in public
art projects was became

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:05.030
crucial what then
happened which was

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:08.600
I wanted to connect with sites
and settings on a large scale,

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.630
but I didn't want to make
public art, I wanted to paint.

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:13.040
The next project
was a commission

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:17.750
for a very ugly concrete
wall in Western Massachusetts

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:20.720
on the campus of UMass Amherst.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.780
And I proposed to
paint a large painting

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:25.670
and they were very disappointed.

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:27.800
They wanted something
spectacularly

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.780
strange and
interdisciplinary and I

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:33.110
said it's just going
to be a painting.

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:35.780
But the painting I
conceived of was the face

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.550
of an agricultural worker--

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:39.944
it used to be an
agricultural school--

00:28:39.944 --> 00:28:42.110
that I found in the archives
doing my research there

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:46.220
and all I wanted to
do was to paint it

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:52.910
upside down so that you would
only see it in the water.

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:55.400
I did not tell anyone
how to use this work,

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.250
but wanted students
to discover it.

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:02.120
So it was called Just a
Rumor and the ducks that

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:06.800
live on this pond became my
collaborators because they

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.951
would wipe out the entire
painting by swimming

00:29:08.951 --> 00:29:09.950
through it all the time.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:18.090
There's one photo and this is it
that shows, oh, you can see it,

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:21.380
but it's a little dark, but
there are four ducks parked

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:23.960
in the face without swimming,
they're not pedaling,

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.220
and therefore you can see it.

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:29.330
They're just asleep
on the surface.

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:32.810
And then it froze and
we all forgot about it

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:34.999
and when spring came, it
thawed and we remembered

00:29:34.999 --> 00:29:36.290
that the piece was still there.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.130
And based on that, I
went back to my studio

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:45.970
again as a painter, as someone
who loves to draw and paint

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:52.240
with my pens and brushes,
and I felt what if I create

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:57.340
works that work with that
scale, but are using my most

00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:00.910
beloved medium in another way.

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:03.460
And I was offered by
neuroscientists at Columbia

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:07.150
Medical School to collaborate
with them on a project that

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:10.930
uses eye tracking technology
that is attached to your pupil

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:12.940
so you don't use your
hands at all to draw,

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.912
but you use your eyes only.

00:30:14.912 --> 00:30:16.870
And this is a drawing,
this is my first drawing

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:19.440
ever with my pupil only.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.540
A camera records
where I'm looking

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:26.660
and each glance, every
direction my eyes make,

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:29.650
is recorded so I have to
be very careful and slow.

00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:33.370
And this is a bicycle on the
right side going down hill--

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:36.130
you can maybe tell.

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:40.030
And based on that,
I decided what

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:46.450
if I create live drawings that
are truly touching the surfaces

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:48.220
I'm interested in,
those buildings

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:53.590
and sites and settings, for
example, a stage with dancers.

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:56.500
I was offered a
collaboration with dancers.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:31:00.460
This is a draft for it and
then this was the actual dance.

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:03.610
The person, the dancer,
had taken a break

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:06.700
after a solo, laid
down, and I was

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:09.880
able to draw her
a blanket of lines

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.340
by using very high
tech projectors in New

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:17.750
York on a beautiful stage and it
was a live drawing performance.

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:19.450
So that's what I'm doing now.

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:22.690
I'm creating these drawings
that happen in actual time.

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:25.600
They're not canned,
they're not video.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:31.950
This is an eye
tracking drawing that I

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:34.800
conceived for that Cooper
Hewitt Museum in New York.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:35.880
This is the facade of it.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.910
It was not realized
because of budget reasons,

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:44.580
but it was a drawing I did with
my eyes looking at a Man Ray

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.130
photograph that you all
know, with the eyelashes

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:47.850
and the tear.

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:53.070
And the straight
lines that come off it

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:56.520
are lines that are
made by my blinking.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.450
And most recently,
these are smaller scale,

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:07.710
but still wall sized
live drawings transmitted

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:11.820
from New Orleans to Hanover,
New Hampshire for the Dartmouth

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:13.830
Biannual.

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:16.230
Every morning, I
made a drawing that

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:22.980
was wired over to Dartmouth and
it was projected onto this wall

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:24.660
very slowly.

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:29.700
So these are drawings created
for that wall in my absence

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:34.520
by me in a different state.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.790
And we did 90 of these indoor
drawings-- one every day--

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:42.680
and then 12 for the outdoor
courtyard of the Hood Museum.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:51.960
So here is one of them and
here is another and another.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.180
This is a goat, of course.

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:58.380
And this is my
last slide for now,

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:06.130
a drawing of a hand created
live so it is moving.

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:08.850
So this is just a still of
that touching the surface

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:10.130
of the Hood Museum's back.

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:17.060
I am so grateful
to have been here.

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:18.317
Thank you so much.

00:33:18.317 --> 00:33:20.702
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:26.999 --> 00:33:28.540
- Good afternoon
and thanks, as well,

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:31.600
for the invitation by
the Radcliffe Institute.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:36.700
We are very honored to be here
and we will talk about nature,

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:40.730
technology, and culture.

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:41.270
- OK.

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:46.240
Our panel is called "Beyond the
Nature and Technology Divide."

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:50.120
And my first thought as an
architect hearing this title

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:54.540
was, if there is a dividing line
between nature and technology,

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:57.215
jumping over it is the
typical behavior for people

00:33:57.215 --> 00:34:02.810
who have the profession of my
husband or climate engineers.

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:06.430
Because in their everyday
work, climate engineers

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:11.630
are measuring and
evaluating and interpreting

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:15.400
physical that is natural--

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.290
parametrics about
temperature, about light,

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:23.540
material, concluding technical
concepts out of them.

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:28.010
As soon as these concepts become
part of architecture or, even

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:32.600
more complex, part of urban
planning and these projects

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:37.360
get realized by
interdisciplinary teams,

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:40.940
culture pops up
as the term which

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:44.690
besides nature and technology.

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:48.770
These three terms became
the title of our talk

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:52.050
and the basis for our
thoughts and research.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:00.680
To get familiar with the
urbanism in the global age,

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:05.150
we were tracing back
the history of settling

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:10.070
from today's megacities to
the very beginning of humanity

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:12.860
and human settlements.

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:17.450
We observed a specific
interdependence

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:19.910
of these three factors--

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:24.860
nature, technology,
and culture--

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:29.060
in every period of
settling and each factor

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:33.970
with different impact or
importance [? in ?] the period.

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:36.940
I don't know if
it's early for that.

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:42.020
Related to six billion
years of Earth's history

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:45.880
at a time 2.8 million years
since the genesis of humanity

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.460
is nearly nothing.

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:57.960
In the Pleistocene, 2.6 million
to 10,000 years before Christ,

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:01.520
is the first and very long
period of human settlement

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:04.950
and it's characterized
by a specific climate,

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:10.650
by the change between ice
ages and warmer periods.

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:12.930
At that time,
settlement was totally

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:17.940
based on nature and
natural conditions.

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:21.510
This cave is called Hohle Fels.

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:23.640
It's in southern Germany.

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:31.060
It was inhabited for a very long
time and remains of mammoths,

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:38.350
spears, and white horses were
found and the very first known

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:45.220
piece of art, this Venus, which
is about 35,000 years old.

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:49.060
It's like this,
carved from ivory

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:51.910
and a great cultural
contribution.

00:36:56.630 --> 00:37:00.200
After the last ice age,
climate stayed nearly constant

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:05.510
from 10,000 before Christ to
let's say 1800 after Christ.

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:10.920
This period is called Holocene
and the climate conditions

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:16.545
were very good for a
widespread cultural blooming.

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:21.810
Nearly everything
we call culture

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:25.320
was developed in this period--

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:33.220
writing, architecture, a lot
of new science, knowledge.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:43.010
It's no accident that all
the high culture developed

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:46.640
in this period in Egypt, all
over the world-- in China,

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.640
in the Middle East, and so on.

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:55.090
This diagram shows the
Holocene temperature profile

00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:56.800
I already mentioned.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:00.200
After the long
period with ice ages,

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:06.010
you can see that in the
Holocene, about 10,000 years,

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:10.450
temperature only decreases
for half a degree.

00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:14.800
And nowadays, we expect a
man-made temperature change

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:20.185
increase between 1.5 and
3 degrees within 50 years.

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.530
This picture of our
illuminated planet

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:29.170
represents the period
we are living in now.

00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:35.470
It's the Anthropocene, where
humans and man-made technology

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:38.650
determine the form,
the happenings,

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:41.320
and the evolution on Earth.

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:47.260
Every light spot represents a
big city and the light pattern

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:51.130
as a whole for me
gives an idea about all

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:57.400
issues of global urbanism,
about population explosion,

00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:03.190
about energy consumption, about
density, about neighborhoods

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:06.730
if we are so close together
and if we have so many,

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:13.180
about the demand
of land and food,

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.190
about scale, about
[? heimat-- ?]

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:19.620
it's typical German word
about responsibility,

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:24.130
identity maybe, individuality.

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:26.950
Now, while the
previous periods like

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:30.460
starting with the
Pleistocene, which

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:34.930
durated 2.8 million years
or 2.4 million years

00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:37.420
and then the Holocne
around 12,000 years,

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:41.500
finally our Anthropocene at the
moment is like 200 years old.

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.740
And it's called the time
of the big accelerations,

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:49.570
looking on development of
population on this planet,

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:52.360
material consumption, but
then as well the consequences

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:57.520
in respect of losing nature,
in this case other people

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:02.610
or created nature, but as well
kind of increasing pollution

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:06.780
effects that we are created
by our technology applying

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:10.970
to be able to live in
any spot on this planet.

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:14.210
There are consequences
out of it, a side of it

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:18.770
that, for example, here
a picture of Beijing,

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:22.340
the lower one represents
[? Beijing ?] of around 5%

00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:23.170
of the year.

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:27.440
85% of the year, the
air quality in Beijing

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:33.380
is described as unhealthy
or even hazardous.

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:36.800
And alone in China, they lose
like three million people

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:39.300
a year just by air pollution.

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:41.670
So [INAUDIBLE] it looks
like biotechnology

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:46.020
and our kind of leftovers
from our technology

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:49.190
we're kind of slowly
poisoning ourselves.

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:51.310
As a side effect,
we know and Anya

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:55.250
mentioned it, kind of
compared it to the Holocene

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:58.010
was 0.5 degrees
over 10,000 years,

00:40:58.010 --> 00:41:00.620
we are now in this
kind of 100 years

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:03.020
increase already in
certain spots temperature

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:06.200
of this planet by 2.5 degrees.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.900
And then coming back to
the first presentation,

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:13.210
in this case water will be our
big problem because suddenly,

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:16.160
and I think we can't solve
it probably with an estuary,

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:20.760
because [? interestingly ?]
now looking on this one,

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:24.360
we are what we describe
nature now suddenly

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.770
will endanger culture.

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:28.650
Because looking on all the
cultural cities along the East

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:32.460
Coast of North America,
they will be all gone.

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:36.090
So this in mind, but it's
not only endangering us,

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:40.300
it's as well endangering any
life on this planet, nature.

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:44.370
[? Like ?] nature, this
is kind of the birds,

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:49.020
the [? found ?] birds reduction
just looking over the last 20

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:54.000
years in this case in Germany,
looking back by the intensity

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.050
of our agriculture.

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:57.330
Increasing the intensity
of our aquaculture,

00:41:57.330 --> 00:42:00.000
we are cutting down the
population of birds.

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:05.970
And there have been
effects kind of looking

00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:10.290
on it that like in 2007, they
started to introduce kind

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:17.850
of bio gas in Germany, which
increased kind of a lot of corn

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:20.310
growing in Germany,
intensifying,

00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:24.300
creating big areas but kind of
cutting down the last refuges

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:25.440
for nature.

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.630
Now, what is interesting
on this one, which

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:30.990
describes the kind of
status of the habitats

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:34.140
of the different ecosystems,
just looking on three of them,

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:36.900
the ocean and the
cropland and the urban.

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:40.920
For the ocean, 85% of
the species in the ocean,

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:45.740
we don't know what is
their status because we

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:46.950
unknown their habits.

00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:50.070
What is interesting now looking
comparing cropland and urban,

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:52.890
and I think this is now quite
interesting for our discussion

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:56.640
on urban, that it looks
like nature in urban

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.580
can find niches to
survive compared

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:02.820
to intensive used
agricultural land

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:06.420
because there is a large
diversity in cities

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:09.540
and in natural
islands in the city.

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:11.790
There are no fertilizers
and there's no hunting.

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:23.280
These are [INAUDIBLE],
which I'm glad to say

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.730
there are a lot of
them and some of them

00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:27.290
are really almost unbelievable.

00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:32.000
These wild pigs
which live in Rome,

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.910
I heard, and the biggest
nightingale population

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:37.610
in Germany is in Berlin.

00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:43.040
The biggest hare population
lives in Stuttgart city center,

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.770
pumas in Los Angeles,
raccoons and foxes

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:50.870
I think in almost every
city of the world meanwhile.

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:53.210
What I found interesting
is that animals that

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:58.610
used to be afraid of people,
they are coming so close.

00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:06.056
This is a kind of adaption
which is another example.

00:44:06.056 --> 00:44:10.760
These are the [? storks. ?]
Only a few decades ago,

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:14.960
they left their territory if
somebody builds a small road

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:16.340
and divides it into two pieces.

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:21.710
In a very short time
later, nowadays storks

00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:24.290
have adapted to modern
living conditions.

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:27.740
They have even changed
their migration routes

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:30.140
and a lot of North
European storks

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:35.960
don't fly to Africa anymore and
spend the winter on waste dumps

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:38.890
in Spain eating leftovers.

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:45.990
This is an example
from Stuttgart,

00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:51.820
where they found a population
of a protected species of lizard

00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:57.030
which settled down
and used holding

00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:59.730
tracks off the main station.

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:03.930
And as the German railway
now wants to expand and build

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:06.780
something on this
site, they really

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:10.260
have a problem because following
the German law on nature

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:12.330
[? conservation, ?]
they have to organize

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:18.810
a complete resettlement
program for these lizards.

00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:21.440
Yeah.

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:21.990
Oh, yeah.

00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:23.320
OK.

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:31.390
So to be honest, I have a quite
romantic relation to nature.

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:36.580
And I wish I could believe
in a different nature.

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:39.670
I am not so sure.

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:45.130
But these niches and
the ability to adapt,

00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:47.780
that gives me some kind of hope.

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:53.410
And I would say that
just because there's

00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:57.940
a lack of space and land, I
think that nature will totally

00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:00.580
change and the scale
will totally change.

00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:06.080
There really will be
only spots of nature.

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:09.990
There are other people, wise
people like Stephen Hawking,

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:13.350
who are much less optimistic.

00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:18.620
And he suggested to seek
space, somewhere else.

00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:19.120
- Yeah.

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:21.120
Which is an interesting
position to think about,

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:24.740
that after a six billion
year life of this planet,

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:29.140
we messed it up in 200 years
and then escape to outer space.

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:30.070
But there is hope.

00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:33.170
We think technology and
nature can feed each other.

00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:36.720
And starting on one of our first
examples, this is Masdar City,

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.830
we already saw a picture today.

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:40.600
We worked with
Foster and Partners

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:43.990
on the master plan for this
first carbon neutral city

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:44.920
in the Middle East.

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:46.270
Now, what is the identity?

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:50.590
How we typically describe
a place of Abu Dhabi,

00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:53.110
you typically get
northwesterly winds.

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:55.900
These northwesterly winds
come over the Arabic Gulf,

00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:59.140
which in summertime heats
up to 35 degrees Celsius, so

00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:01.250
around 110 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:02.500
So it's very warm.

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:05.050
Warm and humid the wind
comes from the sea.

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:07.990
It's pretty warm
so you are exposed

00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:13.090
and you have high sun
kind of irradiation.

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:16.960
So living in the desert, your
air temperature reaching up

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:21.370
to 46 degrees Celsius,
even the felt temperature

00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:22.900
would be even much more.

00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:26.730
Now, looking at Abu Dhabi today,
at urban life in Abu Dhabi,

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:29.500
there is no urban life
during most of the year

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:30.920
because it's too hot.

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:34.930
And to cross a 35-meter-wide
avenue in Abu Dhabi,

00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:36.700
it's dangerous
because you may not

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:39.220
reach the other side because
it's exposing you to around

00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:41.150
150 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:44.470
So our approach was that
instead of this heat island,

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:47.080
we recognized from
big mega cities

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:50.530
like Tokyo nowadays is six
to eight degrees warmer

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:53.650
than outside, we said,
the approach for this city

00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:56.410
should be to create instead of
a heat island a cold island.

00:47:56.410 --> 00:47:59.260
So what are the
technologies coming back

00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:03.280
too much denser cities, to
cities which are self-shading,

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:06.490
which are using natural
resources like the night wind

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:10.270
to cool down, to orient the
streets depending on the wind

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:12.100
direction that the
warm winds of the day

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:16.930
are not coming into [INAUDIBLE]
which curve to the east, where

00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:20.590
the cool night wind which
is 100 degree Fahrenheit,

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:24.990
comes in at nighttime but
allows the city to ventilate?

00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:27.540
That's where the basis
of this master plan.

00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:30.490
And if you look on it, you
see these green fingers

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:32.590
going through, but
the very dense city

00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:38.980
kind of allowing that the city
stays 10 degrees below outside.

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:43.270
And these were our
real-time measurements

00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:44.830
like two summers ago.

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:47.380
Outside in the desert up
to 50 degrees Celsius.

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:50.020
In the city we could reach
this kind of 10 degree.

00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:51.700
What is interesting,
in this case

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:55.390
talking about the city
as a kind of organism

00:48:55.390 --> 00:48:58.530
which reacts with the
help of the wind tower

00:48:58.530 --> 00:49:00.070
to be ventilated at nighttime.

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:02.370
So these [INAUDIBLE],
these concrete elements

00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:04.840
along the facades,
they collect, they

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:07.690
store the night cool
and help the city

00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:11.000
to survive over the next day
so we could ensure that there

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.250
is an urban life even happening
during the warm periods

00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:17.180
of the year.

00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:21.310
And concluding in respect
of energy and consumption,

00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:26.630
this kind of 50,000 square meter
which we realized consumed only

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:29.930
20% of what a typical building
in Abu Dhabi would do,

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:32.720
still allowing-- and this is
the infrared picture on the left

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:33.860
side--

00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:36.040
to realize cool temperatures.

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:38.840
Now, jumping to
our second project,

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:42.920
it's an exhibition
pavilion for Austria

00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:48.170
on the Expo in Milan 2015,
where the overall theme was

00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:50.360
food in the cities.

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:54.770
And the intention of Klaus
[? Loenhart, ?] the architect

00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:57.350
from Austria, was
creating in [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:57.350 --> 00:50:03.280
a piece of an Austrian mountain
forest in the exhibition

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.930
as kind of the Austrian
pavilion, which

00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:10.100
by better air, by low
noise, by good smell,

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:13.970
by comfortable temperature,
would attract people

00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:17.570
to be confronted with
the benefits of nature

00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:19.490
in a kind of a
sealed environment.

00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:24.110
That was the kind of diagrams.

00:50:24.110 --> 00:50:29.290
We planted around 12,600 plants
in around 560 square meters.

00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:31.930
They have around
45,000 square meters

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:36.830
of leaves, which are evaporating
humidity and cooling down

00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:37.370
the space.

00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:40.550
We are adding misting systems
and increased the velocity

00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:44.380
in the space so people felt
quite comfortable in the space.

00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:46.080
This is the verification.

00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:49.040
So we could, comparable
to Abu Dhabi,

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:52.190
reduce the temperature compared
to outside in the range

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:56.840
around 10 degrees Celsius,
kind of an impression how

00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:00.530
you would kind of benefit
from this microclimate

00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:01.190
in this space.

00:51:11.755 --> 00:51:18.840
And last year, I [INAUDIBLE] to
participate at the Architecture

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:24.590
Bienalle, which was titled
"Reporting from the Front"

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:29.410
and many thoughts popped
up, but finally we

00:51:29.410 --> 00:51:36.280
decided to do an installation
about the power of nature.

00:51:41.412 --> 00:51:42.870
Right from the
start, I had in mind

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:48.570
to reproduce natural
phenomena because I

00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:52.350
think somehow it's a kind
of collective experience.

00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:54.040
We are all deeply
and emotionally

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:57.630
touched watching the sea,
discovering a rainbow,

00:51:57.630 --> 00:52:01.890
finding a falling star,
or something like that.

00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:07.335
We chose to showcase visible
sunrise, so-called [INAUDIBLE],

00:52:07.335 --> 00:52:12.750
or more poetically, and
[? just ?] [? ask ?] among

00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:17.100
other things because there is
a connection to a real research

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:21.450
project [INAUDIBLE] did for
[INAUDIBLE] for the new Louvre

00:52:21.450 --> 00:52:22.300
in Abu Dhabi.

00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:31.070
We wanted to do an exhibit
out of such a phenomenon

00:52:31.070 --> 00:52:35.410
by moving it from the
outside to the inside

00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:39.350
here in the Arsenale in Venice.

00:52:39.350 --> 00:52:46.250
And we wanted to just
study these emotions

00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:49.790
and really because of
time pressure, I'm sorry,

00:52:49.790 --> 00:52:53.090
we wanted to do it
quite literally and out

00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:53.960
of its elements.

00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:59.570
And we wanted people to get very
close to it, closer than ever,

00:52:59.570 --> 00:53:03.725
and ideally ineractive somehow.

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:13.590
In nature, these rays can only
be seen if leaves or clouds are

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:17.520
blocking the light and
create a high brightness

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:20.860
contrast in the visual field.

00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:25.760
And the light has to
be scattered by little

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:32.530
like micro particles in the air,
the so-called Tyndall effect

00:53:32.530 --> 00:53:36.810
In a long, long series
of tests, [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:39.240
managed to create this
atmosphere indoors.

00:53:45.050 --> 00:53:49.070
Despite converging on
mostly every picture,

00:53:49.070 --> 00:53:54.500
sun rays are parallel
shafts of sunlight

00:53:54.500 --> 00:54:06.950
and it's just phenomenal the
perspective of the observer

00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:11.346
that we always think
they are converging.

00:54:11.346 --> 00:54:14.150
There are now
people interacting.

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:15.515
We can just go on.

00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:22.330
And creating another
bunch of lines,

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:24.700
creating another bunch of--

00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:30.500
While planning
this installation,

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:35.450
dealing with the power of
nature a lot of questions

00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:42.710
arose about the independence of
nature in human kind and so on.

00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:47.090
We engraved some of
them into a wooden plate

00:54:47.090 --> 00:54:49.460
of the installation.

00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:52.960
These questions are all about
nature, about technology,

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:56.720
about culture, and
somehow they are also

00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:59.601
about urbanism in a global age.

00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:04.020
- Thank you.

00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:06.475
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:16.040
- So thank you all.

00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:18.780
I think just listening to
the three presentations,

00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:23.330
it seems to me I
was coming to this

00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:26.390
and I was kind of expecting
this was the designer panel,

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:27.880
[? you ?] can
design an art panel,

00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:30.220
and then it turns out
into the wetlands panel.

00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:34.520
Somehow the ducks tied together.

00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:39.220
But was what we hear
across the table here

00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:43.600
is very different kind of ways
of elaborating the relationship

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:45.820
between man and nature.

00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:49.170
I hear first this kind
of alternate nature

00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:52.150
as a relationship always
between settlement

00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:55.450
and the physical
environment; I hear

00:55:55.450 --> 00:55:57.130
this idea of nature
and technology

00:55:57.130 --> 00:56:00.130
together as both
kind of observers

00:56:00.130 --> 00:56:03.490
and as participants in
the kind of intervention,

00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:06.940
in the case of Ana;
and then I hear

00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:09.870
this kind of idea
of the Anthropocene

00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:15.340
and the kind of parallel between
the niches and adaptation

00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:18.670
for the natural, but also then
this kind of use of technology

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:21.390
to deliberately alter or
control natural effects.

00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:27.580
So in a way, using technology
to deflect the natural

00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:29.980
or deflect from natural forces.

00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:32.770
Ana's kind of forcing
it into participation

00:56:32.770 --> 00:56:36.400
with the kind of cultural
and physical environments

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:41.170
that are at play and
Anya and Matthias

00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:45.670
are using it to deliberately
as a kind of tool

00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:50.110
act against or with these
kind of physical forces.

00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:52.540
And so within
that, I would say I

00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:58.980
would ask first
of all of you, is

00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:04.950
that kind of role of technology
kind of calling into question

00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:06.630
the idea of nature
for you, or is it

00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:14.460
kind of allowing you to create
a more specific or firm concept

00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:16.920
of the natural in
order to kind of build

00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:18.897
your own work from that?

00:57:18.897 --> 00:57:20.480
Is it a calling into
question or is it

00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:24.210
kind of a strengthening
of a natural concept?

00:57:24.210 --> 00:57:25.950
- I would understand
it in our approach

00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:29.310
that typically, we are using
technology not to ignore.

00:57:29.310 --> 00:57:32.070
Because the typical
settlement in the Middle

00:57:32.070 --> 00:57:35.310
East is ignoring nature
that in Abu Dhabi

00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:38.530
you were not able to live
because there was just too hot.

00:57:38.530 --> 00:57:42.920
So people migrated from Abu
Dhabi to Al Ain in the summer,

00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:45.420
lived six months in Al
[INAUDIBLE] in desert,

00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:48.510
where it was the same
hot but not as humid,

00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:51.990
and then in fall they
came back for pearl diving

00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:54.990
to live six months in Abu
Dhabi and migrate back.

00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:56.430
So they adapted.

00:57:56.430 --> 00:58:00.240
But by inventing the
chiller technology,

00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:03.210
we kind of defined we are
creating a city here where

00:58:03.210 --> 00:58:05.580
normally nature doesn't
make it possible.

00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:08.430
So our approach was
now understanding

00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:11.220
that we should not fight
nature, but in [? a sense ?]

00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:12.810
we support natural giving.

00:58:12.810 --> 00:58:15.840
There is this 30
degree cold wind

00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:19.410
which can help the cities to
survive even at daytime if we

00:58:19.410 --> 00:58:22.610
don't ignore in Abu
Dhabi master plan it's

00:58:22.610 --> 00:58:26.010
a 100% copy of
Manhattan city to Abu

00:58:26.010 --> 00:58:30.180
Dhabi with 75-meter-wide
avenues where

00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:33.440
you are just roasted by
crossing the street at daytime.

00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:43.949
- Well, actually, I
mean, if I may just

00:58:43.949 --> 00:58:45.240
instigate perhaps a discussion.

00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:47.160
I mean, what I
found fascinating,

00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:49.110
actually, om your
presentation I think

00:58:49.110 --> 00:58:54.400
is this notion, actually,
of nature adapting.

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:56.580
It was interesting,
actually, your observation

00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:59.930
that nature adapts.

00:58:59.930 --> 00:59:03.860
Now, that's a very
unusual observation--

00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:09.840
but I should say it's very
revealing of a certain--

00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:13.370
I guess it's carried in the term
Anthropocene to some extent,

00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:16.740
that we have taken
the position actually

00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:20.430
that humankind actually
has changed the planet.

00:59:20.430 --> 00:59:24.670
But then you're also saying
that nature is adapting to us.

00:59:24.670 --> 00:59:27.220
I mean, my question
is, actually,

00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:30.720
where are you really situating
nature in this whole thing?

00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:32.520
So when you talk
about the desert

00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:34.320
and you're talking
about inhabiting

00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:37.424
the desert, actually,
and then moving out,

00:59:37.424 --> 00:59:39.340
I mean, you're talking
about people moving out

00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:44.580
and sort of that this
is uninhabitable but now

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:49.350
it has become [? inhabitable ?]
through Foster's design

00:59:49.350 --> 00:59:52.920
in this manner.

00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:54.660
It sort of raises
for me actually

00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:59.560
very profound questions actually
on your measures of comfort,

00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:01.560
your measures actually--

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:05.280
I mean, everything about
nature is taking its measure

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:07.380
from the human, and
that is to some extent

01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:10.230
the Anthropocene, the other
side of the Anthropocene.

01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:13.050
I mean, so when you're
talking about defining an era,

01:00:13.050 --> 01:00:17.660
you're also defining the era
as defined by man, as it were.

01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:19.890
And man is a peculiar man.

01:00:19.890 --> 01:00:21.330
I mean, he's a man
who is actually

01:00:21.330 --> 01:00:22.830
working with
technology that we take

01:00:22.830 --> 01:00:24.300
for granted in a certain way.

01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:27.000
Now, I come from another part
of the world where technology

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.030
hasn't been imposed, so
I find it interesting,

01:00:30.030 --> 01:00:33.010
actually, when you
sort of present science

01:00:33.010 --> 01:00:34.940
as actually moving
in a trajectory,

01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:38.730
as revealing actually an
Earth of a certain kind.

01:00:38.730 --> 01:00:41.640
But I'm wondering, actually,
whether you're defining nature

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:44.782
to fit your technology and
not the other way around.

01:00:44.782 --> 01:00:45.490
- No, definitely.

01:00:45.490 --> 01:00:49.250
Definitely not because we are--

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:51.930
I think this is the
typical way technology

01:00:51.930 --> 01:00:54.510
was used in definitely
the last 100 years,

01:00:54.510 --> 01:01:00.030
that in a certain way, it
allowed us to ignore nature.

01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:01.290
Let's put it like this.

01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:06.480
And a little part of nature
at certain points can adapt

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:15.180
to our changed environment, but
most of the sorts of animals

01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:18.360
and plants, they will just
die out because in these kind

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:21.480
of inhabitable areas,
they cannot survive.

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:25.280
Now, if we talk about an
adaptation, it's right.

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:30.990
At certain points, what we did
in Masdar City is until now,

01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:34.080
there is no urban living
half of a year-- six

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:37.422
to nine months-- because between
eight o'clock in the morning

01:01:37.422 --> 01:01:38.880
and ten o'clock in
the evening, you

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.920
don't go out because
it's too hot.

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:42.720
So the city is dead.

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:45.240
What is a city
without street life?

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:49.320
So allowing, then,
in such a climate

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:54.180
to allow people to be
living, as well, outdoors,

01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:56.370
I think is a big
improvement, but not

01:01:56.370 --> 01:01:59.280
by using technology
but by understanding

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.260
the natural forces
and supporting

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:05.040
the natural forces to help
us to get this temperature.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:07.730
There is no chiller, it's
just the outside wind.

01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:10.470
But at daytime we keep
it out and at nighttime

01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:11.670
we bring it in.

01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:13.370
And it's not our invention.

01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:17.620
If you go to Sicily and look
on the old medieval cities,

01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:20.130
they are exactly
using this technology.

01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:21.330
But we forgot it.

01:02:21.330 --> 01:02:24.630
By inventing the chiller and
the fan, we just got rid of it.

01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:29.240
- I think it's interesting
that on some level,

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:33.580
the design ends of the
table are fundamentally

01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:37.210
opposed in their approach
but the results end up

01:02:37.210 --> 01:02:38.382
being sort of similar.

01:02:38.382 --> 01:02:40.840
Is the cold island really so
different from the high ground

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.640
and low ground, other
than that maybe you

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:44.260
would just want
everyone to go inside

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:46.910
during the hot part of the day?

01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:49.130
But up against that,
I think Ana's approach

01:02:49.130 --> 01:02:52.000
is very different in
that you're freely

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.460
deploying the natural or
the non-human, the human,

01:02:57.460 --> 01:03:01.810
the technological that
can all appear kind of one

01:03:01.810 --> 01:03:04.870
after the other because the
actual ultimate question is

01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:07.990
about a kind of relationship
amongst them all, but also

01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:11.830
to the end of understanding a
public space that includes them

01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:13.270
all, including the non-human.

01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:14.410
What would you say?

01:03:14.410 --> 01:03:16.480
When you hear the
kind of debate here,

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:19.070
where do you feel like your
practice fits into that?

01:03:19.070 --> 01:03:23.410
- I think I'm perfectly
seated between you two.

01:03:23.410 --> 01:03:25.270
My role is not to
solve problems.

01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:27.640
My role is maybe to
create brief problems

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:33.220
and then resolve them
in a playful way.

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:36.270
I don't have to use
technology to serve,

01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:41.490
but I can use
technology to play.

01:03:41.490 --> 01:03:43.430
It's an active play.

01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:47.740
And to hopefully not
just play, but to engage

01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:51.610
reengage when
engagement was broken.

01:03:51.610 --> 01:03:54.460
- I think that kind of question
of engagement here is maybe

01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:57.550
something that still
unites across the panel,

01:03:57.550 --> 01:04:01.480
that everyone is deploying a
kind of an idea of an ecology,

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:04.990
if ecology means just a
system between the human

01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:11.200
and the non-human presences in a
kind of coherent or sustainable

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.630
constellation, that everyone
is deploying an ecology

01:04:13.630 --> 01:04:15.670
as a cultural strategy.

01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:17.590
It's still answerable
back to culture.

01:04:17.590 --> 01:04:23.620
Even if you're trying to
deflect back and allow

01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:27.160
the natural environment in, it's
still answerable to some level

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:31.610
to allow the kind of
ongoing presence of culture,

01:04:31.610 --> 01:04:34.121
but that may be to inform
what that presence might be.

01:04:34.121 --> 01:04:34.870
And I think that--

01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:36.580
- Let me clarify one thing.

01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:39.830
I mean, I think I
mean, to argue actually

01:04:39.830 --> 01:04:42.730
with the sense of where
technology and nature are

01:04:42.730 --> 01:04:44.260
relative to one another.

01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:45.430
I mean, it's not to oppose.

01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:47.630
I mean, I'm not you.

01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:49.120
I mean, I think
I'm distinguishing

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:51.880
a whole paradigm of
thought, actually, that

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:56.260
is driving your assumptions
here and just pointing out

01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:58.390
one possibility,
actually, whereby

01:04:58.390 --> 01:05:01.816
I think there is a certain--

01:05:01.816 --> 01:05:03.940
so in other words, Ana,
you're not sort of situated

01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:05.620
between anything.

01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:07.660
I mean, it's not like
I'm on the other side.

01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:12.930
So it's just-- the
issue is this, I think.

01:05:12.930 --> 01:05:19.570
To look at technology
as some way by which

01:05:19.570 --> 01:05:24.850
humans relate to nature
or means by which--

01:05:24.850 --> 01:05:28.270
it's a kind of an
instrumental sort of--

01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:32.830
I mean, it's a means by which
you relate to your environment.

01:05:32.830 --> 01:05:34.450
If I look at it
like that, I mean,

01:05:34.450 --> 01:05:36.490
I think for me what is
critical is actually

01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:39.220
how you define environment.

01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:42.920
And I think I think how
you come to terms then

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:47.650
with that space
between then follows,

01:05:47.650 --> 01:05:50.840
I mean in terms of
actually a space of design.

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:55.180
So when I see you actually sort
of [? fuzzing ?] this thing up,

01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:57.490
there's a certain
measure by which

01:05:57.490 --> 01:06:01.900
you're defining both
technology and nature to suit

01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:04.990
a certain mode of designing.

01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:06.850
And what I am
suggesting is actually

01:06:06.850 --> 01:06:09.720
that design plays a
more fundamental role

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:17.230
in taking charge of that
definition by which you

01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:22.640
have sort of made it convenient
to act in a particular way.

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:25.159
You made it convenient
for yourself to act.

01:06:25.159 --> 01:06:26.200
And that to some extent--

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:29.560
I mean, for me coming from
a colonized world wherein

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:34.300
I find knowledges have been
destroyed, ways of being have

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:41.310
been destroyed, I am called to
a certain humility, actually,

01:06:41.310 --> 01:06:44.520
in my understanding
of the space of design

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:47.670
and a certain reflection,
actually, on what design can

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:54.970
do, actually, not just to
promote the singular measures

01:06:54.970 --> 01:06:56.660
that I come to the table.

01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:59.842
But to sort of see that there
are other possibilities,

01:06:59.842 --> 01:07:01.800
there are other ways by
which people [? live ?]

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.341
and maybe we have
not understood them

01:07:03.341 --> 01:07:05.140
except on our own measures.

01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:08.040
So when you talk
about going indoors,

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:10.470
I don't think that's
the answer, actually.

01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:13.980
Just because I'm not out to
that doesn't mean I'm indoors.

01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:16.450
I mean, there's a whole
other measure by which

01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:18.540
I come to understanding.

01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:19.980
And so maybe
indoors and outdoors

01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:22.240
is not a concept
that I deal with.

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:25.240
I mean, we saw Sooni's--

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:29.580
when you spoke of there's no
inside and outside in Mumbai,

01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:33.080
that the person on the
street, no inside and outside,

01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:34.830
that sense of actually
the fact that there

01:07:34.830 --> 01:07:37.050
is no indoor and outdoor
in certain places.

01:07:37.050 --> 01:07:38.160
How do you deal with that?

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:39.160
You know what am saying?

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:42.090
It s your measure falls
off the table when

01:07:42.090 --> 01:07:43.580
you don't have
the context for it

01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:45.310
or you don't have
the ground for it.

01:07:45.310 --> 01:07:46.380
- Yeah, but OK.

01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:48.150
I think you have
to differentiate.

01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:50.280
We move indoors,
this was a measure

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.320
for this art installation
in a certain way

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:56.790
to get people exposed
or in a certain way

01:07:56.790 --> 01:08:00.360
give people the
possibility to experience

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.340
kind of unnatural phenomena.

01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:04.260
In this case, it
was a rain of light;

01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:06.570
six years ago we
did a cloud indoors.

01:08:06.570 --> 01:08:09.600
So I think understanding
the physics,

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.720
we are able to reproduce
even indoors partially

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.520
some natural aspects.

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:17.220
But we would never define--

01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:21.899
I would not see us using
technology to define nature.

01:08:21.899 --> 01:08:25.500
Because I think the point
which we are facing today

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:29.670
is that technology has
led us that at the moment,

01:08:29.670 --> 01:08:34.439
my understanding is that nature
is endangering our culture.

01:08:34.439 --> 01:08:39.029
And probably, as I
said, the estuaries

01:08:39.029 --> 01:08:43.260
will not help to get the
seven meters of rising ocean

01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:46.540
when all the ice is melting.

01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:47.370
- Right.

01:08:47.370 --> 01:08:50.586
- Let's keep this argument going
on as responses to questions

01:08:50.586 --> 01:08:51.210
from the crowd.

01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:52.279
So let's open it up.

01:08:52.279 --> 01:08:52.779
- Thank you.

01:08:59.710 --> 01:09:02.080
Can you hear me?

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:04.750
Funny, I landed in Abu Dhabi--
my name is Johnny [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:06.490
I landed in Abu Dhabi
on the 4th of July

01:09:06.490 --> 01:09:08.170
and they gave me a
car at the airport

01:09:08.170 --> 01:09:11.109
and I couldn't put my
hands on the steering

01:09:11.109 --> 01:09:17.569
so I immediately realized that
this is not a habitable place.

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:19.359
But I was stuck there
for three years.

01:09:22.210 --> 01:09:25.810
But my question is that I
think between the paradigms

01:09:25.810 --> 01:09:29.779
that you're describing,
I'm a marketing background

01:09:29.779 --> 01:09:32.859
and usually, we find out
the success of a project

01:09:32.859 --> 01:09:35.000
by the market.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.420
So we let the market speak
and then when we hear it say,

01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:39.290
OK, that worked or not.

01:09:39.290 --> 01:09:43.390
And my understanding is Masdar
is a complete failure thus far,

01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:45.720
with the billions of
dollars spent on it--

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:48.529
thus far, so I don't know.

01:09:48.529 --> 01:09:53.200
And my question is, do you
feel that the project Masdar

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:56.010
City is a success?

01:09:56.010 --> 01:09:56.510
- OK.

01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:58.170
I will say
thermodymanically, it's

01:09:58.170 --> 01:10:00.360
a success, the
50,000 square meters

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:02.950
which were built because
the urban approach to create

01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:06.160
a cold island could be proven.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.490
Economically, interesting-wise,
the whole exercise

01:10:09.490 --> 01:10:14.080
or the whole target of Masdar
was to invest $22 billion

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:16.090
to build the first
carbon neutral city.

01:10:16.090 --> 01:10:20.950
At the end when then the
economic crisis of 2008 even

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:23.620
reached the Middle
East, the sheikhs

01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:27.380
didn't have the
strength to stand it

01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:29.090
and they gave it to developers.

01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:31.850
And what we see now, and
this is very interesting,

01:10:31.850 --> 01:10:34.610
you can Google up the new
master plan of Masdar.

01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:37.850
They introduced now avenues
which run from the northwest

01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:40.040
to the southeast.

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:43.580
81-meter-wide, even wider
than in the existing city.

01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:46.220
So they will look at the
hot winds into the city.

01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:47.690
So I see it like this.

01:10:47.690 --> 01:10:52.280
OK, there's a lot to learn
out of this approach.

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:54.880
Certain technologies or
certain approaches, concept

01:10:54.880 --> 01:11:00.080
worked, but at the end it
struggled on the limits

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:02.030
of the economical system.

01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:05.240
And even the people which
at the beginning said,

01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:07.370
we are spending money
to show the world

01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:10.370
that we which are the worst
guys because we have the biggest

01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:13.910
ecological footprint as
a country of the world,

01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:18.200
we can show that we can build
this first carbon neutral city,

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:23.660
they didn't have the strength
to keep their own expectation

01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:24.890
and they failed.

01:11:24.890 --> 01:11:27.590
So I wouldn't see
this as a big failure

01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:29.540
because of the consequences.

01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:33.140
Masdar certainly
initiated such a lot.

01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:35.930
And I think this is as
well we had even when

01:11:35.930 --> 01:11:39.320
I was teaching at the GSD,
we had a governor from Texas

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:41.090
there in 2007.

01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:43.640
It was just not even a year old.

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:45.080
He was totally surprised.

01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:46.610
He knew about Masdar.

01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:50.780
So the world heard about Masdar
and the knowledge and the news

01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:51.890
was spread.

01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:54.050
And we were always
asking and even

01:11:54.050 --> 01:11:55.670
talking to marketing
people, what

01:11:55.670 --> 01:11:58.760
was the secret of this success?

01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:00.740
And the secret of
this success is

01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:05.780
there was somebody brave to say,
we are looking for a solution

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:08.460
and not just talking
about the problem.

01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:14.090
So Masdar at least set
up an example or a try

01:12:14.090 --> 01:12:18.650
to solve it instead of just
lamenting on the problem.

01:12:18.650 --> 01:12:20.210
I think this is the
biggest success.

01:12:24.210 --> 01:12:29.540
- I really appreciate you saying
that technology is endangering

01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:35.360
us because with all the
gizmos coming out every year,

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:38.420
people have been
lulled into thinking

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:41.650
that that's the answer.

01:12:41.650 --> 01:12:49.470
We might run out of fuel at some
point for some things, which

01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:50.790
brings me to Dilip.

01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:54.570
I loved, loved what you did.

01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:59.010
I can't wait to read the
book or see the program

01:12:59.010 --> 01:13:02.520
or go to the movie or
whatever happens with that.

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:06.900
One question about high
ground, low ground.

01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:09.990
In thee cities that are
talking about resilience

01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:14.430
and sustainability, at
least on the east coast,

01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:18.330
I hear that the
priority for going high

01:13:18.330 --> 01:13:23.040
is like making the highway
which is next to the water

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:25.230
even higher.

01:13:25.230 --> 01:13:32.490
In your diagram, is going high
human access, living areas

01:13:32.490 --> 01:13:36.120
connected to living
areas, or is it

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:41.130
the transportation, the trucking
corridors, the whatever?

01:13:41.130 --> 01:13:45.420
And I wonder in
the break if we can

01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:48.240
see the [? Trans ?]
solar slides flipped

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:52.920
the way we saw Sooni's
spectacular amount

01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:54.165
of information put together.

01:13:57.930 --> 01:14:01.140
- One of the issues
I think that come up

01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:08.729
with what we call the fingers
of high ground as a solution--

01:14:08.729 --> 01:14:10.270
I sort of hesitate
to use that term--

01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:15.090
but perhaps as an
alternate approach is

01:14:15.090 --> 01:14:16.800
that there is a particularity.

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:19.260
There's a particularity
to them actually depending

01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:21.720
on where they are that defines.

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:25.530
So the two projects
that we did in Norfolk,

01:14:25.530 --> 01:14:31.410
I mean one was actually
next to the Naval yard.

01:14:31.410 --> 01:14:36.240
I mean, it was on
the Elizabeth River.

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:39.530
So it was an
infrastructural, it was

01:14:39.530 --> 01:14:43.050
where [? real ?]
meets sea, as it were,

01:14:43.050 --> 01:14:44.610
[? real ?] meets the Elizabeth.

01:14:44.610 --> 01:14:48.450
And so it had particular
conditions, actually,

01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:50.650
by which people were.

01:14:50.650 --> 01:14:53.890
There was a treatment
plant there.

01:14:53.890 --> 01:14:55.620
And we took on
issues that were very

01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:57.690
particular to the
treatment plant.

01:14:57.690 --> 01:15:00.780
When there's a
hurricane, for example,

01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:04.019
they sort of release
sewage into the ocean.

01:15:04.019 --> 01:15:06.060
So we said, why don't we
design barges, actually,

01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:08.640
the extension of fingers
to actually then also

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:10.540
dissipate waves, et
cetera, et cetera.

01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:12.090
So what I'm saying
is that there's

01:15:12.090 --> 01:15:16.740
a particularity to each finger.

01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:20.430
But that is actually
on the issues

01:15:20.430 --> 01:15:22.500
that we're facing from the sea.

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:24.630
But then there are
community issues.

01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:26.730
We found that in
Norfolk, for example,

01:15:26.730 --> 01:15:29.730
that the people actually
living on the sea

01:15:29.730 --> 01:15:31.920
were not that endangered
as people living inland

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:33.850
because rain had nowhere to go.

01:15:33.850 --> 01:15:37.860
So the people who were drowning
or in danger of [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:39.480
were actually inland.

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:41.390
So it was actually
between rain and tide

01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:43.380
that we were designing.

01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:45.050
So yes.

01:15:45.050 --> 01:15:46.504
The complexity builds up.

01:15:46.504 --> 01:15:48.420
But I think that that
is the beauty, actually,

01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:51.680
of working with a particular
[? on the east coast. ?]

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:54.010
While we can make a
kind of general comment,

01:15:54.010 --> 01:15:57.090
actually, on turning
the coast, it really

01:15:57.090 --> 01:16:02.930
requires very grassroots sort
of activity in terms of--

01:16:02.930 --> 01:16:05.040
and we've tried,
actually, to do that.

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:07.890
But it really needs--

01:16:07.890 --> 01:16:10.230
that people are willing to
change governance, actually,

01:16:10.230 --> 01:16:13.090
so governance structures
in the Chesapeake.

01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:14.956
And that is happening slowly.

01:16:14.956 --> 01:16:16.830
so we are still in
conversation with the Army

01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:20.850
Corps of Engineers, actually,
working in that area.

01:16:20.850 --> 01:16:24.270
And we're dying to
actually do a pilot project

01:16:24.270 --> 01:16:27.870
where we can actually review
the diversity of these things.

01:16:27.870 --> 01:16:30.750
I'm not quite sure if I'm
answering your question, am I?

01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:32.880
- I just think would
be awfully interesting

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:37.140
if all these towns
in jeopardy would

01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:40.320
have maps around the town
showing the high ground, low

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:42.080
ground.

01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:44.210
Unless people know
what to-- this

01:16:44.210 --> 01:16:47.480
is a different way of thinking,
although in New Orleans

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:49.850
they figured out pretty fast
where the high ground was,

01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:52.280
which were the overpasses.

01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:57.350
But it would just be
interesting to remap one's world

01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:58.670
into high ground, low ground.

01:16:58.670 --> 01:17:02.780
And it doesn't
rely on technology,

01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:12.387
it relies on nature helping
us, which is grade, elevation.

01:17:12.387 --> 01:17:13.720
- Can I take a little more time?

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:18.092
I hope-- I don't want to be
taking time from the others.

01:17:18.092 --> 01:17:19.300
I just want to raise a point.

01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:21.640
I mean, one of the beautiful
things about thinking

01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:25.780
about high ground, low
ground versus a coastline

01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:29.290
is that when we read the
surface of the earth,

01:17:29.290 --> 01:17:32.210
actually, in terms of urban
and rural, for example,

01:17:32.210 --> 01:17:34.540
we are seeing
actually cities, which

01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:37.030
is a question, actually,
for the symposium,

01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:39.292
actually, which I sort of
find a little problematic.

01:17:39.292 --> 01:17:40.750
Because when we
use the term urban,

01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:43.930
we are actually using it
exclusively and excluding

01:17:43.930 --> 01:17:47.500
things that are outside of it.

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:49.950
So when one refers to the
desert, et cetera, et cetera,

01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:51.574
one is actually
positioning it outside.

01:17:51.574 --> 01:17:55.180
And I wonder sometimes what
one is positioning outside

01:17:55.180 --> 01:17:55.726
of the city.

01:17:55.726 --> 01:17:57.100
But that reading,
actually, where

01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:59.710
the city has been given
a measure to things

01:17:59.710 --> 01:18:02.080
is very different from a
middle ground, for example.

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:04.390
And so if I actually
do maps that

01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:06.940
work with drawing
the middle ground out

01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:09.112
as the agency with
which we work,

01:18:09.112 --> 01:18:11.320
you get a completely different
structuring, actually,

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:13.780
of the surface of the
Earth, as compared

01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:17.620
to working with cities
that you can then

01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:22.297
talk about as successes, which
is to me extremely problematic.

01:18:22.297 --> 01:18:24.130
But I don't want to get
into that discussion

01:18:24.130 --> 01:18:26.671
because it all depends on how
you define the problem in order

01:18:26.671 --> 01:18:30.030
to fit the solution.

01:18:30.030 --> 01:18:32.910
- The solution-- I think one
of the problems here is that

01:18:32.910 --> 01:18:35.640
if you look at the projections--
there are maps, by the way,

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:38.550
available showing what sea
level rise would do to coastal

01:18:38.550 --> 01:18:41.250
cities, but yet money is
pouring into [? Seaport ?]

01:18:41.250 --> 01:18:45.060
or into Miami Beach on
the premise, I suspect,

01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:49.470
that by the time disaster
hits in 2050 or 2070,

01:18:49.470 --> 01:18:52.240
we'll have our money, the
original owners have sold it,

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:54.060
if they even can sell it.

01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:56.114
But looking up the
heat issue, if you

01:18:56.114 --> 01:18:58.155
look at the projections
for the Arabian Peninsula

01:18:58.155 --> 01:19:02.130
with [? wet ?] bulb
temperatures, by 2050 or 2060,

01:19:02.130 --> 01:19:04.080
there won't be very
cool winds coming off

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:06.000
in the humidity ranges needed.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.680
So trying to design
in today's parameters

01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:12.750
but ignoring 25 or 30 years
out, let alone 50 or 100.

01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:16.620
At one time you could
walk from Boston Light

01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:20.790
during the glacial maximum all
the way out to the George's

01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:22.560
Bank.

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:25.410
70 meters is a lot to
overcome and you're not

01:19:25.410 --> 01:19:29.744
going to do it by trying to
imitate Dutch technology.

01:19:29.744 --> 01:19:32.160
It will buy a few years, but
that's all it's going to buy.

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:33.618
So I guess my
question of the panel

01:19:33.618 --> 01:19:35.400
is, when are we going
to start looking

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:40.050
at reasonable projections,
rather than sort of work

01:19:40.050 --> 01:19:43.890
on these very narrow
timeframes of 20 or 30 years

01:19:43.890 --> 01:19:45.470
and ignore the fact
that it's going

01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:47.490
to be a lot different
by the time I'm dead

01:19:47.490 --> 01:19:48.937
and everybody in
this room is dead

01:19:48.937 --> 01:19:50.520
but our children and
our grandchildren

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:52.270
will have to face a
whole different world?

01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:58.980
- I would see we are
looking on the next years

01:19:58.980 --> 01:20:02.460
because politically, the
decisions we do the next years,

01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:05.220
they will determine the next
50 and the next 100 years.

01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:08.970
Because the time is so
late that our decisions are

01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:13.170
so critical that expecting that
this might be solved though

01:20:13.170 --> 01:20:16.970
the technology in 10 or
15 years, that's too late.

01:20:16.970 --> 01:20:20.660
And I think this is the
dangerous kind of performance

01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:24.570
or habit of climate change,
that you don't feel it

01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:26.670
before it really
strikes and then it's

01:20:26.670 --> 01:20:30.080
too late because the
system is so big.

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:31.480
And this is nature.

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:34.830
So this has been, again
back to the discussion

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:37.530
that in a certain way,
we messed that up.

01:20:37.530 --> 01:20:40.470
And the question is, are
we able to bring it back

01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:41.710
to a certain performance?

01:20:41.710 --> 01:20:45.040
I think the planet will
survive because it survived

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:47.130
other waves of temperature.

01:20:47.130 --> 01:20:51.218
The question is if the
human period will survive.

01:20:53.610 --> 01:20:54.110
- All right.

01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:58.660
I think we can wrap
it up with that.

01:20:58.660 --> 01:20:59.560
No.

01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:00.460
Please.

01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:03.210
[APPLAUSE]
