DANA HAN-KLEIN: Today it
is my absolute pleasure

00:00:02.039 --> 00:00:03.630
to welcome the
Editor-in-Chief of io9,

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.289
and the award-winning
writer, Charlie Jane Anders,

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:07.580
for "All the Birds in the Sky."

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.704
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS: Thanks
so much for coming out.

00:00:09.704 --> 00:00:12.480
"Laurence first met his
girlfriend, Serafina,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.780
at a robot fashion show, with
robots modeling human clothing

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.180
and humans modeling
robot fashions,

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.830
like mechanical lingerie.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.780
The event happened at a garagey
artspace somewhere south

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.540
of South of Market,
with a gunmetal trough

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.980
full of artisanal vodka.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.410
Laurence had come this close
to mistaking Serafina for one

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.460
of the models-- her
cheekbones and oval face,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.440
her lustrous skin and
shiny red/black hair

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.060
were that amazing-- but
he realized just in time

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.330
that she was one of the
robot makers instead.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.220
Serafina's model
was a steel sylph,

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.200
with ball-and-socket
joints that let

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.150
it strike a pose, pivot,
talk with its delicate hands.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.460
Laurence had helped to build
battle bots in college,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.191
but never artificial
supermodels,

00:01:02.191 --> 00:01:04.190
and he had managed to say
something witty enough

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.040
about the difference
between the two,

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.140
that Serafina had
friended him on MeeYu.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.010
They met for coffee a
few days after that,

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.370
and the coffee date
morphed into a dinner date.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.760
And the third time
they hung out,

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.000
it was tacitly a sleepover.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.870
Serafina had a
toothbrush and condoms

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.480
in a pouch of her
vinyl shoulder bag,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.830
which was Twiki
from "Buck Rogers."

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.197
Protip-- do not think
of "beedi beedi beedi"

00:01:26.197 --> 00:01:28.530
while you're having sex for
the first time with the most

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.616
beautiful woman alive.

00:01:29.616 --> 00:01:31.240
Or you will have some
explaining to do,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.770
even if your motion,
rocking the bed frame,

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.060
does have a sort of "beedi
beedi beedi" rhythm to it.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.020
After that, they hung
out every other day,

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.940
held hands in the streets,
skipped through traffic,

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.390
whispered in each other's ears
in public, clung together skin

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.930
to skin in every
moment in private,

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.720
and swapped gene prints,
traded odd little gifts,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.194
and wondered how soon was
too soon to say I love you.

00:01:56.194 --> 00:01:57.860
Laurence had soon
found out that letting

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.150
people know that he was
part of the 10% Project

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.140
was a super-fast
ticket to getting laid.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.910
Laurence was
finally a rock star.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.040
About time, really.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.750
And yet, there was
still no way that he

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.400
was in Serafina's league.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.710
She was perfect.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.340
He was damaged goods.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.330
He never forgot this
disparity for a second.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.430
About a month after
they started dating,

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.090
Serafina took Laurence
into her sanctum.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.590
She had to sign him in.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.670
And he had to surrender
his ID to the man

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.810
at the desk, who printed a badge
with Laurence's fresh photo

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:28.900
on it.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.650
She led him down an elevator
along a sloping hallway,

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.225
through two keypad-secured
doors and on into the lab.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.580
Inside, eyes watched
Laurence from every wall

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.570
and flat surface.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.140
Four of them belonged to bearded
humans who said, yo, and then

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.080
looked back down at
their workstations.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.810
But the rest all
belonged to robots

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.270
in various states of assembly.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.960
Serafina barely introduced
Laurence to the two humans,

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.680
but took her time showing
him the robots, who

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.160
were animatronic cartoon
characters or animals,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.320
or a few mannequin heads.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.700
'This is Frank.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.590
He laughs a lot.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.610
Watch out for Barbara.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.990
She flirts, but she's got a mean
streak.' The robots all seem

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.480
to like Laurence, especially
Donald the Cactus.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.310
By now, Laurence
and Serafina had

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.410
been dating for five months.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.090
And lately, every time
Serafina looked at her phone

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.170
while they were hanging
out or stared into space,

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.390
or bit her thick lower lip in
the middle of a conversation,

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.780
Laurence braced himself.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.910
This was it.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.600
She was going to dump him.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.332
Then the moment would pass.

00:03:33.332 --> 00:03:34.790
Laurence was sure
that she was just

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.210
waiting for the right
moment or the ideal pretext.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.630
Every time he woke
up next to her,

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.570
he wondered if this was the
last time her breath would warm

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.140
the back of his
neck and her breasts

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.640
would graze either
side of his spine.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.460
He was not going to lose her.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.620
He had aced bigger
challenges than this.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.260
He was going to
think of something,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
take extreme measures, even
deploy the nuclear option early

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.850
if he had to.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.170
He was going to find a way to
hold on to this amazing girl.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.940
Serafina was late for dinner
because her emotional robots

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.020
had been having a nervous
breakdown-- all of them.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.700
'It took me the whole
day to figure out

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.700
what was bothering them.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.830
They just kept wigging
out and giving us

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.150
all the hairy eyeball.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.920
We looked at everything
that had changed in the lab,

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.269
trying to eliminate
any possible variable.

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.530
Like, was the music different?

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.010
Did we update their
code recently?'

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.940
Laurence didn't rush her.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.530
Problem solving
and troubleshooting

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.660
were a source of pleasure
for both of them.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.010
And narrating the process
was the next best thing

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.270
to doing it.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.379
The same neural pathways lit
up when you talked your way

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:40.920
through the maze as
when you actually

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.470
solved it for the first time.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.370
Except this time you were bathed
in the glow of already having

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.820
unraveled the thing.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.710
And yet, Laurence was
still uncomfortable.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.560
For one thing, because
Serafina was late,

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.800
they were stuck sitting at
one of the sidewalk tables

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.510
at the fancy pizza place
with nothing but a tiny heat

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.090
lamp and three meatballs to
insulate them from the fog

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.220
until the pizza arrived.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.000
For another, he was trying
to be a good listener because

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.850
of his ongoing
not-getting-dumped project,

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.170
and active listening
was hard work.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.860
We finally figured out the
one thing that had changed.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.660
Serafina said, she
wore a camisole,

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.600
but she'd put her bulky
jacket back on when

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.190
they were seated outdoors.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.990
The heat lamp made
her skin look bronze.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.540
Matt just got a Caddy, and he
brought it into the office.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.050
Soon as we took the
Caddy out of Wi-Fi range,

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.650
the robots calmed
down-- somewhat.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.000
And before you ask,
the Caddy did not

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.550
have any weird apps
installed on it.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.460
It was fresh from the store.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.670
Wi-Fi range, so they
were getting something

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.926
from the Caddy on their wireless
network that upset them.

00:05:49.926 --> 00:05:51.300
Laurence pulled
out his own Caddy

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.133
and glanced over it,
as if he would suddenly

00:05:53.133 --> 00:05:55.930
spot some brand-new feature.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.090
It still looked like
a big guitar pick

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.560
with a curved base,
covered with aluminum.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.340
The Caddy was scanning for open
networks, the same as always.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.210
But it wouldn't link
up with other machines

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.633
on the same network without
being instructed to do so.

00:06:09.633 --> 00:06:13.530
Unless-- 'Here's
what I don't get,"

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.660
Laurence said, bisecting
the third meatball

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.750
so Serafina could have half.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.570
The meatball was
their only protection

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.630
against the cold, the last
of their dwindling supplies

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.670
until the pizza arrived.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.260
'So, your emotional
robots, I mean,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.960
they don't have emotions in
the way that humans do, right?

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.310
I mean, no offense.' Laurence
was on thin ice here.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.540
And not only the edge,
but the dead middle

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.180
of a lake, 100 fragile
paces in any direction.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.580
'I mean, the robots
simulate emotional responses

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.582
to some situations.

00:06:43.582 --> 00:06:46.040
And then they try to pick up
on what the people around them

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.810
are feeling.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.660
Right?' 'You make it
sound like we're designing

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.300
three-dimensional game avatars.'

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.420
Serafina didn't quite
push her chair back,

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.387
but she did seem a
little further away.

00:06:58.387 --> 00:07:00.720
'I'm aware it's a lot more
involved than that,' Laurence

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.830
said, 'both because
of the uncanny valley,

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.800
and because the physical world
is a lot more complicated.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.670
But the real point is, how
do you know your emotions are

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.310
spontaneous and genuine and
not just a preprogrammed set

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.480
of responses?'

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.600
'I don't.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.300
I wonder about that all the
time.' Laurence was conscious

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.857
that it was probably a bad idea
to confess to your girlfriend

00:07:21.857 --> 00:07:23.940
that you often wondered
if your feelings were just

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.020
an involuntary response.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.816
'I just wonder--
I mean, assuming

00:07:27.816 --> 00:07:30.190
that they have a particular
feeling, a reason for feeling

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.550
a particular way, and
they don't just wake up

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.100
on the wrong side of the bed?

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.870
I mean, the Caddy had to be
doing something that resembled

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.390
an aggressive act as defined
in their response matrices,

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:46.650
right?' 'Yeah,' Serafina said,
'they reacted as if they were

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.160
being threatened.'

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.450
The pizza came at last, just
when Laurence needed something

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.600
to distract Serafina from what a
mansplaining dick he was being,

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.690
in spite of all his resolutions.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.260
'I mean, there has to be some
other explanation.' Laurence

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.060
said, 'you're talking
about a Caddy.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.700
It's not a black box.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.517
People have jailbroken, and--'

00:08:08.517 --> 00:08:09.850
Sorry, I just lost my stopwatch.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:10.210
OK.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:11.780
'people have jailbroken
and wiped them.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.113
They've installed Linux on them.

00:08:13.113 --> 00:08:14.790
And they've also
ported the Caddy OS

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.910
over to cheap imitation
tablets from Liberia.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.597
This is the most hacked
device in history.

00:08:20.597 --> 00:08:22.180
If there was something
weird about it,

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:27.770
we'd know by now.' 'Hey,'
said Serafina, chewing pizza,

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:30.480
'Ockham's razor is not just
an optional weapon in Street

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.760
Warrior V. I already told
you, we eliminated all other

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.049
possibilities.'

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:39.100
The harder Laurence
tried not to screw up,

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.830
the worse he screwed up.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:42.780
He was not going to get dumped.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.754
That was not a
possible outcome."

00:08:45.754 --> 00:08:47.420
So I'm going to skip
a little bit ahead.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:51.610
There's more about the Caddy,
this miraculous device.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.380
So Patricia, who was the other
main character in the book,

00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.180
is a witch.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.020
And she's been going
through a crisis.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.040
And we pick up there. "Patricia
was fixing Reginald's sink,

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.130
which had one of those
glitchy new valves

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.680
that were supposed
to shut off the water

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.910
after a couple of minutes.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:14.180
And she found herself talking
about her latest breakup.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.600
And you know, her fear that
she was just always going to be

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.410
alone. 'I mean, I just never
have time for anybody,' she

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.840
said, 'I just keep
isolating myself.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:27.300
I'm just basically doomed to
wind up alone forever, right?'

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.760
Patricia expected Reginald to
offer some bromides about how

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.990
she just needed to be herself.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:39.340
But instead he said, 'Get--
a-- Caddy.' 'What?' She nearly

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.507
bonked her head on the sink.

00:09:40.507 --> 00:09:41.006
'Get.

00:09:41.006 --> 00:09:41.510
A. Caddy.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.110
It will change your life.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.290
I am not kidding at all.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.940
You become totally connected
to all the people in your life.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.580
Not like regular social
networking either.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.930
It's uncanny.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:55.040
You will just run into people
you know, in person, when

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.780
you most need to see them.

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.040
I could barely afford
one on my fixed income.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.420
But it turned out to be
the best investment I ever

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:05.050
made.' 'I always thought
Caddies were just for mission

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:05.780
hipsters."

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:09.400
Patricia said, "Anyway,
it sounds creepy.'

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.610
'Seriously, no.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:11.800
It's not creepy.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.490
And it's so easy to use.

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:16.830
It doesn't spy on you or tell
you to stalk your friends.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.210
I never felt like it
was invading my privacy.

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:23.670
It just makes serendipity
happen more often.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:27.170
It's unobtrusive, and it doesn't
give you a bunch of alerts.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:28.820
But you'll always
know what's the one

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.060
party that you shouldn't miss.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.700
I was feeling
isolated, even with

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.590
your much-appreciated visits.

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:37.450
And then I got this Caddy,
and I feel as though I'm back

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.940
in my own life again.'

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.750
In spite of
Reginald's insistence

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:46.550
that the Caddy was not all
creepy, his hard sell in itself

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.710
was kind of creepy.

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:51.750
He sounded like someone
who had just joined a cult.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:56.330
Patricia vowed that she would
never, ever buy a Caddy.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:57.450
Ever.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.670
Ever.

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:02.050
Two days later, Patricia
was in the Caddy store,

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:03.420
near Union Square.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.016
It was narrow,
with curving walls

00:11:05.016 --> 00:11:06.890
that drew you towards
the counter at the back

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.440
like a stream curving
around some rocks.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.390
The walls seemed to glow.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:13.830
Patricia picked up a Caddy
from the display on one wall,

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:15.710
and the screen flared to life.

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:17.100
There was a swirl of colors.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.120
And then it resolved
into a wheel shape.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.710
The wheels had swirls
coming out of its center,

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:24.520
sort of like a Taoist symbol.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.010
And each of them got
bigger when she touched it.

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:31.680
They included things like
communication, orientation,

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.620
self expression,
and introspection.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.690
She paid for the Caddy
with her ATM card

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.950
and felt like a total wanker.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:41.670
Next, she was just
going to go get

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.450
some giant square dark
glasses and a medallion that

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:48.080
changed color depending on how
recently she had gotten laid.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.460
God!

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.450
Still, it was a fun toy.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.400
And at this point,
she would try anything

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.330
to make herself feel less
claustrophobic and isolated and

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:58.160
self-absorbed.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.910
Although there was something
perverse about buying

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:04.020
a device that offered a
huge introspection wedge,

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:07.060
in the hopes that it would
make her more social.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:11.620
That night, Patricia sat in bed
and played with her new Caddy.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.790
It was not that different
from the standard tablet,

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:15.650
except for the
guitar-pick shape,

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:19.100
and the way that it insisted on
asking you demented questions

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.730
to customize your experience.

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:24.760
Like, would you rather lose
your sense of smell or taste?

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.060
When was the last time you
were glad you stayed up late?

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.071
There was a check box to
disable the questions.

00:12:30.071 --> 00:12:32.570
But everybody said they made
it work a million times better,

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:35.600
and they tapered off
after about a day.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.330
And sure enough,
after a few days,

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.610
the Caddy was steering
her oh-so-gently

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:43.259
towards happy accidents
and little discoveries.

00:12:43.259 --> 00:12:45.050
There was that little
egg-themed restaurant

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:47.470
in Hayes Valley, where
everybody sat in egg chairs

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.820
and ate egg dishes,
from Scotch eggs

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.640
to Chinese-style egg tarts, and
drank cocktails with egg yolks

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.309
in them.

00:12:54.309 --> 00:12:56.350
The whole place was an
allergy waiting to happen.

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:58.652
But it was also warm and cozy.

00:12:58.652 --> 00:13:01.110
And there was a faint smell of
butter and sugar in the air,

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:04.090
making her feel like she was in
her grandma's kitchen and five

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:05.690
years old.

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:07.330
The Caddy helped
Patricia figure out

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.920
which bus to take to
avoid being late for work.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.240
And when one of her Mary
Janes broke a strap,

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.840
the Caddy steered her to this
hole-in-the-wall place that

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.500
fixed it on the spot.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.400
Within a few days, Patricia
had a low-level awareness

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.190
of what a dozen or
so people in her life

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:26.027
were up to at any given moment,
without feeling overwhelmed.

00:13:26.027 --> 00:13:28.110
She managed to grab lunch
with her friend, Taylor,

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:29.818
and make time for an
ice cream conference

00:13:29.818 --> 00:13:32.490
with her roommates,
Deedee and Racheline.

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:36.280
Then something weird happened.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.770
Right around the
time that Patricia

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.840
had gotten used to the Caddy,
and started thinking of it

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.540
as an extension
of her personality

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:46.540
rather than just an appliance--
after about five days,

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:50.120
in other words-- she started
running into Laurence.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.430
A lot.

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:56.640
At lunch, at dinner, at tea,
on the bus, in the park.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.480
At first it didn't
seem like a big deal.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.810
Because San Francisco
was a tiny town.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:04.500
But after a couple of
days, it felt weird.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:08.190
She would see Laurence, say
hi, mumble a few awkward words,

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:09.520
and then bail.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.642
And then the process would
repeat a couple hours later.

00:14:12.642 --> 00:14:14.350
She would think that
he was stalking her,

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:18.110
except that she was the least
stalkable person on the planet.

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.740
The third day, she tried
shaking up her routine,

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.970
going for a vegan soul
food in the outer sunset.

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:24.800
And somehow, Laurence
was there too,

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.172
going to some kind of
musee mecanique revival.

00:14:28.172 --> 00:14:30.200
'Uh, hey again,' he said.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.630
He started to say
something else,

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:35.249
and then seemed to
think better of it.

00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:37.540
She was already saying, 'Hey.'
and turning back to talk

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:38.040
to Taylor.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.470
On her break at work,
she picked up her Caddy

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:46.570
and scrawled, what's
the deal with Laurence?

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:47.650
With her finger.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:50.320
The Caddy responded by telling
her some facts about Laurence,

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:53.550
including some physics
prize that he'd won at MIT.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:55.870
She couldn't help feeling
like the Caddy understood

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:59.740
the question perfectly
and was just playing dumb.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.170
She decided to leave
her Caddy at home.

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:05.440
And for a whole day, her
life was boring again.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.180
Just missing the bus and not
connecting with her friends,

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.830
and not having
time to grab dinner

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:11.900
in the middle of doing errands.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.970
The rain started just as she
was heading home for the night.

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:16.620
And she had forgotten
her umbrella.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.590
And there was no
place to buy one.

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:20.640
And of course, she
had to run 10 blocks

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.120
to catch the bus, which
left just as she got there.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.940
She waited another half an hour
under a disintegrating canopy

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.150
for the next bus.

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:31.420
And when she staggered on
board, drenched as a sponge,

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.360
the only seat-- the
only empty seat--

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.880
was next to Laurence.'
I'm going to stop there.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:37.930
Thanks.

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:39.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.600
DANA HAN-KLEIN: So I
think it's hilarious

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.299
that-- I would love for
all of our UX designers

00:15:46.299 --> 00:15:47.215
to read about Caddies.

00:15:47.215 --> 00:15:49.489
And I'm sure they would all
love to make one magically

00:15:49.489 --> 00:15:51.780
work as well as it does in
the universe you've created.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.290
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS: I want one.

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:56.964
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah, so thanks
so much for joining us today.

00:15:56.964 --> 00:15:58.380
I think the first
question is what

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.110
inspired you to write the book?

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:02.693
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS: You know,
it started out as just sort of,

00:16:02.693 --> 00:16:05.020
like, thinking about putting
these two genres together,

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:08.280
fantasy and science fiction,
in kind of one bundle.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:12.560
And then when I started
to really think about it,

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.920
I started to think of it more
as the story of these two

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.950
people, the mad
scientist and the witch,

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:21.500
and less like just you
know, kind of a genre story.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.730
I got more excited about
their different world

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.480
views and their different
kind of feelings

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:30.750
about magic and science
and nature and technology.

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:33.650
DANA HAN-KLEIN: What were some
of the challenges of weaving

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:37.450
together a universe that
combines those without flaw?

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:41.550
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS: I mean,
basically, the main thing was

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:43.302
there was a million challenges.

00:16:43.302 --> 00:16:45.510
But in terms of bringing
together the science fiction

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:49.030
thing and the fantasy thing
of these two characters,

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:51.540
you know, the worldbuilding
was a challenge.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.195
Like, making the fantasy
world feel grounded and real,

00:16:54.195 --> 00:16:55.820
and like, something
that could actually

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:59.540
co-exist with a realistic
"world" of machines

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.090
and computers and stuff.

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:04.250
You know, it meant that I
couldn't really go crazy, like,

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:07.640
full-on Harry Potter
or just have, like,

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.650
magical shit exploding
all over the place.

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:14.449
It had to kind of be a little
bit more grounded, I guess,

00:17:14.449 --> 00:17:15.990
and like, something
that actually you

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:19.010
could believe was in our world
and that was all around us

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.099
without people noticing.

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:23.670
And then with the
science stuff, again, I

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:26.540
couldn't go to broad with the
kind of Jimmy Neutron-- Boy

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.870
Genius side of it or whatever.

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.920
Because I wanted it to
contrast with the magic as much

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.530
as possible.

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:36.030
So the more, kind of, it
felt like they're working

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:37.820
for startups, they go to MIT.

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:42.270
They have a loft in Soma or
whatever, that kind of stuff,

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.260
the more it felt
like real-life geeks.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:48.150
The more I believed
in it, and the more it

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:51.010
was a good counterpoint
to the magic stuff, which

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:52.177
was more of a made-up world.

00:17:52.177 --> 00:17:54.010
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Speaking
of real-life geeks,

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:55.289
since we're at Google--

00:17:55.289 --> 00:17:56.372
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS: Yeah.

00:17:56.372 --> 00:17:57.880
DANA HAN-KLEIN: --what sort
of research did you do,

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.150
in terms of-- I mean, there's
probably more research

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.400
to be done in terms of the
scientific side of the book

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.030
than the magical
side of the book.

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:04.850
But that might just be my bias.

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:07.094
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS: Yeah,
the magic side, I just

00:18:07.094 --> 00:18:08.260
had to do a lot of thinking.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:09.510
And I'd read a lot of fantasy.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:12.250
And I had to just make sure that
I had something that actually

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.550
had internal logic
and wasn't derivative

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:15.970
of other stuff I'd read.

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:19.050
With the science stuff, I talked
to a jillion science people

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:21.210
about the physics in the book.

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:24.150
And actually, there
was somebody who,

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:25.567
I think she's a post-doc now.

00:18:25.567 --> 00:18:27.400
Or she was working at
Microsoft for a while.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.250
She was getting her PhD
in computer science.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.210
She's done a lot of stuff on AI.

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.340
And she spent hours
going through, like,

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:34.670
the AI stuff in the book.

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:40.220
And part of the book, as
you can see, from the stuff

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.090
about the Caddy,
there's kind of a theme

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:46.930
of AI emerging from our personal
technology in our gadgets

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:49.370
and the things that we
interface with every day,

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:53.460
and that we depend on
to enable our lives now.

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:54.960
And that's not
something, obviously,

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.160
that I came up with that's
been in a million other things.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.640
And the movie "Her" came out
while I was writing this book.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.692
And I was, like, damn!

00:19:00.692 --> 00:19:03.150
Because I feel like "Her" beat
me to the punch a little bit

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:04.066
on some of that stuff.

00:19:04.066 --> 00:19:05.990
But there's been a
million other things.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:07.610
That's almost a
cliche at this point.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:09.026
But I really wanted
something that

00:19:09.026 --> 00:19:13.077
was a realistic AI in
a consumer gadget kind.

00:19:13.077 --> 00:19:14.660
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I
mean, it's something

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.554
that we, at Google,
and other companies,

00:19:16.554 --> 00:19:17.470
are trying to work on.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:17.970
You know?

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:18.892
Google Now.

00:19:18.892 --> 00:19:20.600
And it's trying to
make your life easier.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.357
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS: Yeah.

00:19:22.357 --> 00:19:24.690
DANA HAN-KLEIN: So if you had
to pick, if you could only

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:25.900
live in one world,
a world with magic

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.390
or a world as a super
scientist, which would you pick?

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:30.030
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS: I mean,
I guess if I could be, like,

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:31.750
one of the witches in
Patricia's world, that

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:32.570
would be pretty awesome.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:34.630
Because they can do some
pretty amazing stuff.

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:37.090
But you know, there's
a huge cost to it.

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:38.715
So I don't know.

00:19:38.715 --> 00:19:40.000
It's tough.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.574
I think, yeah, the magic world.

00:19:42.574 --> 00:19:44.990
DANA HAN-KLEIN: So the book
is set in San Francisco, which

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:46.059
we're near.

00:19:46.059 --> 00:19:48.350
And it was great for me,
because I'm from the Bay Area.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:51.930
And reading, you know-- San
Francisco could be fiction

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:54.640
if you haven't been here.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.070
So what did you
weave in, in terms

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:01.950
of having to weave, pretty
much, a made-up place

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:03.864
into a made-up place?

00:20:03.864 --> 00:20:05.280
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS:
I mean, a lot

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.650
of the stuff in San Francisco
is the real San Francisco.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:12.100
Like the part I just read
there, at Pizzeria Delfina,

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.660
and later in that section, they
go to the Latin American club

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:17.770
on Humphrey Slocombe, It's,
like, right-- you know?

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:19.030
There's real places.

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:20.952
I think the egg
restaurant in Hayes Valley

00:20:20.952 --> 00:20:21.910
doesn't actually exist.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:23.785
There's a couple places
that are a little bit

00:20:23.785 --> 00:20:25.260
like that in Hayes Valley.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.000
There's that
bookstore-bar place that

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.750
has a little bit of
an egg thing going on.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:30.860
But I guess it's
not really the same.

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:33.190
But you know, then I
just tried to kind of,

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.917
like-- there are things, like,
where the magicians live.

00:20:35.917 --> 00:20:38.000
Like, there's this used
bookstore that one of them

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.290
lives in, which is right in
the middle of the Mission.

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:43.200
And I just kind of drew
on some real places

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.320
and kind of changed it
around a little bit.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.810
So I mean, there was so
much other made-up stuff

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:50.000
in the book that was kind
of just completely out

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.030
of left field, that
as much as possible,

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:54.389
I wanted the setting to
be just 100% grounded.

00:20:54.389 --> 00:20:56.680
And there was a little bit
of like-- because that stuff

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.190
all takes place
10 years from now.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.510
And it was like, do I
really think, you know,

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.460
Pizzeria Delfina will
be here in 10 years?

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.080
Do I think Humphrey Slocombe?

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.050
I don't know.

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:07.540
I hope so.

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:11.090
DANA HAN-KLEIN: They already
got the breakfast cereal.

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:13.727
Did you always know you wanted
it set in San Francisco?

00:21:13.727 --> 00:21:14.810
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS: Yeah.

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:17.740
I mean, the first
third of the book

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:18.950
isn't set in San Francisco.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:21.510
And then I think
I decided to set

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:23.170
the grown-up parts
in San Francisco out

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:24.920
of total sheer laziness.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.680
Because I just didn't
want to have to deal with,

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.286
like, if I set it
in some other city,

00:21:30.286 --> 00:21:31.660
that it'd be a
lot more research,

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:34.355
and making sure that things
actually felt-- you know?

00:21:34.355 --> 00:21:37.190
Even like New York, or Boston,
where I've spent a lot of time,

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:40.555
it's just not
quite as automatic.

00:21:40.555 --> 00:21:41.930
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
One thing you did

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:43.000
that I thought is
really interesting

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.950
is that you've actually shared
parts of the book that didn't

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:46.420
make it into the book online.

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:47.140
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS: Oh, yeah.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.970
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I'm actually
curious as to the motivation

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:49.470
behind this.

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:52.537
Is it just sort of,
like, DVD extras?

00:21:52.537 --> 00:21:53.620
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS: Yeah.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.210
I mean, it is kind
of DVD extras.

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:58.684
I have a Tumblr,
allthebirdsinthesky.tumblr.com,

00:21:58.684 --> 00:22:01.100
where I've been just posting
deleted scenes from the book.

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.510
And it's mostly just because
there's so much of it.

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:05.470
The book was, like, a
billion pages longer.

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:07.220
And there was a lot
of stuff that I really

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.886
liked that I had to
cut just for length.

00:22:08.886 --> 00:22:13.226
And some of it adds to your
appreciation, or hopefully,

00:22:13.226 --> 00:22:14.850
your understanding
or whatever, of some

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:17.650
of the supporting characters
and some of the other stuff

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:18.642
that's going on.

00:22:18.642 --> 00:22:20.850
And I don't know, I think
it's fun to see that stuff.

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:23.720
And it's probably going to
never be used anywhere else.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.420
So might as well post it.

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:28.059
And hopefully people like
it and it doesn't just

00:22:28.059 --> 00:22:29.850
give a weird impression
of what the book is

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:31.730
like, since it's
all the stuff that

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:33.335
actually wasn't in the book.

00:22:33.335 --> 00:22:33.876
I don't know.

00:22:33.876 --> 00:22:34.570
Fingers crossed.

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:35.820
DANA HAN-KLEIN: No, it's cool.

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:38.750
It's just one of those things
where I was like, well,

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:40.970
you could have written an
entire other book based

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:45.080
on the additional materials.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:49.000
I'm wondering, obviously,
when you're working for io9

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.800
you consume and analyze a lot
of science fiction and fantasy

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.210
in media.

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:57.380
And did you ever
find yourself going,

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:59.027
oh, I'm going to
hold back because I

00:22:59.027 --> 00:23:00.110
know this person did this?

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:01.500
Or was it sort of
encouraging to be,

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.860
like, well, I know this
person did this well.

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.270
So I'm going to do it better.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:07.470
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS: Yeah, I'm
definitely super-hyper aware

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:08.570
of what's been done.

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:09.930
I mean, not all the time.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:11.470
I'm sure there's like things
that I'm not aware of.

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.136
Because I can't know
every single thing.

00:23:13.136 --> 00:23:16.369
But I kind of know the
things that people are

00:23:16.369 --> 00:23:17.660
people have been excited about.

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:19.916
And that's kind of weird,
being that hyper aware.

00:23:19.916 --> 00:23:21.290
But I feel like
that's all of us.

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:24.010
Like, we all kind of are
hyper aware at this point.

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:28.330
Like, I was in a writing group
years and years and years ago.

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:31.270
And someone wrote a
short story or a novel

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:34.321
where there was an AI named
Michael or named Mike,

00:23:34.321 --> 00:23:34.820
or whatever.

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:37.236
And everybody was, like, oh
my god, how could you do that?

00:23:37.236 --> 00:23:38.580
What are you doing?

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:41.510
Because that's the name
of the AI in "The Moon

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:43.610
is a Harsh Mistress,"
by Robert A. Heinlein.

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:46.329
And it was, like, why
would you name you AI Mike?

00:23:46.329 --> 00:23:47.870
Is this some kind
of weird shout out?

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:50.066
Or are you just, like,
you know-- I don't know.

00:23:50.066 --> 00:23:52.360
Anyways, so things like that.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.340
You can never entirely
avoid stuff like that

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:56.470
unless you just have, like,
encyclopedic knowledge

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:59.089
of the genre, which I
definitely do not have.

00:23:59.089 --> 00:24:00.630
So that's another
reason why you have

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:02.296
to show it to people
and also just trust

00:24:02.296 --> 00:24:06.840
that your editor, at some
point, will pin you if you've

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.240
made a mistake like that.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.830
But yeah, it's tough.

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:13.440
The more time goes on,
the more stuff there is,

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.640
and the more you're likely
to be ripping someone

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.160
off without realizing it.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.993
DANA HAN-KLEIN: So
paying them a compliment.

00:24:18.993 --> 00:24:19.960
Imitation is the sincerest
form of flattery.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.459
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS:
It's an homage.

00:24:21.459 --> 00:24:22.800
Yeah, exactly.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.230
DANA HAN-KLEIN: So who are
some of your inspirations?

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:26.740
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS: For
this book in particular,

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.865
the number one inspiration
that I always talk about

00:24:28.865 --> 00:24:30.110
is Doris Lessing.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:31.610
Because she is an
incredible writer,

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:35.850
who did this kind of weird blend
of science fiction and realism

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:36.890
in a lot of her books.

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:39.020
Especially this
five-book series,

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.820
the "Martha Quest" series, which
I encourage everybody to read.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:42.780
Because it's amazing.

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:46.450
It starts out super, very
tightly autobiographical,

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:49.060
about a young woman
growing up in Africa

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:52.030
and getting involved in
Marxist politics in the '50s.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:57.310
And she wrote it over a
period of, like, 20 years.

00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:59.810
And by the end, there's
like, nuclear war

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:01.550
and mutants and psychic powers.

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:04.630
And just like, it gets way
more and more out there

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:05.710
as it goes along.

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:07.060
But it feels kind of seamless.

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:09.840
It just kind of, like, it
feels like, OK, the world

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:13.300
was more normal, and
now it's not, kind of.

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:15.550
DANA HAN-KLEIN: So the first
half the book takes place

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:17.466
and they're sort of
children and young adults.

00:25:17.466 --> 00:25:20.430
And were there any books
that sort of shaped you

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:22.960
as a young adult, into
the writer you are today?

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.418
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS:
I mean, I read

00:25:24.418 --> 00:25:26.380
a ton of Judy Blume,
and like, Beverly Cleary

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.250
when I was a kid.

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:28.750
I love them.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:30.900
I love "The Chronicles
of Prydain."

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.700
I don't know if that's
YA or middle grade.

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:34.680
But I loved those a lot.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.260
And anything by
Daniel Pinkwater.

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.926
Daniel Pinkwater is,
like, the greatest.

00:25:40.857 --> 00:25:41.940
DANA HAN-KLEIN: All right.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:45.160
Do you have a favorite hero
or heroine in literature?

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.780
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS: Oh man.

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:47.560
There's so many.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.710
I don't know.

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:51.710
Yeah, I mean, I love
Katniss Everdeen, actually.

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:53.080
I think she's a great hero.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:58.196
I think she's actually, like,
a really terrific character who

00:25:58.196 --> 00:26:01.400
there's just so much
going on with her.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.940
DANA HAN-KLEIN: And then if
you were hosting a dinner party

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.248
and you could invite three
authors, dead or alive, who

00:26:06.248 --> 00:26:07.196
would you?

00:26:07.196 --> 00:26:09.820
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS: God, I mean
definitely Vonnegut, for sure.

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.236
Vonnegut and
Lessing, actually, it

00:26:11.236 --> 00:26:13.510
would be pretty hilarious
to see those two together.

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:14.470
I don't know.

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:17.080
And then I don't know
who the third would be.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:17.960
Maybe Michael Chabon.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.180
I don't know, that'd
be kind of fun.

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:21.720
DANA HAN-KLEIN: He's a nice guy.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.470
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS: Yeah,
one living author, at least.

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:25.630
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah.

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:28.179
Is there something that you
wish you could tell yourself

00:26:28.179 --> 00:26:30.470
when you set out to write
this book, that you know now?

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:32.974
Now that it's done
and published?

00:26:32.974 --> 00:26:34.390
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS:
I don't know.

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:35.230
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I you
could do time travel?

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:35.700
That's part of it.

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:36.580
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS:
Yeah, I don't know.

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:38.590
It just would have been nice to
know that it wasn't just going

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:40.020
to be a total flaming disaster.

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.070
I mean, at least not a
total flaming disaster.

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:43.649
I don't know.

00:26:43.649 --> 00:26:45.940
For, like, at least a few
years, I was pretty convinced

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.580
that it was just going to
be a trash fire forever.

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.670
But I don't know.

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:53.360
I mean, the main thing
that was the mistake I made

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.400
was trying to go too
broad and over the top

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.060
with the humor at first.

00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:00.540
And there was a slow process of
kind of peeling back the humor

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.500
until I got to something that
was a little more personal

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.450
and you know, kind of had
more space for the characters

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:08.462
and their emotions.

00:27:08.462 --> 00:27:10.670
So that's something that
could've saved a lot of time

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:12.080
if I hadn't gone that way.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.680
But I think that was
part of how I figured

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.610
out the world and stuff, is
just by making it really silly

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:18.652
and then dialing it back.

00:27:18.652 --> 00:27:20.526
DANA HAN-KLEIN: When
you're building a world,

00:27:20.526 --> 00:27:23.750
do you sort of set out the odds
of like, Sanderson has his law.

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:25.702
He says, OK, they can't do this.

00:27:25.702 --> 00:27:26.410
And they do this.

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:29.840
Because there are some
trade offs and constraints

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.910
within the world you've
built. Is that something

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:32.830
you discovered along the way?

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:34.246
Or is that something
at the outset

00:27:34.246 --> 00:27:36.200
you went, I know this
has to be a part of it?

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.090
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS:
You mean with the magic?

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:37.840
Or just in general?

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.730
DANA HAN-KLEIN: With the
magic, but also in general.

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:40.610
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS:
Yeah, with the magic,

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:42.401
I was definitely pulling
it out of my butt.

00:27:42.401 --> 00:27:43.946
as I went along.

00:27:43.946 --> 00:27:46.320
And then I kind of had to
figure it out a little bit more

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.710
when I was revising.

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:52.077
I mean, the main thing with
the magic, with the magic,

00:27:52.077 --> 00:27:53.660
you kind of see it
two different ways.

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:55.250
Because you see
it for the first,

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:58.500
like, 100-something pages,
like Patricia is a little kid.

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.427
And she's just figuring
it out on her own.

00:28:01.427 --> 00:28:03.260
And she doesn't know
any other magic people.

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:07.501
And so it's, like-- you know?

00:28:07.501 --> 00:28:08.000
Excuse me.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.780
It's just this mysterious
thing that she's

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:11.190
kind of struggling with.

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:13.350
And it's sort of
dreamlike and weird

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:16.100
and kind of crazy and trippy.

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:20.570
And then, the other
2/3 of the book, she's

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:22.010
integrated with magical society.

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:25.710
And they do have all their own
rules and their own history,

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:27.760
and their own
system of what magic

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.720
is, where there's
two different systems

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.810
that they've tried to
merge into one system.

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:36.890
And it's just I think that
stuff is a partial understanding

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:37.390
of magic.

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:39.516
And I feel like
part of what I hope

00:28:39.516 --> 00:28:41.640
to get by the end of the
book is that nobody really

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.812
understands it.

00:28:42.812 --> 00:28:45.270
You can come up with a system
and rules and all this stuff.

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:47.811
But that doesn't mean that you
actually understood all of it.

00:28:47.811 --> 00:28:51.524
You've just kind of figured
out some stuff kind of.

00:28:51.524 --> 00:28:53.190
DANA HAN-KLEIN: We
have an audience mic,

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:56.476
if anyone wants to line
up and take a question?

00:28:56.476 --> 00:28:57.850
I think one of
the things for me,

00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:00.000
actually-- it's funny that
you picked the first passage

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.708
to read from-- because
there was a moment

00:29:01.708 --> 00:29:02.930
about the emotional robots.

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:03.480
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS: Oh yeah.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.570
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I thought
that was so great,

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:05.820
the way you describe emotions.

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:08.600
It was like a virus state.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.380
It was great.

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.070
I was, like, oh that's
something, weirdly enough,

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:13.445
like, I connect with this, as
somebody who works in tech,

00:29:13.445 --> 00:29:15.360
or something like that.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.550
Is that something that
you kind of stumbled upon?

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:18.170
Or is it--

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:19.260
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS:
The emotional robots?

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.190
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah.

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:21.960
Is that something you've been
mulling over for a while?

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:22.860
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS: I
just have known people

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:24.170
who worked on emotional robots.

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:27.080
And I've been around
them a couple times.

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:27.960
I don't know.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.475
I mean, I guess
part of what it is,

00:29:29.475 --> 00:29:32.870
is that I wanted her to
be somebody who works

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:35.720
with technology, who's
like, as bad ass as Laurence

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.340
is, as smart as him.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:38.240
You know?

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.670
And I guess there's sort
of a theme in the book.

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:43.300
Like, part of the
thing with the Caddy,

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.589
too, is like, about
how we interact

00:29:46.589 --> 00:29:48.130
with other people
and our connections

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:50.060
to other humans and stuff.

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:52.200
And so the idea of
emotional robots

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:55.410
was just another way of
getting at the thing of, like,

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:57.300
technology and
human interaction,

00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:00.100
and how technology can
simulate that, but also

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.960
how technology
can kind of either

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.509
complicate or simplify
human interaction.

00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:07.050
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Sometimes inhibit it.

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:07.520
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS:
Yeah, sometimes.

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:08.390
DANA HAN-KLEIN: We're staring
at our phones all the times.

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:09.680
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS:
Yeah, exactly.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:09.965
Yeah.

00:30:09.965 --> 00:30:11.170
I know, sometimes that's true.

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:11.360
Yeah.

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.040
DANA HAN-KLEIN: But
there'll come a day

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.048
where robots know us better
than we know ourselves.

00:30:14.048 --> 00:30:15.002
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS:
I think yeah, that's

00:30:15.002 --> 00:30:16.460
definitely going to happen.

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:17.560
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Well, thank
you so much for joining us.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:17.800
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS:
Yeah, it was a pleasure.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.530
DANA HAN-KLEIN: The book is out.

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:20.190
And we'll have a
signing after this.

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:20.670
Thanks, everyone.

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:20.970
CHARLIE JANE ANDERS: Yay!

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:21.270
Thanks!

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:21.770
Woo!

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:24.020
