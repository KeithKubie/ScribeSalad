Look, Joey,
I'm a drummer, too.

[ Drumming ]

00:00:13.045 --> 00:00:15.148 size:63% position:69%
Taught one guy
everything he knows.

00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:18.518 align:end size:97% position:97%
What is going on
with those two?

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:20.286 align:start size:91% position:9% line:85%
I have no idea.

[ Laughs ]

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:22.188 align:start position:0%
I have no [bleep] idea.

00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:28.194 size:84% position:58%
Well, let's smoke and maybe
get some clarity because...

00:00:28.227 --> 00:00:29.929 size:63% position:31%
The wolfman taught
the other kid.

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:32.465 size:69% position:34%
He lent him the truck.
He wants $1,800.

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:36.035 align:start size:88% position:13% line:85%
I heard enough.

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:36.035 align:start size:66% position:34%
Yeah, he has friends.

00:00:36.068 --> 00:00:39.472 align:end position:100%
I guess they stole
all of his stuff,

00:00:39.505 --> 00:00:42.442 size:59% position:70%
like they knew
he'd get messed up.

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:44.844 size:66% position:67%
I just don't think
he has a strong case.

00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:46.612 size:72% position:64%
But I don't --
You know, I don't think

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:49.816 size:69% position:66%
the other guy
is completely innocent

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:51.784 align:end position:100%
'cause why would he give
his truck to this dude?

00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:54.620 align:start position:0%
The kid was in San Diego.
He went out, he got [bleep] up.

00:00:54.653 --> 00:00:55.621 size:78% position:39%
He gets what he deserves.

00:00:55.654 --> 00:00:57.890 size:81% position:41%
They gave him a Cosby pill
in Tijuana

00:00:57.923 --> 00:00:58.925 align:end size:56% position:56%
and he woke up
with nothing.

00:00:58.958 --> 00:00:59.926 align:start position:0%
That's what happens.

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:01.360 size:63% position:31%
Next time,
you pay attention.

00:01:01.393 --> 00:01:02.695 size:63% position:69%
Loaning your truck
to a werewolf.

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:05.031 align:end position:100%
Can you imagine the road rage
those werewolves have

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:06.299 align:start size:78% position:22%
when they're out driving?

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:07.934 size:69% position:34%
He's like
a [bleep] nightwalker.

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:10.169 size:59% position:70%
He'll lose his car,
for sure.

00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:13.372 size:84% position:58%
But it sounds like the guy
admits that he had the car,

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:15.274 size:59% position:70%
so the law
would say that...

00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:18.211 align:start size:84% position:16% line:85%
9/10.

00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:18.211 size:84% position:58%
...he owes for the car.

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:19.679 size:59% position:70%
But the car
is not worth...

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:21.481 align:start size:81% position:19% line:85%
$1,800.

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:21.481 size:84% position:58%
...1,800 bucks.

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:23.382 size:63% position:31%
Let's give him $250.
[Bleep] 'em.

[ Laughs ]

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:24.817 align:start size:97% position:3%
$250 and the buckets.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.619 align:start size:94% position:6%
He's got enough.

00:01:26.652 --> 00:01:27.954 align:start position:0%
Let him [bleep] go out and play
the drums till next week.

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:29.689 size:84% position:58%
Well, whatever we give him,
we definitely have

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:32.788
to crumple it up
and throw it into his buckets.
