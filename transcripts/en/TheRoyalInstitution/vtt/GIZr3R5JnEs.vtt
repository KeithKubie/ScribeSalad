00:00:07.904 --> 00:00:19.760
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.040
So normally, when you fly a
kite, you care about the kite

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.650
and not so much the string.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.305
But in my research, I'm
interested in the dynamics of

00:00:27.305 --> 00:00:30.410
what the line is doing, whether
it be a kite or a

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.700
tethered balloon, offshore oil
and gas platform underwater.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.930
There's cable dynamics in lots
of different engineering

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.350
systems, anything with cable
moving around in the sky.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.316
You have changing tension
along the line.

00:00:45.316 --> 00:00:47.625
You can get things like
travelling waves.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.300
And that's what I'm
trying to model.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.560
Even in a simple system like
this - this is just a bathroom

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.310
chain and a shower ring - you
can get really complicated

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.680
things going on.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.330
So if I just put the ring on the
chain, so it's just free

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.500
to fall off the end like that
- I'm just going to put it

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.650
back on - you can get
complicated things going on.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.660
Because if I just drop
this ring...

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.580
No!

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.390
Failure is a part of life.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.640
...it gets stuck.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.340
So you see that and
you wonder, well

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.560
how does that work?

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.300
And its to do with the
tether dynamics.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.570
So if I have this chain and
this ring falls, I get a

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.630
travelling wave going down
the chain like that.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.740
So when this ring is falling,
it goes down the chain.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.720
And there's a wave following
it down the chain.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.750
And when the wave gets to the
end, there's a whiplash and

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.350
this ring is going to fall into
that hole and get stuck.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.770
So you can see that you can get
complicated things even

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.750
just on a short length
like that.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.120
But when you have something
that's longer - a balloon

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.760
tether out in the environment,
you have this long tether -

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.630
you can still have these
travelling waves going down

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.400
the length of your cable.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.980
There you can see that
wave travelling down.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.410
You're going to have
changing tension.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.260
So the tension at the top,
because of the self weight, is

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.460
a lot higher than the tension
at the bottom.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.040
And not only that, if this
is outside, you're

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.220
going to have wind.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.100
So you're going to have
drag on this tether.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.150
And you can imagine that
normally you have tethers that

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.470
are circular in cross section,
so something like this.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.880
And in terms of drag, it's
really surprising that the

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.620
drag on this circular cross
section is actually equal to

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.960
the drag on this air foil.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.910
So you can get a huge benefit
if you can streamline the

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.600
section in terms of drag,
which will decrease the

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.600
tension on your overall
system.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.810
So my research has to do with
if you do change the cross

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.910
section of the tether,
will it be stable?

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.620
Can you even design something
that would work?

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.030
So I have an aerodynamic tether
here, and I'm trying to

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.670
model whether this would work.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.290
So I have this tether, and I'm
going to discortise it into a

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.920
bunch of tiny sections.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.690
So I'm going to break it
up into small chunks.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.870
And that way I can model the
elasticity, and damping, the

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.470
bending, torsion, all
of those things.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.220
And I can also model the
changing parameters up the

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.890
length - say this
is 20 kilometres

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.150
long - into the sky.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.040
So I'm going to have changing
air density,

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.810
changing wind speed.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.140
So I have a computer model
to model that behaviour.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.560
But not only is that important,
the actual cross

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.850
section of the tether is also

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.050
important in terms of stability.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.800
So if I draw this cross section
out, I have a bunch of

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.520
different centers.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:05.650
So on this air foil I'm going
to have a centre of mass, a

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.380
centre of tension, a shear
centre, which has to do with

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.160
bending, and the aerodynamic
centre, which is

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.720
where the lift acts.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.360
And depending on where these
centres are with respect to

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.720
each other, is going
to dictate whether

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.960
this cable is stable.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.120
So I have this 10 metre long
length of the cable - of

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.960
aerodynamic tether.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.280
And manufacturing this is
a project on its own.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.160
And you can see that this one
this is the very first tether

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.940
that's been manufactured
and it has some

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:40.960
imperfections in it.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.910
You can see there hasn't
quite filled in.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.390
So it's just it's just a first
attempt, but I think would be

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.070
quite good fun to string this up
on a kite and have a go at

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.250
flying it and see
what it does.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:05:09.026
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:09.026 --> 00:05:10.276
Now pull it tight.

00:05:22.936 --> 00:05:24.920
You want to hold it?

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.170
You want to hold it from here?

00:05:43.272 --> 00:05:44.522
Oh, no!

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.224
GoPro rig has descended.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.500
So now we have the aerodynamic
tether section attached to the

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.230
kite line flying up there.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.550
And you can see that it alters
the dynamics of the entire

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.800
kite system quite a bit.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.730
This particular section isn't
really manufactured in any way

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:21.980
that it should be stable.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.520
It's just an extruded
piece of something

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.820
aerodynamically shaped.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.550
So it does flutter around
in the wind.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:28.220
It flips.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.960
And those are all of the
problems that you could

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.020
encounter if you'd had something
that wasn't stable.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.110
But when it goes under tension,
you can see that it

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.710
sort of straightens out.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.390
And ideally, what you want to
manufacture is something that

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.160
you've played around with the
cross sectional properties so

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.995
that it does the align
itself with the wind.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.640
So going out and flying kites
for a Ph.D. might seem like a

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.400
bit of a laugh, but this
is the part that

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.840
makes a good film.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.930
What doesn't make a good film
is me sitting in front of a

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.050
computer doing a bunch of code,
or me writing out a

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.340
bunch of equations.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.330
But that stuff's really
interesting for me, and it's

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.860
those equations that dictate
whether something like this,

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.210
or an aerodynamic tether
would be stable.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.580
And by the end of my Ph.D.
hopefully I'll have a better

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.710
idea of whether you can make an
aerodynamic, stable tether.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.230
I think I might need
some help first.

00:07:51.485 --> 00:07:52.735
Still recording!
