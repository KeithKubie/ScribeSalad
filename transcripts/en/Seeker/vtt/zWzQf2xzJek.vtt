00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.839
CRISPR is mostly known for making gene editing
so easy, scientists had to pump the brakes

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:08.570
for a second and talk about the ethical implications
of playing God.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.941
But while we haven’t figured out yet exactly
where to draw the line on messing with the

00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:16.460
human genome, I think we can all agree we’re
cool with using this revolutionary technique

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.070
to mess with harmful bacteria, because we
hate those guys.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.730
Researchers are developing a CRISPR pill which
could help fight bacteria that have developed

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.210
a resistance to other forms of antibiotics,
the much feared superbugs.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.920
Best of all, killing bacteria using CRISPR
turns their own defenses against them.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.170
CRISPR is not just how I like my bacon, it’s
also an acronym that stands for Clustered

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.340
Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.720
It refers to sequences in a bacteria’s DNA
that are pretty much what they sound like,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.370
short sequences that are partially the same
backwards and forwards that are spaced out

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.559
regularly.

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.420
CRISPR is actually a bacterium’s defense
mechanism against viruses.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.950
That’s right, bacteria get viruses, it’s
a virus eat bacteria world out there.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.730
Anyway, when a virus attacks a bacterium,
it injects it’s DNA into it.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.630
But if the Bacterium has been attacked by
this kind of virus before, it’s saved a

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.390
bit of it’s DNA in between the CRISPR strands.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.820
The bacteria will use that as a template to
create a strand of RNA that can target the

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.280
virus’ DNA.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.990
Once the RNA is locked on to its friends,
a protein called CRISPR associated protein

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.620
9, or cas9 chops up the virus DNA and renders
it harmless.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.680
It’s like an ingenious primitive immune
system.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.980
So scientists thought, “What if we used
this bacterial defense to make the bacteria

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.420
destroy it’s own DNA?”

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.280
Researchers are figuring out how to do exactly
that, and to add insult to injury, they want

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.530
to use a virus to deliver the bacteria killing
DNA.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.070
It takes a little more finesse than just swallowing
a pill of viruses, because stomach acid would

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.310
break them down.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.820
So the plan is to shroud the virus in innocuous
bacteria, like a trojan horse.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.670
Once the good bacteria make it through the
stomach, the virus reveals itself before forcing

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.110
the bacteria to commit suicide.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.390
Disguised viruses using bacteria’s own weapons
against them for revenge?

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.880
It’s like Game of Thrones up in there.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.930
The best thing about this approach is it can
be used to target very specific bacteria,

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.280
which is what you want in an antibiotic.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.360
Broad spectrum antibiotics kill swaths of
bacteria indiscriminately, whether they’re

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.920
good or bad.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.650
Their overuse has created bacteria that are
becoming more and more resistant to antibiotics,

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.250
and if antibiotics become ineffective, that’s
a huge step backwards for humanity.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.200
Remember bubonic plague?

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.260
Neither do I, and I don’t want to.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.060
This research has a ways to go before it’s
ready to start busting gut microbes.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.880
The delivery method is in its early stages
and hasn’t been tested on animals.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.980
Plus right now the researchers are just targeting
one species of bacteria, C. difficile.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.740
While C. difficile is a drug-resistant bacterium
classified as an urgent threat by the CDC,

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.650
it is just one species, so the same virus
can’t be used to fight other bacteria because

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.480
viruses tend to be one-species-only kind of
murderers.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.940
Still, we’re in dire need of new ways to
fight antibiotic resistant bacteria, and if

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.570
we can kill them in the most ironic way possible,
I say heck yeah, more research is needed.
