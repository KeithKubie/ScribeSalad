1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.480
One thing I do know about is feral pigs.
I've studied them pretty,
pretty closely.

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.290
Why?

3
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.250
Because I'm friends with a lot of people that are professional hunters and uh,

4
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.460
I wanted to know how the fuck they got so big.
Like there's a video of a,

5
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.150
there's a photo rather one they called Hogzilla.
That was from Georgia.

6
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.000
It's a fucking enormous pig,
but it looks,

7
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.420
look at that mother fucker.

8
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.380
King Kong hog from Russia makes Hogzilla look like a baby.
See,

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.090
I'm not buying that.
Does that guy look at the guy's head?
See that guy's head.

10
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.000
That guy is a mile away.
Where the fuck is that guy?

11
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.210
That guy could be on top of that thing and that look looks like a German

12
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:39.660
shepherd.
How much does it weigh?
We have no idea.
This is a photograph.
Hold on,

13
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.010
let me see that tusks again.
Let me see.
The tusks,
Eh,
it's a big pig,

14
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.580
but it doesn't have to be that big.
That could be a 300 400 pound big.

15
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.810
It doesn't even say did they?
It 1,179 pounds.

16
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.080
So these go scales.

17
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.860
What website is this?
I've got scales.
Website.
Website is,
it's wide open spaces.

18
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.750
Hmm.
That's a pretty reputable,

19
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:07.860
well not all shoulder first five,

20
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.750
five and a half feet at the shoulder of Jesus Christ.
I got to see his picture.

21
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.260
He brought 200 of these.
Not specifically that one,
but it was a Russian boar.
Hmm.

22
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.270
He brought in from Russia and they've ended up breeding with local feral pigs

23
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.070
and they got big.
Yeah.

24
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:26.310
Well here's the thing about bores and pigs and all that jazz.

25
00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:30.330
It all comes from the same genus.
It's all from something called sue [inaudible].

26
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.220
Sue scruff is all pigs.

27
00:01:32.221 --> 00:01:35.490
What's crazy about that is like when you see a domestic pig and they look all

28
00:01:35.491 --> 00:01:37.080
cute and cuddly and pink and shit.

29
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.960
When they get loose and they go wandering through the woods,

30
00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:44.880
they turn feral and their face changes.
Their face gets longer,
they grow tusks,

31
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:47.940
their hair gets thicker.
This one,
it says the shoulder height.

32
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.000
Is that how high the shoulders are off the ground?
Right at five and a half feet.

33
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.890
Triste that's so big.
That's all.
I'm three inches shorter or taller than that.

34
00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.050
Five and a half feet.
That's insane.
That's this tall on me.
So me standing up.

35
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.900
Okay.
I'm five,
eight.
Look at this.
Watch this.
Here's the pigs.

36
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.860
Here's the pig shoulder,
right?
[inaudible]
that's on.

37
00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:10.950
Or is it like right there?
Where's three inches?
Like right here?

38
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.750
That's fucking insane.
It's a pig that high.
That's insane.
That's an elk.

39
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.370
Hugs.
Hogzilla was a shoulder.
Had a three feet.

40
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.770
That's almost double three though.

41
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.360
Five and a half feet tall.
So big.

42
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.510
But if it was a thousand pounds,
that makes sense.
Cause uh,

43
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.270
a good elk is like 800 pounds.

44
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.250
A longhorn steers are so far behind it though.

45
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.660
[inaudible] bullshit hunters trick.
It's a hunter's trait.
That's what's drawn.

46
00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:45.590
It's back here.
I don't see his hands.
Do you see his hands?
I don't see you say,

47
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.520
trust me.
Look at it.
Listen that guys in the next 706 area code,

48
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.400
that guy's hiding.
He's way behind that thing.

49
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:57.120
You're supposed to be right next to it.
If that is a deceptive photo.

50
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.070
When you take a photo like that,
that is you doing that on purpose,

51
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.340
what you're supposed to do.
He's supposed to put your gun or your rifle or your,

52
00:03:04.341 --> 00:03:07.630
or you're a bow and arrow.
You lean it on the animal,

53
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:11.890
you stand next to it so that people that know how difficult it is and people
say,

54
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:15.310
oh,
your trophy a hundred now he trying to kill a smart,

55
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:19.330
mature animal because that's the one that's healthiest for the population.

56
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.880
That's the one you want to take out of the breeding cycle.

57
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.540
This is one that's already spread.
It's jeans and hunter's respect.

58
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:29.590
When someone shoots a mature older animal,
that's a for sure.

59
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.933
It looks good,
right?

60
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.480
Those are not that good to eat unless you really know what the fuck you're
doing.

61
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.870
Like you gotta be,
you gotta Slow Cook that motherfucker.

62
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.630
That one you want to do low,
you want to probably,
you know Brian,

63
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:44.464
that bitch,

64
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.620
get them in a big old Vada saltwater with brown sugar and garlic and just let

65
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:53.740
them soak for awhile.
This article is sort of Santa could be bullshit bullshit.

66
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:56.620
I'm telling you,
that guy's too far away.
You've got to listen to me.

67
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.840
Try to see a guy that's that far away.
What do you say to her Russian,
Bro.
He's,

68
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.530
that guy is near the bumper.
That's a fucking car.
I bet they're pigs.

69
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.040
Look at where his shoulders are.

70
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.790
They line up almost with the bumper that he does.
He looks tiny.

71
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.170
He's way behind that pig in relation to the size of the car.

72
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.740
Exactly.
It was like a third grader.
Exactly.
It doesn't make sense.

73
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.670
This guy is hiding.
He's hiding behind that pig.

74
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.180
If you wanted people to know the actual perspective you'd say on that.

75
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.780
If he had a rifle leaning up against that pig and the rifle look tiny,

76
00:04:28.781 --> 00:04:31.390
you'd be like,
Holy Shit.
That's a giant pig.
That's,
yeah,

77
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.380
but there's nothing in that photo that represents an actual perspective.

78
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.120
You'd have to be standing right.
Look,
he's hiding.
He's,
he was old.

79
00:04:38.121 --> 00:04:39.310
We can't even see bitch.

80
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.160
You could see that ain't a five and a half foot tall pig.

81
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.820
Well that pig six one laying down in this picture.
Yeah,

82
00:04:46.821 --> 00:04:50.630
and picture these guys on his knees.
The only evidence they have dead one.

83
00:04:50.631 --> 00:04:51.910
That means that the Werewolf we have in the,

84
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.970
in the lobby could be real to that world was a thousand pounds.

85
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.660
It's even bigger than this pig.
Yeah,
that's stupid.
That's what people do,
man.

86
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.770
People take pictures of animals.
They hide.
Well,

87
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.700
it's in the hunting world is called the grip and grin.

88
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.150
Take a photo like a hold a deer and you like push them way out.

89
00:05:07.151 --> 00:05:11.140
People do that with fish too.
Like you caught a big bass.
You take that big bass,

90
00:05:11.141 --> 00:05:13.650
you put it way in front of you.
It looks gigantic,
right?

91
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.930
If you take that big basket like,
Hey,
look at my big bass,
right?

92
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.590
That's a confident person.
Confident person's got that bass behind him.

93
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.240
I'm sure that mother fucker do.
You know?
Beg that is wrong.
Bigger,
wrong.

94
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:27.820
Keep guessing.
Doesn't matter if this guy's a liar.

95
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.770
The guy with holding it out in front of him,
he's showboating.
I'm not buying it.

96
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.950
That fucking pigs,
300 pounds.
That's a baby pig.

97
00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:38.020
That's one the Whitney you Rogan or against it?
