However, it is important to note that the symptoms of schizophrenia differ

00:00:03.642 --> 00:00:07.872
person by person. And that includes the combination of symptoms they

00:00:07.872 --> 00:00:12.864
experience, as well as the severity of the symptoms and their duration. That

00:00:12.864 --> 00:00:16.283
said, sometimes schizophrenia is a chronic condition and the person is

00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:21.256
constantly experiencing hallucinations and delusions. However, other times

00:00:21.256 --> 00:00:25.084
people experience periods where they are somewhat symptom free, but

00:00:25.084 --> 00:00:31.598
occasionally have periods of a more acute form of psychosis. Therefore, each

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:34.926
individual is different and will experience the symptoms of the disorder in

00:00:34.926 --> 00:00:36.500
different ways.
