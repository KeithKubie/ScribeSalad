[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.770
STACEY SASAKI: All right,
so "New York Times"

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.690
best-selling author
and co-creator

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.470
of The Whole30 Program, Melissa
has helped millions of people

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.370
achieve their weight
loss and health goals.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.100
And we're really excited to
have her here today to talk hot

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.740
on the heels of her
latest book release,

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.976
"Food Freedom Forever, Letting
Go of Bad Habits, Guilt,

00:00:29.976 --> 00:00:33.500
and Anxiety Around Food,"
only released yesterday, so we

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.854
are right at the cusp of that.

00:00:34.854 --> 00:00:36.270
And we're excited
to have her here

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.430
to talk to us about what that's
all about, what The Whole30 is,

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.600
and answer all our
tough questions.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.230
So please join me in welcoming
Melissa to Talks at Google.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.354
MELISSA HARTWIG: Thank you.

00:00:45.354 --> 00:00:47.965
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:49.340
STACEY SASAKI: So
it's a pleasure

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.500
to have you here today, Melissa.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.840
MELISSA HARTWIG: Thank
you, I'm really excited.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.840
STACEY SASAKI: I'm
very excited too.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.570
As a person who's very
interested in all the latest

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.040
food crazes exercise
crazes, as most of us are,

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.490
it's really great
to have you here

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.180
so you can navigate
things for us

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.020
and tell us about
yours and all of that.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.228
MELISSA HARTWIG: I'm excited.

00:01:07.228 --> 00:01:08.400
STACEY SASAKI: Perfect.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.760
I mean, a lot of these people
already know about the Whole30.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.220
It's a very well-known
program and pretty amazing.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.500
But tell us a little about
it, just to get us going.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.290
MELISSA HARTWIG:
Sure, so you can

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.670
think about the Whole30
pushing the reset button

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.010
with your health, your
habits, and your relationship

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.850
with food.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.240
So for 30 days,
you'll eliminate foods

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.760
that the scientific literature
and our clinical experience

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.060
have shown to be really commonly
problematic to varying degrees

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.395
across a broad range of people.

00:01:33.395 --> 00:01:36.246
So you pull that stuff out
completely for 30 days.

00:01:36.246 --> 00:01:37.620
And you're going
to evaluate what

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.110
changes-- energy, sleep,
digestion, mood, skin,

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.990
athletic performance, recovery,
cravings, any kind of symptoms,

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.219
migraines, asthma,
allergies, all of this stuff.

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:49.510
You're going to see what
happens in the absence of some

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.820
of these potentially
problematic triggers.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.610
At the end of the
30 days, you then

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.430
put those food back
in very carefully

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.950
and systematically,
one at a time,

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.970
like a scientific experiment.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.990
And you pay attention
to what changes.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.630
So does your
digestion get worse?

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.730
Does your skin break out?

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.220
Does that shoulder
pain come back?

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.820
It allows you to figure out how
food impacts you individually

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.940
because there's no
one-size-fits-all.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.840
And it lets you create
the perfect diet

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.010
for you going forward.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.530
STACEY SASAKI: Who
is the Whole30 for?

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.720
Is it for anyone?

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.410
Is it for kids?

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.550
Anyone can do this?

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.940
MELISSA HARTWIG: I think
everyone in the whole world

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:24.856
should do the Whole30.

00:02:24.856 --> 00:02:26.910
But that's just me.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.420
We have a lot of
medical doctors who

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.740
are using our program
with their patients

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.010
and seeing amazing results
with things like high blood

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.230
pressure, high cholesterol,
type 2 diabetes,

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.310
autoimmune conditions.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.750
But you don't have to be sick
to benefit from the Whole30.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.810
So if you're just looking
for improved energy,

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.400
managing your cravings,
reducing digestive distress,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.480
or weight loss, even
though that's not

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.580
the main focus of our program,
the Whole30 is for you.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.900
STACEY SASAKI: OK, and so tell
us a little bit more about what

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.950
we can have on the Whole30 so
we don't go into that what we

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.450
can't.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.658
MELISSA HARTWIG: I like that.

00:03:01.658 --> 00:03:03.210
I always like
starting with the cans

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.240
because the list of
no's can be a little

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.450
intimidating on the Whole30.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.950
So let's start with
what you will be eating.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.825
And I'm going to paint
a really good picture.

00:03:09.825 --> 00:03:12.310
So meat, seafood, and
eggs, ideally naturally

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.160
raised and fed.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.290
But you can have animal protein.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.860
And we encourage a moderate
portion with every meal.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.795
So it's certainly
not meat, meat, meat.

00:03:19.795 --> 00:03:21.120
It's not a carnivorous plan.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.950
It's actually really
moderate portions.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.330
You're eating lot and lots of
plants, so lots of vegetables,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.380
fresh fruit.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.400
We're not afraid of things
like potatoes, sweet potatoes,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.510
or fruit as a whole,
natural, nutrient-dense food.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.150
You're eating good healthy fats,
so things like avocado, olives,

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.760
olive oil, duck fat,
ghee, coconut oil,

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.040
and coconut products.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.410
And then you're doing
herbs and spices.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.100
And people who do
Whole30 recipes,

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.340
like those who guest post on our
Whole30 recipes Instagram feed,

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.710
get incredibly creative
with these really hearty,

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.230
nourishing Whole30 meals.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.220
STACEY SASAKI: So if I wanted
the super paleo double fudge

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.340
whatever, as long as
the ingredients are

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.124
like fake fudge, can I eat that?

00:04:06.124 --> 00:04:08.540
MELISSA HARTWIG: Oh, you're
setting me up now, aren't you?

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.430
So there is a rule
in the Whole30 that

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.410
says you are not allowed to
recreate baked goods, treats,

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.110
desserts, junk foods
with technically

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.310
compliant ingredients.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.899
So there is a way to
make Whole30 compliant

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:22.720
pancakes or muffins or cookies.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.310
But remember, the Whole30 is
about changing your health,

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.850
but also your habits and
your emotional relationship

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.770
with food.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.140
And these comfort foods are what
make us feel so out of control.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.880
We start eating.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.292
And we can't stop eating them.

00:04:35.292 --> 00:04:37.000
So if you're trying
to change your habits

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.625
and your relationship with food,
and you eat pancakes, muffins,

00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:41.520
and cookies, and then
you do the Whole30

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.270
and you continue to eat
pancakes, muffins, and cookies,

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.290
how much are those
things going to change?

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.710
So we do have a rule
that says that's a no-no.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.960
STACEY SASAKI: So you
said we can have fruit.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.940
MELISSA HARTWIG: Right.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.815
STACEY SASAKI: I have
this thing about fruit.

00:04:54.815 --> 00:04:58.120
I have a friend who says no
one ever got fat off of fruit,

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.780
so you're fine.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.070
But if you saw my
fruit mound I have

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.030
morning and every
afternoon working here,

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.270
you'd be like, hmmm.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.564
I think I'm the only person
who might be able to do it.

00:05:06.564 --> 00:05:09.445
Is that good as a
dessert replacement?

00:05:09.445 --> 00:05:11.320
MELISSA HARTWIG: So
again, we don't generally

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.547
encourage dessert replacements,
because even if it's

00:05:13.547 --> 00:05:15.130
a healthier choice,
what we want to do

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.586
is get you out of
the habit of dessert.

00:05:17.586 --> 00:05:18.960
I don't want you
to feel like you

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.000
have to have something
sweet before the meal can

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.980
feel complete.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.700
So if you want dessert
occasionally, great, eat it.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.480
That's fantastic.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.521
But I don't want you to
feel like it's necessary.

00:05:30.368 --> 00:05:32.037
I'm not afraid of eating fruit.

00:05:32.037 --> 00:05:33.870
But what I don't want
you to do is use fruit

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.540
to satisfy your sugar cravings.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.100
So if every day at
3 o'clock, you're

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.770
used to having a Snickers bar,
and then you do the Whole30,

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.170
and every day at 3
o'clock, you're like,

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.669
OK, well, I can't
do a Snickers bar,

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.500
so I'm going to do a Lara Bar,
it's a better food choice,

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.777
but you're still
feeding your brain

00:05:48.777 --> 00:05:50.860
the sugar that it's throwing
a temper tantrum for.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.240
So you're not actually changing
anything in that pattern.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.240
So it's not just about
what you're eating.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.910
It's about why you're
eating it and some

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.720
of the emotional reasons
behind that relationship

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.804
with that particular food.

00:06:00.804 --> 00:06:02.678
STACEY SASAKI: So how
does the Whole30 really

00:06:02.678 --> 00:06:04.790
help you get at those
emotional relationships?

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.804
You just don't eat if you're
having those sugar cravings?

00:06:07.804 --> 00:06:08.720
MELISSA HARTWIG: Yeah.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.300
STACEY SASAKI: Yeah?

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.716
MELISSA HARTWIG:
Well, I mean, no.

00:06:10.716 --> 00:06:11.890
STACEY SASAKI: Dont eat it.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.931
MELISSA HARTWIG: A lot of
these traditional diets

00:06:13.931 --> 00:06:16.260
just ask you to white knuckle
your way through them.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.470
Right?

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.880
They don't provide
a lot of rationale.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.030
They don't provide support.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:20.488
They don't provide
a big community.

00:06:20.488 --> 00:06:22.170
They're not giving
you alternatives

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.050
to not eating the cookie
at 9 o'clock at night.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.980
So all you're
doing is willpower,

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.480
white knuckling
your way through it,

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.600
thinking about what you're
going to eat on Day 31,

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.250
the carbopalooza that
you're going to have, right?

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.755
What we do on the Whole30
is provide alternatives.

00:06:35.755 --> 00:06:38.324
So because we limit
those comfort foods

00:06:38.324 --> 00:06:39.740
that you would
normally reach for,

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.197
and because we've got really
strong recommendations

00:06:43.197 --> 00:06:44.780
against-- like, OK,
well, yes, they're

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.480
just homemade plantain chips.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.210
But if you feel like you're not
in control when you eat them,

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.800
is that really what you
want for your Whole30?

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.170
We force people to find other
ways to comfort themselves,

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.030
to reward themselves, to
self-soothe, to show love

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.500
with other people
in their lives so

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.370
that at the end of the
program, you actually

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.550
have some new habits
to fall back on,

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.694
not just the same habits
with different foods.

00:07:05.694 --> 00:07:07.110
STACEY SASAKI:
What kind of things

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.226
can we use besides
food to self-soothe?

00:07:09.226 --> 00:07:10.274
It's hard, right?

00:07:10.274 --> 00:07:11.690
MELISSA HARTWIG:
Yeah, it's funny.

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:12.470
It is tough.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.350
But I said on
Instagram the other day

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:15.830
and so many people
responded to it,

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.760
like, you're not
looking for a cookie.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.620
You're looking for a connection.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.750
And so often what
I find is people

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.550
who rely on food for
those emotional--

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:25.979
to fill that emotional hole.

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:27.770
You're not going to
find that at the bottom

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:28.960
of a bag of potato chips.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.200
And we all know this.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.680
But we don't know
what else to do.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.130
And because the food is
super normally stimulating,

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.420
incredibly rewarding, and
it's got low satiety factors,

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.265
we overconsume.

00:07:39.265 --> 00:07:41.099
And then we feel even
worse about ourselves.

00:07:41.099 --> 00:07:43.139
And then we say we're not
going to do that again,

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:45.600
except that we do because we
don't know what else to do.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.300
And I find the
interpersonal connection

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.310
to be so key in relieving
anxiety and stress

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:54.350
and having that motivation
and that accountability

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:55.960
and giving and receiving love.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.460
So I think the next time you
find yourself in that situation

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.060
where you're reaching for food
that you don't really want,

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.670
but you don't know what else to
do, reach out to someone else

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:04.169
instead.

00:08:04.169 --> 00:08:05.320
Go see a friend.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.930
Text message, phone call, make
it as personal as you can.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.030
And I really would
find it hard to believe

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:11.749
that that didn't
relieve or fill you up

00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:13.040
with what you were looking for.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.040
STACEY SASAKI: Great.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.590
And you have a whole
Whole30 community too

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:19.552
for people to reach out to.

00:08:19.552 --> 00:08:20.430
What's that like?

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.013
MELISSA HARTWIG: The
Whole30 community

00:08:22.013 --> 00:08:24.960
is incredibly robust,
fiercely loyal,

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.550
and I think one of the
most positive and welcoming

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:28.560
communities online.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.350
We've got almost two million
photos hashtagged #Whole30

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:32.799
on Instagram right now.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:34.299
I mean, it is the thriving.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:36.706
And people are connecting
with each other.

00:08:36.706 --> 00:08:39.080
So if you don't have someone
at home or in your community

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.100
that you're doing the Whole30
with, you can come to my house.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.760
And we'll make sure that you
stay motivated and accountable.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.930
We'll answer your questions.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:47.310
We'll provide you with support.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.640
I have a lot of people
who will Snapchat me

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.602
and say, I really
want a cookie today.

00:08:51.602 --> 00:08:52.810
I don't know what else to do.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.768
And sometimes, all they
need is someone to say,

00:08:54.768 --> 00:08:56.100
you're not going out like that.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.290
And they're OK.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:58.340
And they keep going.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.060
So this is how connected
I am to our community,

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.260
and my entire team.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.924
So yeah, I really am super
proud of our Whole30ers.

00:09:04.924 --> 00:09:06.090
STACEY SASAKI: That's great.

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:07.446
That's really great.

00:09:07.446 --> 00:09:10.540
So the person who like, I'm
going to have a cookie today.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:11.610
I can't resist.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.670
They actually do it on
the Whole30 program.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:14.820
Then what happens?

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.930
MELISSA HARTWIG: So
ideally, with the Whole30,

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:19.690
if you go off-plan,
you start over.

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:22.120
And it's not because we're
trying to be like a hazing,

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.930
or like the boot camp of
paleo, because the basis,

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.400
the foundation of the Whole30
is an elimination diet.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.580
You are eliminating these
foods to see whether or not

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:32.800
they work for you.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.910
And the analogy I like to
use is, say you have 10 cats,

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.110
and you want to know if
you're allergic to cats.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.330
So you get rid of
nine of your cats.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.100
Do you feel better?

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.880
Maybe, but you still have a cat.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.124
How are you supposed
to know whether or not

00:09:47.124 --> 00:09:49.290
cats impact you if you've
still got one hanging out?

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:51.900
So you want to know if
you're allergic to cats.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:52.630
You have 10 cats.

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:53.963
You give up all 10 of your cats.

00:09:53.963 --> 00:09:56.636
But Saturday morning, you kick
you heels up with the cat.

00:09:56.636 --> 00:09:58.010
Or Friday night,
you're like, I'm

00:09:58.010 --> 00:09:59.610
just going to have
one little cat.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:00.460
Right?

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.109
Whether that's pizza
or a beer or whatever

00:10:03.109 --> 00:10:05.150
it is you're thinking
about, you can't accurately

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.200
evaluate how these
foods are impacting you

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.900
if you're including them even
a little bit in the plan.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.540
So it's 100%
elimination for 30 days.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.552
Think of it like a
scientific experiment.

00:10:14.552 --> 00:10:16.010
And if you do go
off-plan, I really

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.316
encourage people to start over,
both for the physiological

00:10:19.316 --> 00:10:20.690
reasons, but also,
because I want

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:25.810
you to honor the commitment that
you made to yourself, 30 days.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:28.840
STACEY SASAKI: So you mentioned,
obviously, paleo in there.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.004
Is the Whole30 a paleo diet?

00:10:31.004 --> 00:10:31.920
Are there differences?

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.420
What's the--

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.545
MELISSA HARTWIG: There are
significant differences.

00:10:34.545 --> 00:10:36.920
It's based on the general
framework of the paleo diet

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.880
because the research
behind the foods that

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.230
are eliminated on the paleo
diet are pretty solid.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:43.960
Again, we're not saying
these foods are good or bad.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.501
We're not saying these foods
are healthy or less healthy

00:10:46.501 --> 00:10:47.000
for you.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.880
We're saying they're
very commonly

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.620
problematic to varying degrees.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.000
And I don't know how they
work for you until you

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.590
do the Whole30 and
do this experiment

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:57.390
and figure it out for yourself.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:01.170
So the foods that you eliminate
on the Whole30 like grains,

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.220
legumes, and dairy
are all foods that

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.650
are also off-limits with
the paleo-style diet.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.999
But we do include
potatoes in the Whole30

00:11:07.999 --> 00:11:09.790
because they're a real
nutrient-dense food.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:12.320
And lots of paleo people
say potatoes don't count.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.290
You're not allowed to
do those egg and banana

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:16.695
pancakes that I talked
about and some of the paleo

00:11:16.695 --> 00:11:18.320
treats and desserts
that are out there.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.570
So there are some differences.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:23.530
Our program is for a
very specific purpose.

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:25.840
STACEY SASAKI: And so
when we're talking about,

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.400
we do this Whole30.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.100
We make it.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.310
Thank, god.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:30.800
What happens next?

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:31.345
It's scary.

00:11:31.345 --> 00:11:32.720
MELISSA HARTWIG:
It can be scary.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.560
And that's really what "Food
Freedom Forever" is about

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.250
is people did the Whole30.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:36.708
We've had millions
of people do it.

00:11:36.708 --> 00:11:37.970
And they have amazing success.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:40.060
And they feel like they
really changed their habits.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.560
And it's like the first thing
that's really worked for them.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.080
And then they're
like, OK, now what?

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.621
Because I don't want to go back
to the way that I was eating,

00:11:46.621 --> 00:11:48.400
but I don't know
how to not do that,

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.240
especially in the
face of a holiday,

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.550
a vacation, a stressful event.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.830
So that's really what
"Food Freedom Forever"

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:56.610
is about is it's
the three-step plan

00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:00.490
to help people get past that
short-term dietary intervention

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.240
and turn what they've
learned into a lifetime

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.440
of healthy habits.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.760
STACEY SASAKI: So it
stems from the terror

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.590
that people feel
when they're like,

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:10.336
oh, I have to go back
into the real world

00:12:10.336 --> 00:12:11.459
now, eat some real food.

00:12:11.459 --> 00:12:12.750
What's that going to look like?

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:14.083
I mean, maybe that's excitement.

00:12:14.083 --> 00:12:16.337
But I think for a lot of
people, it's also terror.

00:12:16.337 --> 00:12:17.920
MELISSA HARTWIG: We
call it frexcited.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.910
It's frightened and
excited at the same time.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:20.130
Right?

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:22.380
I mean, you're excited to
get back to some of the foods

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.100
that you really love and
see how they work for you.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.390
But at the same time, you
feel so good that you just

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:27.431
don't want to mess it up.

00:12:27.431 --> 00:12:30.180
And you're afraid that if you
do let some of these foods

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.880
back in, it's going to send
you down this slippery slide

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.937
of feeling out of control again.

00:12:35.937 --> 00:12:38.270
And I've provided a lot of
guidance over the years about

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.640
what to do, but never in a
really clear step-by- step

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.890
do this, do that format.

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:46.310
So this came from my community
saying, I need more help.

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:48.934
I need more help in
life after the Whole30.

00:12:48.934 --> 00:12:50.850
STACEY SASAKI: You
mentioned that carbopalooza

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:53.210
that could happen immediately
following your Whole30.

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:56.400
Day 31, yay, I can
have all the pasta.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.250
But I don't think
that's how it works.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:59.750
So tell us about
the reintroduction.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.374
MELISSA HARTWIG:
Yeah, we did a survey.

00:13:01.374 --> 00:13:03.750
I think we had more than
5,000 Whole30ers respond.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.561
And of those people
who finished a Whole30

00:13:05.561 --> 00:13:07.560
and said that at the
beginning of their program,

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.060
they thought they
were going to want

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:12.067
to eat all the things on Day
31, 75% of them at the end

00:13:12.067 --> 00:13:13.400
said, I actually didn't want to.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.357
I felt so different.

00:13:14.357 --> 00:13:16.690
And things had changed so
much-- my tastes had changed--

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:18.670
that I didn't want to do that.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:22.180
But in between the
Whole30 and your food

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.530
freedom comes this
reintroduction period.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:27.120
Remember, you eliminate, and
then you bring them back in.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:31.060
So we've got both a 10-day
fast track reintroduction

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.710
outlined in the "Whole30" book.

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:34.865
And then we've got
this slow roll option

00:13:34.865 --> 00:13:36.990
for people who maybe don't
want to bring everything

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.480
back in within 10 days.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.130
But the reintroduction is
the money of the program.

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.160
This is where you learn
how these foods impact you

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.120
and where you learn
how much and how often

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.660
and what kinds of foods you
can bring back into your life

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.140
so that it's delicious and
healthy and feels sustainable,

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.190
but in a way that's not
going to mess you up

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:56.938
in terms of how awesome
you want to look and feel.

00:13:56.938 --> 00:13:58.240
STACEY SASAKI: Great.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:02.280
So if we're slowly reintroducing
things, what does it look like?

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.850
Say, OK, today is dairy day.

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:08.590
Do I go and eat yogurt
all day and top if off

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.955
with a dab of milk and
then have a brick of cheese

00:14:10.955 --> 00:14:11.580
with ice cream?

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:12.500
MELISSA HARTWIG: Maybe
not a brick of cheese.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:12.680
STACEY SASAKI: No?

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:13.432
Oh, OK.

00:14:13.432 --> 00:14:15.190
MELISSA HARTWIG: But basically,
what you want to do-- again,

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:16.898
think of it like a
scientific experiment.

00:14:16.898 --> 00:14:18.870
Dairy is going to be
your experimental factor.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.203
And the Whole30 is your control.

00:14:20.203 --> 00:14:21.930
So your entire diet
for the whole day

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:23.230
is going to be Whole30.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:25.670
The only thing you're
adding back in is dairy.

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:27.680
So you would do your
typical Whole30 breakfast.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.830
Maybe it's some poached eggs,
maybe a little bit of avocado

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.070
and a veggie medley
and some mixed berries.

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:36.459
But you're going to sprinkle
some cheese on your eggs.

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:38.000
So you're going to
add the dairy back

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.470
in a way that allows you
to evaluate just the dairy

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:42.220
component alone.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.886
And then you're going to go back
to the Whole30 for two or three

00:14:44.886 --> 00:14:47.006
days and see what happens
in terms of the reaction

00:14:47.006 --> 00:14:48.880
because sometimes the
reaction can take a day

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.150
or so to manifest, depending
on how sensitive you are.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:53.600
STACEY SASAKI: You don't
want to overdo it, but slowly

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.490
bring it in and test it out.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:56.200
MELISSA HARTWIG: Yeah, and
you have to do enough of it

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:56.830
to really see.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:59.030
So if you just put a drop
of milk in your coffee,

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.410
what are the chances
that you're really

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:01.320
going to notice an impact?

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.240
So you want to do some
cream in your coffee,

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.640
some cheese on your omelet,
maybe a side of yogurt

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.041
with your lunch, and then
at dinner, some other form

00:15:08.041 --> 00:15:09.290
of dairy that you really like.

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:12.110
What you don't want to
do is do a giant bowl

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:14.440
of ice cream that also has
cookie dough, that also

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.460
is topped with chocolate syrup
because then you're not going

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.780
to know what's impacting
you, the dairy or the gluten

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.380
or the massive sugar bomb.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:22.130
STACEY SASAKI: OK.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.650
So what about people
who-- is there

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:28.656
some way to do this if you
don't want to go strict Whole30?

00:15:28.656 --> 00:15:30.030
They're pretty
strict guidelines.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.570
I think that they
make a lot of fans.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:32.986
And it's really
great to find out.

00:15:32.986 --> 00:15:36.425
But some people are like, so
if I said I want to do this,

00:15:36.425 --> 00:15:39.770
but I don't care how
alcohol affects me.

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:41.410
I don't care if it
makes me bloated.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.240
I don't care if it
makes my skin break out.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.930
I want to try to get rid
of all the other things,

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:45.680
bring it all in.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.755
Can I still do a
Whole30ish program?

00:15:48.755 --> 00:15:50.284
Or is it a no-no?

00:15:50.284 --> 00:15:51.700
MELISSA HARTWIG:
Doing the Whole30

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.100
is a little like being pregnant.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.480
You either are, or you're not.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.540
There is no kind of, right?

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.710
So if you're going
to do the program,

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:00.260
the way I describe
it is if you're

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.870
going to come play my game,
you need to play by my rules.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.597
And all I'm asking
for is 30 days.

00:16:04.597 --> 00:16:06.930
And all I'm asking is for you
to trust me for one month.

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:09.580
And I've got seven years
of experience backing up

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.600
my recommendations.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.970
But the Whole30 is
not for everyone.

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:14.750
So if you're vegan,
for example, you

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.320
can't do the Whole30 as written
because we are basically

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.080
excluding all of your
plant-based protein sources.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.790
And the rules are rigid.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.890
And it's a lot to imagine
giving up at once.

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:27.100
It can be a very
emotional journey.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.790
So in "Food Freedom
Forever," I have

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.530
outlined several different
resets that you can do,

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:33.980
not all of which are as
intense as the Whole30,

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.730
but all of which will
get you to the place

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.512
where you know how
food impacts you,

00:16:37.512 --> 00:16:39.970
and you're in a better balance
in terms of your blood sugar

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:42.650
regulation, hormonal balance,
digestion, and immune system.

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:45.450
So the Whole30 isn't
the price of admission

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.154
for "Food "Freedom,"
but I will strongly

00:16:47.154 --> 00:16:48.320
encourage everyone to do it.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.406
And I do several
times in the book.

00:16:50.406 --> 00:16:51.364
STACEY SASAKI: Awesome.

00:16:51.364 --> 00:16:54.360
So if you're looking
to do something,

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.150
your book will give you a few
different options for things.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.200
Yeah, I did have the
question as well is,

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.320
if I'm a vegetarian,
vegan, or I can't have soy,

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.840
so I can't have tofu,
which I would usually

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.720
have on the Whole30 strictly.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.510
But you definitely
give people options.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:10.489
MELISSA HARTWIG: Yeah,
there is a full vegan

00:17:10.489 --> 00:17:11.569
reset outlined here.

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:15.400
And you're eliminating the most
commonly problematic protein

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.750
sources, again, according
to the literature.

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:20.240
And in all of the resets,
you're pulling out alcohol.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.325
Like, come on, guys.

00:17:21.325 --> 00:17:23.200
You're going to pull
out alcohol for 30 days.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:23.700
Right?

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.866
In all of the resets, you're
eliminating added sugar

00:17:25.866 --> 00:17:28.010
and some of those processed
food with no breaks,

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:31.460
and some of those sweet treats
and desserts and baked goods.

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.850
All of the resets,
that's the very baseline

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:35.720
of the elimination.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.740
There's a basic reset
outlined in here

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.580
that's as bare
bones as possible.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.845
But what I say in the book,
with all sorts of tough love--

00:17:42.845 --> 00:17:44.470
emphasis on the love--
is if you're not

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:46.270
willing to do at
least this, you're

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:47.812
not ready for this
program right now.

00:17:47.812 --> 00:17:48.936
STACEY SASAKI: That's fair.

00:17:48.936 --> 00:17:49.550
That's fair.

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:51.000
I like the tough
love in the book.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.618
MELISSA HARTWIG:
Heavy on the love.

00:17:52.618 --> 00:17:54.390
STACEY SASAKI: Yes,
of course, of course.

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:55.305
But it's very real.

00:17:55.305 --> 00:17:57.170
You give it us straight.

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:59.250
So I very much appreciate that.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.660
Have you ever had anybody go
through the Whole30 program

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.330
and do their whole
reintroduction, ad

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:06.060
they're just like, I don't
notice anything different.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.640
I don't notice any of my
allergies flare up or whatever.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.194
I still had headaches
the whole time.

00:18:11.194 --> 00:18:12.360
Is there anything like that?

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.943
MELISSA HARTWIG:
Sometimes the Whole30

00:18:13.943 --> 00:18:16.830
doesn't work super well
for absolutely everybody.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:20.470
For some people, food may
not be your biggest issue.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:23.170
If you've already been eating
really squeaky clean or close

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:26.487
to Whole30ish and you're
already pretty healthy,

00:18:26.487 --> 00:18:28.070
maybe there's something
else going on.

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:30.528
Maybe it's because you're only
sleeping five hours a night,

00:18:30.528 --> 00:18:32.670
or you're doing two-a-day
CrossFit sessions

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.100
and not recovering actively.

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.500
So food might not be
your biggest issue.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.520
The Whole30 also
can't fix everything.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.520
So if you've got this
underlying, undiagnosed gut

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.580
infection or you've got
an autoimmune condition

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.830
that you've been living with
and it's been progressing

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.655
for the last 20
years, the Whole30

00:18:47.655 --> 00:18:49.780
might give you a good start
towards feeling better.

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.960
But you may need to work with
a functional medicine doctor

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.390
to make sure that you're
getting the treatment that's

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:56.290
applicable for you.

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:57.140
Yeah.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:59.850
STACEY SASAKI: So yeah,
that makes a lot of sense.

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:02.430
The other thing that I
think can be problematic

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:06.900
is the whole thing around
social networks, family.

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.170
How do you navigate that?

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:09.910
I know going to my
mom's and saying,

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:11.368
oh, I'm not eating
gluten or dairy.

00:19:11.368 --> 00:19:12.372
I'm not having alcohol.

00:19:12.372 --> 00:19:14.580
I'm not-- she'll just be
like, well, don't come home.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.250
MELISSA HARTWIG: Right.

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:17.610
STACEY SASAKI: So what do we do?

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:19.810
MELISSA HARTWIG: So
not what you just said.

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:20.050
STACEY SASAKI: OK.

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:21.370
MELISSA HARTWIG: That's
a terrible way to do it.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.965
I actually have three chapters
in "Food Freedom Forever"

00:19:23.965 --> 00:19:26.090
about how to talk to friends,
family, and coworkers

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:27.840
about food, three chapters.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.740
Not overkill because talking to
friends and family about food

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.160
is third only to
religion and politics

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.770
in terms of how
divisive it can be.

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:37.520
You started talking about
food and changing your diet,

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.180
and immediately,
people get judgmental.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.717
They get defensive like you
don't have to do anything.

00:19:41.717 --> 00:19:44.050
You can just roll up to the
table with your Whole30 meal

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:45.590
and the entire table
all of a sudden

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:47.380
feels like it's being attacked.

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:50.390
So what I like to
say is A, don't have

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:52.380
the conversation over food.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:52.880
Right?

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.620
Have it away from food and
ideally, ahead of time.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:57.530
B, you always want
to be lead with all

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.050
of the positive things.

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:02.180
And you want to make the
conversation as personal

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.410
as is appropriate for
your relationship.

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:06.640
So if you're talking to
your mom, and you say,

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.654
I hear the Whole30 is
really good for cravings,

00:20:08.654 --> 00:20:11.070
that's not going to particularly
bring you close together.

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:13.590
If you say, Mom, you sent me
home with your chocolate chip

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:14.665
cookies the other day.

00:20:14.665 --> 00:20:16.290
And I said I was only
going to eat one.

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:17.520
And I ended up eating five.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.560
And it makes me feel
really bad about myself

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.520
that I can't control
what I'm eating.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.700
So I'm going to do this
experiment for 30 days

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.050
where I try to break
my reliance on sugar

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:27.410
and change my cravings.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.440
It means I won't be able
to eat your cookies.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.710
But it's only for a month.

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:33.010
And when I get done, I'll
be able to really enjoy

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:34.690
them the way you want me to.

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:35.240
Right?

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:38.000
That's a totally
different conversation.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.240
So make it personal.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.590
And then make it relatable.

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.290
So if your mom is
mostly sedentary,

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:43.914
you saying, I'm going
to do the Whole30

00:20:43.914 --> 00:20:46.820
and I'm hoping to cut my
5K time by three minutes,

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:47.520
not relatable.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.340
If you know your
mom also suffers

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:53.220
from cravings or sleep or
energy issues, bond with her

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:53.807
on that level.

00:20:53.807 --> 00:20:55.890
Man, every day at 2 o'clock,
my head's on my desk,

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:57.886
and I feel like I need
caffeine and chocolate.

00:20:57.886 --> 00:20:58.760
You know what I mean?

00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.760
Oh, yeah, me too.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.140
I'm going to do this
Whole30 because it's really

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.120
meant to reset
your energy levels

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.570
and give you that awake feeling
without needing extra caffeine.

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:09.780
And now, she's listening.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:10.864
So those are my best tips.

00:21:10.864 --> 00:21:12.613
STACEY SASAKI: Is that
where you also say,

00:21:12.613 --> 00:21:13.970
maybe you should do it with me?

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:14.954
Or how does that work?

00:21:14.954 --> 00:21:17.370
MELISSA HARTWIG: Tread very
carefully with that, you guys.

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:20.310
The phrase I like to use
is lead by quiet example.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:22.000
You can ask for her support.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.502
Mom, will you
support me in this?

00:21:23.502 --> 00:21:25.210
If I'm having a tough
day, can I call you

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:27.150
and have you tell me what
a good job I'm doing?

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:29.691
But you don't want to ever push
someone into trying to do it.

00:21:29.691 --> 00:21:30.230
Right?

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:31.990
Instead, just lead
by quiet example.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.980
Look awesome.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:33.830
Feel awesome.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:36.710
Talk about your results,
your non-scale victories.

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:39.597
Hey, Mom, I saw a plate of
cookies at the office today,

00:21:39.597 --> 00:21:40.680
and I wasn't even tempted.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.530
I feel so good.

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:44.050
What a great sign that is.

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:46.600
And then just sit back
because at some point,

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.989
they will say, what
have you been doing.

00:21:48.989 --> 00:21:50.280
Tell me a little more about it.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.321
And maybe it will take
them a while to get there,

00:21:52.321 --> 00:21:54.549
but you just do you.

00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:56.340
STACEY SASAKI: Talk to
me a little bit more

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.310
about non-scale
victories because I

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:01.680
think our society is really
obsessed with that number that

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.630
appears whenever you get on it.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:04.880
How do you get away from that?

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.570
What are the things
to celebrate?

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:07.820
I think that's a good example.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:08.950
Walking away from the
cookies, I think, Is huge.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:09.700
MELISSA HARTWIG: It's huge.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.550
And so one of the
other rules of the 30

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:12.966
is that you're not
allowed to step

00:22:12.966 --> 00:22:15.580
on the scale for 30 days,
which, for some, is the hardest

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:16.980
rule of them all.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:18.510
But it is not a
weight loss program.

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.370
And it is not about weight.

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:23.330
I think we all need
a break from letting

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:25.970
this $20 hunk of plastic
hold our self-esteem

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:27.600
and self-confidence hostage.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.360
So we focus on what we
call non-scale victories.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.880
And in Whole30 lingo,
it's hashtag #NSV.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.900
And what people will
do is look for things

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.100
like-- maybe some of
them are physical.

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:39.160
Maybe it's oh, I'm
down about belt loop.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.100
Or my wedding ring now fits.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:42.680
It was too small,
and now it fits.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.150
I love hearing that.

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:47.552
Maybe it's a craving thing,
like I didn't need the cookie.

00:22:47.552 --> 00:22:49.010
I was able to walk
past the cookie.

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:50.950
Or I didn't need the candy bar.

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:53.030
Or I finally feel like
I'm in control of food.

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:54.400
Maybe it's digestive.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.460
Maybe it's skin glowing
and clearing up.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:57.850
We hear a lot of that.

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:00.290
Maybe it's I went to my
doctor and my blood sugar

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:01.460
is better managed.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:03.130
Or I'm no longer
type 2 diabetic.

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:06.456
But there is this huge list
of non-scale victory in a PDF

00:23:06.456 --> 00:23:07.830
we give you on
the Whole30 sheet.

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:09.090
And it's like, check
them off, people,

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:11.270
because the more you can
check off, the more motivated

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:12.269
you will be to continue.

00:23:12.269 --> 00:23:13.510
STACEY SASAKI: Totally.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:16.440
And so even after the
Whole30, is it still no scale?

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.172
Are you anti-scale?

00:23:19.172 --> 00:23:21.650
MELISSA HARTWIG: I'm anti-scale
if getting on that number

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:23.060
actually matters.

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:25.162
If you with trepidation
close your eyes

00:23:25.162 --> 00:23:27.370
and cross your fingers before
you step on that scale,

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:29.356
maybe it's better to
get off the scale.

00:23:29.356 --> 00:23:30.480
I have a scale at my house.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:34.910
I use it to weigh my suitcases--
68 pounds for this trip, 68--

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:35.883
or to weight my son.

00:23:35.883 --> 00:23:38.007
And occasionally, I'll step
on and just kind of see

00:23:38.007 --> 00:23:38.507
where I am.

00:23:38.507 --> 00:23:40.600
But it doesn't mean anything.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.530
So I am OK with
weighing yourself

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:44.982
before and after because
for some people, obviously,

00:23:44.982 --> 00:23:47.440
I understand weight loss is a
big goal for a lot of people.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.540
And I don't want to
minimize how amazing it

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:52.850
is if you can eat to satiety
and not count calories and still

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:53.585
lose weight.

00:23:53.585 --> 00:23:54.510
Awesome.

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:59.480
But if that number is going to
ruin your day or make your day,

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.130
maybe you should examine your
relationship with the scale.

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:03.296
STACEY SASAKI: Totally fair.

00:24:03.296 --> 00:24:04.080
Totally fair.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.500
In terms of either
technologies-- we're Google.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.540
We care about are there things
that you are on board with?

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.490
Again, things that are
helpful, [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:18.937
fitness trackers, wearables,
the posture coach, the fork

00:24:18.937 --> 00:24:20.270
that you mentioned in your book.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:21.120
MELISSA HARTWIG: The happy fork.

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.085
Yeah, I don't know
about the happy fork.

00:24:23.085 --> 00:24:26.930
It vibrates to let you know
if you're eating too quickly.

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:27.910
But it's like 80 bucks.

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:29.284
So I'm like, maybe
you could just

00:24:29.284 --> 00:24:31.360
stop eating like
you're in prison.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.473
STACEY SASAKI: That's one
of my favorite quotes.

00:24:32.473 --> 00:24:33.900
MELISSA HARTWIG: But i
do like the wearables.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.774
If you're the kind of
person who is motivated

00:24:35.774 --> 00:24:38.470
by seeing your
results, then things

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:40.760
that can improve on the
Whole30 that you'll notice

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.624
is naturally, your steps will go
up because you'll feel better,

00:24:43.624 --> 00:24:45.040
and you'll want
to be more active,

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.120
and you'll park further away.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.703
And you won't sweat
taking the stairs.

00:24:47.703 --> 00:24:48.380
So that's cool.

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.602
Your sleep quality, being
able to track your sleep,

00:24:50.602 --> 00:24:52.310
and whether you're
falling asleep easier,

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:54.640
sleeping longer, getting
more restful sleep,

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.640
awesome non-scale
victory on the Whole30.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.460
So if you can find some
of those little ways

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.900
to not only track your
progress, but tie it to wow,

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.490
it's stuff that you wouldn't
necessarily, I guess,

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:06.990
link back to your diet.

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:08.450
Taking more steps?

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:11.402
But if you see a change in that,
it can be really motivating.

00:25:11.402 --> 00:25:12.699
STACEY SASAKI: Yeah.

00:25:12.699 --> 00:25:14.740
I have one last question
for you before I open it

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:17.340
up to everybody, who's probably
dying to ask you things.

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.750
They're like, stop talking.

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:21.990
But I'm curious about just
changing the whole relationship

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:23.870
about good and bad foods.

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:26.660
And how do you even
get to that thought

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:27.940
because I think it's hard.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:31.350
It's very hard for people to
know that it's not necessarily

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:33.150
this is good for you,
this is bad for you,

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:35.290
or you're a good
person or a bad person.

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:37.850
And you talk a lot about
the language of food.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:39.080
How do we change that?

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.705
MELISSA HARTWIG: It's
really important.

00:25:40.705 --> 00:25:42.260
I think the language
of food is often

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:44.490
what's holding us hostage
in our relationship.

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:47.102
And what I really
emphasize in the Whole30

00:25:47.102 --> 00:25:49.310
and also in "Food Freedom"
is these foods that you're

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:52.290
eliminating, it's not
because they're bad.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:53.976
There's no good or bad food.

00:25:53.976 --> 00:25:55.850
You're pulling them out
and putting them back

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:57.131
in because they're unknown.

00:25:57.131 --> 00:25:57.630
That's it.

00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:59.713
You just want to figure
out how they work for you.

00:25:59.713 --> 00:26:02.040
And you are not good or
bad based on the food

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.590
that you put on your plate.

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:08.480
And I think once we can get
past the idea of our self-worth

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.440
being tied to what
our body weight is,

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.310
or what size jeans we
fit into, or whether we

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:17.630
are the exerciser or
the healthy person,

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:19.190
I think it makes
a huge difference

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:22.760
in letting food be
more fun and easy

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.260
and playful and
rewarding and joyful.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:27.640
I'm not trying to
take any of that away.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.690
So I write a lot about the
idea of a growth mindset

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:32.990
and changing your language.

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:38.210
It's a real shift, a re-frame,
from the diet culture

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:40.120
we've had for the
last 20 years, where

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:44.040
it was all about deprivation
and restriction and willpower

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.070
and good foods and bad foods.

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:49.195
And I want to change
all of that paradigm.

00:26:49.195 --> 00:26:51.070
STACEY SASAKI: The
learning to think about it

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:54.180
in a different way than we
do, it just seems so hard.

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:57.266
But I think that you give a
lot of great tips in the book.

00:26:57.266 --> 00:26:58.484
I won't spoil them all.

00:26:58.484 --> 00:27:01.170
But yeah, I think
it's a challenge

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:04.409
to be solved, related to
the goods and the bads.

00:27:04.409 --> 00:27:06.700
MELISSA HARTWIG: Yeah, but
the more you practice that--

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.180
and I talk about things
like leaving post-it notes

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.030
around your house.

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:12.130
It sounds kind of
silly, but the more

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:14.490
you can reinforce
the ideas behind,

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:17.370
I'm a healthy person
with healthy habits.

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:19.060
And I'm living a
healthy lifestyle.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:21.670
And this is a
scientific experiment.

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:22.710
It's an experiment.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:23.730
It's not a diet.

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:27.630
And the more you can re-frame--
and I really emphasize that

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:30.190
over and over again-- I
think the better chance

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:32.010
you have of that
actually sticking.

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:34.440
And changing your foods and
changing your relationship

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.430
with foods and
feeling like you're

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:38.103
building new healthy habits will
only serve to reinforce that.

00:27:38.103 --> 00:27:39.430
STACEY SASAKI: I love that.

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:40.070
That's great.

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:42.080
All right, guys.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.060
Open it up.

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:44.732
We have one right there.

00:27:44.732 --> 00:27:45.450
Yeah, sorry.

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:48.847
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:27:48.847 --> 00:27:49.680
MELISSA HARTWIG: Hi.

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.305
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for coming.

00:27:51.305 --> 00:27:53.170
This was really interesting.

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:57.200
And as someone who's generally
a health-focused eater,

00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:00.277
but also hasn't
ever really dieted,

00:28:00.277 --> 00:28:02.610
I was wondering if you could
elaborate a little bit more

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:05.080
on your last point there,
about the idea of after you're

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.700
done with the
Whole30, not thinking

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.274
about foods as good and bad.

00:28:11.274 --> 00:28:12.940
I don't know too much
about the Whole30.

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:16.320
But I've seen peers or
people on my Facebook

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.700
or whatever doing it.

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.810
And to me, it always
kind of worries me,

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:24.690
the idea of saying you
can't have these things.

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:27.850
And it seems a little bit sad
if after the Whole30 would end,

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:30.390
then you still feel like,
I can't have the cookies.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:32.390
I can't have--
even if you end up

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:36.550
being OK with dairy and eggs.

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:39.980
And eating disorders are also
a thing that happens too.

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:42.897
So, I guess, what's your
perspective on after people

00:28:42.897 --> 00:28:44.480
finish the Whole30
and they figure out

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:47.840
what they can and can't have,
then transitioning to be like,

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.857
OK, now we're going to
bake pumpkin cookies.

00:28:49.857 --> 00:28:50.940
And I'm going to have one.

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:51.600
And that's OK.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.849
MELISSA HARTWIG: Yeah, that's
a really great question.

00:28:53.849 --> 00:28:57.261
And that all-or-nothing
is the diet mentality.

00:28:57.261 --> 00:28:57.760
Right?

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.750
I'm either on this diet
and I'm white knuckling

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:02.660
my way through it, or I'm
face first in a box of donuts.

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:05.020
And so I start from
the very beginning,

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:08.030
from your elimination period
with the Whole30 saying,

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:11.020
you're not eliminating these
foods because they're bad.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:12.470
They're just unknown.

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:14.720
And you just want to figure
out how they work for you.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.290
And it's not the Whole365.

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:18.270
It's the Whole30.

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:23.060
So it's a 30-day, scientific
elimination period.

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:27.450
And then after that, I want you
to live in your food freedom.

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:29.800
I want you to figure out what
does work for you and what

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:30.300
doesn't.

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:33.050
In fact, the goal I propose in
"Food Freedom Forever" is this.

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:38.220
I want your diet to be as
broad an expansive as possible,

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:40.420
while still looking
and feeling as awesome

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:41.890
as you want to look and feel.

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:43.480
And you get to draw that line.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.010
I'm not drawing it for you.

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:47.680
So I have figured out
that I can get away

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.210
with a couple
glasses of wine here

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:51.520
and there, some Justin's
Peanut Butter Cups here

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.160
and there, my mom's
chocolate chip walnut cake.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.916
And I still look
just as awesome.

00:29:55.916 --> 00:29:57.290
And I still feel
just as awesome.

00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:58.200
So guess what?

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.890
I do because it makes
my life so delicious

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:03.780
and healthy and rewarding
and happy, like emotionally

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:04.660
healthy.

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:06.500
So I want you to do that.

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:08.310
And if you start
from the beginning

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:10.185
not thinking about
these foods as bad

00:30:10.185 --> 00:30:11.810
and that's why you're
eliminating them,

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:13.810
then you shouldn't
feel the same guilt

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:15.430
when you bring them back in.

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:18.390
I don't want you to feel guilty
reintroducing these foods.

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:20.390
You may make the wrong
choice sometimes.

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:23.040
I may overdo it on the wine or
my mom's chocolate chip walnut

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:23.540
cake.

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:25.400
And I'm like, wow, that
was a poor decision.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.390
I don't feel as good.

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:27.380
And my energy is down.

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:28.110
My mood is down.

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:31.170
OK, so I learned from that,
and I apply it the next time

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:32.860
that situation comes up.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:36.950
But I encourage everyone
to find that line.

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:38.900
How much can you
get away with so

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.850
that your life is amazing and
rewarding and delicious and

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:45.720
satisfying and full of your
family and friend traditions

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.970
while still maintaining
all of the health

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:50.737
benefits you want to maintain?

00:30:50.737 --> 00:30:51.570
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:53.412
MELISSA HARTWIG: Yeah, thanks.

00:30:53.412 --> 00:30:55.620
STACEY SASAKI: Just to follow
up on that, what if you

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:58.990
do you overdo it and
just completely fall off

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:00.710
after you've done your Whole30?

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:02.350
MELISSA HARTWIG:
So one of the steps

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:06.510
in "Food Freedom Forever,"
so it's you do your reset.

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:08.180
You live your food freedom.

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:10.370
And you acknowledge that
your habits have slipped.

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:13.110
So I have built
right into the plan

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:15.330
that you will fall
off the wagon.

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:16.340
Isn't that relieving?

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:17.700
Because all of these
diets are like,

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:19.366
oh, you're going to
do our 21-day detox,

00:31:19.366 --> 00:31:22.019
and then you'll never, ever
have to diet ever again.

00:31:22.019 --> 00:31:23.810
Everything's going to
be magically changed.

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:25.700
And that's completely
unrealistic,

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.660
even for a program as
good as the Whole30.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.560
And it's good in
changing people's habits.

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:33.370
Eventually, you fall
back into old ruts.

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:34.980
You're trying to
overwrite decades

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.010
of less healthy behaviors
and associations

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:38.610
and emotional
relationships with food.

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:40.720
You're not going to
fix that in 30 days.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:44.120
So if that happens, you just
come back to your reset,

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:48.110
whether it's a full Whole30,
or maybe a Whole3 or a Whole7.

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:51.750
However long you need
to feel back in control

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:55.620
and to get that energy and
sleep and mood and digestion

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:57.050
rocking again, cool.

00:31:57.050 --> 00:31:58.170
You know it works.

00:31:58.170 --> 00:31:59.250
You know how to do it.

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:00.740
You know it's going to
make you feel amazing.

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.406
And then as soon as
you're done, as soon

00:32:02.406 --> 00:32:04.264
as you're able, as
soon as possible,

00:32:04.264 --> 00:32:06.680
because I want you to get right
back to your food freedom,

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.138
you're back to living in your
normal healthy balance again.

00:32:09.138 --> 00:32:10.280
It's simple.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:13.000
And you continue that cycle
literally in perpetuity

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.340
until, ideally, you never need
another Whole30 ever again.

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.210
I'll probably never do
a full 30 ever again.

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:18.590
STACEY SASAKI: Really?

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:19.720
MELISSA HARTWIG:
No, I don't need it.

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.400
STACEY SASAKI: Does it
get easier each time?

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.030
MELISSA HARTWIG:
Of course it does.

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:22.880
It gets easier.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:23.600
You learn more.

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.555
You become more selective
about what's worth it for you.

00:32:26.555 --> 00:32:29.820
You identify foods that
maybe don't work for you,

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:31.480
but it's really nuanced.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.850
Oh, I didn't notice this
after my first Whole30.

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:36.610
But by my third, don't think
this is worth it anymore.

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:37.637
Yeah, it gets easier.

00:32:37.637 --> 00:32:38.970
And it just becomes what you do.

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:40.510
You no longer even
have to think about.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:41.385
STACEY SASAKI: Great.

00:32:41.385 --> 00:32:42.925
MELISSA HARTWIG: Yeah.

00:32:42.925 --> 00:32:44.220
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name's Brooke.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:45.296
Thanks so much for coming.

00:32:45.296 --> 00:32:46.070
MELISSA HARTWIG: Hi, Brooke.

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:48.120
AUDIENCE: I'm on Day 10
of Whole30 round four.

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:50.310
MELISSA HARTWIG:
Yay, welcome back.

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:51.300
AUDIENCE: I've done it.

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.720
This is my fourth time.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.570
And I started a year ago.

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:56.770
And I swear to god, it
completely changed my life.

00:32:56.770 --> 00:33:00.580
So if anyone's doubting, you
absolutely have to try it.

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:05.360
I don't do the gluten or the
dairy or alcohol anymore.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.105
And it has completely
changed my life.

00:33:07.105 --> 00:33:09.060
So thank you.

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:12.940
So with all these resets
and having over the course

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:15.380
of a year decided to
eliminate those things,

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:17.880
the one thing that
does change and does

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.960
keep me going back to
Whole30 is the fact

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.520
that the sugar thing sneaks in.

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:24.670
So if it's like a
fucking-- sorry.

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:26.480
I love gummies.

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:30.050
And I love almond milk ice
cream and stuff like that.

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:31.400
MELISSA HARTWIG: Sure, yeah.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.900
AUDIENCE: But I noticed that
actually, interestingly enough,

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.960
I lost a lot of weight
at the beginning.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.940
And then eliminating all the
foods that affect me poorly,

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:43.480
my weight's actually
gone back up.

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:47.500
I'm wondering what maybe the
scientific reason for that is,

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.480
and if it is the sugar.

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:50.730
I mean, that would make sense.

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:53.280
But I've heard also
before, perhaps,

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:59.716
that your body level sets and
kind of recalibrates after you

00:33:59.716 --> 00:34:00.840
eliminate all these things.

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:01.680
I was just wondering
if you could

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.400
speak to that a little bit.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.710
MELISSA HARTWIG: Yeah,
there's a million questions

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:04.709
I would have to ask you.

00:34:04.709 --> 00:34:08.150
So do you have a history of
yo-yo dieting, where you lose,

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:08.710
then gain.

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:09.710
AUDIENCE: Kind of, yeah.

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:10.719
MELISSA HARTWIG:
How long are you

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:11.900
sleeping every single night?

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:13.233
What are you doing for exercise?

00:34:13.233 --> 00:34:14.570
Is it high intensity stuff?

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:16.239
Are you adequately
recovering from that?

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:17.780
What does your life
stress look like?

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:20.469
We would sit down and have a
serious therapy session for me

00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:23.760
to talk about-- maybe
it's the food, maybe.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.350
A food journal can be very
helpful in this situation

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:29.876
because I might say to
you, how are you getting

00:34:29.876 --> 00:34:31.000
after your Whole30, Brooke.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:31.980
And you're like, I'm
doing pretty well.

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.147
And then if I made you write
down every single thing

00:34:34.147 --> 00:34:36.521
like that, not weighing or
measuring, just write it down,

00:34:36.521 --> 00:34:39.250
you're like, oh, wow, that Luna
Bar and almond milk ice cream's

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:41.030
coming back a
couple times a week.

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:43.420
And we were having a
conversation before about

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:45.406
the bags of the plantain chips.

00:34:45.406 --> 00:34:46.489
You think they're healthy.

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:49.620
If you hoover one of those,
it is like 560 calories.

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:51.310
And it's not that
calories don't count.

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:51.810
Right?

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:54.920
So it's basically like a
mini-meal all unto itself.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:55.940
So maybe a food journal.

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.430
Maybe it's the food.

00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:59.845
But maybe food isn't your
biggest issue anymore.

00:34:59.845 --> 00:35:01.970
And maybe it's time to look
at things like caffeine

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:03.950
consumption and
sleep, or what you're

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:06.680
doing for training and
recovery, or what's

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.070
going on with your life stress.

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:11.440
I know a lot of people
who go on vacation

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.982
and immediately,
they lose 10 pounds,

00:35:12.982 --> 00:35:15.190
even though their eating
habits dramatically changed.

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:16.430
And I'm like, well, shocking.

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:17.980
You have no stress on vacation.

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:19.420
Everything's easy and simple.

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:22.534
So there's just so many
factors that play into that.

00:35:22.534 --> 00:35:24.450
Consider keeping a journal
just for a few days

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:28.020
after your Whole30, just to see
if stuff is sneaking back in.

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:30.997
And then maybe consider going to
work with a functional medicine

00:35:30.997 --> 00:35:32.580
doctor, doing some
very basic testing.

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:35.160
It could be an underlying,
undiagnosed gut infection,

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.110
for example.

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:38.110
Really common in
some of these cases.

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:39.950
So it could be a
number of things.

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:41.757
But it's not always food.

00:35:41.757 --> 00:35:43.590
And I find when people
do multiple Whole30s,

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:46.170
they want to tie
everything back to food.

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:47.660
And food is a huge part of it.

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:49.107
But it's not the only part.

00:35:49.107 --> 00:35:49.940
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:51.150
MELISSA HARTWIG:
Yeah, you're welcome.

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:51.690
And good luck.

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:52.398
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.620
AUDIENCE: Awesome,
thanks for coming.

00:35:58.620 --> 00:35:59.215
Two questions.

00:35:59.215 --> 00:36:00.770
The first one is a simple one.

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:03.660
Just when you travel, how
do you prepare for that?

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:06.130
And what foods do
you personally have?

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:09.720
The second one is more like,
I'm curious on your journey

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.180
to actually write this book.

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:13.810
And I'd be interested
in this because I had

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:15.820
tons of dietary issues earlier.

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:18.350
And I was placed on
the low FODMAP diet.

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:20.990
It's just like
Whole30, but stricter.

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:22.470
And it was phenomenal.

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:23.670
It changed my life.

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:26.120
Now, I'm like very paleo
with a side of sugar.

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:30.270
And so just curious how
you got to this point.

00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:32.815
Was it you hit some mark,
and then you were like, wow,

00:36:32.815 --> 00:36:33.856
I need to change my life.

00:36:33.856 --> 00:36:35.480
MELISSA HARTWIG: Oh, I did.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:38.040
I'll answer the first
question first about travel.

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:41.310
So my bag on the way for
this book tour was 68 pounds.

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:43.310
And I'm pretty sure six
pounds of that were meat

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:45.660
sticks, like jerky sticks.

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:47.790
So I always pack a
ton of emergency food.

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:49.249
And I pack a really
healthy protein

00:36:49.249 --> 00:36:51.873
because that's the hardest thing
to find when you're traveling.

00:36:51.873 --> 00:36:53.800
It's easy to find fruit
and nuts and seeds.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.180
But so I'm packing like
Epic bars and WildBars,

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:59.307
and DNX bars, and
the meat sticks.

00:36:59.307 --> 00:37:00.890
Literally, if anyone
wants to try one,

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:03.546
I've got like seven
in my bag right now.

00:37:03.546 --> 00:37:05.420
I do as much research
as I can ahead of time.

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:08.220
So when I land, I know where
the local health food store.

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:10.330
I know where the local
grocery store is.

00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:11.810
I know a few good lunch options.

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:13.870
I've already looked at
the menu to make sure.

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:16.070
I can wing it anywhere
at this point.

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:19.320
But I still want to make it
as easy on myself as possible

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.040
so that when I get there,
I already have a plan.

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.160
And I'm not stuck
in rush hour traffic

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.920
after a really long
flight super hangry

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.280
with nowhere to go for food.

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:30.580
I make sure that my
hotel has a refrigerator

00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:33.360
so I can stock up on a few
things at the grocery store.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.740
So those are some tips
that make it easier.

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:38.550
I wrote an article called
"Business Travel 101"

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:41.930
on the whole30.com that
lays out my incredibly

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:44.255
anal retentive travel plan
because I travel so much.

00:37:44.255 --> 00:37:45.880
And it's really
important to me to make

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.340
it as stress-free as possible.

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:52.730
As for my journey, I was not
always a really healthy person.

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:54.460
I'm actually a
recovering drug addict.

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:56.850
I've been clean for
almost 17 years.

00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:57.590
And that--

00:37:57.590 --> 00:37:58.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:58.570 --> 00:37:59.512
Oh, thanks.

00:37:59.512 --> 00:38:01.680
I always feel weird when
people clap for that.

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.220
I'm like, I got
myself messed up,

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:05.636
so I'm not sure you should
applaud me getting unmessed up.

00:38:05.636 --> 00:38:07.350
But it is a big deal.

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:11.506
And I started in health
and exercise and nutrition

00:38:11.506 --> 00:38:12.880
when I got out of
rehab because I

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.870
knew that I had to
change everything

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:16.110
about my life to stay clean.

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:18.030
I had to adopt
that growth mindset

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:19.980
and convince myself
that I wasn't

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:24.190
some degenerate, worthless loser
who couldn't change her life.

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:25.770
So I started exercising.

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:27.130
And I started eating healthier.

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:29.230
And I got some fitness
certifications,

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:31.240
and ran a CrossFit
gym for a while,

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:32.710
and did some
kettlebell coaching.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:35.240
And that was really
where my path

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.980
started was through
my own transformation.

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:39.950
And so if you've
done the Whole30,

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:41.690
knowing this about
my background,

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:42.990
the rules kind of make sense.

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:44.470
The rigidity kind
of makes sense.

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:47.270
The steps and the
community makes sense

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:51.210
because it was all of the things
that I needed to get and stay

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:52.800
clean 17 years ago.

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.790
So yeah, there's
a chapter on that

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:57.800
here because if you looked at
me now, I think a lot of people

00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:00.517
would say like, what do
you know about feeling out

00:39:00.517 --> 00:39:01.600
of control with your food.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:02.724
I've never been overweight.

00:39:02.724 --> 00:39:04.750
That's not a struggle
or a battle I've fought.

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:07.270
But trust me when I say
I have fought my battles.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:09.520
And drugs and food are not
that different in terms

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:13.430
of the impact they have on the
brain and cravings and reward

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:16.060
and your social interactions
and your self-confidence.

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:19.240
And so I do write about that.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:20.490
Thanks.

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:24.500
STACEY SASAKI: To follow
up quickly on the food,

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:28.310
going out to eat, vacations,
that sort of thing--

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:31.850
I think one of the great things
about Google-- there's many--

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:33.640
is that we get a menu every day.

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.390
And we see all of the things
that are available to us.

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:38.490
And it gives you all
of the allergens.

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:40.698
But when you go to a
restaurant, you don't have that.

00:39:40.698 --> 00:39:44.234
So people who are not in this
world, how do you navigate?

00:39:44.234 --> 00:39:44.900
What do you say?

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:45.980
How do you go out for dinner?

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:48.063
MELISSA HARTWIG: Yeah,
this is totally my process.

00:39:48.063 --> 00:39:49.940
The first thing I
do is go on Yelp.

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:52.860
And I do a search for American
New, or grass-fed burger,

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:55.410
or vegetarian breakfast
because for some reason,

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:57.470
the vegetarian breakfasts
tend to lead me

00:39:57.470 --> 00:40:00.600
to the grass-fed, organic,
farm-to-table places.

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.690
I look at the menu.

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:03.130
If the menu looks
pretty doable--

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:04.810
I'm looking for simple
protein options.

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:08.800
So it's like a steak or grilled
fish or eggs or a burger,

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.740
like cool.

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:10.630
I look at the sides.

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:12.140
Do I have a bunch
of veggie choices.

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:13.350
Like great.

00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:15.664
Occasionally, if I have to,
I'll call the restaurant

00:40:15.664 --> 00:40:16.830
ahead of time and say, look.

00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:18.740
I'm walking in like,
this is my stuff.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.340
And I don't make a
big deal out of it.

00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:22.804
I don't eat this, this,
or this right now.

00:40:22.804 --> 00:40:24.720
Do you have options that
would accommodate me?

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.130
Or when I come in, can
I make a some requests?

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:31.020
I had a lamb burger at the
Breslin last night, so good.

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:32.740
But they don't do substitutions.

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:34.700
That's very helpful
to know up front.

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:35.680
So I walked in.

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.710
And I did no bun and no cheese.

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:38.480
And they did that.

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:39.980
But they wouldn't
substitute my salad

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:41.354
dressing for a
different dressing

00:40:41.354 --> 00:40:42.640
because it was cream-based.

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:45.122
So I just asked for lemon and
a little bit of olive oil.

00:40:45.122 --> 00:40:46.330
And they were cool with that.

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:48.185
But it's good to
know ahead of time.

00:40:48.185 --> 00:40:49.810
So just do your
research ahead of time.

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:52.710
And then when you get
there, make your order

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:55.190
and be as matter of fact
and polite as possible.

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:57.009
The bigger a deal
you make about it,

00:40:57.009 --> 00:40:59.050
the bigger a deal everyone
else is going to make.

00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:01.630
So don't walk in there and be
like, oh, I know it's so weird.

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:03.070
And I'm going to be
your special person.

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:03.860
And I'm so sorry.

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:05.442
Like no, can I have this?

00:41:05.442 --> 00:41:07.400
And can I not have the
bun and not have cheese?

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.085
And can you sub the fries?

00:41:09.085 --> 00:41:10.710
I see you've got
broccoli in this dish.

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:12.700
Can I just get some broccoli
steamed on the side?

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:13.500
Thank you so much.

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:15.968
And then you tip
very generously.

00:41:15.968 --> 00:41:17.461
STACEY SASAKI: I like it.

00:41:17.461 --> 00:41:19.460
AUDIENCE: That was actually
one of my questions.

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:22.040
But the other question is,
how do you find the right time

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.872
to do this because I
always feel like I'm

00:41:23.872 --> 00:41:24.830
oh, I can't this month.

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:25.871
I have two client events.

00:41:25.871 --> 00:41:27.950
Or I can't next month,
it's Thanksgiving.

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:30.530
How do you find or prioritize
the right 30 days to start?

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:32.530
MELISSA HARTWIG: That's
a really great question.

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:34.290
So first of all,
you want to remember

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:36.010
that it's not just the 30 days.

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:37.599
It's 30 days plus
re-introduction.

00:41:37.599 --> 00:41:39.390
So I see people sometimes
who are like, oh,

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:41.399
my day 31 is my trip to Italy.

00:41:41.399 --> 00:41:42.940
And I'm like, oh,
you're really going

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:44.800
to have a hard time
reintroducing there.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.300
And if you don't
reintroduce, you're

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:48.240
missing a lot of the
benefit of the program.

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:51.160
So ideally, you're
finding a 40-day block.

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:55.590
I want you to not do the Whole30
ideally over the holidays.

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:56.090
Right?

00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:57.701
That's just asking for trouble.

00:41:57.701 --> 00:41:59.200
Plus during the
holidays, you've got

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:02.800
a lot of these once-a-year,
really special family foods.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.630
And I don't necessarily want
you to miss out on that.

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:09.330
So find a 40-day block where
you don't have an A level race,

00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:11.130
or you're not getting
married that month,

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:14.420
or you don't have a once in a
lifetime vacation to Croatia.

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:16.700
But a client event is
not a good enough reason.

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.360
I want you to
figure out how to do

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:21.830
this in all of life's
circumstances-- bridal showers,

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:25.420
family dinners, clients
events, business lunches.

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:28.020
You need to figure out
how to live in your food

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:30.550
freedom, which may or may
not include these food going

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:31.530
forward.

00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:33.960
So don't schedule
around-- you'll

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.530
never find 40 days where
the only thing you're doing

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:38.160
is staying at home
watching Netflix.

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:39.590
That's not going to happen.

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:41.789
So make sure it's nothing
that's so special you

00:42:41.789 --> 00:42:42.830
wouldn't want to miss it.

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:47.000
But I would include
some of those every day,

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.049
but still specialish
occurrences.

00:42:49.049 --> 00:42:50.715
And then figure out
how to make it work.

00:42:50.715 --> 00:42:51.290
Right?

00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:54.826
You're ordering a
sparkling water with lime.

00:42:54.826 --> 00:42:57.200
And you're just as festive,
and you're just as cheersing.

00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:00.754
And it's just as
happy in that hour.

00:43:00.754 --> 00:43:01.254
Yeah.

00:43:08.159 --> 00:43:08.700
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:09.440
Thanks for coming.

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.300
MELISSA HARTWIG:
Yeah, thank you.

00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:12.640
AUDIENCE: 3 and 1/2 years
and counting and loving

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.155
it, loving every minute of it.

00:43:14.155 --> 00:43:14.580
MELISSA HARTWIG: Cool.

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:16.038
AUDIENCE: I have
one situation that

00:43:16.038 --> 00:43:19.580
continues to be challenging,
which is at this point,

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:22.870
pretty much everyone in my life
knows that I have eating habits

00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:25.000
that they might consider
quirky or bizarre

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.100
or against conventional
wisdom or whatever it is.

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:27.790
MELISSA HARTWIG: Sure.

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:28.790
AUDIENCE: Occasionally,
I'm a guest

00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:30.581
in someone's house,
which happened actually

00:43:30.581 --> 00:43:33.310
this weekend, where, oh,
you can eat everything.

00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:37.410
It's all gluten free and full of
honey and artificial sweeteners

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:41.370
and rice flour and all kinds of
things that I'm not going near.

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:44.610
How do you prepare for-- well,
I know how I prepare internally.

00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:47.150
But how do you prepare
socially for those situations

00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:49.560
and handle those with
a well-meaning host who

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.690
is actually going against
everything that you want?

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:52.680
MELISSA HARTWIG: I
totally get that.

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:54.590
And I had that situation
at the holidays

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:56.580
this past year
where I was served

00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:59.410
pasta full of ricotta cheese
and I was like, oh, this

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:00.560
is going to be tough.

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:03.260
Are you on the Whole30
during this situation?

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:06.410
Or is this just part
of your food freedom?

00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:07.160
AUDIENCE: I'm not.

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:10.160
MELISSA HARTWIG: OK, so
you're not on the Whole30.

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:11.980
So this is one of
those situations where

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:17.320
you have to weigh sticking to
your preferences versus really

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.940
hurting someone's feelings.

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:20.810
Ideally, you're having
a conversation ahead

00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:22.235
of time, if at all possible.

00:44:22.235 --> 00:44:24.091
Hey, I just want
to let you know.

00:44:24.091 --> 00:44:26.090
Just like if you were a
vegetarian, for example.

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:27.630
I just want to let
you know that I

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:29.130
don't eat this, this, and this.

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:30.640
If that's going to be a
problem with your menu,

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:31.910
I'd be happy to bring a dish.

00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:33.900
Let me know what I
could contribute.

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.652
When you get there, if they've
gone out of the way and said,

00:44:36.652 --> 00:44:39.110
this is all gluten-free, but
it's full of this other stuff,

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:42.210
then it comes down to, how bad
is it going to mess you up.

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:44.140
If it's going to
seriously mess you up

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:47.550
with migraines or
headaches or asthma

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:49.930
or whatever, then you have
to politely decline, and say,

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:52.190
you know what, I
really would love to.

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:54.950
And I'm so, so thankful that you
took the time to prepare this.

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:57.700
But I really have a bad reaction
with artificial sweeteners.

00:44:57.700 --> 00:44:59.408
And if I eat it, this
is going to happen.

00:44:59.408 --> 00:45:01.440
So I'll politely decline,
but thank you so much.

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:05.110
If it's just a preference,
then you have to think about,

00:45:05.110 --> 00:45:06.890
I might just take
one for the team.

00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:10.960
And eat as little as
possible to be polite.

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.182
Share with someone else.

00:45:12.182 --> 00:45:13.640
Pass your plate on
to someone else.

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:15.515
Take a bite or two and
say, this was amazing.

00:45:15.515 --> 00:45:16.380
Thank you so much.

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:17.940
But I'm saving for
the next course

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:19.640
if you know it's more edible.

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.930
But this is where
you have to weigh

00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:24.460
hurting someone's feelings and
being gracious against what

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:28.440
is really just a preference
and not an actual sensitivity.

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:32.420
So I ate three bites of
this pasta with ricotta.

00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:34.462
And I knew the dairy
was going to kill me.

00:45:34.462 --> 00:45:36.420
I spent the rest of the
night not feeling well.

00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:38.535
But it was the
woman I didn't know.

00:45:38.535 --> 00:45:40.410
I didn't have any
opportunity to communicate.

00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:41.380
I ate a couple bites.

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:43.050
I passed it along
and said, I'm really

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:44.540
saving for the
next course, which

00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:46.340
I knew I could totally eat.

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:48.250
And I sucked it up and took it.

00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:50.660
And so sometimes you
just have to decide

00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:52.480
what's worth it for you.

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:52.980
Yeah.

00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:00.570
AUDIENCE: My wife
doesn't eat eggs.

00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:04.110
And I was wondering what
kind of interesting options

00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:07.207
for breakfasts that you
do during the Whole30.

00:46:07.207 --> 00:46:08.790
MELISSA HARTWIG: I
love that question.

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:10.360
We get that question
all the time.

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:11.690
In fact, in the
"Whole30" book, there's

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:14.480
a whole intro about what you can
eat for breakfast if you're not

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:15.180
eating eggs.

00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:17.885
So first of all,
I really encourage

00:46:17.885 --> 00:46:20.010
people to get that idea of
breakfast, lunch, dinner

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:20.718
out of your head.

00:46:20.718 --> 00:46:22.820
We just call them Meal
1, Meal 2, and Meal 3.

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:24.970
And for Meal 1, I'm just
as likely to have a burger

00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:26.010
as I am to have an omelet.

00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:27.551
The other morning,
I literally cooked

00:46:27.551 --> 00:46:29.850
a burger for Megan and I.
That was our breakfast.

00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:31.140
And it was amazing.

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:34.410
So you can have absolutely
anything you want,

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:39.450
leftovers for breakfast,
or cook any kind of protein

00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:40.070
that you want.

00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:42.360
But if you want more
of a breakfasty feel,

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:44.130
we do have some
really good recipes.

00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:48.360
So think things like
ground chicken and apples

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:52.020
and sweet potato and
a few diced walnuts

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:55.640
with a little apple cider
vinegar, a warm hash style.

00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:58.820
Sausage, whether
it's pork sausage,

00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:02.550
ideally pastured and organic,
or some kind of chicken sausage

00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:04.480
would be a good choice.

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.920
Soups in the morning are good.

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:07.820
I also love a good
breakfast salad,

00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:09.060
which I know sounds weird.

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:10.476
But I got into the
habit of eating

00:47:10.476 --> 00:47:13.570
salad first thing in the morning
when I was in Scandinavia,

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:15.416
and just fell in
love with the idea.

00:47:15.416 --> 00:47:17.540
So maybe breakfast salads
with some sort of protein

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:20.880
on top that just feel different,
so almost so different

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:23.030
that it's cool that you're
eating it for breakfast.

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.863
But there are a lot.

00:47:23.863 --> 00:47:26.172
If you just Google Whole30
egg-free breakfasts,

00:47:26.172 --> 00:47:28.130
you will come up with a
million different ideas

00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:28.910
from our community.

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:29.408
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:47:29.408 --> 00:47:30.574
MELISSA HARTWIG: Yeah, yeah.

00:47:33.367 --> 00:47:35.200
STACEY SASAKI: Are there
any other questions

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.235
from the audience?
