So let's explore this a little more,
we know it means 35 miles per hour, but

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.450
can you tell me which of the following
is the best way to represent this number

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.650
mathematically?

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.570
And maybe you know this one or maybe
you don't doesn't really matter but

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.400
take a look at the three options and
select what you think is best.
