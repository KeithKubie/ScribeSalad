00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.520
JEFFREY BAIER: When I
first saw Khan Academy,

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.320
what was attractive
to me was the ability

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.830
for students to learn concepts
at their own pace, when

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:22.980
they were ready for them.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.240
And it brings that learning to
students both in the classroom

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.575
and at home with a seamless
transition from one location

00:00:29.575 --> 00:00:30.159
to the next.

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:31.700
ALYSSA GALLAGHER:
What caught our eye

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.160
in using it to
differentiate instruction

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.540
is the interface that
the students have,

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.520
and really on the back end,
all of the complex data

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.990
that's provided to the teachers.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.530
It would take them hours to
get that same kind of data.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.280
SANDRA McGONAGLE: It
was easy to roll out.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.510
Thankfully, I have some teachers
who are just great risk takers

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.230
and saw the potential of how
it would help their students.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.780
Cost wise is great.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.470
I know there are other math
programs out there that you

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.580
can purchase, but it is a
cost and it's not real time.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.550
JEFFREY BAIER: The data sets
the Khan Academy provides

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.900
allows principals at
the school site level

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.760
to have conversations
with their teachers about

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.070
progress students are making;
to recognize very quickly which

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.600
students are grasping
skills and moving ahead,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.630
which students are struggling
with a particular concept,

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.640
and which students
are stuck and need

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.200
some additional intervention.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.950
ALYSSA GALLAGHER: Khan
Academy is directly

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.300
helping because every
day, every child

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.780
has the opportunity
to have individualized

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.410
learning opportunities, where
they are specifically working

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.607
at their level, being provided
with instantaneous feedback.

00:01:40.607 --> 00:01:42.190
Which is not something
that they would

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.320
get in the traditional
teacher lecture model.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.840
SANDRA McGONAGLE:
I see every student

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.060
utterly engaged in
what they're doing.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.800
And they are talking about math.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.060
They are excited about math.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.220
They're appropriately
challenged.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.580
And those kids who are
really math superstars

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.937
are able to push themselves
to where they want to be.

00:02:02.937 --> 00:02:04.770
JEFFREY BAIER: The
parent involvement aspect

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.140
is important, as well,
because they can actually

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.150
see the teaching, the
instruction, as the student

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.130
hears the instruction in class,
as well, because they, too,

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.470
can watch the videos.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.840
It brings an opportunity
into the home for parents

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.360
to have conversations
with their children

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.850
about math, about
learning, and about what

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.140
they're doing in school.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.348
SANDRA McGONAGLE: I am most
excited that our kids are

00:02:29.348 --> 00:02:31.520
happy and excited about
learning, and especially

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.540
learning math, because it
seems to be the older you get

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.000
in grades, you either have
determined for yourself

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.750
that you love math, or
you're not good at math.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.300
And so if kids can have
success at their level,

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.710
to build that mental
math capability,

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.560
I think that's amazing.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.540
JEFFREY BAIER: When both
teachers and students

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.930
are excited about the
teaching and learning going on

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.890
in the classroom, it has
limitless possibilities.
