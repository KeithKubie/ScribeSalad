00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.620
 After entering puberty, pubic hair begins to grow in our external genitalia. But with 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.740
 With hair removal and beauty becoming a common personal habit, 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.690
 Is it really good to trim or wax to remove the hair below? Or is it overgrown? 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:23.210
 After the last ice age, humans lost most of their body hair about 70,000 to a million years ago. 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.410
 Although most of the hair is gone, 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.410
 Rich hair in the armpits and underarms 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.440
 Make humans the only mammal in the world with long, thick pubic hair. 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.550
 Researchers believe that pubic hair is a visual signal after humans have passed puberty 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.800
 Used to attract potential mating objects 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.559
 Moreover, the thick pubic hair can prevent the damage caused by friction during sexual intercourse. Another theory involves sweat. 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.519
 Humans have two types of sweat glands, one type that mainly secretes water and salt, and has no taste. 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.440
 The other gland is mainly distributed in the underarm and pubic area. 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.920
 Through the hair follicles, the secretions are rich 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.880
 Protein, lipids, and pheromones. And when these molecules are broken down in the bacterial skin, body odor is produced. 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.229
 During the evolution, humans retained these hairs and made pheromones 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.369
 Attract potential sexual partners. This argument is supported by the fact that women 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.600
 In order to give birth and conceive during ovulation, different pheromone messages will be released. 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.380
 Make yourself more sexually attractive. But a study in the United States 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.370
 It was found that among the more than 1,000 students, in the past month, 96% and 87% of women had some or all of them. 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.300
 Remove pubic hair. However, no matter what form is used to remove hair, when the pubic hair grows again 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.810
 Regenerated hair can irritate the skin. Actually, 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.950
 75% of people with pubic hair experience have had genital itching, 40% 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.060
 Experienced some type of rash. 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.450
 Shaving and waxing can cause the hair to grow out smoothly, but grow inward. 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.890
 Causes red and inflamed rashes. Interestingly, these conditions 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.270
 In fact, shaving and wax removal have reduced haze 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.659
 However, these practices can also cause minor injuries on the skin. 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.659
 This can lead to infections and even infections. 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.820
 In theory, it is believed that pubic hair removal may also increase 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.750
 Gonorrhea, infection with chlamydia and papillomavirus. Even if you don't consider infection 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.799
 According to reports of the most common genital injuries in the US emergency room, 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.500
 It happens in the process of removing pubic hair. At the end of the day, regardless of 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.190
 What new hair removal tools are currently available, 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.190
 Let the pubic hair develop naturally and there is absolutely no harm to human beings. Before we finish, we want to send an oversized one. 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.680
 Thank you for 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.380
 There are great ideas and content here. 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.510
