00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.530
First, you'll need to create
an Analytics account ID.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.020
I'll walk you through this process, and
in the next node you'll do it yourself.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.250
We start by going to
analytics.google.com.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.710
If you're already logged in to Google,

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.950
you'll see the Access Google Analytics
button at the top right.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.170
If your not already logged in,
you'll see a button for signing in.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.610
I'm going to assume you already have a
Google account, but if not, go ahead and

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.810
create one now I'm going to sign in.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.760
If you're new to Analytics,
you'll see a welcome screen.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.440
Go ahead and sign up for Analytics.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.040
You're going to be
tracking a mobile app.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.040
And you need to enter an account name.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.450
This can be whatever you like.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.640
It's for you to identify the count.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.790
It's a good practice to have the name
be something that relates your app,

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.960
then you need to setup the app name.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.100
Analytics doesn't check that it
corresponds to a real app name, so

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.000
again, enter something helpful to you.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.920
Go ahead and
fill in the rest of the form.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.980
Choose an industry category.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.910
Our sample app is to do with dinner,
I guess that would be food and drink.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.800
My reporting time zone
is the United States.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.190
States GMT Pacific Time.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.060
Yours might be different.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.810
And then also choose
the data sharing settings.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.030
The first data sharing option is that
you can choose to share your data

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.390
with other Google products only.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.720
And this means sharing the data
with your other accounts.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.660
For example this let's you
import your Analytics data

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.050
into your AdWords account,
if you have one.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.582
The next data sharing setting,

00:01:33.582 --> 00:01:38.735
is that you can choose to share your
data anonymously with Google and others.

00:01:38.735 --> 00:01:41.445
This basically just means
that your data will be shared

00:01:41.445 --> 00:01:46.145
completely anonymized with Google, all
identifying information removed from it.

00:01:46.145 --> 00:01:49.645
And Google will use the data for
marketing, educational purposes and

00:01:49.645 --> 00:01:52.325
to make customized communications.

00:01:52.325 --> 00:01:54.885
If you share your data
with technical support,

00:01:54.885 --> 00:01:59.555
this helps us help you,
if you have technical difficulties.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.910
The last sharing option is for
account specialists.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.760
So if you share your data with account
specialists, this means that the Google

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.970
account specialist can look at your data
and help you optimize your strategies.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.590
And you'll see at the bottom it tells
you how many accounts you're using.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.490
For this user that I've logged in with,
I'm using 0 out of 100 accounts, so

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.730
this is going to be my first account.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.000
So now, I'm going to get my tracking ID.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.960
Accept the terms of service, assuming
you do accept them, and look yay.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.060
I have a tracking ID.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.620
So, this tracking ID is going to be
the link between your app and Analytics.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.340
You'll add the count ID
to your mobile app code.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.900
And then, when people use your app the
app will send usage data to Analytics

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.520
at this ID.
