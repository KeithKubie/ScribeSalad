My name is Dozie Anyaegbunam,
co-founder of gidimo.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.950
Gidimo is a personal
advancement tool

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.660
that uses mastery of
concepts and topics

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.390
to drive a student
or professional

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.490
to learn a particular course
or pass a particular exam.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.120
By localization,
we're basically trying

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.530
to say that when you're trying
to solve a user's issue, a user

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.370
problem, and you're trying to
deliver a product that delivers

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.210
value and solves
a user's problem,

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.720
it's important to consider who
the user is, where the user is

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.810
coming from, the culture, and
the environment in which a user

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.130
has been in throughout
his or her life.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.360
The way I would say we're
doing it is, first of all,

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.500
it's very important
to, after scoping out,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.050
or after writing out what
your your product idea is,

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.420
it's important to
pilot and get feedback.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.790
So that way, that
single action in itself

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.140
helped solve a lot of the
problems we stumbled into while

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.790
building our product.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.730
A big example
could be broadband.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.910
So in Nigeria right
now, broadband is still

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.340
a big issue for people.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.210
So if you build an
app, if you take

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.122
an idea that relies heavily
on heavy data usage,

00:01:17.122 --> 00:01:18.580
then that idea
isn't going to work.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.320
Because then that
means you're going

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.380
to kick out the majority
of the consumers who

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.521
struggle with data right
here at the moment.

00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:28.020
What we found that
some of the users

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.310
will register on multiple
phones with the same account,

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.060
just because they
wanted to win the prize.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.000
So at that end, we
now had to start

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.830
adjusting to capture
this this kind of people

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.900
who play on multiple accounts.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.750
And at the same time, weed
them out of the system

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.730
so that we ensure that everybody
who pays fairly gets to win.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.430
Down here, a lot of Africans
like having big phones

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.441
because they feel that
the phone-- then they can

00:01:50.441 --> 00:01:51.690
see everything on their phone.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.857
Now, that affects what
you're going to do with them.

00:01:53.857 --> 00:01:56.231
It affects the kind of product
you're going to give them.

00:01:56.231 --> 00:01:57.900
It affects the kind
of image you're

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.983
going to use when you're
developing the app you're

00:01:59.983 --> 00:02:00.980
developing for them.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.450
Localization helps
keep us in check.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.480
It ensures that at every
single point in time,

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.590
we are creating a product
that the consumers understand,

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.800
and a product that solves a
problem we think they have,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.230
or the problem they
know they have.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.280
