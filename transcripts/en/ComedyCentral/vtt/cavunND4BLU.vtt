He owned up to it.

00:00:05.906 --> 00:00:07.441
He goes,
"I've been a bad friend.

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:08.742
"I've been distant,
and I'm sorry.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:10.110
"And I want to
make it up to you.

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:11.712
"So I got some mushrooms,

we should do these mushrooms

our friendship."

Thank you.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.015
On this show,
here's what happens.

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:50.184
It's just a bunch of comics
telling true stories,

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:51.552
and that's all it is.

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:53.620
And to tell you
what happened to Pete Carboni,

00:00:53.654 --> 00:00:56.223
ladies and gentlemen,
his side of the story,

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:57.424
Mr. Pete Carboni,
everybody.

00:00:57.457 --> 00:00:58.659
Let him hear it.

[cheers and applause]

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:05.732
So it was about halfway
through the trailer...

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:09.203
[laughter]

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:12.372
To the movie <i>Bruno</i>

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:17.077
that I started
to feel sadder

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:21.348
than I've ever felt
in my life before.

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:22.850
I think what was
going through my mind is,

00:01:22.883 --> 00:01:24.251
I was laughing
at the trailer.

00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:25.919
I found it really funny,
and I was like,

00:01:25.953 --> 00:01:28.088
"Yeah, this guy Sacha Baron
Cohen's a really funny dude.

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:30.224
He's doing really well
in his career," you know?

00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:33.427
And then I started to think
of my own career as a comedian,

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.330
and I started to get
a little bit sad.

00:01:36.363 --> 00:01:38.198
And that thought just
spiraled me

00:01:38.232 --> 00:01:41.602
and propelled me
out of that room.

00:01:41.635 --> 00:01:43.904
I had that feeling
that you have,

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:47.875
like, right before you're about
to cry hysterically.

00:01:47.908 --> 00:01:53.914
I mean, am I right, fellas?
Yeah?

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.649
And I was in a dark place
in my life.

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:58.519
I'd just gotten out of this
on-again, off-again

00:01:58.552 --> 00:02:02.422
embattled relationship
with this girl Kelly.

00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:05.425
And Kelly would use
the off-again portion

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.294
of our relationship

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:12.900
to have sex
with some of my friends.

00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:15.736
Yes, and this would
often inspire me

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.671
to take her back again,
you know,

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:21.575
to stop that
from happening,

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:23.877
which would make us
more embattled, you know?

00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:25.579
Which would make me
break up with her.

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:27.948
The whole thing--it's what
an economist might call

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:32.486
a vicious cycle.

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.555
So I--like, I got to get
out of here.

00:02:34.588 --> 00:02:36.089
I'm just not
in a good place.

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:41.762
So I jump into a cab,
and I say, "551 Sawtelle,"

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:43.463
'cause that's
where I lived,

00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:46.867
and the guy must have
misheard me.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:47.868
So he turned around,

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:51.104
and he was like,
"Uh, which hotel?"

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:52.673
And normally,

00:02:52.706 --> 00:02:57.711
I think I would be able to
resolve this misunderstanding.

00:02:57.744 --> 00:03:01.648
But in the condition I was in,
all I could think to do was,

00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:05.519
I pointed in the direction
of my apartment,

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:09.423
and I just was like, "Go!

00:03:09.456 --> 00:03:13.126
Please, just go!"

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.830
And so the guy just starts
driving in that direction,

00:03:16.864 --> 00:03:19.132
and I'm like,
"Okay, I'm on my way home,"

00:03:19.166 --> 00:03:22.169
and then we got
to a stop sign.

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:23.370
And it's a weird thing.

00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:24.771
When you're on mushrooms,

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:26.607
it messes with your sense
of time, you know?

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.909
So it felt like I was at this
stop sign for, like, a year.

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:30.244
It felt awful.

00:03:30.277 --> 00:03:32.412
And so I couldn't help my--
and I just start going,

00:03:32.446 --> 00:03:34.114
"Go!
Please!

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:36.450
Please go!
Just go!"

00:03:36.483 --> 00:03:38.151
And then the guy
would drive faster,

00:03:38.185 --> 00:03:41.488
and then he'd get
to the next stoplight sooner.

00:03:41.522 --> 00:03:43.624
And then I'd yell "go" again.

00:03:43.657 --> 00:03:45.926
I mean, this is another
vicious cycle

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.462
I found myself in.

00:03:48.495 --> 00:03:50.097
Until finally,
I felt so bad.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.599
I felt like--"Geez, I'm"--
I'm like,

00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:54.568
"This guy's, like,
a working-class guy.

00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:57.171
He's doing his job
to support his family."

00:03:57.204 --> 00:03:58.572
I'm like
this degenerate.

00:03:58.605 --> 00:04:04.778
I'm doing mushrooms
on a Monday morning.

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:08.115
So I got out of the cab.
I told him to stop, got out.

00:04:08.148 --> 00:04:10.517
And I gave him 100 bucks.

00:04:10.551 --> 00:04:16.056
And then I turned,
and I just started running.

00:04:16.056 --> 00:04:20.427
And I was running down
Bundy Avenue,

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:25.165
which if you don't know is
basically a four-lane highway.

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.102
And it's probably too big
of a street to be running down,

00:04:29.136 --> 00:04:31.305
dressed like this,

00:04:31.338 --> 00:04:32.673
as fast as you can

00:04:32.706 --> 00:04:36.710
while you're crying
hysterically,

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:39.446
because people started
slowing down on the road

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.682
to check me out,
you know?

00:04:41.715 --> 00:04:43.884
They're, like,
"Yeah, I don't think that guy

00:04:43.917 --> 00:04:49.790
is jogging."

00:04:49.823 --> 00:04:51.992
So I start to feel
really self-conscious,

00:04:52.092 --> 00:04:54.595
and as I'm running,
I notice ahead of me

00:04:54.628 --> 00:04:56.997
a hole, like,
in a fence.

00:04:57.097 --> 00:05:01.034
And so my instinct is just to go
through this hole in the fence.

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:03.937
So I just jumped--
I sort of slide through,

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:07.641
and I wind up in,
like, this suburban backyard.

00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:10.544
And there's some dude
who's, like,

00:05:10.577 --> 00:05:15.449
reading a paper
on his back porch

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:19.553
as I come in
in my sad state.

00:05:19.586 --> 00:05:21.788
And I was like, "I'm just...

00:05:21.822 --> 00:05:24.057
I'm gonna try
the honesty approach."

00:05:24.057 --> 00:05:25.259
I walk up to the guy.

00:05:25.292 --> 00:05:28.629
I'm like,
"Uh, excuse me, sir?

00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:33.867
"I'm very sorry,
but I'm feeling very sick.

00:05:33.901 --> 00:05:38.739
Do you think that maybe
you could drive me home?"

00:05:38.772 --> 00:05:41.542
And shockingly,
this guy says yes.

00:05:41.575 --> 00:05:43.844
I was like--and my mind
was blown that he said yes.

00:05:43.877 --> 00:05:46.747
I was like, "What a wonderful
world we live in

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.817
that this guy
would say yes to me."

00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:53.220
I was like, "But he shouldn't,"
and he did,

00:05:53.253 --> 00:05:54.521
and I love that man.

00:05:54.555 --> 00:05:56.590
And we got in his car,
and, you know,

00:05:56.623 --> 00:06:01.728
he starts driving,
but then he gets to a stop sign.

00:06:01.762 --> 00:06:03.263
And I'm just out of control.

00:06:03.297 --> 00:06:05.599
I'm like,
"Man, just go!

00:06:05.632 --> 00:06:08.569
Please!
Just go!"

00:06:08.602 --> 00:06:10.537
And we wind up
doing that again,

00:06:10.571 --> 00:06:13.040
and then I finally tell him
to stop.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.879
And I jump out of his car,
and I throw $200 at him.

00:06:18.912 --> 00:06:20.681
And he--he says to me.

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:22.950
He's like, "Man, I just
drove you, like, five blocks.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.385
It's really"--
And I was like, "Just take it!"

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:28.055
And then
I just started running.

00:06:32.292 --> 00:06:34.161
And I ran
all the way home.

00:06:34.194 --> 00:06:38.665
And when I got home, I started
to feel a little bit lonely,

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:43.270
and I started to rethink things
with Kelly, you know?

00:06:43.303 --> 00:06:44.738
It's like,
you know, yeah,

00:06:44.771 --> 00:06:47.741
she slept with a few
of my friends.

00:06:47.774 --> 00:06:49.276
Okay.

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:50.744
Maybe I can
just take that as,

00:06:50.777 --> 00:06:54.381
she finds my friends
really charming and attractive.

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:56.583
In a way,
that's like a compliment.

00:06:56.617 --> 00:06:59.853
So I called her,
and I asked her to come over,

00:06:59.887 --> 00:07:01.088
and she did.

00:07:01.121 --> 00:07:06.693
And when she got there,
I begged her to take me back,

00:07:06.727 --> 00:07:08.161
and she did.

00:07:08.195 --> 00:07:10.197
And then my phone rang,

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.533
and it was Ari.

00:07:12.566 --> 00:07:18.939
I was like, "Oh, yeah.
That's right.

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:21.341
"Like, we were supposed to be
doing mushrooms today

00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:22.876
"to rekindle
our friendship

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.945
because I've been
such a bad friend."

00:07:25.045 --> 00:07:27.648
And, Ari, do you remember
what you said?

00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:29.049
(Ari)
Yeah, I was worried about you.

00:07:29.049 --> 00:07:31.919
So I was like--I was like,
"Hey, are you okay?"

00:07:31.952 --> 00:07:35.055
Yeah, and I thought
he was gonna attack me,

00:07:35.055 --> 00:07:37.858
which would've been
the right thing to do.

00:07:37.891 --> 00:07:40.694
And then I was like,
"You know"--

00:07:40.727 --> 00:07:42.162
I don't know
how to tell him this,

00:07:42.196 --> 00:07:45.332
so I was like, "Yeah, I'm good.
I'm good.

00:07:45.365 --> 00:07:47.501
I'm here with Kelly."

00:07:47.534 --> 00:07:48.869
Yeah, I forgot
about that.

00:07:48.902 --> 00:07:50.404
You were like,
"I'm here with Kelly.

00:07:50.437 --> 00:07:52.072
We got back together,"
but I was like...

00:07:52.105 --> 00:07:53.574
[sighs]

00:07:53.607 --> 00:07:55.409
"All right, well,
at least you're all right."

00:07:55.442 --> 00:07:56.944
(Pete)
Yeah, he was
a good sport about it.

00:07:56.977 --> 00:07:59.179
And then you--not only that,
then he says to me.

00:07:59.213 --> 00:08:02.883
He's like, "Hey, man,
I just want to let you know

00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:05.052
that I love you."

00:08:05.085 --> 00:08:06.153
(Ari)
I do.

00:08:06.186 --> 00:08:07.354
I was really concerned
for you.

00:08:07.387 --> 00:08:10.557
Yeah, and I was, like,
overwhelmed with--

00:08:10.591 --> 00:08:12.793
I was like--
That was so nice of you.

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:13.861
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:08:13.894 --> 00:08:15.262
I wouldn't have been
that way.

00:08:15.295 --> 00:08:16.597
Let me ask you
a question.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:17.798
(Pete)
What's that?

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:22.135
Why--why did you have
$300 on you?

00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:25.272
[laughter and applause]

00:08:25.305 --> 00:08:27.107
I think I figured that
I was doing something

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.575
sort of adventurous
that, like,

00:08:28.609 --> 00:08:31.512
I should probably bring
emergency funds.

00:08:31.545 --> 00:08:33.213
- You know?
- No, it's--

00:08:33.247 --> 00:08:34.781
Just to be safe.

00:08:34.815 --> 00:08:36.783
You don't need emergency funds
for a mushroom trip.

00:08:36.817 --> 00:08:38.218
Oh, yeah,
but didn't I need them?

00:08:38.252 --> 00:08:39.853
[laughter]

00:08:39.887 --> 00:08:41.555
Wouldn't you say
that I needed them?

00:08:41.588 --> 00:08:43.357
Yeah, you're right.
You're right, you did.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:44.658
And I'm glad
you're safe, man.

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:45.792
I'm glad you're safe
as well.

00:08:45.826 --> 00:08:47.227
Thanks.
Pete Carboni, everybody.

00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:48.595
