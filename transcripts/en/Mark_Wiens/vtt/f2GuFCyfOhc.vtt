00:00:00.268 --> 00:00:02.043
- Oh wow, that's just heavy!

00:00:02.043 --> 00:00:05.210
You can feel all that cheese on there.

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:13.999
This was worth every single
minute of the trek to get here.

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:17.499
(upbeat percussive music)

00:00:19.355 --> 00:00:20.795
Good morning everyone, it's Mark Wiens

00:00:20.795 --> 00:00:24.082
with Migrationology.com in New York City.

00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:27.920
I'm loving the view of
the city this morning.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.624
Today, we're gonna head over to Brooklyn

00:00:30.624 --> 00:00:34.646
and on our way first to eat
at a famous pizza place.

00:00:34.646 --> 00:00:39.220
Today, you could say I'm on
a bit of a pizza pilgrimage.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.901
We're on our way to the
subway and should be

00:00:41.901 --> 00:00:44.669
about a 40 minute ride or
so, maybe it will take us

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:48.423
about an hour to get to
Brooklyn to the pizza place.

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:51.590
(lively reggae music)

00:00:59.816 --> 00:01:03.399
We're going all the
way from 34th street...

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:06.362
Where is that?

00:01:06.362 --> 00:01:08.791
Where is 34th street?

00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:12.958
Here, Harold Square, all
the way over to Brooklyn.

00:01:13.851 --> 00:01:16.453
And we're gonna get off on Avenue J.

00:01:16.453 --> 00:01:19.620
(lively reggae music)

00:01:35.272 --> 00:01:39.743
That took exactly 40 minutes
and according to Google Maps,

00:01:39.743 --> 00:01:43.559
it says Di Fara is a one
minute walk from here.

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:44.933
I'm getting excited.

00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:48.100
(lively reggae music)

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.549
Right now it's right at 11:30 a.m.,

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.605
so it's about 30 minutes
til they open at noon.

00:01:56.605 --> 00:02:00.688
Looks like I'm the first
one here today, oh yeah!

00:02:02.578 --> 00:02:04.205
I'm in a little bit of
a dilemma right now.

00:02:04.205 --> 00:02:05.736
I'm not sure whether I should order

00:02:05.736 --> 00:02:08.354
the regular pie, which
is a circular pizza.

00:02:08.354 --> 00:02:10.197
Or the square pie.

00:02:10.197 --> 00:02:13.745
People both say that they are amazing.

00:02:13.745 --> 00:02:14.930
Some people like the square pie,

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.207
some people like the circle, regular pie.

00:02:18.207 --> 00:02:20.420
I think I might have to keep
it classic with the circle pie.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.652
That's my thought before they open.

00:02:23.652 --> 00:02:25.726
Can I get one regular pie?

00:02:25.726 --> 00:02:26.652
- [Man] Okay.

00:02:26.652 --> 00:02:28.035
- [Mark] With half pepperoni?

00:02:28.035 --> 00:02:29.234
- [Man] Of course, what's the name?

00:02:29.234 --> 00:02:30.067
- [Mark] Mark.

00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:32.640
- [Man] Okay Mark, about 10 minutes.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.798
- [Mark] Thank you very much.

00:02:33.798 --> 00:02:36.381
- [Man] Al, half pepperoni, Al!

00:03:04.107 --> 00:03:06.857
And she's making us do more work.

00:03:08.314 --> 00:03:09.147
Hey Mark!

00:03:10.246 --> 00:03:11.829
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:19.124
- [Man] There you go.

00:03:19.124 --> 00:03:21.534
- [Mark] Thank you,
can we get it in a box?

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:22.573
- [Man] Yeah, if you want.

00:03:22.573 --> 00:03:24.240
- [Mark] Yes please.

00:03:29.926 --> 00:03:31.259
- [Man] It's 31.

00:03:32.421 --> 00:03:34.898
- I think Ying and I will take it to go.

00:03:34.898 --> 00:03:37.069
So I put it in a box.

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.451
This is fresh out of the
oven and I don't wanna...

00:03:41.451 --> 00:03:43.929
I do love my chili but I think I'll

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:47.010
put it on the side for now.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.736
Just put a bunch of chili
on the side for later.

00:03:50.736 --> 00:03:52.810
And they do have a couple
of tables and seats inside,

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.216
but with a box of pizza this big

00:03:55.216 --> 00:03:57.088
there was just no space to sit down.

00:03:57.088 --> 00:03:59.686
So I decided to get it to go, but I cannot

00:03:59.686 --> 00:04:03.145
walk far to taste it while
it's hot and fresh right now.

00:04:03.145 --> 00:04:05.498
I have to taste my
first piece immediately!

00:04:05.498 --> 00:04:07.675
And I would just like to
really quickly mention

00:04:07.675 --> 00:04:11.842
that Dom DeMarco, who is
the pizza legend at Di Fara.

00:04:12.997 --> 00:04:15.854
And he is a literally, a pizza hero.

00:04:15.854 --> 00:04:20.150
And I saw him on a TV program from Vice TV

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.651
at this place making the pizza.

00:04:21.651 --> 00:04:23.237
And he looked like he had so much passion

00:04:23.237 --> 00:04:25.889
and just an amazing, an amazing man.

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.124
He was not making the
pizza today when I came.

00:04:29.124 --> 00:04:32.376
So I was a little bit
disappointed, but that's okay.

00:04:32.376 --> 00:04:36.316
I am still very happy it's
still within his family.

00:04:36.316 --> 00:04:38.338
Okay, let me just open this up.

00:04:38.338 --> 00:04:40.088
Oh, that aroma!

00:04:40.088 --> 00:04:43.910
And what I loved is that
after it came out of the oven

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.635
he immediately, whoa that is a heavy box.

00:04:46.635 --> 00:04:49.114
He immediately, as it came
out of the oven, he took

00:04:49.114 --> 00:04:52.569
a handful of basil and he
chopped it up using scissors.

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:56.185
So you can smell that aroma of
the fresh basil all over it.

00:04:56.185 --> 00:04:58.816
I'm gonna start with
this piece right here.

00:04:58.816 --> 00:05:01.916
Just the regular cheese
with lots of basil on it.

00:05:01.916 --> 00:05:05.787
And you can see that oil and
that oh, it's hot and fresh!

00:05:05.787 --> 00:05:09.615
Oh and there's a little corner
of pepperoni on here as well.

00:05:09.615 --> 00:05:11.305
Oh wow, that's just heavy!

00:05:11.305 --> 00:05:14.472
You can feel all that cheese on there.

00:05:25.297 --> 00:05:26.630
That is amazing!

00:05:29.731 --> 00:05:31.091
That is outstanding!

00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:33.272
Okay, this was worth every single minute

00:05:33.272 --> 00:05:35.252
of the trek to get here.

00:05:35.252 --> 00:05:39.296
Oh, that crust paired with that cheese.

00:05:39.296 --> 00:05:42.713
The ratio is beautiful and it just gushes

00:05:44.254 --> 00:05:47.848
with that olive oil and you can taste

00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:50.274
that fresh basil chopped on there.

00:05:50.274 --> 00:05:51.865
And the cheese it's salty but not

00:05:51.865 --> 00:05:54.395
too salty, it's perfectly salty.

00:05:54.395 --> 00:05:57.604
The tomato sauce is not very tart

00:05:57.604 --> 00:06:01.271
it has more of like a
sweet tomato-y flavor.

00:06:07.647 --> 00:06:11.743
Oh, you can just see that cheese and sauce

00:06:11.743 --> 00:06:14.839
oozing out of the crust
when I take a bite,

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:16.262
when it condenses in there.

00:06:16.262 --> 00:06:18.275
So that cheese is just a perfect

00:06:18.275 --> 00:06:21.346
melted-ness mixed with that sauce.

00:06:21.346 --> 00:06:23.513
This is a beautiful thing.

00:06:28.617 --> 00:06:31.950
Next up, I have to go for the pepperoni.

00:06:42.881 --> 00:06:45.630
This place is legendary for a reason.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:46.801
It's so good!

00:06:46.801 --> 00:06:49.948
The combination, the simple
combination of ingredients

00:06:49.948 --> 00:06:53.536
but just made perfectly
and cooked perfectly.

00:06:53.536 --> 00:06:55.968
I know one of the things
that they really stress

00:06:55.968 --> 00:06:59.407
is how it's cooked and the done-ness.

00:06:59.407 --> 00:07:03.074
So it is crispy on the
bottom but not burnt.

00:07:04.898 --> 00:07:09.384
It is just a beautiful
golden, lightly blackened,

00:07:09.384 --> 00:07:13.837
crispy-ness on the bottom,
gooey on the inside

00:07:13.837 --> 00:07:16.728
where that sauce meets the cheese.

00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:18.462
It's just incredibly good.

00:07:18.462 --> 00:07:21.629
(lively reggae music)

00:07:35.482 --> 00:07:38.159
After eating two pieces of
pizza, then we ended up walking

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:41.186
over to the nearest park to sit down

00:07:41.186 --> 00:07:43.161
and to enjoy the rest of the pizza.

00:07:43.161 --> 00:07:45.808
And so we made it to the park
and immediately as you open

00:07:45.808 --> 00:07:48.533
the cover of that box
you can smell that basil.

00:07:48.533 --> 00:07:50.444
That basil makes all the difference.

00:07:50.444 --> 00:07:54.093
Okay, I'm gonna go for
this piece over here.

00:07:54.093 --> 00:07:55.582
This is mostly a cheese piece just

00:07:55.582 --> 00:07:58.332
with a few cut-outs of pepperoni.

00:07:59.992 --> 00:08:01.929
Okay, and it's not so hot anymore

00:08:01.929 --> 00:08:05.262
but I think it's still gonna be amazing.

00:08:11.407 --> 00:08:15.978
Yeah, that is just a brilliant
combination of flavors.

00:08:15.978 --> 00:08:17.478
A brilliant pizza.

00:08:18.463 --> 00:08:22.895
It was definitely better when
I had that very first piece.

00:08:22.895 --> 00:08:25.851
Right out of the oven when
the cheese was sloppy.

00:08:25.851 --> 00:08:28.629
I'm gonna go ahead and dip in that chili.

00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:32.462
Or maybe I'll unfold and
just sort of go down.

00:08:34.708 --> 00:08:35.541
Oh, yeah.

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:38.058
Alright.

00:08:40.795 --> 00:08:42.640
I think I would have to say that I enjoyed

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.233
the regular pizza, no
pepperoni, just the pizza

00:08:46.233 --> 00:08:49.663
with cheese and the basil on it the most.

00:08:49.663 --> 00:08:51.366
That was the best.

00:08:51.366 --> 00:08:54.365
Just that basil, just
increased the flavor.

00:08:54.365 --> 00:08:56.995
And that olive oil, it was fantastic.

00:08:56.995 --> 00:08:58.379
And although I didn't have a chance

00:08:58.379 --> 00:09:01.689
to see Mr. Dom, the
legend, making the pizza

00:09:01.689 --> 00:09:04.404
I still could feel the passion

00:09:04.404 --> 00:09:06.657
and the love of pizza at Di Fara.

00:09:06.657 --> 00:09:08.320
Walking through the neighborhood,

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.009
it's a really nice
neighborhood here in Brooklyn.

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:13.547
And I just looked up the
directions, we are on our way

00:09:13.547 --> 00:09:15.955
over to a different subway station

00:09:15.955 --> 00:09:19.148
called Flatbush, next to Brooklyn college.

00:09:19.148 --> 00:09:21.160
And we're gonna take
that a little bit north

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.553
and head next to eat some Caribbean food.

00:09:24.553 --> 00:09:27.720
(lively reggae music)

00:09:33.559 --> 00:09:35.937
So we're heading just a couple stations

00:09:35.937 --> 00:09:38.854
from Flatbush to President Station.

00:09:39.752 --> 00:09:42.919
(lively reggae music)

00:09:48.039 --> 00:09:50.308
This restaurant is called Gloria's.

00:09:50.308 --> 00:09:52.739
And they serve Caribbean food.

00:09:52.739 --> 00:09:54.768
And I think, this is Brooklyn,

00:09:54.768 --> 00:09:56.766
but I think this area
is called Crown Heights.

00:09:56.766 --> 00:09:58.987
And as soon as I entered
the door you could just

00:09:58.987 --> 00:10:02.169
smell the aroma of the spices in here.

00:10:02.169 --> 00:10:05.209
And they do have a few tables
within this little restaurant,

00:10:05.209 --> 00:10:08.374
it's a small restaurant but
it has some nice high tables.

00:10:08.374 --> 00:10:10.596
And so we sat in the corner here.

00:10:10.596 --> 00:10:14.096
And I got the large portion and it's huge!

00:10:14.946 --> 00:10:16.593
That is heavy!

00:10:16.593 --> 00:10:18.926
And I got the chicken curry.

00:10:20.141 --> 00:10:21.391
Oh, that steam!

00:10:22.581 --> 00:10:26.343
That steam was ridiculous,
it smells so good!

00:10:26.343 --> 00:10:30.771
It came with rice and peas,
and this is a side of pumpkin.

00:10:30.771 --> 00:10:33.004
And I'm not sure, I think she gave me

00:10:33.004 --> 00:10:35.939
some kind of a vegetable
which was called like

00:10:35.939 --> 00:10:37.833
cam-boo-la or something like that,

00:10:37.833 --> 00:10:40.182
I can't even remember the
name but that's what I tried.

00:10:40.182 --> 00:10:42.932
And then Ying got the fish curry.

00:10:45.296 --> 00:10:47.189
Oh Ying, that looks awesome.

00:10:47.189 --> 00:10:50.538
A whole fish steak and that
curry smells incredible.

00:10:50.538 --> 00:10:52.839
And then some kind of,
maybe collard greens

00:10:52.839 --> 00:10:54.204
and mixed vegetables.

00:10:54.204 --> 00:10:58.082
Grab my fork, ah I cannot
wait it smells so good!

00:10:58.082 --> 00:11:01.665
Okay I gotta begin with
this chicken curry.

00:11:02.506 --> 00:11:05.756
Oh and let me mix it with some of that.

00:11:19.122 --> 00:11:20.872
That chicken curry...

00:11:22.436 --> 00:11:24.537
It's so hot and fresh.

00:11:24.537 --> 00:11:27.037
And the spice blend is superb.

00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:30.988
You can taste, I think,
some cumin in there.

00:11:30.988 --> 00:11:33.271
And maybe some garlic and ginger.

00:11:33.271 --> 00:11:36.211
And then that vegetable that's like a...

00:11:36.211 --> 00:11:39.128
It's some kind of puréed vegetable.

00:11:45.049 --> 00:11:47.686
I don't know what that
vegetable is but it's awesome!

00:11:47.686 --> 00:11:51.521
It sort of has a little
bit of a spinach-y...

00:11:51.521 --> 00:11:55.259
That sort of slimy,
spinach-y texture to it.

00:11:55.259 --> 00:11:57.131
But at the same time it's puréed.

00:11:57.131 --> 00:12:00.501
It has a little bit of a sour taste to it.

00:12:00.501 --> 00:12:04.481
And that is amazing, that
vegetable is awesome.

00:12:04.481 --> 00:12:07.980
And then with that red rice on the bottom.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.654
And then mixed in with the spices

00:12:09.654 --> 00:12:11.987
from the chicken curry, wow!

00:12:13.054 --> 00:12:17.137
That is absolutely a
sensational mixture of food.

00:12:18.616 --> 00:12:22.366
Okay now let me try for
some of that pumpkin.

00:12:23.887 --> 00:12:25.054
Whoa, mmm-hmm.

00:12:27.116 --> 00:12:31.630
It's so nice and sweet and
then balanced by being salty.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:34.708
It's a creamy purée as well
and you can taste a little bit

00:12:34.708 --> 00:12:38.218
of those pumpkin fibers in
there as well, it's wonderful.

00:12:38.218 --> 00:12:40.774
And then it's lightly spiced,
maybe I can taste a little bit

00:12:40.774 --> 00:12:41.910
of the pepper in there or maybe that's

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:44.007
coming from the curry that's mixed in.

00:12:44.007 --> 00:12:46.550
I'm very happy with this
meal in front of me.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:50.683
This chicken curry is
just absolutely awesome.

00:12:50.683 --> 00:12:52.107
And I love how it's all mixed together

00:12:52.107 --> 00:12:55.197
within this tray as well,
you get little bites of...

00:12:55.197 --> 00:12:57.497
Well you get rice, then
you get bites of that curry

00:12:57.497 --> 00:13:00.443
with all those spices, then
you get that creamy vegetable,

00:13:00.443 --> 00:13:01.835
and then the sweetness from the pumpkin.

00:13:01.835 --> 00:13:02.857
It all just works together.

00:13:02.857 --> 00:13:05.827
I'm gonna get everything in one bite.

00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:06.660
Yeah.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:11.793
Let me taste the fish curry.

00:13:11.793 --> 00:13:13.543
Oh, that's very firm.

00:13:17.448 --> 00:13:19.365
Look at all that spice!

00:13:22.151 --> 00:13:24.028
Maybe it's king fish?

00:13:24.028 --> 00:13:27.997
And then that beautiful
blend of spices again.

00:13:27.997 --> 00:13:31.275
You can taste the tomato,
it's a little bit spicy.

00:13:31.275 --> 00:13:33.610
And that blend of dry spices in there

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:37.605
just is fantastically
delicious, so much flavor.

00:13:37.605 --> 00:13:40.993
I'm so full right now that
was so hardy and so flavorful.

00:13:40.993 --> 00:13:43.269
And the combination,
actually I really liked it.

00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:47.799
'Cause the chicken curry is
full of spice and turmeric.

00:13:47.799 --> 00:13:51.212
And I loved it with that pumpkin
because you get that sweet

00:13:51.212 --> 00:13:54.020
touch mixed in by that
naturally sweetness.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:57.115
You've got that creamy vegetable

00:13:57.115 --> 00:13:59.495
and then all on a bed of rice.

00:13:59.495 --> 00:14:02.353
Awesome place, the
owners are very friendly.

00:14:02.353 --> 00:14:04.093
And she told me that the restaurant

00:14:04.093 --> 00:14:06.736
serves mainly Trinidad style food.

00:14:06.736 --> 00:14:08.471
It's worth making the trip out here

00:14:08.471 --> 00:14:12.638
to Crown Heights Brooklyn for
some delicious Caribbean food.

00:14:13.784 --> 00:14:16.951
(lively reggae music)

00:14:25.525 --> 00:14:28.201
Just 30 minutes ago we were in

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:30.774
what felt like almost the Caribbean.

00:14:30.774 --> 00:14:33.246
Eating delicious Trinidad food.

00:14:33.246 --> 00:14:36.128
And now back into the middle of Manhattan.

00:14:36.128 --> 00:14:37.978
Actually I'm still kind
of full from lunch,

00:14:37.978 --> 00:14:41.208
so I think I'm gonna end the vlog

00:14:41.208 --> 00:14:44.552
for today right here, and call it a day.

00:14:44.552 --> 00:14:46.709
But again, I just wanna
emphasize the reason why

00:14:46.709 --> 00:14:49.057
I love New York City so
much and why it's such

00:14:49.057 --> 00:14:51.320
an amazing city is
because of the diversity,

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.999
it's such an incredible melting pot.

00:14:54.999 --> 00:14:57.375
Alright, that's it for today's vlog

00:14:57.375 --> 00:15:00.419
see you on the next video,
thank you again for watching.
