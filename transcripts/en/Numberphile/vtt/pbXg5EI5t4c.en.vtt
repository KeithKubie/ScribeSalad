00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.440
I've got 10 cards here.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.320
I'm gonna shuffle them up.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:09.500
They're just one to ten, or ace to ten. You can see there, look. Ace of hearts, ten of hearts, nine, look. Seven, four.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.360
So I'm just gonna shuffle them up, I'm gonna lay them out, I'll count-

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.380
Brady: "Hey Jamie, It looks like you've got the world's smallest hands."

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.180
These are normal sized cards. I'm just a tiny person.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm gonna lay these out. I'll count along when I lay them out. And I win...

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.140
if the position matches its value, which means if ace comes out first,

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.680
I win. If, if the four comes out fourth, I win, okay?

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.280
Now, what's the chance of me winning this game? So, am I likely to get a match?

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.780
That's the question. Am I likely to get a match? Do you think it's likely? Do you think it's unlikely?

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.020
Do you think it's greater than 50%?

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.880
Do you think it's less than 50%?

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.080
1

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.820
2

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.440
3

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.820
4

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.960
5

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.320
6

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.660
7

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.880
8

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.540
9

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.580
ah, 10!

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.680
So I got no match. Now, is that what you expected? Did you expect me to get no match?

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:15.320
Well, actually I think I was quite unlucky there to get no match, because the probability of having no match is

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.940
37%. So, the probability of getting one match, winning the game,

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.280
would have been 63%, so it's actually more likely to win.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.540
Over 50%, not a huge amount over 50%, so it can go wrong, okay?

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.200
So you can lose this game.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.700
Brady: "If you're a specially unlucky guy."

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.680
Yeah, if you're like me. If you're unlucky like me, you might lose this game.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.140
But I used 10 cards here, and the probability of winning with 10 cards

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.760
is 63%.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.340
Do you think, then, if I had 100 cards, am I more likely to get a match,

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.420
or less likely to get a match?

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.000
Well, I can tell you it's still 63%. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how many cards you have, it's a constant.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.500
It's gonna be 63% no matter how many cards you have.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.620
Brady: "What if it's two cards?"

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.040
Okay, you caught me out there. I was gonna get to that. I was gonna get to that.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.100
It's 63% if you use four or more cards.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.060
So pretty much any game, okay? So you don't, a game that uses three and two and one...

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.200
uh, is not 63%, but hey, four or more and you will always get 63% chance of winning.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.000
That's a, that's a constant. So the way you solve this problem,

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.560
it's about matches, getting a match. Or not getting a match.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.220
And these things where you are not looking for a match is called as a derangement.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.020
A derangement, which is such fun to say! So we're gonna get deranged, so let's do that.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.700
So if you're mixing up cards or any objects like that, that's called a permutation,

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.760
or you might call it an arrangement.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.340
Maybe that's a word you would use. If I had, say, five things, let's do five dots,

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.520
Eh, five dots here.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.540
And then I could arrange them in any way. I'm gonna do that with arrows, to show that, you know, one becomes two,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.740
two becomes three,

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.420
let's say

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.220
three becomes five,

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.960
Let's say four goes across to four, and five becomes one, like that. So you can have any kind of scramble like that.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.720
So how many ways can you scramble those objects? Well, that's n factorial,

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.760
in general, so there are n factorial ways you can scramble up n objects,

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.340
number, um, number of permutations, n factorial.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.000
Now a derangement is a permutation that has no fixed points.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.420
Now, this is not a derangement. Look. Four went to four.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.920
It's fixed. It didn't change. That's not a derangement. So a derangement is something like that,

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.120
but there are no fixed points.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.900
So if I did the same sort of idea,

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.000
and draw one in,

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.560
a derangement would mean

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:02.600
something like this,

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.200
maybe like that,

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.340
and maybe something down there, there you go. That would be a valid derangement.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.820
And the symbol for derangements, so how many derangements are there?

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.140
So it's a subset of permutations.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.320
So there's fewer. And the number of derangements has this symbol.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.460
It's exclamation mark n.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.060
It's like a backwards factorial. Now, how many of these are there?

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.700
Well, there's a formula for that. The number of derangements

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.700
is approximately

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.720
the number of permutations

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.760
divided by e.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.640
[gasp]

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.600
Surprise e! Oh, where did that come from? Surprise e!

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.040
There he is!

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.160
And that, in fact, is a very accurate

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.680
formula. In fact, you, say approximately, just take the nearest integer, round up or round down, and you're done.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.280
That's how many derangements there are. Boom, straight away.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.120
So if I'm interested in the probability of losing this game,

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.620
I'm looking in, I'm looking at the probability of

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.500
no fixed points.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.880
So it's, I'm looking for the number of derangements, so it's probability of no fixed points.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.540
Brady: "And you found one there, didn't you? That was a no fixed points."

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.300
This was a, this was a derangement. I accidentally had a derangement.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.980
I didn't plan it, I just went and saw what happened.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.980
Brady: "So we thought you lost, but you're a genius!"

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.980
Well, I didn't plan it, but,

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.000
but it works out for this video.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.500
so if you want to find the probability of no fixed points,

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.020
it's how many derangements we have. So this is equal to number of derangements

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.660
divided by the total number of ways I could have scrambled up

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.220
those n objects,

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.000
which is the total number of permutations.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.760
So if this is the probability of no fixed points,

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.020
you're taking all the derangements and dividing by all the possible

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.920
permutations, and we have a formula for that, and so this is going to be approximately

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.980
1 over e, which is going to be 0.37,

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.100
which is why

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:09.720
it's 37% to get a derangement, or 63% to get a match, which is the opposite question.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.760
So one of the classic versions of this same problem is called the secretary problem.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.580
So imagine having a secretary, and that person's got letters to various people,

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.020
and they've got envelopes to those same people, so you need to put the letters in the right envelopes.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.880
So that secretary, they're looking at their watch, they're trying to get out the door, right? So they're just

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.500
quickly

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.080
shoving in letters into envelopes.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.460
What's the probability that at least one letter goes to the right person?

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.140
Ends up in the right envelope. And that's going to be

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.640
63%.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:51.200
Another version of the same problem is the hat problem, hat checking problem, this sounds a bit

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.720
old-fashioned to me, sounds a bit Edwardian.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.640
Which is, you go to the theater, and people check their hats at the cloakroom.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.640
That sounds very old-fashioned. But they put them in boxes, and then they just

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.580
give them out back to people without thinking. So again, what's the probability that someone

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.360
gets their hat back? 63% again.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.980
So there are various versions of the same question.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.320
Brady: "Would we be using the same style of mathematics if we started wanting to know what's the probability of

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:29.440
"two people getting their hat back, or 10 people, or would we start using other mathematical weapons to figure that out?"

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:35.420
Yeah, so to answer the question of exactly two people, something like that, it's harder.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.440
What I've actually done here is worked out the probability that no one

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:45.280
gets the correct match. And that's quite an easy thing to solve.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.620
Once you start asking questions about,

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:54.080
these people did, so many people did, and so many people didn't, it gets more complicated to work out.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:58.180
So this formula I've just given you seems to come out of nowhere.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.540
I want to show you where that formula comes from.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:09.700
But this is going to be for the dedicated viewer, I think. It's not a simple proof, but I think it's doable,

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.660
but we're going to try, all right, let's, let's see where that formula came from.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:23.580
So imagine having all the possible permutations, right? It's the set of all possible permutations.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.360
I'm actually gonna draw a Venn diagram.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:30.560
So these are all the possible permutations that you can have, which means there are--
