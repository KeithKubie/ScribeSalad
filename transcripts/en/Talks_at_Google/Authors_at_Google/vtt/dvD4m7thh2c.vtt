[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.232 --> 00:00:07.690
BRICE CHALLAMEL:
So let's introduce

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.760
with your first
opening question.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.330
It strikes me that
in the last decade,

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.600
we have read fiction and
all sorts of philosophy,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.080
documentary, that project
a very gloomy perspective

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.860
on the future.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.170
When you read science
fiction books, most of them

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.100
are dystopia.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.390
You can think of "Silo," of
"Divergent," of "Hunger Games."

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.550
There are not a lot of
science fiction books

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.790
that give you a positive outcome
for the future of mankind.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.070
However, here at Google,
we believe in progress.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.050
We believe in empowerment
with technology.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.540
We believe in greater
good and values.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.110
We received an email from
our CEO, Sundar Pichai,

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.550
a few days ago.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.680
And he was writing,
"At Google, we

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.470
believe in making people's
day a little easier

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.960
and ultimately, helping increase
their knowledge, their health,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.880
their happiness,
and their success.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.670
And I want to ask you
this first question.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.100
Are we at Google
the last utopians,

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.440
the last ones to hope and
believe in a better future?

00:01:09.675 --> 00:01:11.050
BERNARD-HENRI
LEVY: Probably not.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:17.590
But I'm not sure
that to be a utopian,

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.200
to believe in
progress, is so good.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.430
I'm not certain that
it is a privilege.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.580
And I'm not completely sure that
it is for the best of humanity.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.970
I know two ideas which
really harm humanity.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:47.530
One is the idea of universal,
indefinite, unbreakable

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.120
progress.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.750
And the other one is the
universal, indefinite,

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.630
and unbreakable decline.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.490
Both philosophies are,
for me, as misleading

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.590
one and the other.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.410
The first one has
one big name, which

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.610
might be sufficient
to incarnate it,

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.360
which is the name of the
German philosopher Hegel.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.342
Hegel believed in
necessary progress.

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:25.200
A Hegelian, at
least-- not Hegel--

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.030
a Hegelian would
believe that whatever

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.730
you do, even if you do
nothing, even if you

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.000
sit in a lazy way on the
backseat on the last wagon

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.700
of the train of
history, the train

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.430
will arrive at [? terminus. ?]

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.940
On the other side, you have
the followers of, let's say,

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.730
Oswald Spengler,
the philosopher who

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.750
published one century
ago a very important book

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.900
and strong book about
"The Decline of the West."

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.930
He thought exactly the
opposite, that whatever

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.510
you do, even if you do a
lot, even if you gesticulate,

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.880
even if you stand at the
forehead of the train

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.320
and try to push it
harder, nevertheless,

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.131
the world is going to the worst.

00:03:29.131 --> 00:03:34.080
These two philosophies,
for me, are really twins

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.940
and are twin
teachers of laziness.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.130
What I like around
me, among my friends,

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.310
the people I respect,
are those who

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:55.480
believe neither this nor
that but just try to apply

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.130
what the Jewish thought calls--

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.220
called and calls--
the tikkun olam, which

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:10.750
is the power which every single
individual, every single woman,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:18.940
every single man, has to
repair, a little, the world.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.100
The world has no sense.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.260
The world can go in the worst
or in the best direction.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:36.550
We can, each of us, at our
level, like Mr. Pichai said,

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.290
try on his own
battlefield with the means

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:48.280
he has in hands to improve, a
little, the state of affairs,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:55.320
to stop or to slow, a
little, the process of decay.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.200
So it's not [INAUDIBLE]
being utopian.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.880
It's not [INAUDIBLE] progress.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.530
And anyway, utopia,
that last remark,

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:11.770
as it was conceived in the
past, is probably inconceivable.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.960
We are the first
generations, mine and yours,

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.590
who for the first
time in history

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.800
don't really believe
that there is

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.790
a serious reason for tomorrow
being better than today.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:35.680
This ideal of time like
an arrow going strike

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:43.730
straight to a target, very few
fools still believe in that.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:50.280
But the fact that we have
in our hands some tools

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:56.640
and that with that tools, we
can [? embetter ?] a little

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:02.230
or make a little worse the
world in which we live, yes.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:03.702
This is in our hands.

00:06:03.702 --> 00:06:05.910
BRICE CHALLAMEL: Thank you
very much for this answer.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.880
Thank you.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:13.030
So our way to repair the world
and is embedded in our mission

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.230
statement at Google, is to
make the world's information

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.130
universally
accessible and useful.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.500
And information is a
gateway to a lot of things.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.340
And one of those things is
knowledge and the empowerment

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.780
of knowledge.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.170
There was a long-standing
ideal of thinking

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.410
every human being could
rise to the level of almost

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:40.030
universal knowledge and,
you know, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.180
And that meaning was
very deeply embedded

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.490
in the European culture of
the Enlightenment, [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.530
in its original meaning.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.180
The more we go in
time, the more we

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.880
find that science
is a bottomless pit

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.480
of very complicated
knowledge, that we

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.980
hear about things that happen
at the other side of the world

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.640
and that don't make sense to us
and need a lot of qualification

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.510
and explaining for us to
even grasp or understand,

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.910
as you've done in
the last decades,

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:11.770
to tell us about
things that happen

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.620
from our European perspective
in [INAUDIBLE] very far away.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.850
And it seems more and more
elusive and distant to us

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.710
to have knowledge.

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:21.700
A lot of people--

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.580
this is surveyed very
frequently-- would say,

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.320
I feel the world
is going very fast.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.820
I think things are
very complicated.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.550
And I don't feel that I
can understand the world

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.350
or know the world anymore.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:33.970
So my second question is this.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.120
Is the ideal of
the Enlightenment,

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.960
of bringing knowledge to
mankind, of making every man

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.320
and woman on earth
someone who has knowledge

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.780
and who has understanding of
the world around them, is it

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.160
still relevant?

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.330
Or has it lost its meaning
in the recent years

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:57.640
in this complexifying
of our existence?

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:03.730
BERNARD-HENRI LEVY: It
still has meaning, in part,

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:06.550
because of Google.

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:13.810
It is losing its meaning, in
part, because of Google too.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:17.470
As far as Enlightenment
is concerned--

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.540
this is your question--

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:26.500
Google is a force for the best
and a force for the worst.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.340
Let's enter the core
of the question.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.760
I speak frankly,
if you don't mind.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:39.410
For the best, first, Google
made two great things.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:47.480
Google launched two
real revolutions--

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.880
number one, the universal
access to knowledge,

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.960
the dream of the Enlightenment,
the dream of the authors

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.480
of "Encyclopédie,"
Diderot and so on.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:07.820
The dream of Hegel, the absolute
knowledge, le savoir absolu.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:13.040
This seemed out of
reach for humanity

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:18.130
till the last decades
for the first time.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:23.840
And this is even incredible
and nearly unthinkable

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.620
that in such a short
time, a few people

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:33.390
achieve that this
knowledge is accessible.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:38.750
And this is really an
anthropological change

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:42.710
in the destiny of
humanity, the fact

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:48.920
that any scientific discovery,
any medical research

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:54.950
in a remote laboratory
of any continent

00:09:54.950 --> 00:10:01.470
can be at your reach
or mine in a click.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:06.420
This is completely new and
completely revolutionary.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:11.220
And it is a gesture
of Enlightenment.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:20.280
Diderot, d'Alembert would have
liked this aspect of Google.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.520
There is another
thing that Google

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:28.680
did and achieved which
goes also in the sense

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.860
of this Enlightenment.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:35.880
It is the fact that every
single citizen of the world

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.620
has, for the first time in
the history of humanity,

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:45.710
the technical possibility
and the human right

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:54.740
not only to express himself, but
to have his expression written,

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.850
embedded, inscribed somewhere.

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:02.660
One of my masters, Michel
Foucault, French philosopher

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.790
who spent a lot of time
at the end of his life

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:09.230
in San Francisco, by the
way, made a huge difference

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.930
between two sort of people.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:15.620
More important than the
have and the have-ots,

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:20.030
more important than those
who had power and those

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:23.120
who were dominated, it
was good difference,

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:29.990
said Michel Foucault, with
the famous and the infamous,

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.390
what he called
infamous, which meant,

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:38.170
in his language, those who
had no way to have their

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:42.830
[? fame, ?] their
reputation, the story

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:49.400
of their crossing of the planet
leaving any trace anywhere.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:54.080
Michel Foucault said, one
of the worst of inequality

00:11:54.080 --> 00:12:02.910
is that three quarters, 99% of
humanity crosses the planet,

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:09.660
crosses life, without
living any scar, any trace

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.760
at the face of the planet.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:18.710
And this, said Michel Foucault,
or a Michelle Foucault follower

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:22.170
could conclude, this
is heartbreaking.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.640
This is an absolute unfairness.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:32.760
To this, Google
brought a reparation.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.100
Google repaired that.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:41.040
Since Google and since the
digital revolution in general,

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:46.890
anyone, any one
of us can step out

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:53.640
if he wants from out of the
night of the obscure men

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.930
and women.

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:57.645
Step out the night
of the infamous.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:05.860
These two gestures are true
gestures of Enlightenment.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:11.620
And again, Denis Diderot,
d'Alembert, d'Holach, all

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:17.680
the French pre-revolutionaries
who made this real revolution

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:23.080
of making "Encyclopédie," which
was not Wikipedia, believe me--

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:28.300
they would consider that
as to [INAUDIBLE] gesture.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.935
Then, the worst.

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:43.230
Real Enlightenment supposes
two additional propositions,

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:45.790
two additional things.

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:52.640
Number one, that this absolute
knowledge, which is, as I said,

00:13:52.640 --> 00:14:00.370
under the reach of anyone,
has to be mastered.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:08.370
You have to have a way to
find your way in its bushes.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:12.930
You have to find a
way for this putting

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:15.720
into access or
universal knowledge

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.250
to be a real gesture
of Enlightenment.

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:25.260
You have not only to have it
like this, at your disposal.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:31.170
But you have to be able to
mobilize it, to shape it,

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:36.860
to mold it, to make
your own way through it,

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:43.890
to eat it, devour it.

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:47.370
The Hebrew prophets said--

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:52.410
they were great eaters of words.

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:57.340
They did not only utter
the words of prophecy.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:02.390
They really masticated
it, masticated them.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:11.900
And the new technology, the new
tools of the digital revolution

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:17.450
at this moment, do not
give the boussole--

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:18.680
how do you say boussole?

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.805
BRICE CHALLAMEL: A compass.

00:15:19.805 --> 00:15:23.090
BERNARD-HENRI LEVY: Compass,
don't give the compass,

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:26.000
don't give the cape.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.480
They're like this system
of the world which was well

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.930
described by your
German philosopher

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:40.410
before Hegel who
was called Leibniz.

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:47.010
Leibniz described a world of
infinite complexity, which

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:50.990
he called the world
of monadology, which

00:15:50.990 --> 00:16:01.200
was an absolute labyrinth
of deeds and worlds

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:11.790
where any office was and had
to be like an [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:14.530
in the labyrinth.

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:23.540
Number one, Google
and any company

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:28.470
born from the digital revolution
did not know to this moment

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:31.650
how to provide the
compass, the cape.

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:38.900
And number two-- this
process, this right

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:46.410
given to the have-nots of
fame the right to have fame,

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:50.730
is an act of Enlightenment
if you are still

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:59.010
able to make a difference
between the worlds,

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:06.869
between the expressions,
between the propositions,

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:12.420
for example, of an expert
whose expertise is nearly

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:14.819
impossible to understand
because he spent all

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:20.490
his life with [INAUDIBLE] and
somebody who just expressed

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:23.500
his mood of the day.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:28.860
The opinion of a
moody guy cannot--

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:33.060
from an Enlightened
point of view--

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:40.350
cannot have the same weight and
the same value as the opinion

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:45.840
of a scholar, an academic, a
woman or a man who devoted his

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:51.570
life and who put all the
interest of his [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.960
in the production
of this opinion.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:03.500
And this passage, this way of
going from proposal number one,

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.110
I have the right
to express myself,

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:11.030
and you have the duty to respect
me, to proposal number two,

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:15.170
I have the right to say
that my truth is the truth,

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:19.880
and you have no right
to make any hierarchy,

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:24.590
to make any difference, between
a better truth or a lower

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:25.430
truth.

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:30.200
This way of going from one
to the other, this passage,

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:34.040
is a non-Enlightened one.

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:38.650
By allowing that, the
digital revolution,

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:49.750
for the moment, for the
moment, overshadows or spreads,

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:54.850
casts a path of shadow
and of night on the light

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:59.795
that you, Google,
and others produced.

00:18:59.795 --> 00:19:00.920
BRICE CHALLAMEL: All right.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.565
Thank you very much for this.

00:19:02.565 --> 00:19:04.992
And also, "eating
the words," I think,

00:19:04.992 --> 00:19:07.450
will please a lot of Googlers
because we have a lot of love

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:09.107
for food at Google.

00:19:09.107 --> 00:19:10.690
And so we should put
this on the menu,

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:14.060
I think, more words, right?

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:18.850
So this brings us to another
consideration and another segue

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:23.110
from information,
which is truth or lies.

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:25.270
This topic-- which
seems very simple,

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:28.300
and you could take a five-year
old child and say that this is

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.920
a lie or this is the truth--

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.170
suddenly becomes
much more complicated

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:35.320
when you apply it to
a grownup or grownups.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.873
And a little story
here, my grandmother,

00:19:37.873 --> 00:19:39.790
when I was a child, used
to say, oh, you know.

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:43.130
Truth is like a mirror
fallen from the sky.

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:45.610
It has exploded in
a million pieces.

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:48.260
Everyone grabs a piece,
look at themselves, and say,

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.660
I hold the truth.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.150
And I would like
to ask you this.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:56.320
Do you think that there is
still such a thing as truth?

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.840
And how should we handle that
notion of truth versus lie?

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.760
Or have we gone and veered into
an environment of opinions?

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.730
And if yes, how can we find
our way out of the opinions

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:10.360
and get back to the guidance
to the meal of words,

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.620
to the meat of meaning?

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:20.320
BERNARD-HENRI LEVY: I don't
know if there is a truth or not.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:25.190
Or if I know, if I
have my idea on that,

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:29.250
this is not a fair thing I
would like to share with you.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:30.800
The first thing I
want to share is

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:38.260
that if we don't believe that
there is a truth, if we believe

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:45.470
that there is as many truths
as there are individuals,

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:50.360
then the world will become hell.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:55.090
Then the world will
become the stage

00:20:55.090 --> 00:21:03.990
of an unfinishable battlefield
between every truth.

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:06.900
This is a real problem.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:14.240
If really the truth
is this broken mirror,

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:22.160
if really each human being has
the legitimate feeling that he

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:28.640
owns part of the true cross
or mirror of the truth,

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:34.170
then it will be war forever.

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:47.740
So the real question, you
have two opposite problems.

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:50.220
Number one is the
one I just mentioned,

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.990
to believe that there is as
many truths as human beings.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:57.030
This is a position
of the sophists.

00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:02.250
The Greeks five
centuries before Christ

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:07.220
had a school of thinkers
who exactly thought that.

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:13.460
They exactly thought, they
said, that [FOREIGN LANGUAGE],,

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:20.270
every single man is the
measure of the value of things.

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:24.710
He has an opinion on the
truth, and his opinion

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:27.050
is absolutely respectable.

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:29.250
This was a sophistic position.

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:35.360
And we know by history, we
know by their contemporaries,

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:39.510
that number one, they were
the allied of the tyrants,

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:43.170
of the despots, and
especially of those

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:47.360
who condemned to
death Socrates, which

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:50.770
was a huge event in the
history of humanity.

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:55.310
The death of Socrates is
something on which humanity

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:56.810
reflected for centuries.

00:22:56.810 --> 00:23:02.420
It was a trauma which affected
humanity for centuries.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:04.730
You have this temptation.

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:07.820
And you had, at this time,
another temptation, which

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:12.290
was to say there is one truth.

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:15.680
It is somewhere.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:27.470
And some, a few of us, have
the divine power to know where

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:30.330
and to know how.

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:36.530
This gives, obviously,
to those who

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:41.090
are in touch with the
truth, an incredible power.

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:46.760
And who would refuse to someone
the absolute power if he

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.420
could say and prove, come on.

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.310
I have the grail.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:53.670
I know where it is.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:58.250
I know the ladder and so on.

00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:02.310
And this is, again, a
justification of tyranny.

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:08.640
So you can justify tyranny,
which is for sure the biggest--

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:12.480
for an Enlightened citizen--

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.400
the biggest evil.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:18.030
You can justify tyranny
by the two ways--

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:21.930
by saying that there is as many
truths as there is individuals,

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:25.490
and by saying that there is
only one truth hidden somewhere,

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:27.840
but reachable.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:32.120
These are the two
opposite risks.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:40.920
In the middle, you have
a more humble way, which

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:47.120
seems to me at the same
time, the most reasonable,

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:55.810
the one that has the advantage
to produce less disease

00:24:55.810 --> 00:25:01.080
and to be probably the most
close to the reality, which

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:08.460
is that there is a truth, number
one that it is out of reach,

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:14.520
number two, but that
it should be targeted,

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:21.640
pursued with good
will by each of us,

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:29.080
and knowing that none of
us will ever say, I got it.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:33.910
We are like in the Greek
paradox of Zeno [INAUDIBLE],,

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:37.340
and the [? tortuga ?]
will never reach.

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:39.040
It will never bypass.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:43.760
The seeker of the
truth will never

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:49.590
fill the space, will always
fill half of it and so on.

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:54.290
So my reply to your
question would be that.

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:55.670
No to the broke--

00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:58.517
I'm sorry for your grandmother.

00:25:58.517 --> 00:26:00.600
BRICE CHALLAMEL: I think
it was a cautionary tale.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.090
So I think you're in the spirit.

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:05.840
BERNARD-HENRI LEVY:
So no for the mirror,

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:15.650
no for the Platonician ideal,
but yes to these women and men

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:21.260
lost in the night
and seeing, from time

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:30.340
to time, a shining star hiding
itself but showing nevertheless

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.010
the path.

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:35.835
This is a way I believe in.

00:26:35.835 --> 00:26:36.960
BRICE CHALLAMEL: All right.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:37.793
Thank you very much.

00:26:37.793 --> 00:26:42.440
So interestingly, we're
leading to the next part

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.510
of our discussion
about solutions,

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:46.520
about how we can contribute.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:52.670
What I heard from you today was
that to the meal of knowledge

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:56.150
of words, we have to
be guided, that there

00:26:56.150 --> 00:27:00.530
is a search for the truth and
that the search matters more

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:02.810
than the truth itself, in
a way, and the good will

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:04.850
we put into this.

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:08.210
I deeply believe that
at Google, everyone

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:09.230
has a lot of good will.

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:11.090
We are very much a
good will company.

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:15.050
And we even hire one
another with good will

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:17.010
as one of our main criteria.

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:19.040
We call this
Googliness, and it's

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.200
a form of extension
of good will.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.940
And we all want to
do the right thing

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.320
and look for the right thing.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.678
So I want to ask you
next about solutions.

00:27:27.678 --> 00:27:28.970
There is a quote that you make.

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:31.553
And you actually made it several
times over the last 20 years.

00:27:31.553 --> 00:27:34.610
So it's a quote
from Virgil that you

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:37.000
say Freud had at the
introduction of "The Analysis

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.220
of Dreams," saying, "If
I can't move the gods,

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:43.550
at least I can move the
river of the shadows."

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:48.350
And I think Juneau used to
say this in Virgil's place.

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:51.710
And here we are,
reaching to the gods,

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:56.100
to people who have incredible
power, knowledge, perspective,

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:59.510
and yet, having to move
the river of shadows, which

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:03.050
is the whole of mankind
moving as a whole and almost

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:07.080
a subconscious thought for us
because it's billions of people

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.330
empowered.

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:09.800
How can we arbitrate?

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.240
What do you think?

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:15.700
What do you propose to us
as solutions, guidelines

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.200
to repair the world in the way
that we can repair the world?

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.492
And how would you
dream Google to tackle

00:28:20.492 --> 00:28:21.950
these tough challenges
that we have

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:24.830
discovered together and
that lead from information

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:27.524
about truth, about
knowledge, about empowerment?

00:28:32.962 --> 00:28:34.420
BERNARD-HENRI LEVY:
What I think is

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:43.580
that you have definitely a
huge and even frightening

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:46.000
responsibility.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.040
You-- digital companies in
general, but especially Google,

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.940
which is incomparable
to the others--

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:56.740
you have a huge responsibility.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:01.540
No company in the
history of mankind

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:11.000
ever had such a power,
ever had such an influence

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:17.960
in the way in which your fellow
human beings, your brothers

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.950
in humanity, think.

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:23.860
You have a huge
influence on that.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:27.640
There was a point I did not
mention, this, for example,

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:33.620
the relationship we all
have to our own memory.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:36.340
This is a point I
make in my book.

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:39.760
I call that, after
one of my masters,

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.530
the syndrome of Saint Denis.

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:46.790
The syndrome Saint Denis
was this French bishop

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:50.360
of the 3rd century
after Christ who

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:53.360
was beheaded by a
group of by pagans

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:58.370
and who is reported by a miracle
to have climbed the hill which

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:00.830
is named today as the
[? calling ?] of Saint

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:06.330
Denis with his beheaded
head under his elbow.

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:08.870
He continued to climb the hill.

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:10.130
Why do I mention that?

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:16.520
Because today, because
of the digital revolution

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:20.060
and with the help
of Google, we all

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:24.230
are some sort of
Saint Denis, having

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:30.650
not our brain, but our
memory not under our elbow,

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:34.410
but in our pocket.

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:38.720
We all know the experience of
having a coffee with friends

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.690
at the cafeteria
or a Chinese soup,

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:44.510
delicious, which
I just had, trying

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:52.820
to remind, to recall an event,
a date, a quote, whatever,

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.280
and checking, Googling it.

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.750
It became a verb.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:01.650
So there is a sort of,
in very short time,

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:11.360
we are facing a real concerning
process of exfiltration

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:15.580
in a great machine
that goes so fast,

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:22.340
who puts things in such an order
of a big part of our memory.

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:26.570
There is an exfiltration,
an externalization,

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:32.000
and off-shoreization beyond
the shores of our head

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.940
of a big part of our memory.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.140
On some regards, why not?

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:41.150
This machine is maybe
more intelligent

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:44.210
and makes less slip of
the tongue and so on.

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:48.740
But at the same time,
slips of the tongue,

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:53.410
misunderstandings,
false memories,

00:31:53.410 --> 00:32:00.170
are so crucial for the
soul, the imagination,

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:02.720
and the process of thinking.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:07.520
So you have a huge
responsibility.

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:15.710
In 20 years, you produced,
you injected in your own minds

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:18.920
and in our worlds and in
the minds of three quarters

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:24.450
or maybe four fifths of
humanity, real changes.

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:29.390
Number two, I know
about the good will.

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:31.950
I know that.

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:35.100
I know it through my
friends, while working

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:38.740
for big digital companies.

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.620
And I know it from
Google because I

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:43.820
happen to have discussions--

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.540
I don't know if I
can say that here--

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:53.640
but with Mr. Sundar Pichai
last summer, your president,

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:59.120
and more closely with the
European team of Google.

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:02.710
You have some, in
Paris and in Europe,

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:06.460
a team of ladies and gentlemen.

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:09.330
Some of them have
become friends.

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:11.330
Mr. Carlo d'Asaro Biondo--

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:15.130
I don't know if you know him.

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:20.650
And I know that these
ladies, these gentlemen--

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:25.350
maybe because they have
the head in the new world

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:30.130
and the feet in the old one,
maybe because part of them

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:35.910
is still belonging to the
Italian Renaissance world,

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:40.120
maybe just because they
are just good people--

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:40.910
I know.

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:43.810
And I seldom saw that.

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:49.390
I seldom in my life
saw such big companies

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:53.350
having such a
terrifying, huge power

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:59.410
and having so much good
will, so much will to repair.

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:02.950
The Jewish commandment of
repairing the world, tikkun

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:05.050
olam.

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:11.000
It's true that in all
big digital companies,

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:17.409
and especially in this one,
I find it as a real motto,

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:25.360
as a real reason to work
and to live and to win.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:30.159
I know that there is
leadership in this company that

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:37.199
prefers to leave a good scar,
to repeat the metaphor I made

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:43.560
before, a good scar, a scar
of life and of light and of

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:50.139
hope in the future of humanity
than a bad inheritance.

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:54.040
Number two, and I'm
convinced of that.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:58.540
Number three, after that,
you have to know what to do.

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:04.570
When you made a golem, a
golem like in Prague, Maharal

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:12.040
of Prague, this sort of
great admirable and somehow

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:19.630
crazy machine that is able to
produce some effects which you

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:23.770
programmed, but that
you do not control,

00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:26.350
you put them in the machine.

00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:29.560
You don't control
completely all the outcomes.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.630
How can you act?

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:33.880
What can you do?

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:40.030
I had, in Paris, a meeting of
this sort with your colleagues

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:42.910
of European Google.

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:48.590
And a few ideas stemmed
out of the conversation.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:56.440
For example, I
launched the idea of,

00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:00.190
as I told before, access
of knowledge, great,

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:07.160
but if you are able
to walk into it

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.860
and if you are able
to memorize it.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:13.300
So I launched the idea
of an "Encyclopédia."

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:16.090
When I said that, the
beginning of our conversation,

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:20.500
each time I quoted Diderot,
I quoted the "Encyclopédia."

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:21.410
Why not to do?

00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:25.630
If I were Google,
if I were Google,

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:31.540
I would certainly devote
one of the billions or half

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:36.550
of a billion or one tenth
of the billions I earn,

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:41.110
my company earns every
year, in order to produce

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:47.020
the "Encyclopédia" of the
modern times, of the 21 century.

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:52.180
It is doable, even if
this knowledge is complex,

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:56.200
even if it is as you said.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:00.430
It is possible to assemble it.

00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:06.670
There are few hundreds,
maybe a few thousands,

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:12.700
of high ranking scientists
who devoted their life

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.070
in their discoveries.

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:22.420
They could make accessible
to all the Google researchers

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:25.920
their knowledge
as the scientists

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.910
of the time of Diderot did.

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:29.840
So I have a dream.

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:34.210
This is what I said to your
Paris colleagues, d'Asaro

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:36.130
Biondo and his colleagues.

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:37.750
I have the dream of--

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:40.120
because we have an
encyclopedia today.

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.912
It is called Wikipedia.

00:37:41.912 --> 00:37:43.150
OK.

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:46.180
I am well placed-- each
of us is well placed--

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:52.060
to know that it is the
worst possible encyclopedia.

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:53.020
It is not good.

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:55.660
Really, it is not good.

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:59.320
It is full of vested interests.

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:03.670
Each article of "Wikipedia"
is a battlefield

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:09.490
in which some forces fight
as in the fight of sophists

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:11.800
in the ancient Greece.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:16.720
You had in the agora of Athens
Gorgias, Pythagoras, Callicles,

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:20.320
who were just fighting
for their truth.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.770
And the most strong,
the strongest one, this

00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:25.630
is "Wikipedia."

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:33.160
It is not dictated by the
idea of the inaccessible star

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:37.360
in the darkness or in the fog.

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:42.380
An encyclopedia that
would be directed by that,

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:49.820
I'm sure that it would be a
real progress for humanity,

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:56.860
a good way to allow each
of us to make his way,

00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:02.900
like in the "Inferno" of Dante,
but an "Inferno" of Dante

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:09.140
who would have a few
lights suddenly coming in.

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:09.890
I would do that.

00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:20.440
You know as well as anyone
that we are living in a world

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.790
where truth is under attack.

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:24.790
It is not the fault of Google.

00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:29.980
It is the fault of Donald
Trump and Vladimir Putin.

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:32.190
It is the fault of
the philosophers

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:34.250
of the 20th century.

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:38.050
It is the fault of the
post-Nietzschean descendents.

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:41.150
There is a lot of
responsibility.

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:50.650
But you know how a tool like
yours can speed the false truth

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:52.270
and can block them.

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:53.530
You know that you can--

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:55.450
company like a tool.

00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:57.080
Don't speak about company.

00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:02.380
A tool like the tools of Google,
like the algorithms on Google,

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:05.050
can have an incredible
contribution

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:08.010
to the process in both ways.

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:12.210
This needs-- deserves, also--

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:14.730
to be thought, to be reflected.

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:17.610
And there is
certainly some means.

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:24.030
In Paris I proposed the
idea of making in real time

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:29.580
a sort of hall of
shame of the fake news.

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:39.330
I launched the idea of making
every year a competition all

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:44.520
over the world with an award,
with a prize, with money given

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:49.050
to the YouTuber or
to the user of Google

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:56.070
who would propose the best short
video or short tale or whatever

00:40:56.070 --> 00:41:01.710
able to turn into laughing,
into ridicule, the fake news.

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:04.800
I don't know how it
can be proceeded.

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.980
And you objected me
in a conversation

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:10.860
that the way in which
the new world works

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:15.480
makes that shame can
be a source of desire.

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:20.490
And the more you put shame
on fake news, the most--

00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:22.020
maybe I'm wrong.

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:25.440
But there must be a way
when you are Google,

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:30.450
when you are such a big company,
to put all your knowledge all

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:34.350
your technicity,
all your algorithms

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:36.330
at the service of the truth.

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:37.680
I'm sure of that.

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:45.090
And the memory-- again,
I'm sure that this process

00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:51.270
of exfiltration, of Saint
Denis-ization of our memory

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:52.220
is reversible.

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:59.820
Today, we have every
day some young genius

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:04.860
who invents a start-up with
an application producing

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:10.980
crazy things to sleep better or
to count your step, whatever.

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:19.500
I'm sure that there is ways to
restart and to make our memory

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:20.760
work again.

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:26.185
I would reflect on these
sort of path if I were you.

00:42:26.185 --> 00:42:27.310
BRICE CHALLAMEL: All right.

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:28.990
Thank you very much.

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:30.450
So thank you very much.

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:33.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:36.780
So I could go on and ask you
questions for the whole day.

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:39.120
But we don't have the whole
day, and I'm not alone here.

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:42.360
And this is the perfect time to
give the mic to the audience.

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:45.150
Does anyone want-- so maybe we
have one here in front and then

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:47.290
one there on this
side, follow-up.

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:48.790
AUDIENCE: You spoke
at great length.

00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:53.010
And I truly agree with a lot
of the things that you said.

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:55.910
But you haven't touched a lot
on the book that you wrote

00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:59.280
and which the talk is about.

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:02.460
And so I hope with my question
to give you an opportunity

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:05.430
to expand a little
bit on the five kings.

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:08.440
And what is the
metaphor behind that?

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:14.700
And in the list of these
places that you mention,

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:18.220
you do mention the United
States as being in decline.

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:22.590
You do not mention the European
Union or the United Kingdom

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:24.540
or the Commonwealth.

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:28.890
So what is the main
idea and thrust

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:32.022
that we should get from the book
that is being presented here?

00:43:32.022 --> 00:43:33.480
BERNARD-HENRI LEVY:
I did not do it

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:36.930
because I did not come
to speak about me,

00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:39.340
but to speak about
you, honestly.

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:40.530
No, no.

00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:43.500
For me, it's a real
treat to be here.

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:46.530
And I really wanted to.

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:58.190
So a few words, my book is
about the bill of $1, which

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:01.160
you may have in your pocket.

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:06.530
If somebody here has a bill
of $1 in his pocket, $1,

00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:12.470
she or he will find
that on this bill of $1,

00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:13.955
there are three quotes.

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:23.530
These three quotes, these
three quotes are here.

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:28.710
The first one is in
Latin, "annuit coeptis."

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:35.610
The second one is in Latin
also, "novus ordo seclorum."

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:42.280
And the third one is in Latin
also, "e pluribus, unum"

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:44.860
on the wings of the eagle.

00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:50.560
So three Latin quotes
in a bill of the most

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:55.060
materialistic country
in the world--

00:44:55.060 --> 00:45:01.930
these three Latin quotes are
all driven from the same author.

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:04.870
This author is called Virgil.

00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:10.120
And Virgil is the author of
a book called "Aeneid" that

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:15.460
tells a story which is,
for me, the founding

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:21.210
story of the birth,
of the growth,

00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:26.100
of the success of America.

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:30.180
This is what my book is about,
why there is three Virgil

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:32.220
quotes of a bill of $1.

00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:36.990
And the book is
also about the fact

00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:42.700
that when you forget the
three Latin quotes on the bill

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:46.020
of $1, when you forget--

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:47.820
which is happening today--

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:52.870
the Virgilian root of the
United States of America,

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:59.670
in other words, when you forget
that you are a country based

00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:04.890
on the rock of certain
values and principles,

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:08.700
when you forget that
you, your ancestors,

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:11.700
your grand grand grand
grand grandfathers

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:19.585
invented this country in
order to reset Europe,

00:46:19.585 --> 00:46:22.170
because this is
America, those three

00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:26.040
quotes of Virgil on this bill--

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:31.530
because the idea was to reset
Europe exactly as Aeneas

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:36.810
did reset Troy, the
city of Troy in flames,

00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:39.510
the city of Amsterdam,
Paris, and London

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:42.180
in flames in the 16th century.

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:44.880
And in face of these
flames is the idea

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:49.620
of reinventing a shining
city on a new land.

00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:52.410
If you'll forget
that, then five kings

00:46:52.410 --> 00:47:02.500
appear, five kings that are
former empires that collapsed

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:12.730
one after the other, who thought
since decades and centuries

00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:19.780
that they collapse forever,
and who are beginning to think

00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:25.930
that if America withdraws,
if America recedes,

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:29.560
if America abdicates,
then there might be

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:35.420
an opportunity for them to
advance, to occupy the field,

00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:38.480
and to fill the vacuum.

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:41.360
This is what this book is about.

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:44.850
But it is also about Google.

00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:51.630
It is also about the
fact that the super power

00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:58.530
that a few digital
companies have has something

00:47:58.530 --> 00:48:07.680
to do with this movement
of tide going back

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:10.200
in terms of geopolitics.

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.675
I give you back your dollar.

00:48:11.675 --> 00:48:12.830
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:12.830 --> 00:48:15.680
BRICE CHALLAMEL:
Thank you very much.

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:19.780
So we had another
question there, please.

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:20.860
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:23.100
Thanks for coming.

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:27.240
You said something
interesting about "Wikipedia"

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:32.080
being one of the worst things
we could have as an encyclopedia

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:34.887
and also that one of the
reasons, If I understand

00:48:34.887 --> 00:48:36.720
correctly, that it's
one of the worst things

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:39.780
is because "Wikipedia"
is a battlefield

00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:42.480
for vested interests.

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:46.530
I'm curious how
you think about--

00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:49.590
so the big difference between
"Wikipedia" and Google

00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:53.850
is Google gets most of
its revenue from ads,

00:48:53.850 --> 00:48:57.090
and "Wikipedia" has
pledged over the time

00:48:57.090 --> 00:49:01.050
that it will never
accept ad dollars.

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:06.210
How do you think about how this
would impact vested interests

00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:12.210
and would impact the truth
that both systems can produce?

00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:14.610
BERNARD-HENRI LEVY: The
worst vested interests

00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:18.310
are those who are
hidden, who are not

00:49:18.310 --> 00:49:21.670
fully and officially expressed.

00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:25.810
An ad, the vested
interest is here.

00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:28.410
It is like a board.

00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:35.050
A vested interest disguised
in self for truth,

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:36.010
this is the worst.

00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:40.910
This is my reply.

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:44.500
I have nothing against ads.

00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:48.340
"The New York Times," "Le
Monde," the best newspapers

00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:53.040
on Earth and others have ads.

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:54.370
It is clear.

00:49:54.370 --> 00:49:56.120
It's open.

00:49:56.120 --> 00:50:02.960
It does not mean that they are
a battlefield for champions

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:09.550
of so-called pieces of truth.

00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:14.830
Problem of Wikipedia is
that under the appearance

00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:22.210
of neutrality, under the
appearance of everyone,

00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:28.190
of participation,
and under the idea

00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:34.210
that you have an invisible
hand like in the market that

00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:45.440
will be as a referee, correcting
in real time all the excess

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:48.720
and will reach the
truth under this idea.

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:52.280
There are some real
intellectual interests--

00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:56.250
I'm not speaking about the
intellectual interests--

00:50:56.250 --> 00:51:02.150
of people who want to
impose or to make advance

00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:05.960
or to give a chance to
something which is a lie.

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:11.990
I remember Philip Roth,
the great American writer.

00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:16.580
He saw a mistake on
his Wikipedia page.

00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:17.420
He protested.

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:21.640
He wrote, innocent
way, old world.

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:26.930
He wrote a letter to Wikipedia
saying, I'm sorry, but see.

00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:31.832
The reply was, you are
not une source fiable.

00:51:31.832 --> 00:51:33.290
BRICE CHALLAMEL:
A reliable source.

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:37.006
BERNARD-HENRI LEVY: A reliable
source for Philip Roth.

00:51:37.006 --> 00:51:39.890
So this is Wikipedia.

00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:45.440
You cannot make an encyclopedia
if you don't believe that there

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:47.570
is a ladder, that
there is a scale,

00:51:47.570 --> 00:51:51.090
that there is a hierarchy
in terms of knowledge.

00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:52.820
Nobody has the full knowledge.

00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:54.020
OK.

00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:58.760
Nobody is able to say, I
have the final knowledge.

00:51:58.760 --> 00:51:59.270
OK.

00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:05.320
We all know that the
history of science

00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:08.050
overshadows every
provisional truth.

00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:11.630
At a point, every truth
is a provisional one

00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:14.700
and will be bypassed
by another one.

00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:21.310
But you cannot say that a
provisional truth has the same

00:52:21.310 --> 00:52:30.340
status as a crazy idea just
stemming out of a vested

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:32.590
interest desire.

00:52:32.590 --> 00:52:34.400
You cannot say that.

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:40.570
And the problem today of most
of the, especially Wikipedia,

00:52:40.570 --> 00:52:46.960
will have is that it works
under this false idea.

00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:50.800
And we have to restore,
even if it sounds elite.

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:54.280
I know that you are
a democratic company.

00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:54.822
I know that.

00:52:54.822 --> 00:52:55.530
AUDIENCE: Uh, no.

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:58.090
We're not.

00:52:58.090 --> 00:53:00.070
BERNARD-HENRI LEVY:
You praise democracy.

00:53:00.070 --> 00:53:01.090
You praise democracy.

00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:01.720
AUDIENCE: Externally, yes.

00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:02.930
But internally, we're
not a democratic company.

00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:05.210
BERNARD-HENRI LEVY: OK, I
don't want to enter in that.

00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:10.810
But to praise the idea
of every point of view

00:53:10.810 --> 00:53:15.830
having to be respected, having
to be praised, and so on, this,

00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:16.330
why not?

00:53:16.330 --> 00:53:19.990
But to be respected does
not mean everyone should

00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:22.720
be respected in expressing--

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:31.350
his caprice, his belief,
his will to think,

00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:34.970
his hope that the truth
should be this or that,

00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:39.760
but not in the idea that he
has the truth when he did not

00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:45.460
make the process, when
he did not make the path

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:50.860
and the road that
the scientists know

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:52.610
and which is the road for truth.

00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:55.030
The two cannot be put
on the same level.

00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:57.880
And there is something
to restore there,

00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:03.130
which is not a reactionary
gesture, but which is, yes,

00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:05.090
a gesture of restoration.

00:54:05.090 --> 00:54:08.590
And it would be great that
the most democratic company--

00:54:08.590 --> 00:54:10.660
one of the most, maybe
another than Google.

00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:14.080
I don't know-- makes
this restoration

00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:18.220
and dares to say
that between Einstein

00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:23.920
and any crazy member
of a conspiracy sect,

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:27.130
you have enemies.

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:29.965
This has to be reminded.

00:54:29.965 --> 00:54:31.090
BRICE CHALLAMEL: All right.

00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:32.150
Well, thank you very much.

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.775
We are on time.

00:54:32.775 --> 00:54:35.170
So time to thank you again
for coming and joining us.

00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:38.800
As we say in English,
food for thoughts.

00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:40.930
So we have a lot of
words to chew now

00:54:40.930 --> 00:54:42.508
and to ruminate for the coming--

00:54:42.508 --> 00:54:44.050
BERNARD-HENRI LEVY:
Chew, chew, chew.

00:54:44.050 --> 00:54:45.310
BRICE CHALLAMEL:
--weeks or months.

00:54:45.310 --> 00:54:47.150
We hope to have you
again at some point,

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:49.360
because this is an ongoing
conversation, of course.

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:51.610
And wish you the best of
stay here on the west coast

00:54:51.610 --> 00:54:54.197
and for your next travels in
America and all over the world.

00:54:54.197 --> 00:54:55.030
Thank you very much.

00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:58.380
