00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.548
For our last problem, I have the quantity 4 minus 10 squared plus 3 squared,

00:00:04.653 --> 00:00:09.604
minus the absolute value of 5 times the quantity negative 4 times 1 plus 2. And

00:00:09.616 --> 00:00:14.220
this whole quantity in the brackets is squared. I know this seems like a lot.

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:19.133
But if you work carefully and start from the parenthesis, you can figure this

00:00:19.145 --> 00:00:20.145
out. Good luck.
