00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.160
We learned in the imaginary
numbers video, that hopefully

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.800
you've watched, that every now
and then in certain equations

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.850
you end up with a square
root of a negative number.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.490
You know, you end up with
square root of negative 1 or

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.640
square root of negative 9.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.730
And since any real number, when
you square it, is either 0 or

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.630
positive, this was
undefined for us.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.760
And then in order to make it
defined in that video, people

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.510
came up with this
thing called i.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.860
And you can call that
the imaginary unit,

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.020
or just the number i.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.520
And you define i as saying,
well if i squared-- we'll

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.340
just make a definition.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.170
This thing called i
when you square it,

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.620
it equals negative 1.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.960
And then that simplifies
the idea of taking a

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.200
negative square root.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.310
Because then you could say, oh
well the square root of

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.430
negative 9 is the same thing as
i times the square root

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.725
of 9, which equals 3i.

00:00:56.725 --> 00:00:57.880
And how can we say that?

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.400
Well, what happens when
you square this thing?

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.700
So what's 3i squared?

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:11.120
3i squared is equal to 3
squared times i squared.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.470
This is just exponent
properties.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.890
And that equals 9 times
negative 1, which

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.520
equals negative 9.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.410
So 3i squared is
equal to negative 9.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.110
And then if we are kind of
extending the definition of

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.190
square roots to negative
numbers, then we can go the

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.610
other way around and we could
say 3i is equal to the

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.790
square root of negative 9.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.490
And 3i we can call an
imaginary number.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.850
And the word is "imaginary,"
but it's as real as anything.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.670
I mean to some degree, do
negative numbers even exist?

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.560
They're just kind of a way of
us-- when we put this sign in

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.180
front of things, it just tells
us something about how it

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.120
relates to this magnitude.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.390
Anyway, I don't want
to confuse you.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.010
But imaginary numbers tend to
get a bad rap because they're

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.370
called imaginary numbers, so
some people think that they

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.540
exist less than other things.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.920
But with that said, any number
times this imaginary unit

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.110
i is an imaginary number.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.100
When you do the quadratic
equation you realize that

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.930
sometimes you end up with
a number that has a

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:16.770
little bit of both.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.180
It has a real part and
an imaginary part.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.630
So let me give you
an example of that.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:31.310
Let's say I have the
number 5 plus 2i.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.490
That number you might say, oh,
well maybe I can simplify it.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.440
But you really can't.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.460
You can't add a real number
plus an imaginary number.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.100
You can almost kind of imagine
them-- and I don't want to use

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.040
the word "imagine" too much--
as in different dimensions.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.800
And so a number that has a real
part, like the 5, and an

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.050
imaginary part, like the 2i,
this is called a

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.070
complex number.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.550
And you could, if you want,
even graph a complex number.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.050
Let me see.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.375
You could make the
vertical axis.

00:03:08.375 --> 00:03:11.370
The vertical axis you could
call it the imaginary axis.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.010
And you could make the
horizontal axis the real axis.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.390
This is a symbol for the
set of real numbers.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.650
And 5 plus 2i, well
it's real part is 5.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.570
So one, two, three, four, five.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.970
That's five.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.160
And it's imaginary part is 2i,
so you go along the imaginary

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.870
axis, or the i-axis you
could even say, 2.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.720
And then you would have this
number here called 5 plus 2i.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.990
In future videos I'll actually
do examples where we'll make

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.880
more use of complex numbers.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.520
But now that we've defined what
a complex number is, let's see

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.860
how we can operate with it.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.690
So what happens when we
add two complex numbers?

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.130
Clear image.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.790
So let's say we have
two complex numbers.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.160
One is a plus bi.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.730
So the real part is a, the
imaginary part is bi.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.110
And let's say that I
have another complex

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:26.430
number, c plus di.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.230
And in general the symbol that
people tend to use-- you know,

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.330
you always use x for when
you're dealing with equations.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.640
Right?

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.090
Like x could be any general
real number when you're

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.920
dealing with an equation.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.670
In complex numbers the
convention is to use

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.570
z, the letter z.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.630
So, for example, we could
call this the complex

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:44.990
number z sub 1.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.810
And it could have been any.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.630
I mean, this choice
of z is arbitrary.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.920
This is an i right here.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.310
This could be z sub 2.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.840
So what is the complex number
z sub 1 plus z sub 2?

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:04.410
Well that equals this, a plus
bi, plus-- this is z sub

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.210
2 right here-- c plus di.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.990
Let me switch colors.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.510
This is getting monotonous.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.360
So when you add two complex
numbers, all you do is you add

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.150
the real parts to each other
and you add the complex

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.230
parts to each other.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:23.530
So that equals a
plus b-- oh sorry.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.190
The real parts.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.310
So it's a and c.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.130
Those are the real parts.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.360
So that equals a plus c
plus-- and then you add

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.240
the imaginary parts.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.190
b plus d times i.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.130
So you have b i's and d i's.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.450
So when you add them together
you have b plus d i's.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.060
b plus d in the imaginary
direction, you can

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.400
almost imagine.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.100
I'm using the word
imagine too much.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.740
So it's pretty easy.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.690
You just add the real and you
add the imaginary parts.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.060
So what happens if you
multiply two complex numbers?

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.820
And actually, let's
just go in order.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:59.930
What happens when
you subtract them?

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:00.830
Well, it's the same thing.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.880
Nothing fancy here. z
sub 1 minus z sub 2.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.800
That's just going to be
equal to-- you subtract

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.070
the real parts.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.420
a minus c.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.080
And that's the new real part.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.580
And then you subtract
the imaginary parts.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.640
b minus d times i.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.510
And this will be the
new imaginary part.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.950
So this will be the
new complex number.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.770
What happens when I
multiply the two numbers?

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.700
So what is z sub
1 times z sub 2?

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:33.450
Well that equals a plus
bi times c plus di.

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.910
And we essentially can
just FOIL it out.

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.310
I don't know if you've learned
FOIL in 8th grade algebra,

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.100
9th grade algebra.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.520
I don't like it.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.130
I actually just think of
it as the distributive

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.270
property twice.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.260
So what we could do is we
can take the c plus di

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.890
and distribute it on
each of these terms.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:49.230
Right?

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:56.200
So this should be equal
to a times c plus di.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.020
Right?

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:02.540
Plus bi times c plus di.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.850
Right?

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.860
All I did is I took the c plus
di and I multiplied it by this

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.120
to get this, and multiplied
it by this to get this.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.720
And then we distribute again.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:16.060
We get ac plus adi--
this is an i.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.920
I know my i's aren't
looking good.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:25.300
adi plus-- now
what's bi times c?

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:25.986
Well that's cbi.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.950
And then we have bi times di.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:38.130
So you get b times
d, which is bd.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.790
And then what's i times i?

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.750
It's i squared, or negative 1.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:43.150
Right?

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.630
Times negative 1.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.600
So what does this simplify to?

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.230
Well this simplifies to--
I'm going to go back here.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.050
So let's see what
the real parts are.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:58.070
We have this term, a
times c, that's real.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.270
So ac.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.720
And then this last term,
which was bi times di.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.320
Because we're multiplying i
times i we get a negative 1,

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.490
but it becomes real again.

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:07.560
Right?

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.920
So we get negative bd minus bd.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.600
So that's our new real part.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.950
So that was this term
and that term are real.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.320
And now what's our
new imaginary part?

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.700
Well it's going to be these
two terms added together.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:28.090
So it's-- I'm running out
of space again-- ad plus

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.850
cb, all of that times i.

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.780
It's a little easier with real
numbers, and maybe in the next

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.170
video I'll use real numbers.

00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:38.250
But the important thing to
realize is essentially you just

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.980
use the distributive property
and realize that you can only

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.640
add real terms to each other.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.225
You can't add a real
to an imaginary.

00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:47.260
And you can only add imaginary
terms to each other.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.430
And just remember, when you
have two imaginary numbers

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:53.010
times each other, the i's, when
multiplied times each other,

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:55.070
and you get negative 1.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:58.010
Now the last operation, when
you divide complex numbers.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.375
This gets a little bit
interesting, and maybe

00:09:00.375 --> 00:09:02.650
a little unintuitive.

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:08.350
So what happens if I divide
z sub 1 by z sub 2?

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:17.240
So once again that equals a
plus bi, divided by c plus di.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.180
How do I divide this?

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.750
Well, we're going to use a
property that hopefully

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.380
you learned in algebra.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:29.040
That if I multiply-- let me
do this in this corner.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.770
a plus b times a minus b.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:34.990
What does that equal?

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:39.620
That equals a squared
minus b squared.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.230
And so if I multiply
a complex number.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:45.560
Let's say, in theory, I
multiply a complex number c

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.950
plus di times c minus di.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.200
What do I get?

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.600
I get c squared
minus di squared.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.060
And what's di squared
going to be?

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.870
It's d squared times negative
1, so it becomes c squared--

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:04.720
oh, I'm out of time.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.330
Actually, let me continue the
division in the next video,

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:08.175
because it can get involved.

00:10:08.175 --> 00:10:09.750
See you soon.
