from enlightenment next I think that

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090
from enlightenment next I think that
 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.470

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349
people that I think that will make this
 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.479
people that I think that will make this
inner circle work and and I've met

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489
inner circle work and and I've met
 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:07.949
inner circle work and and I've met
several people whose names I wouldn't

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959

because I don't think they would feel
 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.370
because I don't think they would feel
