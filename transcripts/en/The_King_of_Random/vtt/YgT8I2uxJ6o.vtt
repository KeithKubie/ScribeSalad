00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.069
I just made a laser guided blowgun for under
$3, but don’t let its simplicity fool you.

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.830
It’s powerful enough to break glass, and
even blast darts into concrete. In this project

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.710
we’re making a custom laser sighted blowgun,
that not only looks cool, but adds another

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.070
dimension to the fun you can have, in the
backyard.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.480
Let’s start this project with a roll of
scotch tape, a stack of sticky notes, and

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.199
a paper party hat. I’m using the small 2x2
squares, and if we wrap one carefully around

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.890
the tip of the hat, the cone shape acts as
a forming guide for making a pointy paper

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.089
dart. We’ll need a little bit of tape to
reinforce the tip and hold it altogether,

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:44.769
so when it slides off, it’ll still keep
its conical shape. Now watch what happens

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.179
if we push the tip into a 1/2” PVC tube
and give it a little twist. You can see the

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:53.159
pressure leaves a little mark right where
it starts getting too big for the tube. Let’s

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:56.530
carefully trim along the inside edge of the
marking, and just like that, we’ve made

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.249
a mini paper dart that’ll fit perfectly
inside the blowgun barrel. But it’s not

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:04.940
quite ready to use yet. We still need to add
some weight to the tips so they’ll fly straight.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.430
I found one of the quickest and easiest ways
to do that, is to squirt a little hot glue

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.640
inside the cones until they’re about 1/3rd
of the way full. If you don’t have hot glue,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.530
try pulling off a little piece of poster putty
instead, and shove it down into the tip with

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.820
something like a screwdriver. That’ll work
just as good. Alright, we’ve got some paper

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.310
darts. All we need now is a blowgun, so let’s
work on making that next. I went to the hardware

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.030
store and picked up a 2 foot length of 1/2”
PVC pipe, and a reducing adaptor. This female

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.250
adaptor is 3/4” on one side, and reduces
to a 1/2” slip connector on the other. Now

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.120
if we simply push the adaptor onto the tube
and give it a little tap, we’ve just created

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.340
a super simple blowgun that can be used right
away. You can see the weighted darts fly amazingly

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.090
straight, and will take out paper cups with
an impressive amount of power. They’re just

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.090
strong enough to do a little damage, but still
safe enough to shoot around the house. Not

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.760
that you should. But you could. Alright, let’s
take this system to a whole new level with

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.850
a roll of duct tape, and some wire nails.
I got this roll of camouflage tape from the

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.950
hardware store, and we’ll need to start
by putting a long strip on the table with

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.569
the sticky side facing up. Now watch this.
If we carefully set the pipe lengthwise in

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.280
the center of the tape, then gently rock it
from side to side, the tape will start to

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.249
wrap itself around the tube. Doing the same
thing with a second piece of tape will cover

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:21.069
any gaps, and just like that, our blowgun’s
got a custom camo wrap. Now just add some

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.560
electrical tape around the tip of the barrel
and around the mouthpiece, to cover the rough

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.790
edges and make it look a little nicer. At
this point, you can see our blowgun is starting

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.219
to look pretty serious. So let’s get busy
making some rounds of ammunition that are

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:37.590
a little more serious as well. I’m using
#16 and #18 wire nails, because they’re

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.459
relatively lightweight, and have a nice flat
head on the top. You can see when a nail gets

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.200
pushed through an empty paper cone, it instantly
transforms into a high speed nail dart. It’ll

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.170
work fine just like this, but to make it a
little more durable, try adding a dab of hot

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.920
glue on the inside of the cone, then pulling
down on the nail until the head catches firmly

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.950
at the bottom. They’ll need about 2 minutes
for the glue to cool and harden, so while

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.529
we’re waiting, why don’t we try making
something a little different. A stack of colored

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:05.180
sticky notes will make different colored darts,
and just for fun I snipped the tips off these

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.829
purple ones and drove small screws deep into
the glue. I call these ones my glass breakers,

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.639
and you’ll see how they got that name in
just a minute. Now if you wanna experiment

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.840
with different types of darts, you can really
use any length of nail you want. Smaller darts

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.629
will be easier to shoot, and fly faster, while
heaver darts will penetrate deeper and do

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.260
more damage. Now that we’ve got some good
ammunition, we’re gonna need a way to

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.340
store it. I found a 6” length of 1/2”
foam pipe insulation for a little over a dollar,

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.109
and tried cutting little donut shapes off
the end, about 3/4” thick. I used some electrical

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:39.090
tape to reinforce the outside of the disc,
then just for looks, used a black marker to

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.629
color the foam a little bit darker. The next
step is to make another foam disc the exact

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.919
same way, then slide both of them onto the
barrel of the blowgun. At this point, we’re

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:52.069
ready to modify the quiver so it’ll carry
8 rounds of ammunition. I found a phillips

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.379
head screwdriver and carefully heated it over
a flame for about 20 seconds. That get’s

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.329
it just hot enough to burn little holes into
the foam on contact. Just make sure you’re

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.469
only burning holes in the top disc because
we’re gonna want the bottom one left

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:07.999
intact. You can see the 8 holes we made space
the darts evenly, and guide the nails as they

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:12.769
push down into the padding below. These makeshift
quivers keep all the darts securely in place,

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:17.269
while protecting the tips of the darts at
the same time. Alright, our customized blowgun

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.350
is looking pretty impressive, and we could
stop here. But let’s go one step further,

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.580
and give it a laser. I picked up a red laser
pointer from the dollar store and hot glued

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.110
it 8-1/2” back from the tip of the barrel,
then reinforced it with a couple of zip ties,

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.780
for durability. The thing I like best about
these $1 lasers are how one button operates

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.010
an LED flashlight, while the other activates
the laser sight, making this system operable

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.310
in the dark. Now I got a slightly better laser
from the pet section of the grocery store

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.810
and turned it into a custom laser scope that
compliments the gun really well. With this

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.610
setup, the position of the laser can be fine
tuned with amazing precision, which you can

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.370
see, results in surprisingly accurate shots.
Alright, now that we’ve got a custom, laser

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.080
guided blowgun, let’s have some fun. I took
mine outside and found that the darts easily

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.680
penetrate into wooden posts with out even
trying. They’ll also stick into tree trunks,

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.400
or completely abuse the side of a wooden deck,
like the one on my kids playhouse. I was able

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.410
to hit some targets from over 100 feet away,
and if I missed, the darts just sailed right

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.950
into the concrete wall behind it, which actually
blows my mind completely. I still don’t

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.410
really know how these stick into cinderblock,
but they do. For one last experiment, I tried

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.910
loading one of the glass breaker rounds, and
fired at a glass full of water. Needless to

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.190
say, they do live up to their name. Now you’ve
probably realized that if you use different

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.120
rolls of tape, you can customize your blowgun
any way you want, and if you want a safer

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.920
kind of ammo, try using colored mini marshmallows.
They’re the perfect fit for 1/2” PVC,

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:46.430
and can be shot safely, but still with incredible
accuracy. Well now you know how to make an

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.870
incredible, laser guided blowgun, that will
rattle off nail darts with power and precision.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.930
The best part is, if you make these in bulk,
they can cost as little as $2.50 each. And

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.490
that’s including the $1 laser. Well that’s
it for now. If you liked this project perhaps

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.530
you’ll like some of my others. Check them
