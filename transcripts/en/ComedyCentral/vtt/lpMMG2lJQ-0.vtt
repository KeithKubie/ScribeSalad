- So I cupped my balls,

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:08.641

00:01:13.172 --> 00:01:16.375
- I had a major transformation
in my life three years ago.

00:01:16.408 --> 00:01:18.311
I don't know
if you can see this scar

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:19.912
I have on my forehead.

00:01:19.945 --> 00:01:22.548
Uh, the lines that go
like that are wrinkles.

00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:24.317
But this one is a scar.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.153
I've been a heavy drinker and
heavy partier my whole life.

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:31.124
And three years ago,
I was so drunk in Philadelphia,

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:32.592
I blacked out

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:34.127
and fell off of a barstool
like a tree,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.762
and busted my head open
on a tile floor.

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:38.397
And once my head hit
the ground,

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.233
I was wide awake.
And there was blood everywhere.

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.568
And some guy grabs my arm
and he lifts me up,

00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:46.405
and he yells out to the bar,
we gotta call an ambulance!

00:01:46.438 --> 00:01:49.108
I went, fuck that,
I don't have health insurance.

00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:51.944
Don't you dare call
an ambulance.

00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:53.746
He goes,
you gotta get to a hospital.

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:55.515
I'm like, how far is
the nearest hospital?

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:57.316
He goes, two blocks.

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:00.686
Two blocks and you were
gonna call an ambulance?

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.122
That's like $15,000, man.

00:02:03.155 --> 00:02:05.424
So I got a wad of napkins
off the bar,

00:02:05.457 --> 00:02:07.126
and I walked to the hospital.

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.495
And after I walked that first
block, I said to myself,

00:02:09.528 --> 00:02:13.533
7,500.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.038
But I have not drank

00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:22.041
or done drugs
in three years, everybody.

00:02:22.074 --> 00:02:26.345
And I want you to know--
I want you to know,

00:02:26.378 --> 00:02:30.449
I want you to know the way I
used to feel about cocaine

00:02:30.482 --> 00:02:33.819
is how I now
feel about donuts.

00:02:33.852 --> 00:02:35.821
I mean, I won't go out
chasing after it,

00:02:35.854 --> 00:02:39.692
but if a friend's got a bag,
I'll have a taste.

00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:42.028
Mmm, maple bar.

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:47.033
Mmm-mmm.

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:48.901
So I was thinking about
times in my life

00:02:48.934 --> 00:02:50.703
I was really fucked up.

00:02:50.736 --> 00:02:53.206
Five years ago,
I was in Galway, Ireland.

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.674
And I was so drunk,

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:56.075
I woke up in
the middle of the night

00:02:56.108 --> 00:02:58.144
in my hotel room
to go to the bathroom.

00:02:58.177 --> 00:03:01.013
And I went into the bathroom,
and the door closed behind me.

00:03:01.046 --> 00:03:03.015
But what had
actually happened was,

00:03:03.048 --> 00:03:06.719
I was out in the hallway, and
I was locked out of my room.

00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:09.922
And I don't know if any of you
have ever been naked and drunk,

00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:13.926
and had to approach
the front desk for another key,

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.929
but I thought you should
show some humility, you know.

00:03:16.962 --> 00:03:19.065
So I cupped my balls,

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:20.733
and I walked
with my knees together

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:24.237
to show that I was
from a good family.

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:28.841
Got to the front desk
and the guy goes,

00:03:28.874 --> 00:03:32.211
hey, man, this is Ireland,
that happens all the time.

00:03:32.244 --> 00:03:36.182
Shake it off, kid.
Walk with your dick out.

00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:38.517
Be proud.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.253
So I think the biggest blunder

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:42.888
that ever happened to me from
drinking was 15 years ago.

00:03:42.921 --> 00:03:45.224
I was in Hong Kong doing shows.

00:03:45.257 --> 00:03:47.393
And I stayed at
the Shangri-La Hotel,

00:03:47.426 --> 00:03:51.097
the nicest hotel I have
ever stayed at in my life.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.198
Beyond five-star.

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:54.033
Opulent luxury.

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:55.968
And I had never been
to Hong Kong before.

00:03:56.001 --> 00:03:58.304
So the first day I was there,
I just walked and walked,

00:03:58.337 --> 00:04:00.973
and soaked the city in
with my eyeballs.

00:04:01.006 --> 00:04:02.275
And when I went back
to my hotel room

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:03.409
at the end of the day,

00:04:03.442 --> 00:04:04.944
they had put a goldfish

00:04:04.977 --> 00:04:07.046
in a little goldfish bowl,
in my room.

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.248
And there was a note next
to it, and it said,

00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:13.419
"Traveling is sacred, but
no one deserves to be alone."

00:04:13.452 --> 00:04:16.922
[crowd aww's, laughs]

00:04:16.955 --> 00:04:21.427
That's why we provided
this friend, the goldfish,

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.964
to keep you company
during your stay here.

00:04:24.997 --> 00:04:27.099
Two nights later, Fatboy Slim

00:04:27.132 --> 00:04:30.002
is doing a concert on the
Kowloon side of the harbor.

00:04:30.035 --> 00:04:32.605
I love Fatboy Slim.
I got tickets.

00:04:32.638 --> 00:04:34.940
The audience was
the most beautiful,

00:04:34.973 --> 00:04:36.409
fashionable Chinese people.

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:37.610
They looked like they had
fallen out of

00:04:37.643 --> 00:04:39.178
fashion magazines.

00:04:39.211 --> 00:04:41.514
And Fatboy Slim
was electrifying that night.

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:44.016
And I was just dancing with
all these beautiful people.

00:04:44.049 --> 00:04:46.185
And I got really,
really drunk that night.

00:04:46.218 --> 00:04:48.621
And somehow,
in the middle of the night,

00:04:48.654 --> 00:04:51.190
back in my hotel room,

00:04:51.223 --> 00:04:54.160
I shit the bed.

00:04:58.497 --> 00:05:02.335
I was drunk and half asleep,
and I thought it was a fart.

00:05:05.971 --> 00:05:07.473
And I blew it out,

00:05:07.506 --> 00:05:10.509
and this wet-ass pee
went all over the bed.

00:05:10.542 --> 00:05:12.144
And I was just shamed, man.

00:05:12.177 --> 00:05:14.780
I had never shit a bed
before in my life.

00:05:14.813 --> 00:05:16.482
Really, I felt terrible
about this.

00:05:16.515 --> 00:05:18.451
So the next day
I left the hotel early,

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:22.121
without making eye-contact
with the housekeeping staff.

00:05:22.154 --> 00:05:24.156
And I walked around
all afternoon.

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:27.526
And I went back to my hotel
room at the end of the day.

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:29.662
They had taken
my goldfish away.

00:05:29.695 --> 00:05:32.432
[crowd aww's and laughs]

00:05:33.565 --> 00:05:36.335
No one deserves to be alone,
except for you,

00:05:36.368 --> 00:05:40.206
you creepy,
bed-shitting weirdo.

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:43.843
You know what's funny
about that

00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:45.411
is that story happened to
me 15 years ago,

00:05:45.444 --> 00:05:48.347
and I did not even tell
my closest friends.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.649
And I damn sure wouldn't have
told that story on stage,

00:05:50.682 --> 00:05:52.318
'cause I was single before.

00:05:52.351 --> 00:05:53.919
Maybe I wanted to meet
a nice girl after the show,

00:05:53.952 --> 00:05:55.988
and do a little [kissing].

00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:57.556
Now I'm married.
I don't give a fuck.

00:05:57.589 --> 00:06:00.092
I shit a bed, y'all.

00:06:00.125 --> 00:06:03.028
Shit all over
that motherfucker.

00:06:03.061 --> 00:06:04.697
