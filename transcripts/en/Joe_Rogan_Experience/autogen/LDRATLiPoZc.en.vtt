University of Louisiana came up with a

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460
University of Louisiana came up with a
 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.370
University of Louisiana came up with a
theory that said that something smaller

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380
theory that said that something smaller
 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.230
theory that said that something smaller
than a Jovian mass would not be strong

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240

enough to perform this task they believe

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460
enough to perform this task they believe
 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.490
enough to perform this task they believe
that there's something up to 25% of them

shield could wreak havoc on earth yeah

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380
shield could wreak havoc on earth yeah
 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.370
shield could wreak havoc on earth yeah
yeah but that's it's it's it's it's

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380
yeah but that's it's it's it's it's
 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.249
yeah but that's it's it's it's it's
inventing a lot to explain something you

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259
inventing a lot to explain something you
 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:16.880
inventing a lot to explain something you
don't know

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890
don't know
 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.620
don't know
right so it's inventing more of what you

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630
right so it's inventing more of what you
 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.530
right so it's inventing more of what you
don't know that could be true to explain

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540
don't know that could be true to explain
 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.429
don't know that could be true to explain
what you don't right that which you

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439
what you don't right that which you
 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.929
what you don't right that which you
don't have any other evidence to support

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939
don't have any other evidence to support
 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.410
don't have any other evidence to support
so it's fun speculation fun speculation

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420
so it's fun speculation fun speculation
 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.630
so it's fun speculation fun speculation
but beyond that to say oh it's real it

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640
but beyond that to say oh it's real it
 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.210
but beyond that to say oh it's real it
must be happening no no it's just let

looked into the actual planets that we

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720
looked into the actual planets that we
 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.010
looked into the actual planets that we
absolutely know a real not that much but

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020

got do you realize that if you fall into
a black hole you will see the entire

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600
a black hole you will see the entire
 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.810
a black hole you will see the entire
future of the universe unfold in front

all right yeah you know why are we
 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.820
all right yeah you know why are we
wasting time talking about whether the

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830
wasting time talking about whether the
 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.860
wasting time talking about whether the
Saturn 5 rocket I mean because we're

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870
Saturn 5 rocket I mean because we're
 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.020
Saturn 5 rocket I mean because we're
fascinated by shit that's unproven look

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030
fascinated by shit that's unproven look
 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.030
fascinated by shit that's unproven look
mysterious shit look I got a broken

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040
mysterious shit look I got a broken
 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.750
mysterious shit look I got a broken
brain ok there's a reason for me
