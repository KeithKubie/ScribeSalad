00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440
 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.260
Now you might have
seen this demo before.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.590
It's one we've featured on
the channel a few times.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.940
But you get a big,
strong neodymium magnet

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.540
like this and a nice
thick-walled aluminium tube.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.589
And it takes a surprisingly
long time to fall through.

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:27.130
Now the explanation
for that is to do

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.349
with how the magnet induces
electric currents in the tube.

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.390
And those currents have
their own magnetic field.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.639
And those two magnetic fields
interact with each other

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:36.890
to create a force.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.530
I go into a bit more detail
with that explanation in one

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.571
of the other videos if
you're interested in that.

00:00:40.571 --> 00:00:43.350
But if I do it again
and look down the tube,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.100
I can see the magnet
isn't actually

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.682
touching the sides at all.

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:49.390
So there's an interesting
question there,

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.030
which is what would happen
to the weight of the tube

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.820
if I were measuring it while the
magnet was falling through it?

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.570
Would it increase?

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.340
Would it decrease?

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.842
What would happen?

00:00:58.842 --> 00:01:00.800
And there's only one way
to find out the answer

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.870
to that question, and
that's to do the experiment.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.350
So I got my balance.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.200
And first of all, I
need to protect it

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.470
from the intensely strong
magnet that I've got here.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.990
So a roll of tape, and I'm
going to put the tube on,

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.250
and let's see what happens.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.314
 

00:01:27.314 --> 00:01:27.980
So there you go.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.650
The weight went up
to about 370 grammes.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.790
And it did that while
the magnet was falling.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.331
And it hasn't really
gone up any more

00:01:34.331 --> 00:01:39.470
now that the magnet is resting
on the plastic at the bottom.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.380
So there's the answer.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.319
The weight does go up.

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.110
The effective weight
of the tube does go up

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.500
with a magnet
falling through it.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.040
So why is that?

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.940
Why does that happen?

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.850
Well, to answer that
question, you kinda

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.380
need to understand a little
bit about what weight is.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.877
So weight is a force.

00:01:57.877 --> 00:01:59.460
In particular, it's
a force that makes

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.001
things accelerate
towards the ground.

00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:05.270
So if I take this ball of
string here and let go, [THUMP],

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.000
when I release it, it
accelerates towards the ground.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.389
Now the flip side of that
is that whenever anything

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.880
isn't accelerating towards
the ground, when this

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.249
pen on the table with
the aluminium tube,

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:16.790
whenever anything
isn't accelerating,

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.206
that means there must be another
force, another force that

00:02:19.206 --> 00:02:21.140
is supporting the
weight of that object.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.590
So with me, the floor
is supporting my weight

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.120
and I'm not
accelerating anywhere.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.078
So when the magnet is
falling through the tube,

00:02:27.078 --> 00:02:28.780
the fact that it's
not accelerating

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.030
means that something must
be supporting its weight.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.480
And that force in fact is
the magnetic interaction

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.450
between the magnet
and the currents

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.590
that are set up in the tube.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.026
But we know from
Newton's Third Law,

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:42.650
if there's a force acting on the
magnet supporting it's weight,

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.834
there must be an equal force
acting downwards on the tube.

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:51.130
And that force is what is being
transmitted through the tube

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.130
into the balance.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.990
And that's what we read on
the display of the balance.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.780
And sure enough, if we measure
the weight of the magnet now,

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.670
we can see, surprise,
surprise, the weight

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.250
it's reading is
that 370-odd grammes

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.490
that we saw reading
while the magnet was

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.750
falling through the tube.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:28.128
