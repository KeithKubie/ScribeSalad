00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.830
All right, we're doing the
California Standards released

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.530
questions in geometry now.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:06.990
And here's the first question.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.120
It says, which of the following
best describes

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.330
deductive reasoning?

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.420
And I'm not a huge fan of when
they ask essentially

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.890
definitional questions
in math class.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.950
But we'll do it and hopefully
it will help you understand

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.070
what deductive reasoning is.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.380
Although, I do think that
deductive reasoning itself is

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.380
probably more natural than the
definition they'll give here.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.360
Well, actually before I even
look at the definitions, let

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.300
me tell you what it is.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.670
And then we can see which of
these definitions matches it.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.650
Deductive reasoning is, if I
give you a bunch of statements

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.140
and then from those statements
you deduce, or you come to

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.380
some conclusion that you
know must be true.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:54.070
Like if, I said that
all boys are tall.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.000
If I told you all
boys are tall.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.780
And if I told you that
Bill is a boy.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.790
Bill is a boy.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.430
That's two separate
words, a and boy.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.580
So if you say, OK, if these two
statements are true, what

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.420
can you deduce?

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.220
Well I say well, Bill is a boy
and all boys are tall.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.160
Then Bill must be tall.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.820
You deduced this last statement
from these two other

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.880
statements that you
knew were true.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.090
And this one has to be true
if those two are true.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.630
So Bill must be tall.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.540
That is deductive reasoning.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.170
Deductive reasoning.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.790
Bill must be tall, not Bill
must be deductive.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.250
So anyway, you have some
statements and you deduce

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.920
other statements that must
be true given those.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.580
And you often hear
another type of

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.850
reasoning, inductive reasoning.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.330
And that's when you're given a
couple of examples and you

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.580
generalize.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.305
Well, I don't want to get too
complicated here, because this

00:01:55.305 --> 00:01:56.810
is a question on deductive
reasoning.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.830
But generalizations often
aren't a good thing.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.080
But if you see a couple of
examples and you see a pattern

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.540
there you can often extrapolate
and get to a kind

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.070
of broader generalization.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.080
That's inductive reasoning.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.979
But that's not what they're
asking us about this.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.310
Let's see if we can find the
definition of deductive

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.000
reasoning in the California
Standards language.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.510
Use logic to draw conclusions
based on accepted statements.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.520
Yeah, well actually that
sounds about right.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.130
That's what we did here.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.760
We used logic to draw
conclusions based on accepted

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.320
statements, which
were those two.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.800
So I'm going to go
with A, so far.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.260
Accepting the meaning of a
term without definition.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.630
Well, I don't even know
how one can do that.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.200
How do you accept the meaning of
something without it having

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.210
being defined?

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.650
Let's see, so it's not B.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.990
I don't think anything
is really B.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.820
C, defining mathematical
terms to correspond

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.420
with physical objects.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.980
No, that's not really
anything related to

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.810
deductive reasoning either.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.060
D, inferring a general truth
by examining a number of

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.040
specific examples.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.290
Well, this is more of what
I had just talked about,

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.870
inductive reasoning.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.270
So, they want to know what
deductive reasoning is, so I'm

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.780
going to go with A.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.770
Use logic to draw conclusions
based on accepted statements.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.330
Next problem.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.290
OK, let me copy and paste
the whole thing.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.996
Copy and paste is essential with
these geometry problems,

00:03:29.996 --> 00:03:32.750
we won't have to redraw
everything.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.230
OK, in the diagram below, angle
1, and this right here,

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.510
you should learn,
means congruent.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.110
When you say two angles are
congruent, so in this case

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.200
they're saying angle 1 is
congruent to angle 4, that

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.990
means that they have the
same angle measure.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.240
And the only difference between
congruent and being

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.210
equal is that congruent says
they can have the same angle

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.040
measure, but they could be
in different directions.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.440
And the rays that come out
from them could be of

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.380
different lengths.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.370
Although I'd often say
that's equal as well.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.160
But if we're dealing
with congruency,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.800
that's what it means.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.110
It essentially just means the
angle measures are equal.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.560
So we could draw that here.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.030
Angle 1 is congruent
to angle 4.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.740
It just mean that these angle
measures are the same.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.019
Whether we're measuring them
in degrees or radians.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.230
All right, now what do they
want us to come to a

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.760
conclusion?

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.400
Which of the following
conclusions does

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.550
not have to be true?

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.480
Does not have to be true.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.430
Not.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.640
Angles 3 and 4 are supplementary
angles.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.890
What does supplementary mean?

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.620
That means that angle
3 plus angle 4 have

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.740
to be equal to 180.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.660
This is the definition of
a supplementary angle.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.250
Supplementary.

00:04:48.965 --> 00:04:51.320
So angles 3 and 4, they're
actually opposite angles.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.150
And you can play with these.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.195
If you had these two lines and
you kind of changed the angle

00:04:55.195 --> 00:04:57.870
at which they instersect, you
would see that angles 3 and 4

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.680
are actually going to
be congruent angles.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.880
They're always going
to be equal to

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.930
each other in measure.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.610
So they are equal
to each other.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.620
And if angle 4 is, we don't
know what it is.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.450
If angle 4 is 95 degrees,
then angle 3 is also

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.270
going to be 95 degrees.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.790
If angle 4 is 30 degrees,
angle 3 is also

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.120
going to be 30 degrees.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.890
So I can think of a bunch of
cases where this will not be

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.260
equal to 180.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.820
The only way that this would be
equal to 180, angle 3 plus

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.470
angle 4, is if angle 4 were a
90 degree angle, and angle 3

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.570
were also a 90 degree angle.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.020
But they don't tell us that.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.240
All they tell us is that angle 4
and angle 1 are the same, at

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.020
least when you measure
the angles.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.710
So I would already
go with choice A.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.000
That does not have to be true.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.050
That'll only be true
if both of those

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.000
angles were 90 degrees.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.790
Let's see, line L is
parallel to line M.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.700
That's true.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.160
If that angle is equal to this
angle, the best way to think

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.490
about it is, this angle is also
equal to, and you could

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.910
watch the videos on the
angle game that I do.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.620
We do this quite a bit.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.850
But opposite angles are equal.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.710
And that should be intuitive
to you at this point.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.380
Because you can imagine that if
these two lines, if I were

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.620
to change the angle at which
they cross, no matter what

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.670
angle I do it at, that's
always going

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:15.970
to be equal to this.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.640
So angle 1 is going to
congruent to angle 2.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.970
And if these two lines are
parallel, if L and M are

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.970
parallel, then 2 and 4 are
going to be the same.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:26.770
Or you can think of
it the other way.

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.080
If 4 and 1 are the same, and 1
is the same as 2, then that

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.330
means 4 is the same as 2.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.020
And if 4 and 2 are the same,
then that means that these two

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.350
lines are parallel.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.540
So this is definitely true.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.400
Angle 1 is congruent
to angle 3.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.170
Once again, if angle 1 is
congruent to angle 4, so those

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.220
two are congruent, and angle
3 is congruent to angle 4,

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.880
because they're opposite
angles.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.780
Or instead of saying congruent,
I could say equal.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.080
If this is equal to this, and
this is equal to this, then

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.120
this is equal to that.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.350
All right.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:10.420
And then, the last one,
2 is congruent to 3.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.070
2 is congruent to 3.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:21.070
Well, by the same logic, if 1 is
congruent to 4, and since 1

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.440
and 2 are opposite, it's
also the same as 2.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.470
And 4, because it's opposite of
3, it's congruent to that,

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.180
all these angles have to
be the same thing.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.640
So 2 and 3 would also
be congruent angles.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.170
So all of the other ones must
be true, B, C and D.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.635
So A is definitely our choice.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.530
Next problem.

00:07:44.916 --> 00:07:48.630
Let me copy and paste it.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:49.880
OK.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.200
Consider the arguments below.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:01.310
Every multiple of 4 is even,
376 is a multiple of 4.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:03.800
Therefore, 376 is even.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.030
Fair enough.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.990
A number can be written
as a repeating

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:09.060
decimal if it is rational.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.730
Pi cannot be written as
a repeating decimal.

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.120
Therefore, pi is not rational.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.920
Which ones, if any, use
deductive reasoning?

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.300
OK, so statement one, every
multiple of 4 is even.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.250
376 is a multiple of 4.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.270
So this is deductive
reasoning.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.680
Because you know that every
multiple of 4 is even.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.059
So you pick any multiple of
4, it's going to be even.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:34.530
376 is a multiple of 4.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:35.530
Therefore, it has to be even.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.250
So this is correct logic.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.620
So statement one is definitely
deductive reasoning.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.590
Let's see, statement
number two.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:43.429
A number can be written
as a repeating

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:45.800
decimal if it is rational.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:54.000
So if you're rational, that
means that you can write it as

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.250
a repeating decimal.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.330
That's like 0.33333.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:00.650
That's 1/3.

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:02.175
That's all they mean by
a repeating decimal.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.010
But notice, this statement right
here, a number can be

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:11.510
written as a repeating decimal
if it is rational.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:17.050
That doesn't say that a
repeating decimal means that

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:17.610
it's rational.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.720
It just means that a rational
number can be written as a

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.740
repeating decimal.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.390
This statement doesn't let
us go the other way.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:24.330
It doesn't say that a repeating
decimal can

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.500
definitely be written as
a rational number.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:30.840
It just says that if it is
rational, a number can be

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.330
written as a repeating
decimal.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:33.510
Fair enough.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.110
And then it says pi
cannot be written

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.000
as a repeating decimal.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.590
Pi cannot be written as
a repeating decimal.

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:44.890
So if pi cannot be written
as a repeating

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:47.180
decimal, pi be rational?

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:52.450
Well if pi was rational, if pi
was in this set, if pi were

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:56.730
rational, then you could write
it as a repeating decimal.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:57.954
But it said that you
cannot write it

00:09:57.954 --> 00:09:58.840
as a repeating decimal.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.460
So therefore, pi cannot
be rational.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.520
Cannot be in the set
of rationals.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.760
So therefore this is also sound
deductive reasoning.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.950
So both one and two use
deductive reasoning.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:14.060
As far as I know.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:14.710
I'm out of time.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.490
See you in the next video.
