00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:03.237
- I've been thinking on this
notion of political courage

00:00:03.237 --> 00:00:04.320
this weekend.

00:00:05.628 --> 00:00:07.346
In particular about some
of the men and women

00:00:07.346 --> 00:00:09.134
who were elected to Congress

00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:13.384
the same year I was
elected to the White House.

00:00:13.384 --> 00:00:16.384
Many of them were new to Washington.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.675
Their entire careers ahead of them.

00:00:20.675 --> 00:00:23.438
And in that very first term,

00:00:23.438 --> 00:00:26.967
they had to take tough
vote after tough vote

00:00:26.967 --> 00:00:29.823
because we were in crisis.

00:00:29.823 --> 00:00:32.633
They took votes to save
the financial system

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:37.184
and the economy even when
it was highly unpopular.

00:00:37.184 --> 00:00:39.645
They took votes to save the auto industry,

00:00:39.645 --> 00:00:43.812
when even in Michigan people
didn't wanna see bailouts.

00:00:44.684 --> 00:00:47.680
They took votes to crack
down on abuses on Wall Street

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.280
despite pressure from lobbyists

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.530
and sometimes their donors.

00:00:54.622 --> 00:00:59.011
And they found themselves in
the midst of a great debate.

00:00:59.011 --> 00:01:03.376
A debate that had been
going on for decades.

00:01:03.376 --> 00:01:05.141
A debate that the Kennedy family

00:01:05.141 --> 00:01:08.141
had participated in and helped lead.

00:01:09.855 --> 00:01:11.271
A debate about whether a nation

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:14.313
as wealthy as the United States of America

00:01:14.313 --> 00:01:17.262
would finally make health
care not a privilege

00:01:17.262 --> 00:01:19.762
but a right for all Americans.

00:01:20.977 --> 00:01:24.144
(audience applauding)

00:01:26.062 --> 00:01:29.081
And there was a reason
why health care reform

00:01:29.081 --> 00:01:31.831
had not been accomplished before.

00:01:32.703 --> 00:01:33.703
It was hard.

00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:38.462
It involved 1/6 of the economy

00:01:38.462 --> 00:01:42.212
and all manner of
stakeholders and interests.

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:47.633
It was easily subject to misinformation

00:01:47.633 --> 00:01:49.133
and fearmongering.

00:01:50.768 --> 00:01:53.369
And so by the time the vote came up

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.503
to pass the Affordable Care Act,

00:01:56.503 --> 00:02:00.219
these freshman congressmen
and women knew that

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.386
they had to make a choice.

00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:06.976
That they had a chance to insure millions

00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:09.321
and prevent untold worry,

00:02:09.321 --> 00:02:12.738
suffering, and bankruptcy and even death.

00:02:15.103 --> 00:02:17.541
But that this same vote would likely

00:02:17.541 --> 00:02:19.708
cost them their new seats,

00:02:21.953 --> 00:02:24.953
perhaps end their political careers.

00:02:27.967 --> 00:02:31.844
These men and women did the right thing.

00:02:31.844 --> 00:02:33.844
They did the hard thing.

00:02:35.234 --> 00:02:37.556
There's was a profile in courage.

00:02:37.556 --> 00:02:39.112
Because of that vote,

00:02:39.112 --> 00:02:41.504
20 million people got health insurance

00:02:41.504 --> 00:02:43.826
who didn't have it.

00:02:43.826 --> 00:02:47.993
And most of them (audience applauding)

00:02:51.303 --> 00:02:54.470
and most of them did lose their seats.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.806
They were true to what President Kennedy

00:02:56.806 --> 00:02:58.896
defined in his book

00:02:58.896 --> 00:03:02.379
as a Congressional profile in courage,

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.978
desire to maintain a
reputation for integrity

00:03:05.978 --> 00:03:09.215
that is stronger than a
desire to maintain office.
