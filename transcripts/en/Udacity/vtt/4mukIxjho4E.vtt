00:00:00.309 --> 00:00:02.906
You maybe surprised by some of the traits that you can learn

00:00:02.906 --> 00:00:07.463
about through your DNA. Those include eye color, hair color and whether you

00:00:07.463 --> 00:00:11.929
have a preference for sweet or savory foods, how well you metabolize

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.669
caffeine and whether you are at risk for a disease such as diabetes.

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:18.097
&gt;&gt; And there are a lot of traits that we know a

00:00:18.097 --> 00:00:20.067
lot of about. And I want you to hold on to the

00:00:20.067 --> 00:00:22.827
trait that you out in, and as we go through the course,

00:00:22.827 --> 00:00:25.442
see what you learn about it And if not much is known

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:28.887
yet about the trait you have in mind, maybe 23 me can conduct a

00:00:28.887 --> 00:00:33.310
research with your help to figure out the connection between DNA and your trait.
