[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:04.370
GOPI KALLAYIL: Good afternoon.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.720
It's my pleasure,
privilege, and honor

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.840
to welcome, to the Googleplex,
Chris Anderson, head of TED

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.460
and the author of the new book
"TED Talks-- The Official TED

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.850
Guide to Public Speaking."

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.740
Chris Anderson
studied at Oxford.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.532
And he studied politics,
economics, and philosophy,

00:00:23.532 --> 00:00:25.490
and went on to work in
a variety of news media.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.550
And at that point,
goes no indication

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.360
in his background
of, eventually,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.220
a career revolving around
technology or public speaking.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:41.110
In 2001, his foundation acquired
a little-known technology

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.810
conference called TED.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.690
And over the years,
what Chris and his team

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.020
has done has transformed it one
of the most powerful vehicles

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.370
we know of today for bringing
to light compelling ideas that

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.230
actually change many
things in humanity,

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.960
in society, in our
social condition,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.650
through short, well-articulated
talks by some of the leading

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.370
thinkers, original thinkers.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.470
And what Chris and
his team have really

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.200
done through this process is
creating this amazing brand

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.350
that serves up powerful
ideas in thousands of videos,

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.360
on talks that you
can see in person,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.180
or through digital media,
more than a billion views

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.150
every single year.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.830
And this has given Chris
this amazing opportunity

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.360
to understand, what
is it that makes

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.710
for a good talk that
is well-delivered,

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.850
well-articulated.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.390
He's had the ringside view
of watching thousands of them

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.100
over the years, working with
thousands-- tens of thousands--

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.630
of speakers, and drawing,
from them, the best of ideas,

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.130
and presenting it to us.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.260
And therefore, it is really
a privilege and an honor

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.110
to hear from one of the best
purveyors of this art of how

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.560
to deliver a well-articulated
talk, something

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.320
that intimidates, baffles,
mystifies most of us.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.080
So here to explain how to
do it perfectly and get

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.247
a billion views to
each of your own talk,

00:02:09.247 --> 00:02:10.830
please help me welcome
Chris Anderson.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.770
CHRIS ANDERSON: Thank you.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.090
Thank you.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.580
Thank you so much, Gopi.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.960
Thanks, guys, for coming out.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.380
As a group of
employees, your work

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.295
is probably as consequential as
any group of employees anywhere

00:02:27.295 --> 00:02:29.970
in the world, so it means
a lot that you've come out

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.910
for the next hour or so.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.400
However, it's
possible some of you

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.160
are here under a bit
of a misapprehension.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.250
It would be perfectly
reasonable to assume

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.580
that the guy who just
published "The Official TED

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.160
Guide to Public Speaking"
would, himself, be

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.412
a great public speaker.

00:02:46.412 --> 00:02:48.120
So I think I need to
start by telling you

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.640
something that happened in
Pakistan a few years ago.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.540
I went there.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.410
I gave a talk.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.410
I was born in Pakistan.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.270
And so after the talk, I was
excited to rush online and see

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.510
what our countrymen
had to say about it,

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.950
just how enthusiastically
they had reacted.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.360
And this is what I read.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:12.706 --> 00:03:15.590
Ouch.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.790
Even worse was what
happened the first time

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.130
I stepped onto the TED stage.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.435
I'm just going to show you
a picture from back then.

00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:23.560
If you're feeling squeamish,
please cover your eyes

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.284
right now.

00:03:26.284 --> 00:03:29.360
Now, believe it or
not, this is a man

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.640
trying to build a natural human
connection with his audience

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.380
while wearing a wrinkled white
t-shirt, a dorky haircut,

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.400
and so nervous he
can't even stand.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.130
So if we could please
agree, I'm actually not

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.720
a natural public speaker.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.450
And so of course, in
preparing this book,

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.950
I had to figure out
a way of turning

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.650
this bug into a feature.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.840
And so my argument became,
listen, if this awkward plunker

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.440
right here can
somehow find a way

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.270
to occasionally give a talk
that is semi-effective,

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.980
everyone can.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.590
That's the argument in the book.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.050
And funnily enough,
even this talk,

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.660
with all its
cringe-worthy faults,

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.005
actually did turn out to
be somewhat effective.

00:04:14.005 --> 00:04:15.630
And if I may, I'd
just like to tell you

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.100
what happened that
day, because it

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.850
does go to the heart
of what's in the book

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.260
and what I want to
share with you now.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.270
So this was 2002.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.430
Back then, there were no
TED Talks on the internet.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.840
Ted was this once-a-year
private conference.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.820
And this took place three
months after my foundation

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.570
had bought that conference.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.580
It was the last
conference being hosted

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.690
by Ted's founder, Richard
Saul Wurman, who's

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.130
this charismatic figure.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.370
His personality really
infused every part of TED.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.420
And I discovered, to my horror,
that pretty much the entire TED

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.020
community assumed that
when he went, TED was dead.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.605
It could not survive him
going-- reasonable assumption.

00:04:59.605 --> 00:05:02.510
And unfortunately, when you
looked at the ticket sales

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.790
for the next year, it was clear.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.830
TED usually sold out
a year in advance,

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.160
800 passes, no problem.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.970
At this point, despite
my best marketing efforts

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.580
as the new owner, I had managed
to sell a grand total of 70.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.630
So I was actually feeling
pretty sick about this.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.120
And I thought I had one
chance, one chance only

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.130
to try and persuade the
community to come along.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.020
And so I took a deep
breath, and rolled my chair

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.990
to the front of the stage,
and began making my case.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.250
And 15 minutes later,
when I stopped speaking,

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.280
three people stood up
and started clapping.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.600
And then suddenly, everyone
was standing and clapping.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.960
And an hour after
this talk, 200 people

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.740
paid the big bucks to by a pass
to the next year's conference.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.170
And suddenly, I'm like,
this is going to be OK.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.130
What on earth happened?

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.780
How did that happen?

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.724
Well, it certainly
wasn't the t-shirt.

00:05:59.724 --> 00:06:01.640
I think there were a few
basics that happened.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.230
So first of all, I used
my terror of the occasion

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.830
as motivation to
really prepare for it.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.440
I knew what I wanted to say,
and I spoke from the heart

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.080
with passion.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.810
And there was actually,
despite-- let's

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.760
get rid of that, yeah--
there was-- despite that,

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.020
there was something of
a human connection built

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.610
through a bit of humor and
through a story of a business

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.597
failure that I'd
just been through.

00:06:24.597 --> 00:06:26.430
None of that, though,
was the biggest thing.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.310
I think the biggest
thing was this--

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.485
I think, during that 15 minutes,
a strange object germinated

00:06:31.485 --> 00:06:36.200
and grew inside the minds
of everyone listening,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.560
an object called an idea.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.290
In this case, it
was the idea that

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.520
the cross-disciplinary
sharing of knowledge

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.260
that happened at TED
actually really mattered.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.720
It was the key to
collaboration and innovation,

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.364
couldn't be allowed to die.

00:06:52.364 --> 00:06:53.780
And in fact, I was
therefore going

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.820
to convert TED to a nonprofit,
operate it for the public good.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.140
So that one idea was enough
to persuade people that even

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.980
without a charismatic host,
TED was going to be just fine.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.686
They wanted to be part
of TED's next chapter.

00:07:07.686 --> 00:07:11.580
And so this is the thing,
it's all about the idea.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.650
Your sole job,
really, as a speaker,

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.450
it's not to entertain,
or tell a story,

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.650
promote your organization,
your cause, whatever.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.280
It's to give your
audience a gift,

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.410
a gift in the shape of
an idea that you transfer

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:29.490
from your mind to theirs,
an idea about something that

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.040
matters.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.180
Because if you can do that, you
are changing their world view.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.810
You are actually
potentially changing

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:42.330
who they are, their behavior
many years into the future.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:43.940
But what is an idea anyway?

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.140
Well, they come in all
sorts of shapes and sizes.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.830
I mean, really, an
idea is anything

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.896
that changes how
you see the world

00:07:50.896 --> 00:07:52.770
and how you're going to
respond to the world.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.990
Ideas can be analytical,
aesthetic, complex, simple.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.730
Here are some that have been
shared on the TED stage.

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:07.390
You know, if you could picture
these ideas as they physically

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:11.280
exist in your
mind, they actually

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.040
probably represent this
tangle of literally millions

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.560
of neurons constructed
in a strange pattern.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.900
And the fact that
that entire pattern

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.260
can be transferred
wholesale to people

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.390
listening in just a few minutes
strikes me as a real miracle.

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.810
How on earth can that happen?

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:33.919
Well, the truth is
it often doesn't

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:35.820
happen very effectively.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.280
It's hard for it to happen.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.091
Most talks are a bust.

00:08:40.091 --> 00:08:41.549
I want to share
with you, if I may,

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:45.210
a TED Talk I found
on the internet.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.810
In this case, it's Ted Poe.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.264
He's a congressman from Texas.

00:08:50.264 --> 00:08:51.305
And here he is in action.

00:08:51.305 --> 00:08:51.971

sponsor this domestic violence

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.950

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.430
I want to commend
Judge Green for working

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.053
with me on this issue.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.760
CHRIS ANDERSON: I mean, one
tip that's not in the book is,

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.190
if you're going to give a
really dull talk on a really

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:11.920
important topic
live on television,

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.110
don't put your grandson
in the row behind you.

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:15.512
Don't do that.

00:09:15.512 --> 00:09:17.967
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:29.010
I mean, this poor kid, this
kid stands for all of us

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.030
in much public speaking, right?

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:35.510
I mean, whether it's politics,
business, church, university,

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.480
so much of it is boring.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.550
And so nothing happens.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:42.120
There is no actual
communication.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.270
It's a kind of tragedy.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:46.300
How do you break
through that boredom

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.760
and land an idea in
a way that matters?

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.000
Well, there's no
one way to do it.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.740
There actually are
no rules about this.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.260
There's certainly no formula.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:01.350
What I think there are are tools
that you can pick and choose

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.330
from to make the
talk that you want.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.060
And these tools are teachable.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.600
And if I may, I'd like to show
a few of them to you in action.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.140
So here's one.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.490
You don't have to begin
the first few minutes

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.960
saying how very, very
deeply honored you are

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.178
and thanking everyone in sight.

00:10:18.178 --> 00:10:20.370
You know, it's nice to
do, but for most people

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.530
in the audience, that's just
not the interesting thing.

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:27.110
And we are all-- as you, of all
people, know more than anyone--

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.910
we're living in
an attention war.

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.020
And you contain, on
your laps right now

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:36.740
and in your pockets,
these dangerous weapons,

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:41.360
lethal weapons called
smartphones or laptops.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.650
Once those are out and use,
your chance of being effective

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:48.190
are gone, you know?

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:51.830
So you kind of have to try and
grab people from the start.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.860
I want to show
you Maysoon Zayid.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.190
She's a comedienne.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.370
She suffers from
cerebral palsy due to

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:00.220
a botched medical
procedure at birth.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:04.860
She walked up onto the TED stage
literally shaking and swaying,

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.360
but she opened
her talk this way.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.026
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:07.026 --> 00:11:11.220
-My name is Maysoon
Zayid, and I am not drunk,

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.500
but the doctor who
delivered me was.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:14.120
[END PLAYBACK]

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:14.994
CHRIS ANDERSON: Boom.

00:11:14.994 --> 00:11:15.740
Right?

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:16.260
Brilliant.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.125
She owned us with
a single sentence.

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.670
BJ Miller, from San
Francisco, began a talk

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:27.326
about redesigning death
with a whole lot of life.

00:11:27.326 --> 00:11:28.280
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:33.240
-Well, we all need
a reason to wake up.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.610
For me, it just
took 11,000 volts.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:36.194
[END PLAYBACK]

00:11:36.194 --> 00:11:37.818
CHRIS ANDERSON: That's
a wonderful man,

00:11:37.818 --> 00:11:38.960
a wonderful talk.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.594
Artists can do this too.

00:11:40.594 --> 00:11:41.260
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.600
-You want to take a closer look.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.730
There's more to this
painting than meets the eye.

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:50.780
And yes, it's acrylic
painting of a man.

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.540
But I didn't paint in on
canvas, I painted it directly

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.454
on top of the man.

00:11:56.454 --> 00:11:57.527
[END PLAYBACK]

00:11:57.527 --> 00:11:59.610
CHRIS ANDERSON: So I'm not
saying that, literally,

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:01.276
in the first sentence,
you have to smack

00:12:01.276 --> 00:12:02.436
people between the eyes.

00:12:02.436 --> 00:12:04.560
But I really do think that,
within the first minute

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.120
or so of speaking, you need to
give people a sense of where

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.790
you're heading with
your talk and why

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.500
they should come with you.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.070
I mean, after all,
if you're going

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:15.650
to build an idea
in someone's mind,

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:17.450
people are naturally
a little skeptical

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:21.335
about allowing a stranger to
poke around inside their brain.

00:12:21.335 --> 00:12:22.710
At first, they
need to find a way

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.490
of trusting you a little bit.

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:26.590
Well, how do you do that?

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:33.915
Well, you can do it lots of
ways, anecdotes, bit of humor,

00:12:33.915 --> 00:12:34.920
a bit of vulnerability.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:39.340
But just looking at people
like this is a key part of it.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.490
Your eyes have
extraordinary powers.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:43.530
When two humans
look at each other,

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.710
their minds are
literally syncing up.

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:49.520
So don't give your talk with
you eyes buried in your notes

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.080
or out into some middle space.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.480
Find a few friendly
faces in the audience.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.310
Talk to them conversationally.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:57.420
Makes all the difference.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.940
It's so powerful
when you do that.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.990
Now, our minds are
wired to love stories.

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:08.450
Goes back to
hundreds of thousands

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:10.440
of years around campfires.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.240
And stories can make
or break many a talk.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.180
So when Monica
Lewinsky came to TED,

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:20.710
she came under a
mountain of fear,

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:23.080
obviously because
of the humiliation

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:26.450
she had suffered
in her early 20s.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:30.469
Now, a single story, in
her case, worked its magic.

00:13:30.469 --> 00:13:31.135
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:31.135 --> 00:13:37.620
-At the age of 41, I was
hit on by a 27-year-old guy.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:42.680
He was charming, and I was
flattered, and I declined.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.370
You know what his
unsuccessful pick-up line was?

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:49.135
He could make me feel 22 again.

00:13:49.135 --> 00:13:52.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.580
[END PLAYBACK]

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.110
CHRIS ANDERSON: So
that single story

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.950
told Monica that the
talk was going to be OK.

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:03.430
And it told the audience that
this was going to be great

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:05.263
and that everyone was
actually going to have

00:14:05.263 --> 00:14:07.690
a good time listening to her.

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.880
But talks don't just have to be
about letting everyone relax.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.770
They can actually set up your
idea beautifully as well.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:18.110
So here's Ernesto Sirolli.

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.360
He wanted to give a talk
about the power of listening,

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.900
the importance of listening.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:25.310
And so he started with a story
about what happens when you

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:26.500
don't.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:31.060
The setting here is a
fertile valley in Zambia

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.294
and a development aid
project that went wrong.

00:14:33.294 --> 00:14:33.960
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.800
-Everything in Africa
grew beautifully,

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.600
and we had these
magnificent tomatoes.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.660
In Italy, a tomato will grow
to this size, in Zambia,

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.420
to this size.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.740
And we could not believe.

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:45.250
And we were telling
the Zambians,

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.630
look how easy agriculture is.

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:51.300
When the tomatoes were nice,
and ripe, and red, overnight,

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.980
some 200 hippos came
out from the river,

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:55.075
and they ate everything.

00:14:57.945 --> 00:15:02.490
And we said to the Zambians,
my god, the hippos.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:04.810
And the Zambians
said, yes, that's why

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:06.280
we have no agriculture here.

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:10.000
[END PLAYBACK]

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.874
CHRIS ANDERSON: So from
that, obviously, it's

00:15:11.874 --> 00:15:15.520
really natural to go on and
begin explaining your idea.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.650
Because when you build an
idea in someone's mind,

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:21.824
the explanation is the
tool that allows that.

00:15:21.824 --> 00:15:23.240
That's really what
explanation is,

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.810
and it's pretty hard to do well.

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:27.780
It's amazing that
we can do it at all.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.410
The key to it is to
remember that you

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:32.750
are building from
elements that are already

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.817
in your audience's mind.

00:15:34.817 --> 00:15:36.400
So you're using the
power of language,

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.140
but it's not your
language, your jargon.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.840
It's their language,
their concepts.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.870
That's the only
way this can work.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:47.940
And one of the key tools
to make it effective

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:50.230
is to use metaphors, to
find the right metaphor.

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:51.950
Because what a
metaphor does is it

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:56.450
shows the shape of how these
elements are to fit together.

00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:00.300
Let me describe science
writer Jennifer Kahn to you.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:00.980
She came to TED.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:08.110
She wanted to explain this
hard topic, CRISPR, right,

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:09.090
and what that was.

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:11.620
It was a very important
new biotechnology.

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:16.890
She said, it's as if you had a
word processor for the genome.

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:21.090
You can cut and paste any gene
or any letter as you wish.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.560
So we know what a
word processor is.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:28.400
You suddenly immediately get
the power of this technology.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.010
So metaphors are crucial,
and examples really

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:34.560
matter as well, because
they cement an explanation.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.140
You think you get it.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:37.390
You tell an example.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:42.920
And then it really lands, and
that cements it into place.

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.765
But if explanation
is the building

00:16:44.765 --> 00:16:48.170
of an idea in someone's
mind, persuasion first

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:49.690
requires a little demolition.

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:51.690
You have to take
down something that's

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:56.540
there that needs to be
replaced by better ideas.

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.170
And so one of the keys
to persuading, I think,

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:02.400
is to show people the
implausibility, maybe

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:06.230
the absurdity of the idea that
you're trying to take down.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:09.410
Here's master persuader
Dan Pallotta in action.

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:11.640
He was trying to
persuade us that we

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:15.540
should rethink how much we pay
people who work for nonprofits.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.310
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:18.319
-We have a visceral
reaction to the idea

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:22.304
that anyone would make very
much money helping other people.

00:17:22.304 --> 00:17:24.970
Interesting that we don't have a
visceral reaction to the notion

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:28.210
that people would make a lot of
money not helping other people.

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.100
You know, you want
to make $50 million

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.752
selling violent video
games to kids, go for it.

00:17:32.752 --> 00:17:34.710
We'll put you on the
cover of "Wired" magazine.

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:36.700
But you want to make a
half a million dollars

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.408
trying to cure kids
of malaria and you're

00:17:38.408 --> 00:17:40.990
considered a parasite yourself.

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.507
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:43.507 --> 00:17:44.090
[END PLAYBACK]

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:45.881
CHRIS ANDERSON: I mean,
if you can pull off

00:17:45.881 --> 00:17:48.040
a rhetorical home
run like that, people

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:52.960
are going to remember your
talk for a very long time.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.200
Now, the stakes can
be high at a talk.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.210
And so many speakers
assume it's OK just

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:00.690
to come and wing it-- a
couple of bullet points,

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.000
I'm good to go.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.410
Actors rehearse.

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:05.780
Musicians rehearse.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.010
Speakers should rehearse.

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:10.950
For a talk that matters,
they absolutely should.

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:13.710
Tim Urban gave an amazing
talk at the last TED

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.180
about procrastination.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.380
It was hilarious.

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.260
It was very insightful.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.720
And three weeks before, when
he came to the TED offices

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.114
to give us a preview,
it wasn't that great.

00:18:25.114 --> 00:18:26.030
The talk wasn't there.

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:27.000
It wasn't ready.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.840
Tim used his experience
there, the stressful, horrible

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.650
experience that that
was, as motivation

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:36.502
to go through a
bunch of rehearsals.

00:18:36.502 --> 00:18:38.710
And what he came up with in
the end was mind-blowing.

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:40.660
So I'm going to do
something a little cheeky

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.410
and show you some
before and after footage

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:45.940
of Tim Urban in action.

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.980
So this starts in the TED
offices, ends on the TED stage

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.700
where he tells this story of
how, after procrastinating

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.670
for a full year
on his thesis, he

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:55.724
had to write the whole
thing in three days.

00:18:55.724 --> 00:18:56.390
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:56.390 --> 00:19:02.130
-So the thing about--
don't want to go there yet.

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:05.130
So there's
micro-procrastination,

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:08.070
as we talked about, and then
there's macro-procrastination.

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:11.860
But the fact about them is
they both have the same cause.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:15.790
So the next 72 hours is a blur
during which I wrote 90 pages

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:19.490
and ran, full speed,
diving head first,

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:21.180
to hand it in just
at the deadline.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.250
And I thought that was
the end of everything.

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:27.360
But a week later, I get a
call, and it's the school.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.910
And they say, is this Tim Urban?

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:30.190
And I say, yeah.

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.730
And they say, we need to
talk about your thesis.

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:35.000
I say, OK.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.300
And they say, it's the
best one we've ever seen.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.702
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:47.640
That did not happen.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.432
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:49.432 --> 00:19:53.746
It was a very, very bad thesis.

00:19:53.746 --> 00:19:54.975
[END PLAYBACK]

00:19:54.975 --> 00:19:56.600
CHRIS ANDERSON: I
mean, that difference

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.370
between complete
ownership of a talk

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:03.560
and being owned by the talk,
you know, it's night and day.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.805
And the difference between
those two is rehearsal.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:11.860
So how do you
actually give a talk?

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.010
I mean, there are so
many ways to do it.

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:15.827
A lot of TED Talks
are given like this,

00:20:15.827 --> 00:20:17.410
just standing in
front of an audience.

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:20.750
There's a vulnerability to this.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.280
And there's actually
power in that,

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.850
because audiences respond
to that vulnerability.

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:28.700
But some people find that
a little nerve-wracking,

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.410
and they'd rather
have a lectern.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:32.840
Maybe they've got things
they need to refer to.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.640
We used to be not
OK with that at TED.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:36.770
I'm now fine with it.

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:39.210
Some of the speakers
still look up and connect.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.720
Or you could walk a bit
if that helps you think.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.090
Sometimes it's good
to take a moment just

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.940
to pause between walking
so that a point can land.

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.806
Actually, sitting is fine too.

00:20:50.806 --> 00:20:54.600
The late, great Oliver Sacks
give a wonderful talk seated.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.510
And then again, why not
leap around the stage

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:59.760
if the mood takes you?

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.260
There's no one way to do it.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.640
What matters is
finding your way.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.190
Because here's the thing,
when all is said and done,

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:11.630
there is only one thing that
matters in giving a talk.

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:15.910
It's having something worth
saying, and therefore,

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:19.410
finding the way of saying it
which is authentic to you.

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:25.770
It was 10 years ago
that something happened,

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:28.560
and this is ground zero for it.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.640
It was the flickering
into life of online video,

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.670
cheered on by a small army
of kittens, admittedly.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.350
But most people at
the time, for sure,

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:41.920
thought it was a
kind of a gimmick.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:46.380
I see it now as public
speaking's Gutenberg moment.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.300
From this moment, a
speaker's words and ideas

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.820
could ripple out across
the internet to thousands,

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:54.370
maybe millions of people.

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:57.080
And that meant that
this ancient art

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.594
the was forged around
our ancestors' campfires

00:21:59.594 --> 00:22:00.635
could suddenly go global.

00:22:00.635 --> 00:22:03.110
It could suddenly scale.

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:05.210
So that is what has
sparked, I think,

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:07.600
a Renaissance in
public speaking.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.230
It's suddenly so much
more worth everyone's time

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:12.830
to figure out how
to do this well.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:19.190
So I think you could
make the case that there

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:22.610
is a new skill for the
21st century that all of us

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:25.580
need to pay really
close attention to.

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:29.240
The name I've given it in the
book is presentation literacy.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:33.940
I think of it as public speaking
adapted for the internet age,

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:37.170
and I really believe it should
be taught in every school.

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:41.590
I don't think our kids are going
to spend that much time writing

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.497
letters to the editor or
preparing written resumes.

00:22:44.497 --> 00:22:47.080
I think they're going to present
themselves directly on video.

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:55.430
I don't know what your
theory of change is.

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:59.130
I do believe that a single
idea can change the world.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:09.930
I mean, I do, but not, not, not
if it stays in a single mind.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:11.550
For a change to
happen, that idea

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:15.520
has to leak out from
that mind to dozens

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.280
of other people, perhaps
hundreds of other people,

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.740
perhaps millions
of other people.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:24.380
This is the miracle of human
culture, human society,

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:30.720
that we can do this, that we
can reimagine a different way

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.830
and share it.

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:35.860
And if enough people believe
in that different way

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:40.530
and get excited about it,
that's when change happens.

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:42.650
And so it's communication,
but communication

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:47.100
that shows the import of
what is being communicated.

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:50.930
And so often, that is done
best by this ancient human tool

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:55.640
of looking, standing, waving
arms, persuading, where people

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.420
can feel the passion,
and the emotion,

00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:00.930
and why it matters,
and feel that pulse of,

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:02.475
yeah, you know what, I get that.

00:24:02.475 --> 00:24:03.600
And that matters to me too.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.230
And I'm in.

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:06.750
And I'm going to
be part of this.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:09.150
And the tragedy
of the present is

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:11.770
that, so often, the
conversation is dominated

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:13.660
by people who
actually don't have

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:16.310
ideas that are that insightful.

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:19.810
And so many of the people who do
have something really important

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:23.920
to share don't share it,
either because they're just not

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.610
confident in how to do
it or they're literally

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:29.300
fearful of public
speaking overall.

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.770
So I would so love
this to change.

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:34.660
You guys are among the
smartest in the world.

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:37.560
Many of you have ideas
that are literally

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.975
capable of shaping the future.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.090
Share them.

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:47.570
They won't probably
have their full impact

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:50.670
unless you find the
courage and the means

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:52.890
to show why they
matter, and to really

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:57.229
explain them, and bring along
with other people with you.

00:24:57.229 --> 00:24:58.770
And by the way, it
doesn't have to be

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:02.810
this amazing new algorithm,
or some scientific discovery,

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:03.930
or whatever.

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:05.480
I actually think
this also applies

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.820
in natural human settings.

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.860
A wedding, the next
wedding you go to,

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.540
share a moment of
meaning or joy.

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:14.550
It can connect people in a
way that's really beautiful

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:16.370
and gives us all a
little bit of hope.

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:19.740
The way I see it,
we humans are still

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:23.130
huddled around a campfire,
it's just that the campfire

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:26.260
spans the whole planet.

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.030
There it is.

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:28.340
Here we are.

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.360
And maybe there's this moment
where it's time for you

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.220
to-- [CLEARING THROAT]--
clear your throat,

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:35.940
find the courage to
stand, and speak.

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.360
I very much hope you do.

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.745
Thank you so much.

00:25:38.745 --> 00:25:42.125
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:42.622 --> 00:25:44.080
GOPI KALLAYIL: So
thank you, Chris.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.770
It was both hugely
entertaining and fascinating

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:48.830
and very thought-stimulating.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.567
And you started off
by saying that one

00:25:51.567 --> 00:25:53.150
of the most important
things in a talk

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:56.370
is a powerful idea you
want to communicate.

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:58.730
And one of the most
powerful ideas I took away

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:00.430
is that even with
all of the technology

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:03.640
advancements, human beings still
communicate most effectively

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.470
by standing in front of the
campfire, waving their arms.

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:08.440
And the campfire's now global.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.500
So many of the people
in this audience--

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.810
not everyone-- wants
to be a TED speaker,

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:16.000
but pretty much
everyone wants to be

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.740
an effective communicator.

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:20.130
They all have amazing ideas.

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:23.150
So what is one thing that
you would ask this audience

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:26.350
to do based on the book
and the vast experience,

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:30.247
start doing tomorrow,
to start the journey?

00:26:30.247 --> 00:26:31.830
CHRIS ANDERSON: Well,
especially here,

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:34.700
in a room full of
brilliant technologists,

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:40.570
it's, don't forget the
human side of this.

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:42.294
We are who we are.

00:26:42.294 --> 00:26:43.960
We're incredibly
sophisticated machines.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.220
We don't understand
fully how we work.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:50.010
We don't understand the level
of complexity and nuance

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:54.460
that happens in face-to-face
human communication.

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:58.670
It's wild how many
signals are exchanged.

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:01.280
It's wild to me that
when you put two humans

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.070
and have them just
look at each other

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:06.360
that their brains are
literally syncing up.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.760
And so it's possible
to forget that

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:14.120
and to just assume that if you
email someone an obvious point

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.590
that, duh, it's done.

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:18.690
No, persuasion, it
takes time, and there's

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:19.740
a human piece to it.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.750
And people need to
want to come along.

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:25.300
We're not very rational, logical
people a lot of the time.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:28.120
It's in there, but
it needs teasing out.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.100
So that means it's
worth learning

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:34.020
the nuances of
explanation and persuasion

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:36.030
and figuring out how
to do it the right way.

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:38.990
But I do think everyone
can learn to do this.

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:42.160
And I think the fear
of public speaking

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.960
is-- it's understandable
why it's there.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.520
It's because we're
a social species,

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:50.520
and we're worried
about humiliation.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.089
But you can get past that.

00:27:52.089 --> 00:27:54.130
GOPI KALLAYIL: But the
problem, as you indicated,

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:55.697
is nobody teaches this formally.

00:27:55.697 --> 00:27:57.280
You said we should
have it in schools,

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:58.580
a form of communication.

00:27:58.580 --> 00:27:59.810
So it is not formally taught.

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:02.740
And you arrive, as
adults, in a workplace

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:05.970
and realize that, I'm not
that effective at getting

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:06.779
my ideas across.

00:28:06.779 --> 00:28:08.320
So how does one
learn it in the midst

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:12.067
of their career-- besides
reading the book, of course.

00:28:12.067 --> 00:28:13.650
CHRIS ANDERSON: Well,
that would help.

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:15.580
I thank you.

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:19.600
No, I think you learn by
doing and by starting small.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:24.570
I mean, literally giving
a talk to your smartphone

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:28.000
in your bedroom is a good start,
because you will learn things

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:28.690
about yourself.

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:30.773
And you'll go, oh my, do
I really sound like that?

00:28:30.773 --> 00:28:33.260
And am I actually doing that?

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:34.940
So you can start there.

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:36.715
Talk to a few friends.

00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:40.210
If you can have a dinner party,
invite people around, and make

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:42.320
a case or tell a
story effectively,

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.200
then you can public speak.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:50.860
But it all comes from repetition
and from taking it seriously.

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:56.810
It's definitely not easy to--
without real preparation--

00:28:56.810 --> 00:29:00.750
to just stand up and speak
from a few bullet points.

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:02.140
A few people can do that.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.714
Usually, that goes
horribly wrong.

00:29:04.714 --> 00:29:06.630
GOPI KALLAYIL: And this
is where, in the book,

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:08.338
I think, one of the
most important points

00:29:08.338 --> 00:29:10.267
to make is the
need to practice--

00:29:10.267 --> 00:29:11.100
CHRIS ANDERSON: Yes.

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:12.350
GOPI KALLAYIL: --and rehearse.

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:13.660
CHRIS ANDERSON: I think so.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:14.650
I think so.

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:18.780
Obviously, it depends on
the stakes of the talk.

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.930
But do the calculation.

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:24.930
Say there's 100 people
coming to listen.

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:25.940
Who are they?

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:29.290
How much time are they
investing in this?

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:33.200
Well, it's worth your putting
in a fair fraction of that time

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:33.770
to prepare.

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:35.590
It's only fair.

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:39.180
If you're going to account for
100 person-hours of humanity's

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:42.002
time, you better put in a few
of your own in preparation.

00:29:42.002 --> 00:29:43.710
And if the talk's
being recorded and it's

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:46.220
going to go out to
another 5,000 after,

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.900
well, multiply that up again.

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:52.980
So I think that's part of
it, is just being respectful

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:55.544
of the time that's out there.

00:29:55.544 --> 00:29:57.460
GOPI KALLAYIL: So you
say that even before you

00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.251
start practicing, you
should have something

00:29:59.251 --> 00:30:03.920
worthwhile to say that makes
it meaningful for the listeners

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.000
to spend their time.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.180
And most people struggle
with, how do I identify.

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.840
What is it that I
want to communicate?

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.240
What is my life's mission?

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.698
You know, articulating,
do you have

00:30:11.698 --> 00:30:14.210
a formula for unearthing that?

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:17.510
CHRIS ANDERSON:
Definitely no formula.

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:19.190
So the trap, right,
is that you're

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:22.330
excited about the idea of
speaking without having

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:23.440
something good to say.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.280
And we're certainly very
allergic to this at TED,

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:30.430
of the people who really
want to be a TED Talks star,

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:34.380
but without the actual
content that matters.

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:38.110
But here, no one
would be in this room

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:42.420
if they weren't
remarkable in some way.

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:46.930
And so it's finding the piece
that you want to focus on.

00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:48.840
Usually, the problem
is that people

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.680
want to try and say
too much in a talk.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.910
What is almost always more
effective is to pick one thing

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:59.870
and go deeper into it so that
you can say why it matters.

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:01.040
You can explain it.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.290
You can give examples.

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:07.990
You can show the implications of
it and where it might lead to.

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:11.160
That's what makes a talk land.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:14.020
And if you really
don't know what

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.850
you should be speaking about,
then don't speak until you do.

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:21.110
But it is worth having honest
conversations with friends

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:24.920
and trying to say-- because
we only see ourselves

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.780
from the inside, right?

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:29.171
You can be a remarkable
person and not

00:31:29.171 --> 00:31:31.670
know that you're remarkable,
because you've always been you.

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:32.910
Isn't anyone like this?

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:34.320
No, actually, everyone's not.

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.960
You're special.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:40.166
But with an honest friend,
you can figure that out.

00:31:40.166 --> 00:31:41.540
GOPI KALLAYIL:
With that in mind,

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:42.600
I'm going to ask
you a question then.

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.910
I'll give you the option to
say, I pass on this one if you

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:45.417
don't.

00:31:45.417 --> 00:31:47.750
Since you said that when
you're in front of an audience,

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:49.980
you should have something
meaningful and important

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:53.430
to say, how would you rate our
current presidential candidates

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:54.090
on that index?

00:31:57.390 --> 00:32:00.010
CHRIS ANDERSON: Well,
TED is nonpartisan,

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:04.002
but what I will say is this,
is that one of the first rules

00:32:04.002 --> 00:32:05.960
of public speaking-- if
there is a rule, if one

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.050
of the first
guidelines, principles--

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:11.599
is to start where
your audience are.

00:32:11.599 --> 00:32:12.640
A talk is like a journey.

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.598
You start where they are,
and you persuade them

00:32:14.598 --> 00:32:16.040
to come with you on a journey.

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:19.170
Donald Trump has been
masterful at doing that.

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:23.130
He spotted what many of the
politicians didn't spot,

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:27.920
which is just how much fear
and anger there is out there.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.790
And he started with them.

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:30.990
He's right there.

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:33.260
Like, everyone felt,
for the first time,

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:35.717
here's a politician who gets me.

00:32:35.717 --> 00:32:37.300
That's extraordinarily
powerful, and I

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:40.030
think that goes a long way to
accounting for the momentum

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:41.740
that he's had.

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:46.250
But there are many other
pieces to public speaking.

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:50.470
There's explanation of a
complex topic or policy.

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:53.100
There's sharing a vision
for the future that

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:55.800
is inspiring and hopeful.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:00.390
There's persuading people to
tap into their better selves.

00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:04.220
And you know, I think
different politicians out

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:09.840
there have different abilities
in both those elements,

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:12.637
and also, just in
different settings.

00:33:12.637 --> 00:33:14.095
So I think public
speaking is going

00:33:14.095 --> 00:33:16.890
to be incredibly important
over the next six months.

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:19.050
It may determine
all of our future.

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:21.390
And it's not going to
be just the politicians.

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:26.800
We're in this age where any
citizen can record themselves,

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.960
and a point they want to
make, and their own passion

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.140
and humanity.

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:34.980
And on a technology like
YouTube or whatever,

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:39.480
that can explode across
America and the world,

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.990
and may well change
how people react.

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:45.120
We're all in this.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:49.531
GOPI KALLAYIL: So if that is
the case, in many of the talks

00:33:49.531 --> 00:33:52.030
or many of the examples that
you just showed us and you talk

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:53.863
about in the book,
people talk with the kind

00:33:53.863 --> 00:33:55.710
of ideas that come
from sociology

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:57.626
and the human
condition, psychology.

00:33:57.626 --> 00:33:59.250
One of the challenges
for this audience

00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:02.260
here is the topics that
they're most passionate about,

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:04.330
that they're best equipped
to talk about might

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:07.550
be highly technical.

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:11.030
How do you take a very
arcane, technical topic

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:13.382
and make it come alive?

00:34:13.382 --> 00:34:14.840
CHRIS ANDERSON: So
there definitely

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:20.440
may be some topics deep in
AI, or machine learning,

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:25.370
or whatever that are really
hard to, in 18 minutes,

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:27.469
communicate to a
general audience.

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:31.070
But here's what I believe
is, no matter who you are,

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:35.375
it's really important that
we are able to communicate

00:34:35.375 --> 00:34:37.500
to each other why we're
passionate about what we're

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:41.480
doing, and why it matters,
and what other people

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.050
should understand about it.

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:48.530
So it's not necessarily all the
details, but the implications

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:52.770
and how it fits into the rest
of what's going on actually

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:53.699
really matter.

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:57.900
So something like AI, it's
such an important topic

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:01.650
for the future of the world,
both in the most thrilling ways

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:03.490
and, if you believe
some scenarios,

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:06.310
in the most terrifying of ways.

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:09.170
And that's a vital
conversation that can't just

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:11.752
be had among technologists.

00:35:11.752 --> 00:35:15.950
The citizens need to be
part of this conversation.

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:19.260
And so people who can
find a way of saying,

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:22.350
this is how you should think
about what we're doing--

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:25.140
the reason why you
shouldn't be terrified

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:29.170
about machine learning is this,
or why you should, is this.

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:32.340
And find that way or
framing it using metaphors,

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:35.380
using whatever means
you can to make

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:37.210
it accessible to a
general audience.

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:40.160
I think that's really
important, and people need

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.469
to figure out how to do that.

00:35:41.469 --> 00:35:42.510
GOPI KALLAYIL: Brilliant.

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:44.051
And one of the
stories I really liked

00:35:44.051 --> 00:35:46.240
in the book that
alludes to that point

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:50.170
is Richard Turere's case and
the fact that he said just

00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:52.689
about anybody can
be a public speaker.

00:35:52.689 --> 00:35:53.980
But I'm still quite fascinated.

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:56.160
On the one hand, you
have Sheryl Sandberg.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:59.590
Obviously, a senior executive
at a big public corporation

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:01.120
does a lot of speaking.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.030
But tell us the
arc of that story

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:06.390
where you find a 12-
or 13-year-old boy

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:10.410
in the Maasai who also
had a piece of technology.

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:13.110
But war is survival.

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:15.347
And then you brought
him onto the TED stage.

00:36:15.347 --> 00:36:17.680
CHRIS ANDERSON: So my colleague
Kelly Stetson and I were

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:20.800
on a global tour
looking for new ideas,

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.350
new speakers to bring to TED.

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:25.410
And in Nairobi,
we were introduced

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:30.500
to this terribly shy Kenyan boy
who was cowering in the corner.

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:34.090
And he grew up in
a Maasai village

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:37.920
helping his family look
after their flocks.

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.600
And they had this lion
problem where they

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:42.210
were being taken out by lions.

00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:43.870
And he'd often been
out in the night

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:46.860
trying to frighten
them away with fire.

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:48.955
But he used the
power of technology

00:36:48.955 --> 00:36:49.830
to solve the problem.

00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:52.220
He taught himself
electronics by kind

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:54.780
of dismantling
his parents' radio

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:57.680
and somehow figured
out a way to construct

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.700
using this-- I think
he found a motorcycle

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:03.730
indicator, and some solar
cells, and whatever.

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:07.876
He made this get-up that flashed
lights at different points,

00:37:07.876 --> 00:37:10.500
because what he'd discovered was
that what frightened lions was

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:12.970
not light, but moving light.

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:15.600
And so he built this
device, and it worked.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:19.180
And so instead of villages going
out and hunting down the lions,

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:20.300
they were fine.

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:23.300
And this invention
spread to other villages.

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.584
And so we were dying
to bring him to TED,

00:37:25.584 --> 00:37:26.500
but he was so nervous.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.550
And he could hardly speak.

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:32.230
And yet when you just took a
bit of time with him and said,

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:35.160
piece by piece, tell us,
Richard-- and you would find,

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:36.840
suddenly, his face
would light up

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:40.170
with some moment of
excitement that had happened.

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:41.570
And you go, that's it.

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:44.800
If you can say that,
say it that way.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.140
You have no idea how
powerfully people

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.430
are going to respond to you.

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:52.310
And so he'd won a scholarship
to a school in Kenya

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:53.710
because of this invention.

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:56.830
And they allowed him to
give several practice

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:58.844
talks, which is all part of it.

00:37:58.844 --> 00:38:00.760
And then he got on a
plane for the first time,

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.349
and came to Long
Beach, California,

00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:05.015
and gave this TED
Talk slotted somewhere

00:38:05.015 --> 00:38:08.300
between Bill Gates
and Sergey Brin.

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:10.149
And he kind of came
up to the stage,

00:38:10.149 --> 00:38:11.190
and looked up, and spoke.

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:13.797
And then he burst into
this million-dollar smile.

00:38:13.797 --> 00:38:15.630
And the whole audience,
their hearts melted.

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:17.910
And at the end of
this story, they

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:19.510
all just stood up and cheered.

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:20.990
It was an amazing thing to see.

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:23.187
So yes, if he could do it,
anyone can give a talk.

00:38:23.187 --> 00:38:24.520
GOPI KALLAYIL: Anyone can do it.

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:26.620
So that is a fantastic
example, but it also

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:28.830
attracts a criticism
that TED often gets,

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:31.320
that the audience
and the speakers

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:35.170
are very elite,
where they come from.

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:36.300
And this is one exception.

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.820
So how do you-- if your concept
is ideas worth spreading,

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:42.250
good ideas accessed
in all population,

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:44.000
not necessarily among
an elite community--

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.950
how do you democratize
TED as a movement.

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:48.950
CHRIS ANDERSON:
Well, the criticism's

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:51.790
more relevant to the audience
than to the speakers.

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:53.650
For the speakers,
we genuinely do

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:57.374
try to pull the most
interesting people doing

00:38:57.374 --> 00:38:59.290
powerful work from
whatever part of the world.

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:03.070
Most of the speakers who come
to TED aren't particularly rich.

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:05.540
A lot of them, they're working
in academia, or science,

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:07.370
or whatever.

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:08.380
The audience is rich.

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:12.260
And we see it as our noble duty
to take their money off them

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:15.150
so that we can fund the
rest of what TED does

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:17.190
and distribute
these ideas for free

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:19.130
on the internet for all time.

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:22.420
It's kind of the
Robin Hood model of--

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:23.710
and please don't tell them.

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:24.840
Please don't tell them.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:27.080
Don't mention this to Larry.

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:33.040
But no, the journey of
TED over the last 15 years

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:36.020
has been one of
trying to open it up,

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:38.560
to make these ideas
accessible to everyone,

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.090
because ideas want to be free.

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:42.180
They know no borders.

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.850
They should be shared freely.

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:46.310
And that's what
we've sought to do.

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:50.040
We bring some fellows
to TED who don't pay.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:54.440
We allow people to organize
their own TED-like events

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.680
with a TEDx license
that is free.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:00.910
So we're definitely
aware of the importance

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:05.250
of that, of democratizing this,
because it is for everyone.

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:07.784
GOPI KALLAYIL: And
from that perspective,

00:40:07.784 --> 00:40:09.700
getting everyone, the
whole world, to be great

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:12.620
public speakers is also part
of that mission, I assume.

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:15.652
What I'm leading to is, what
led you to write this book.

00:40:15.652 --> 00:40:16.860
CHRIS ANDERSON: Yes, exactly.

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:21.350
So what led me to write the book
was the belief that ideas are

00:40:21.350 --> 00:40:25.420
everywhere and that we need to
be sharing them, and sharing

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:26.680
them in a human way.

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:31.469
I think everyone's
worried about this world

00:40:31.469 --> 00:40:33.135
where we're all
obsessed by our screens,

00:40:33.135 --> 00:40:34.580
and looking down the whole time.

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:36.674
And we're entering this
sort of text-y world

00:40:36.674 --> 00:40:38.340
that's sort of exciting
and interesting.

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:41.470
But we're worried about the
loss of human connection.

00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:45.652
And I think the
fact that we can now

00:40:45.652 --> 00:40:47.860
connect as humans-- you can
look down at your screen,

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:49.790
and you can see a
human face speaking,

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:55.150
using all this ancient
technology of speech--

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:57.650
I actually find that
really exciting.

00:40:57.650 --> 00:40:59.460
And I'm stunned
at the possibility

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:02.660
of what's happening
over the next five years

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:07.260
through things like Project
Loon and these other initiatives

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:10.150
to take broadband internet
to the entire world.

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:14.330
I think that is
incredibly important.

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:19.480
But it's also kind of
an extraordinary social

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.102
experiment.

00:41:20.102 --> 00:41:22.060
Because we're going to
go, in just a few years,

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:23.990
to people who never
had the internet

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:30.260
to suddenly having anyone in
the world there on their screen.

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:33.900
So I think we need voices
coming from everywhere.

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:37.310
It's not just a few
existing TED-type speakers.

00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:40.180
We want to find the inspiring,
insightful voices wherever

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:42.350
they are on the
planet and help them

00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:44.540
find the way to inspire people.

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:47.070
Because for the first
time in history,

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:48.390
you can inspire lots of people.

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:50.760
If you've got something
worthwhile to say, even

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:54.190
if you live in a village
in Kenya, or wherever

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:58.430
on the planet, you can reach
out to hundreds, thousands

00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:02.340
of people around you
in language and using

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:05.525
examples that are directly,
deeply relevant to them.

00:42:05.525 --> 00:42:06.900
So let's figure
out how to do it,

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.550
because there's so much
at stake in this future.

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:11.969
And if we naively
believe technology's

00:42:11.969 --> 00:42:14.260
going to make a better future,
we're probably mistaken.

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:18.100
We could easily sleepwalk into
a future that we end up hating.

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:19.170
It's all to play for.

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:22.650
And I think by putting
a human, a deeply,

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:25.680
profoundly, and powerful human,
technology at the heart of it,

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.795
there's some hope and
possibility in that.

00:42:27.795 --> 00:42:29.420
GOPI KALLAYIL: And
with those comments,

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:31.120
you've just opened
the Pandora's box.

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.161
So I'm going to ask the
audience, how many of you

00:42:33.161 --> 00:42:36.767
have a powerful idea that you'd
like to speak about at TED?

00:42:36.767 --> 00:42:37.850
CHRIS ANDERSON: All right.

00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:38.010
GOPI KALLAYIL: OK.

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:39.620
We've got about eight people.

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:42.804
What should they do, Chris?

00:42:42.804 --> 00:42:43.970
CHRIS ANDERSON: Write to us.

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:45.540
Tell us, what's the idea?

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:48.310
speakers@ted.com--
make the case.

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:49.420
We get a lot of incoming.

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:52.110
But absolutely,
we're always looking

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:55.840
for the ideas that matter most.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:43:00.360
And in this room, probably more
than most places on the planet,

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:03.470
those ideas probably exist right
now if you could only see them.

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:05.940
If I could go away with a
brain scan of everything that's

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:10.020
going on in this room right now,
I'd probably know the future.

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:10.520
I could.

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:14.305
Who's got a question?

00:43:14.305 --> 00:43:15.580
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:17.250
So my name is Greg.

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:20.180
My question-- so
recently, Barack Obama

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:23.780
said that his greatest regret is
that they failed to communicate

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:26.080
what they were doing
during each crisis,

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:28.966
that they were solving
the next crisis

00:43:28.966 --> 00:43:30.890
and they didn't have time.

00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:32.000
But he made addresses.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.440
And my question is, what would
you have changed to the format,

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:36.730
to the style?

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:40.080
What would you have recommend
they do differently?

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:43.930
CHRIS ANDERSON: Oh gosh, I
wouldn't try, for a minute,

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:45.770
to give any advice
to Barack Obama.

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:52.455
The level of challenges
that modern government faces

00:43:52.455 --> 00:43:55.310
are just extraordinary.

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:58.360
I think it just goes back
to principles though, of,

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:01.140
you have to know
where people are.

00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:01.911
And it's hard.

00:44:01.911 --> 00:44:03.660
We all suffer from the
curse of knowledge,

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:07.420
where you don't
remember what it's like

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:09.040
not to know what you know.

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:10.110
It's a bug.

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:15.500
And to get round it, it just
takes an intense effort.

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:18.844
So that's all you can
do is constantly say,

00:44:18.844 --> 00:44:20.010
what does that person think.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:20.830
What do they really think?

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:21.580
What do they feel?

00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:23.850
How do I recognize that?

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:26.400
And then, build from that.

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.182
But there's no slicks.

00:44:28.182 --> 00:44:29.640
There's no silver
bullet to that's.

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.330
It's hard.

00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:33.430
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name's Blake.

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:34.450
You're a journalist.

00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:36.160
Now, in the course
of my lifetime,

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:39.160
I've seen journalism
change substantially.

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:41.490
When I was a child, there
was a very limited number

00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:43.800
of geographically
limited news sources.

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:47.220
Then cable news was born,
then blogging and Twitter.

00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:50.190
And as it has transitioned
into a much more financially

00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:52.670
competitive environment,
I've seen journalism

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:57.160
go from the admittedly
dryer transmission of facts

00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.570
to a much more exciting
personalized world

00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:01.420
of echo chambers.

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:03.280
Do you see this
trend continuing,

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:06.720
or will journalism shift, yet
again, into something new?

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:10.190
What is the future
of journalism?

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:13.040
CHRIS ANDERSON: Great
and complex question.

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:16.530
I certainly think that
the traditional business

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:18.520
models are challenged.

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:21.460
Like, the notion that you
could build a company that

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:26.460
pays professional wages
to a group of journalists,

00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:29.880
put the output
onto the internet,

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:33.330
get enough traffic
to pay for the--

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:37.200
and therefore ad revenue to pay
for their-- salaries, no one

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.750
is really doing that very
effectively right now,

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:42.620
just that model, simply
because it turns out

00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:44.980
that there are so many
other people out there who

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:45.750
love to write.

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:47.575
There are so many
other choices now

00:45:47.575 --> 00:45:50.110
for what someone could read.

00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:54.600
99% of it is poor, but 1% of
it is actually quite amazing

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:56.130
and often unexpected.

00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:59.210
And that 1% still
dwarfs the total output

00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:01.730
of the paid journalists, so
it's definitely a problem.

00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:05.290
And you've seen business
models like "Huffington Post"

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:09.530
and many others that basically
tap into the mass willingness

00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:16.574
to write for free to make
an effective business model.

00:46:16.574 --> 00:46:18.240
I don't see that, per
se, as going away.

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.710
And I think a lot of
journalists probably

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:22.930
could do with--
imagine themselves

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:26.090
as curators and coaches, and
accepting that they're not

00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:28.670
going to do all the writing,
but that they can filter,

00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:31.490
and they can provide, and
see the journalistic talent

00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:33.790
in other people.

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:36.602
And so certainly if I was
running a traditional news

00:46:36.602 --> 00:46:38.060
site, that's what
I would try to do

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:39.476
is you've got to
find a way to tap

00:46:39.476 --> 00:46:42.440
into the extraordinary
willingness of many people

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:44.690
to participate.

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:46.800
As for the whole
echo chamber bit

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.701
and the whole
personalization bit,

00:46:48.701 --> 00:46:50.200
I think the key
thing that's driving

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:54.020
that is the fact that
these companies are

00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:55.900
running algorithms to
find what are the most

00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:57.832
click-baity stories.

00:46:57.832 --> 00:47:00.290
And that is having the effect
of dragging the internet down

00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:03.110
market faster than
1,000 Rupert Murdoch's.

00:47:03.110 --> 00:47:04.690
It's very distressing, actually.

00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:09.380
And I think what
many people don't

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:12.840
see is-- I think our view
of human nature is wrong.

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:14.690
People see, this is
what people want.

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:17.280
No, it's what people's
lizard brain wants.

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:18.380
People are complicated.

00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:20.295
They have many things
going on in there.

00:47:20.295 --> 00:47:22.420
The lizard brain is one
thing, and the lizard brain

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:25.890
drives that clicking
finger unfortunately.

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:27.230
But it's not the only thing.

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:28.570
It's not the only part
of people's identity.

00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:29.944
And so there's
another whole part

00:47:29.944 --> 00:47:31.590
of the internet,
which is where people

00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:34.080
share based on their identity.

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:39.710
And that is actually
tending to promote much more

00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:42.060
valuable stories, shall we say.

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:47.200
And I think there's huge
power here, actually,

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:50.720
in this company, to shape
what happens online,

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:54.395
and to understand that
humans are complex people,

00:47:54.395 --> 00:47:57.190
and to have a
personalisation strategy that

00:47:57.190 --> 00:48:00.990
is much richer than just what
the damn lizard brain does.

00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:02.630
People's reflective
brains should

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:06.310
be given a chance to shape
what they want to read.

00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:08.560
And that means asking the
question in a different way.

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.976
It means not just observing
what people actually click on.

00:48:10.976 --> 00:48:14.090
It's saying, OK, what kind of
experience can we give you.

00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:17.310
May we have your permission to
sometimes put in front of you

00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:20.700
stuff that might
provoke you and not

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:23.310
just satisfy that little
twitchy finger of yours?

00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:25.290
And I think most
people would actually

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:27.280
say yes that, yes, please.

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:30.660
Save me from my lizard brain.

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:32.340
So I think it's all
to be played for.

00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:38.660
So finally, what I'd say is
that I think journalism, which,

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:45.172
at its best, is the pursuit
of truth, right-- I mean,

00:48:45.172 --> 00:48:47.630
in the knowledge age, there's
hardly a more important thing

00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:48.264
to do.

00:48:48.264 --> 00:48:50.180
And I think it's going
to get funded much more

00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:52.170
by philanthropy in the future.

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:54.480
I think it's a really
noble, philanthropic thing

00:48:54.480 --> 00:49:00.060
to do to finance, for example,
here's the news site which

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:03.180
is shutting out all of
the commercial pressures

00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:04.857
to do stories for
certain reasons.

00:49:04.857 --> 00:49:06.690
We're going to write
the stuff that actually

00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:08.630
matters from whatever lens.

00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:11.225
And I think there's some
great examples of that.

00:49:11.225 --> 00:49:12.850
There's going to be
a lot more of that.

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:13.950
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:15.033
CHRIS ANDERSON: Thank you.

00:49:15.033 --> 00:49:16.747
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name's Jamie.

00:49:16.747 --> 00:49:19.080
Just want to say, first of
all, thanks a lot for coming.

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:20.960
Great talk.

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:23.630
I've been a fan
of TED for awhile.

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:25.860
I actually organized
a TEDx event

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:29.720
while I was at
college, so a big fan.

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:31.950
One of the things I've
noticed though-- and speaking

00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:33.616
to other people, I
think they've noticed

00:49:33.616 --> 00:49:38.020
as well-- you spoke about
the democratization of TED

00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:40.182
and being nonpartisan.

00:49:40.182 --> 00:49:41.900
But one of the
things I have noticed

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:45.390
is that there does seem to be a
pretty strong ideological slant

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:48.780
to the talks that are
on the front page.

00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:54.580
And I wonder if you agree
with that characterization

00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:57.035
and whether you see that as
a challenge or something that

00:49:57.035 --> 00:49:58.955
needs to be addressed.

00:49:58.955 --> 00:50:00.330
Because there may
be a risk there

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:03.850
of it becoming either kind of
humdrum or some people feeling,

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:06.090
in some way, excluded.

00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:07.520
And maybe the
ideas are not truly

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:10.930
challenging you if they come
from a place where there's

00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:13.136
a lot of agreement already.

00:50:13.136 --> 00:50:15.010
CHRIS ANDERSON: It's a
great question, Jamie.

00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:16.968
And first of all, thank
you for doing the TEDx.

00:50:16.968 --> 00:50:19.020
That's great.

00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:20.260
I think about this a lot.

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:23.320
We want the best ideas
from wherever they are.

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:28.120
Speaking personally, there's
not a political agenda.

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:32.460
Like, if you could define what
the radical center looks like,

00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:35.330
then I might put myself,
personally, that way.

00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:38.530
But there's people at
TED who come from most

00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:39.850
parts of the spectrum.

00:50:39.850 --> 00:50:43.200
Yes, I think the majority in
the audience, traditionally,

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:47.480
at TED-- and I think
this is what you're

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:50.020
referring to-- if
you like, have a sort

00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:52.140
of progressive-type agenda.

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:53.960
And you sometimes see
that in the talks.

00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:58.490
If you could hear
us internally, we

00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:03.420
are constantly on the search
for great, outside-the-box ideas

00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:05.490
from the right, from
all parts, honestly,

00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:06.837
of the political spectrum.

00:51:06.837 --> 00:51:08.920
Mainly, what we're trying
to do, actually, though,

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:11.740
is find talks that aren't
locatable somewhere,

00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:14.170
neatly, on the
political spectrum.

00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:15.590
Because the trouble
with politics

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:17.940
is that it provokes
these sort of trigger

00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:18.880
reactions from people.

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:21.490
People stop listening
once they think

00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:25.240
your speaking-- this is tribal.

00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:28.060
So we want talks that
are just great ideas.

00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:34.714
So that's the journey
that I think we're on

00:51:34.714 --> 00:51:35.880
and that I want us to be on.

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:39.020
But absolutely, if
anyone's listening to this

00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:40.770
and you think you're
on a different part

00:51:40.770 --> 00:51:43.186
of the political spectrum from
what you think TED normally

00:51:43.186 --> 00:51:47.790
represents, suggest to us,
what is the compelling idea

00:51:47.790 --> 00:51:50.780
that the world needs to
know about from your lens.

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:52.960
Because we really
want to know it.

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:53.730
So I thank you.

00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:56.170
And keep pushing for
that extra diversity.

00:51:56.170 --> 00:51:57.150
We're looking for it.

00:51:57.150 --> 00:51:57.983
It's a conversation.

00:51:57.983 --> 00:51:59.140
AUDIENCE: Cool, thanks.

00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:02.020
AUDIENCE: Hello,
my name is John.

00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:04.630
Do you have any advice for
people whose English is not

00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:05.810
their first language?

00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:08.290
And what is TED doing
to bring in ideas

00:52:08.290 --> 00:52:11.637
from non-English
speaking people?

00:52:11.637 --> 00:52:13.220
CHRIS ANDERSON: Yes,
absolutely, we're

00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:18.140
committed to increasingly
getting talks

00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:19.310
from non-English speakers.

00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:20.560
There are already quite a few.

00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:25.490
The TEDx initiative,
many of those events

00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:27.330
are not held in English.

00:52:27.330 --> 00:52:30.437
So those talks are being
recorded and uploaded,

00:52:30.437 --> 00:52:31.020
so they exist.

00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:35.230
What we're trying to do, slowly,
is bring together more of them.

00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:37.610
So in this coming year, we
have an initiative on Spanish

00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:39.440
where we're going
to try and produce

00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:41.970
a critical mass
of Spanish talks.

00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:46.260
And so I think we've
done a good job, so far,

00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:48.217
of translating
TED, in subtitles,

00:52:48.217 --> 00:52:49.300
into many other languages.

00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:52.320
We're in pretty much
100 languages now.

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:55.190
But the next step is
doing a much better job

00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:58.000
of sourcing non-English talks.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.310
We're on it.

00:52:59.310 --> 00:53:00.780
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name's Zack.

00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:04.060
I was wondering if you had
any advice or things to say

00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:07.510
about stage fright, if you learn
to speak with stage fright,

00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:11.410
or try to get the stage
fright to go away,

00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:13.730
or whatever it may be.

00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:15.260
CHRIS ANDERSON:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:19.900
I think for me,
the first thing is

00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:25.380
renaming that fear in your
mind and making it an asset.

00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:26.740
Fear is there for a reason.

00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:30.140
It's to persuade you to act to
avoid that fearful thing coming

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:30.750
true.

00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:33.531
So use it as
motivation to prepare

00:53:33.531 --> 00:53:34.530
and to do what's needed.

00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:36.740
So that's step one.

00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:42.280
Step two is to know that, with
rehearsal, your confidence can

00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:46.945
grow and that it's possible to
just shift that fear from fear

00:53:46.945 --> 00:53:48.170
to excitement.

00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:51.310
Feelings are actually
quite similar.

00:53:51.310 --> 00:53:55.470
Third is just, even on
stage, it can actually

00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:56.770
give you an extra edge.

00:53:56.770 --> 00:54:02.500
It can dial up your
energy in the moment.

00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:05.530
And if you feel like you're
losing it, and you're shaking,

00:54:05.530 --> 00:54:08.720
and whatever, just have
an honest conversation

00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:09.470
with the audience.

00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:10.540
People respond to it.

00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:14.420
Audiences are
fundamentally supportive.

00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:17.670
There's other things like doing
some physical activity right

00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:20.820
before, breathing deep,
all those kinds of things,

00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:23.540
and having a couple
of escape clauses

00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:26.100
where you've got
a bottle of water

00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:27.890
and some notes off to the side.

00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:30.300
And you can always bring
on a little coughing fit,

00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:33.270
and go over and have a drink of
water, and remind your notes,

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:35.320
and calm down.

00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:42.680
But audiences actually often
see nervousness as vulnerability

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:45.160
and actually rise
to that person.

00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:48.620
They embrace that
speaker more, so long

00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:51.160
as you can keep that
authenticity there.

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:55.110
So it's absolutely overcomable.

00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:58.546
Pretty much every speaker
feels a level of nervousness.

00:54:58.546 --> 00:55:00.170
It's only in a few
that it's crippling,

00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:02.000
but even there, it
can be overcome.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.842
And if Monica Lewinsky
can do it, you can do.

00:55:04.842 --> 00:55:06.550
GOPI KALLAYIL: Thank
you to the audience.

00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:08.850
I want to close here with
two final questions, Chris.

00:55:08.850 --> 00:55:10.890
One is, all of the
examples that you showed,

00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:12.890
many of the examples you
talk about in the book,

00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:14.590
humor is a big part of it.

00:55:14.590 --> 00:55:18.060
Making people laugh makes
you endearable as a speaker.

00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:21.430
And that's also a big
fear for almost everyone

00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:24.589
who fear that we are
not naturally funny.

00:55:24.589 --> 00:55:26.380
So how do you bring
humor in when you think

00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:28.170
that, I'm not a funny guy?

00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:30.349
CHRIS ANDERSON: Well, I
think I'm not a funny guy.

00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:31.140
And so what I did--

00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:32.806
GOPI KALLAYIL: You're
British, so you've

00:55:32.806 --> 00:55:34.017
got a natural advantage.

00:55:34.017 --> 00:55:35.600
CHRIS ANDERSON: What
I did was I found

00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:39.460
some funny videos,
like Share the Load.

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:42.680
And actually, when you look at
several really popular talks

00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:46.770
on TED, an early moment of
humor comes not directly

00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:49.150
from the speaker, but from
something that they showed.

00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:52.630
So I totally cheated with this.

00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:54.470
You don't have to
actually have humor.

00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:55.280
Humor is great.

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:57.050
It does open people up a bit.

00:55:57.050 --> 00:56:01.020
And it helps people
feel like they've

00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:02.520
got a connection
with you, but there

00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:03.603
are other ways to do that.

00:56:03.603 --> 00:56:06.710
Just being honest with
people, being vulnerable,

00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:10.290
telling a story about a
failure of yours or whatever,

00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:12.779
you can connect with people
in lots of different ways.

00:56:12.779 --> 00:56:14.320
I would say the only
thing you really

00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:17.010
can't do in a talk
is come on in kind

00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:22.230
of a blowhard of, let me tell
you the reasons I'm so great.

00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:24.410
And I've had such
amazing success

00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:25.730
over the last few months.

00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:27.710
I'm just going to tell
you a few examples.

00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:29.285
Everyone hates that.

00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:34.200
As soon as people
get the sense this

00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:38.240
is about you, not about
them, that doesn't work.

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:42.250
So it's worth trying to
find the humorous moment,

00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:44.540
because if you can find
it, it will give you

00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:45.750
more confidence in the talk.

00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:47.590
And it just helps
everyone relax,

00:56:47.590 --> 00:56:48.970
but it's not the only way.

00:56:48.970 --> 00:56:51.860
And bad humor is to be avoided.

00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:54.912
That's worse than no humor.

00:56:54.912 --> 00:56:56.370
GOPI KALLAYIL: So
my final thoughts

00:56:56.370 --> 00:56:58.650
are on what you've done
going beyond the book.

00:56:58.650 --> 00:57:00.600
It's not simply a
conference that you created.

00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:03.740
You created an amazing
institution, a legacy.

00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:06.750
In an era where the art of
this form of communication

00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:10.246
is dying out, TED, as
a brand, has revived

00:57:10.246 --> 00:57:11.370
the art of public speaking.

00:57:11.370 --> 00:57:13.110
And it's become
a global platform

00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:16.210
through which many people
are expressing themselves.

00:57:16.210 --> 00:57:19.030
And you use digital
technology to great effect

00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:21.670
to really take it to all
comes with the world.

00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:24.050
What is your vision
for TED and TEDx?

00:57:24.050 --> 00:57:26.620
And next five years, what
can we expect to see?

00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:28.642
Or 10 years?

00:57:28.642 --> 00:57:30.100
CHRIS ANDERSON:
It's honestly being

00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:33.350
driven by the technological
revolution that's coming.

00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:35.490
Like, if you really believe
that broadband video is

00:57:35.490 --> 00:57:39.280
coming to every
part of the planet,

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:40.500
that gives us our roadmap.

00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:42.890
Now, that means 4
billion people are

00:57:42.890 --> 00:57:46.600
coming online and leapfrogging
straight to an internet where

00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:47.190
there's video.

00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:48.300
It's thrilling.

00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:49.770
It's also terrifying.

00:57:49.770 --> 00:57:51.722
And so I think that
the TED Talk you

00:57:51.722 --> 00:57:53.680
want to put in front of
them is not necessarily

00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:57.820
Sir Ken Robinson, as much
as I love him, you know?

00:57:57.820 --> 00:58:01.370
It's something that is
relevant to them now.

00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:05.910
And it's going to be competing
in this incredible war with who

00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:09.200
knows what-- all these new
marketing things that they've

00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:11.820
seen for the first time,
terrorist recruitment

00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:13.410
videos for all I know.

00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:16.150
We've got to get this right.

00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:20.280
And so that plus a
big push in education

00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:23.430
are the two new
things, and meanwhile,

00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:29.770
trying to welcome as many new,
fresh voices onto the platform.

00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:31.570
The joyful thing about
knowledge, knowledge

00:58:31.570 --> 00:58:34.170
is different from
ice cream, right?

00:58:34.170 --> 00:58:36.600
I love strawberry ice cream.

00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:39.410
The first spoonful is delicious.

00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:43.357
The second, not quite
so much so, but OK.

00:58:43.357 --> 00:58:44.940
Knowledge actually
goes the other way.

00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:48.490
The more you learn, the mole
wondrous the world seems,

00:58:48.490 --> 00:58:50.960
the more you want to
know the next thing.

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:55.340
And so I find that,
honestly, really exciting.

00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:57.780
And I think the fact that
we have the chance now

00:58:57.780 --> 00:59:01.640
to lead lives that are
lifelong learning, that's

00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:02.940
amazing and thrilling.

00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:06.070
And really, I feel so
fortunate to be just playing

00:59:06.070 --> 00:59:07.912
this little part of it.

00:59:07.912 --> 00:59:10.370
GOPI KALLAYIL: And that's a
great opportunity and a problem

00:59:10.370 --> 00:59:11.934
to solve for the
future, imagining

00:59:11.934 --> 00:59:12.850
what it could be like.

00:59:12.850 --> 00:59:14.860
And I can bet, somewhere
in the audience,

00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:17.910
someone is willing to give
a great TED Talk on that.

00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:20.119
CHRIS ANDERSON: I bet
that that is true.

00:59:20.119 --> 00:59:22.160
GOPI KALLAYIL: Any closing
comments and thoughts?

00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:26.130
One final piece of advice
as it relates to the book?

00:59:26.130 --> 00:59:27.790
CHRIS ANDERSON: The
book's the book.

00:59:27.790 --> 00:59:31.680
To you guys here, at
Google, it's extraordinary

00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:38.980
what you've built. It has
enabled everyone's work

00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:41.760
to be completely different
from what it could be.

00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:45.780
It's transformed education's
potential in ways

00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:47.640
that no one even recognizes yet.

00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:49.390
The fact that we're
in a world where

00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:52.300
everyone has "The Hitchhiker's
Guide to the Galaxy"

00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:54.450
in their pocket, and
actually, all they need

00:59:54.450 --> 00:59:58.760
is curiosity to
find out anything,

00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:00.420
it's absolutely stunning.

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:02.780
What YouTube is
is stunning to me.

01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:05.330
The fact that you
can show everyone

01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:08.580
on the planet what the best
people in any given field

01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:13.130
can do, from skateboarding
to giving an idea,

01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:14.480
it's mind-blowing to me.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:20.920
And so I know you know you work
for a company of immense power

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:21.840
and impact.

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:29.850
But where that goes, it's
going to have a huge impact

01:00:29.850 --> 01:00:30.780
on the world's future.

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:33.090
And I know you constantly
are thinking about this

01:00:33.090 --> 01:00:35.660
and how to make sure it
goes the right way and not

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:37.050
the wrong way.

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:38.497
Thank you for doing what you do.

01:00:38.497 --> 01:00:39.580
It really, really matters.

01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:42.580
And it's been a real privilege
to be here today, so thank you.

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:45.793
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:45.974 --> 01:00:47.390
GOPI KALLAYIL: And
Chris, I wanted

01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:48.860
to say thank you for
what you've created.

01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:50.360
Thank you for writing the book.

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:51.666
Thank you for coming to Google.

01:00:51.666 --> 01:00:53.040
It's been our
honor and pleasure.

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:53.500
Thank you.

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:54.390
CHRIS ANDERSON:
Thanks a lot, Gopi.

01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:55.015
Thanks so much.

01:00:55.015 --> 01:01:01.640
