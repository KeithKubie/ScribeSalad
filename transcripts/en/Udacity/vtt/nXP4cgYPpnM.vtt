00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.260
The wrong dose of a drug can either have no effect

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.890
at all, or it could possibly have dire consequences for an individual.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.830
&gt;&gt; At least I know I have a functioning

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.470
ADH, but I'm going to stick to water for now.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.180
&gt;&gt; Variation and mutation in individual genes

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.770
that are involved in pathways of drug

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.270
metabolism will determine the effectiveness and toxicity

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.650
of an individual drug for an individual person.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.020
&gt;&gt; Well, but what about the rest of the family?

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.740
&gt;&gt; You mean like how did they respond to drugs?

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.370
&gt;&gt; No, I mean

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:26.180
how are we all connected?

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.980
&gt;&gt; that's next.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:28.280
&gt;&gt; Oh, good.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.710
&gt;&gt; It's time we turn our focus to how our genomes connect all of us together.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.560
In the next lesson, we're going to learn all

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.820
about human ancestry and evolution using personal genetic information.
