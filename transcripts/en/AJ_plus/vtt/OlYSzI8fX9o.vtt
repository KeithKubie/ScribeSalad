00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.210
“It’s handled.” You know her because you’ve seen her so many times. She’s bold, fierce

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.610
– an unflinching, seemingly invincible black lady. “But you got me twisted OG.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.539
I’m always gonna eat.” In media, you can see the idea that the black woman, being this

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.710
superwoman ... The caricature isn’t only used to shape fictional personalities in

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.090
in pop culture. It’s also a standard to which society holds all African-American women.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.470
And it is that mindset that is passed down to African-American girls and women,

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.910
from generation to generation. But there’s a problem. I don’t think it’s

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.170
very sustainable at all, and if it is sustainable, if a person survives living

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.530
this way, we would need to take a really good look at their health. I think

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.789
this “superwoman syndrome” is suffering in silence. Hey, fam. I’m

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.239
Imaeyen. This Sunday on AJ+ we’re looking at what the ramifications are

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.400
when society expects black women to be “super.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.560
Two of the most popular dramas on American television right now center on black

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.759
women with seemingly limitless emotional strength. Scandal’s Olivia Pope is known

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.570
as much for her wardrobe as her ability to endure. And How to Get Away with Murder’s

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.500
Annalise Keating spends each season carving out solutions for law

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.520
law students who refuse to stay in their lane. “Never take a learning opportunity

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.640
away from another student, no matter how smart you need everyone to think you are.”

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.390
Annalise and Olivia have repeatedly showed audiences how to win. And those

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.799
wins almost always come at the expense of themselves. The fictional creations

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.670
are two examples of what clinical psychologist Jazz Keyes calls the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.319
“superwoman syndrome.” Black women are always in this state of figuring it out,

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:50.899
conquering it all, being this warrior, being of infinite strength. The black

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.490
superwoman persona didn’t originate with Olivia Pope, Annalise Keating or any of

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.390
of the countless black female characters who exhibit the same attributes.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.140
Before the black superwoman character was a part of any script or screenplay,

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.819
the idea of it was being handed down within the black community. In her 2011 book

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.510
“Sister Citizen,” Melissa Harris-Perry said the strong black woman stereotype was

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.549
developed to combat tropes like the mammy, the jezebel and Sapphire. These are

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:21.230
gendered stereotypes you may recognize.
The mammy was born out of a post-Civil War

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.790
America longing for antebellum days. 
She’s an asexual grandmother type

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.230
dedicated to fulfilling the needs of a white family – much like Hattie McDaniel’s

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.040
character in Gone with the Wind, who literally was called Mammy.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.519
There’s the jezebel, which hypersexualizes black women.

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.670
It depicts black women as having inappropriate and insatiable

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.049
sexual appetites – much like you see in many music videos. And then there’s Sapphire,

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.019
which you know more commonly as the angry black woman stereotype. She’s loud,

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.250
emasculating and verbally abusive, like Gabrielle Union’s character Eva

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.150
in 2003’s Deliver Us From Eva. The superwoman idea was meant to buck stereotypes like those.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.859
And now Keys says it’s become part of black women’s subconscious. "This

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.760
This is something that’s subconsciously embedded in our psyche, and also in

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.470
others, that black women can endure so much or have endured so much and still

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.360
rise to the top." There are even songs dedicated to this idea, like Karyn

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.530
White’s aptly titled “Superwoman,” which spent 18 weeks on the billboard charts between

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:28.170
1988 and 1989. “I'm not your superwoman…”

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.720
That song is one way you may have seen the superwoman syndrome embodied. Here’s

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.010
another on the opposite side of the spectrum: “I’m a strong black woman.”

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.239
Keyes says the mythology surrounding the black superwoman can be as empowering

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.560
empowering as it is detrimental. The thought of always being seen as strong

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.020
and resilient may seem complimentary. But the superwoman ideal has some substantial

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.519
negative effects on black women’s health.
It’s so impactful that psychiatric nurse

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.989
Cheryl Giscombe has spent the last 15 years studying the psychological stress

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.620
and health of black women. She’s developed what she calls the “black superwoman

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.850
schema” and says there are five characteristics of the black superwoman.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.319
"One is a perceived obligation to present an image of strength. The second is

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.019
a perceived obligation to suppress emotions.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.450
The third is resistance to vulnerability or dependence on help from others.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.500
The fourth is a motivation to succeed despite limited resources. And the fifth

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.000
is prioritization of caregiving or providing care to others,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.410
and balancing that with self-care. Giscombe says these factors are very likely

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.280
impacting black women’s health in ways that aren’t really being considered or

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.539
widely researched. She added that the superwoman schema can affect things like

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:47.130
sleeping habits, relationships and even diet. The Centers for Disease Control says

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.860
more than half of African-American women older than 20 are obese.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.650
African-Americans also develop high blood pressure more often and at

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.950
an earlier age than their white and Hispanic counterparts. Even within that

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.360
that troubling statistic, there’s even more worry for black women. More of them have

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.110
high blood pressure than black men. Then there’s the effect of network stress.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.700
That’s when you carry stressors because someone in your circle is experiencing

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.380
stress. "When we compared directly experienced stress to network stress, we

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:22.289
found that for African-American women, network stress was just as powerful a

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:26.460
contributor to overall emotional distress as was personally,

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.360
directly experienced stress." Giscombe says those stress levels may help

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.590
explain black women’s morbidity in cancer rates. "Some of the statistics related

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.669
to morbidity related to breast cancer may be stress-related because

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:42.820
African-American women are not more likely to experience breast cancer,

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.139
but they’re more likely to die of breast cancer, and some of that is related to

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:52.300
delayed health-seeking." And then there’s something else. Could it be possible

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.100
this superwoman complex is having an adverse effect on black birth rates in the U.S.?

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.090
"African-American women have twice the rate of low birth weight, preterm

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:07.180
delivery and infant death, or infant mortality. And it cannot be completely

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.770
explained by things such as limited insurance or limited access to healthcare."

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.260
Giscombe says those disparities still

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:19.000
exist even among highly educated black women. She believes health professionals

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.030
should consider the superwoman schema when researching illnesses and

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.410
prescribing healthcare regimens. She wants more researchers to try and

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.370
determine the direct links between the superwoman schema and African-American women’s

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.479
health.  Both Giscombe and Keyes say a substantial factor in black

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:38.590
women’s health stems from their focus on caregiving. This even plays out in

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.520
in fictional portrayals, like when Olivia Pope was driven to kill and Annalise

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.990
Keating spiraled into alcoholism. "They’re the host, so everyone needs them

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.470
all the time, whether it be to make decisions, whether it be to fix things,

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:56.470
to clean up messes. They’re always the person coming in and being

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:01.570
the savior. No one paid attention to the fact that they were suffering in silence,

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.950
until the point of them having a nervous breakdown or turning to alcohol." Keyes says

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.820
even while these superwomen are breaking down, they’re not allowed to

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:14.320
to process their own emotions because everyone else is relying on them.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.460
"The superwoman syndrome is that part where, often at night, we’re

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:24.220
suffering in silence because we’re never saved. No one’s ever 'cape-ing' for us.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.270
This is a lesson that really resonated with her after she became a mother.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:33.789
"My daughter expedited my healing process in a way that nothing else could have ever

00:07:33.789 --> 00:07:40.120
done. And I believe it caused me to really take a deep evaluation into what

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:45.490
what did I believe about my womanhood.
I didn’t want her to associate her life as

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:50.680
a black woman with your ability to endure and withstand a great deal of

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.440
pain and still be able to say, 'Well, I’m strong enough

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.150
to get through that.”' Both Keyes and Giscombe say the first step to ensuring

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:03.070
the health of black women is reminding them to take care of themselves. They

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:08.350
believe philanthropy starts with self. "At some point, you’re going to have

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:12.610
to learn how to save yourself. And that is that radical self-love and that radical self-care."

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.810
