00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's ask you another question, suppose you care about 95% probability confidence

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
How many data points do you have to collect at a minimum

00:00:14.000 --> 09:59:59.000
to reach a factor that isn't larger than 2.145? You can read this off the table.
