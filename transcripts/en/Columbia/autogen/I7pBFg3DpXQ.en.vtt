and then we can look at the definition
also offered where we're talking about a

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110
also offered where we're talking about a
 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.610

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:46.180
in her program and so Maria marzan ended
 

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:48.750

up being a 67 item student survey and

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:48.760
up being a 67 item student survey and
 

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:52.020
up being a 67 item student survey and
you can see the areas that that were

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:52.030
you can see the areas that that were
 

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:54.570
you can see the areas that that were
perfectly aligned with the AFC cultural

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:54.580
perfectly aligned with the AFC cultural
 

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:57.600

they made it what they wanted in their

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:03.850
they made it what they wanted in their
 

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:05.580
they made it what they wanted in their
medical education how important it was

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:05.590
medical education how important it was
 

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:08.670
medical education how important it was
to them and it was administered here in

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:08.680
to them and it was administered here in
 

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:10.530
to them and it was administered here in
New York City to medical students and

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:10.540
New York City to medical students and
 

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:11.700
New York City to medical students and
all these people are they start their

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:11.710
all these people are they start their
 

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:14.670
all these people are they start their
education and just sample items you know

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:14.680
education and just sample items you know
 

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:18.270
education and just sample items you know
about identifying position bias there

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:18.280
about identifying position bias there
 

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:23.130
about identifying position bias there
typing things of that sort and so what

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:23.140
typing things of that sort and so what
 

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.570
typing things of that sort and so what
was looked at also the social

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:24.580
was looked at also the social
 

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:27.330
was looked at also the social
desirability now if you think about

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:27.340
desirability now if you think about
 

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:30.720
desirability now if you think about
medical students or graduate students or

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:30.730
medical students or graduate students or
 

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:32.730
medical students or graduate students or
just students period have you hear that

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:32.740
just students period have you hear that
 

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:36.360
just students period have you hear that
concept of brown-nosing yeah okay so we

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:36.370
concept of brown-nosing yeah okay so we
 

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:39.030
concept of brown-nosing yeah okay so we
complete our survey that will students

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:39.040
complete our survey that will students
 

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:39.520
complete our survey that will students
might be

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:39.530
might be
 

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:41.980
might be
kind of good at saying what you want to

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:41.990
kind of good at saying what you want to
 

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:45.700
kind of good at saying what you want to
hear and so it's really important to

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:45.710
hear and so it's really important to
 

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:47.620
hear and so it's really important to
always be a professor that we created

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:47.630
always be a professor that we created
 

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:49.540
always be a professor that we created
then the soldiers are building scale so

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:49.550
then the soldiers are building scale so
 

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:51.670
then the soldiers are building scale so
we can see well how high are you on that

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:51.680
we can see well how high are you on that

school and so we looked at predictors

00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:26.360
school and so we looked at predictors
 

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:29.500
school and so we looked at predictors
and relationships I'll turned out that

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:29.510
and relationships I'll turned out that
 

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:31.720

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:34.510
the scale is a really nice scale it's
got good internal consistency both for

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:34.520
got good internal consistency both for
 

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:38.770
got good internal consistency both for

and it also could be used to say well

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:55.880
and it also could be used to say well
 

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.480
and it also could be used to say well
now that this medical student has been

00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:58.490
now that this medical student has been
 

00:37:58.490 --> 00:37:59.860
now that this medical student has been
exposed to three or four years of

exposed to three or four years of
 

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:03.700
exposed to three or four years of
medical education do we see any change

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:03.710
medical education do we see any change
