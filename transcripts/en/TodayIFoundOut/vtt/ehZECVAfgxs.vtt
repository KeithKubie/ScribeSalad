00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:12.440
Avoid Being Sued with the "Small Penis Rule"

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.600
The law is a funny thing and when it comes
to defamation and libel, it’s notoriously

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.600
murky.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.029
As such, writers often have to be careful
when they’re trying to create characters

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.470
“inspired” by real people to avoid a lawsuit.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.910
For writers who don’t care about that though,
there’s always the small penis rule.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.260
In essence, the small penis rule is a way
of avoiding a claim of libel by describing

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.940
the libellous character as having a penis
of comically underwhelming size.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.199
The idea being that few men would be willing
to sue if it meant having to stand up in court

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.070
and say that the character in the novel who’s
seriously deficient in his nether regions

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.530
is clearly based on them.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.000
The earliest mention of the rule can be traced
back to a 1998 New York Times article by Dinitia

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.700
Smith, though the description itself is attributed
to libel lawyer Leon Friedman who describes

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.909
it as a “sly trick” used by writers looking
to avoid a law suit for basing a character

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.640
on someone who portrays them in a less than
flattering manner by simply giving them a

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.000
quality or attribute nobody would want.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.460
Yes, the undesirable trait doesn’t have
to be limited to one’s manhood, and other

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.370
techniques for avoiding claims of libel may
involve things like:

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.150
Giving the character an unsavoury personal
foible like foul body odour

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.450
Describing the character as being ugly or
overweight

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.650
Making the character objectively abhorrent
by describing them as a racist or homophobic.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.670
Going out of your way to make sure the audience
knows the character is into some really kinky

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.530
things in the bedroom
The idea behind all of these tactics is basically

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.600
the same- by making the character have one
particularly awful trait that nobody would

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.630
want associated with themselves, you can discourage
whomever that character happens to be a pastiche,

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.170
parody or mockery of from taking it to court.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.530
That way, as long as you don’t use the person’s
real name, you’ll probably be fine.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.890
A classic example of this occurred in Michael
Crichton’s book, Next.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.319
In it, he describes a character called Mick
Crowley: (Warning, this one gets kind of graphic)

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.409
Alex Burnet was in the middle of the most
difficult trial of her career, a rape case

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.730
involving the sexual assault of a two-year-old
boy in Malibu.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.030
The defendant, thirty-year-old Mick Crowley,
was a Washington-based political columnist

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.159
who was visiting his sister-in-law when he
experienced an overwhelming urge to have anal

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.019
sex with her young son, still in diapers.

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:41.030
Crowley was a wealthy, spoiled Yale graduate
and heir to a pharmaceutical fortune…

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.489
It turned out Crowley’s taste in love objects
was well known in Washington, but [his lawyer]—as

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.110
was his custom—tried the case vigorously
in the press months before the trial, repeatedly

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.590
characterizing Alex and the child’s mother
as “fantasizing feminist fundamentalists”

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.780
who had made up the whole thing from “their
sick, twisted imaginations.”

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.120
This, despite a well-documented hospital examination
of the child.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.060
(Crowley’s penis was small, but he had still
caused significant tears to the toddler’s

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.060
rectum.)

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.430
This character, who is of virtually no importance
to the overarching plot, is also called a

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.090
“dickhead” later in the novel.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.281
As it turns out, Mick Crowley was a very thinly
veiled stab at a journalist and Yale Graduate

00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:26.499
called Michael Crowley who had previously
written a scathing review (which is no longer

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:28.909
available online) of Crichton.

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:33.069
Perhaps the “small penis rule” worked
in this case, as Crowley didn’t sue.

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.060
Instead, he wrote an article in which he stated,
among other things,

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.469
I confess to having mixed feelings about my
sliver of literary immortality.

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:46.459
It’s impossible not to be grossed out on
some level–particularly by the creepy image

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:52.219
of the smoldering Crichton, alone in his darkened
study, imagining in pornographic detail the

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:53.499
rape of a small child.

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:59.109
It’s uplifting, however, to learn that Next‘s
sales have proved disappointing by Crichton’s

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:05.139
standards, continuing what an industry newsletter
dubs Crichton’s “recent pattern of erosion.”

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:09.450
And I’m looking forward to the choice Crichton
will have to make, when asked about the basis

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.620
for Mick Crowley, between a comically dishonest
denial and a confession of his shocking depravity.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.530
Crichton launched his noxious attack from
behind the shield of the small penis rule

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.590
because, I’m sure, he’s embarrassed by
what he has done.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.610
In researching my article, I found a man who
has long yearned for intellectual stature

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.480
beyond the realm of killer dinosaurs and talking
monkeys.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.400
And Crichton must know that turning a critic
into a poorly endowed child rapist won’t

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.740
exactly aid his cause.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.979
Ultimately, then, I find myself strangely
flattered.

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.240
To explain why, let me propose a corollary
to the small penis rule.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.310
Call it the small man rule: If someone offers
substantive criticism of an author, and the

00:04:51.310 --> 00:05:14.180
author responds by hitting below the belt,
as it were, then he’s conceding 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:21.680
that the critic has won.
