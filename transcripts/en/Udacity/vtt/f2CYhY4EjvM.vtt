00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In order for us to calculate how many cycles it takes for the amplitude to decay

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to one half its original value, we need to know the relationship between the amplitude

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and the energy value which we know decays by 20.6% per cycle.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This relationship is actually given by the potential energy equation.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
When the spring is most compressed or most extended,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
then the displacement away from the equilibrium length is equal to the amplitude A.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
At this point, where the spring is most stretched or most compressed,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
the potential energy is exactly equal to 1/2&lt;i&gt;K&lt;i&gt;A².&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We should be careful here the value here should not actually be K,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
it should be equal to 4K, so this equation should actually be equal to 2KA²,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and that's because we have four springs down here which could be effectively treated as one spring

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
with a spring constant of 4K which we saw in the solution to the previous question.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Now, I'm going to substitute this value for potential energy 2KA²

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and the value for energy in our earlier equation, and doing a little math,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
we get that the current A² is equal to 0.794ⁿ&lt;i&gt;A².&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Now, let's remember what we're looking for.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
We are looking for the amplitude A that's equal to exactly half the original amplitude.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We can substitute one half A₀ for A here, and that gives us this equation here

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and quite nicely, the A₀ terms cancel and that gives us this interesting equation up here that 1/4=0.794ⁿ

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and depending on how much math you've had, you may recognize

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
that you can solve this equation by using something called a logarithm.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
We don't actually have to use logarithms here.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
It turns out that if you go through trying different values for ⁿ--different integer values in particular,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
you'll find pretty soon that the solution to this equation actually is n=6,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
This means it takes six cycles, six complete oscillations in order for the amplitude

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
of our spring oscillations to decay to one half the original value.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Great work if you got this problem, but if you didn't,

00:02:03.000 --> 99:59:59.000
don't worry about it either--this was quite challenging.
