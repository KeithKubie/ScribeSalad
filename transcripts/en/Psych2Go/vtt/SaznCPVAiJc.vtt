00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.480
There is a common misconception that depression is easy to spot.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.680
Hollywood often depicts it as somebody who is always sad, or looks worn out.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.840
But depression isn't always obvious, which is why so many of us struggle with it silently.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.640
Sometimes, it means smiling on the outside, when we're really dying on the inside.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.860
Here are 5 hidden signs of depression.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.400
1. You have habitual remedies

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.640
Therapy and medication can help with depression.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:01.480
But if you find yourself making extra changes to your lifestyle, then it can indicate that you are struggling more than usual with it.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.840
I'm going through this one myself.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.360
If you are too, you may find yourself exercising more frequently, listening to music more often,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.620
or doing your favorite hobbies to distract yourself from the pain you're feeling.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.460
Hidden depression exists when you're trying to quiet the loud demons in your head.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.900
2. You have irregular eating and sleeping patterns

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.840
People with depression struggle with consistent sleeping and eating patterns.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.240
You may find you're either sleeping and eating too much, or too little.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.600
Depression can work in extremes, and slows us down when we get little energy from our irregular daily patterns.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.040
3. You are highly philosophical

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.040
Do you constantly find yourself seeking a purpose in life?

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.720
Do you also think about the "what if's" and have frequent, deep conversations about life and death?

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.220
Although you sound very scholarly and smart, there can also be a downside to thinking too much.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.620
People with hidden depression have a tendency to ruminate about their uncertainties in life.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.040
They usually feel directionless, lost, and scared.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.040
4. You have trouble with abandonment

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.080
People with depression understand how much of a burden it can be.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.440
I can strongly relate to this.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.060
I have a hard time letting people in, afraid that it will be harder for them to be there for me when I need their support.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.440
I realize I have abandonment issues, but I'm trying harder to be more vulnerable.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.020
I realize I can't fight depression alone, and neither should you.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.840
No one should have to.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.040
5. You're losing your patience

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.860
Have you been feeling irritable or angry with others lately?

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.640
Depression doesn't always have to look like sadness or dejection.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.220
Instead, you might find yourself frustrated and impatient with everyone.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.200
If you feel like you're at your last straw, your depression might have intensified.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.660
Do you resonate with any of these hidden signs?

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.240
