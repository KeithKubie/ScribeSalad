00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:11.220
- In order to try to get

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.000
as many sourdoughs as possible
identified in the world,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.570
I am on a quest for sourdough.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.720
For the moment, we host 107 starters

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.990
from more or less 20 countries.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.390
And so we ended up with 17 sourdoughs

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.050
from 17 bakeries in Italy,

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.280
40, 41, 42, from Hungary,

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.720
the 64 was an old lady in China.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.530
It's sourdoughs with a story
where I know the people there

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.400
like, 79 is from Josie
Baker in San Francisco.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.400
104, 106, and 107 go back
to the Klondike Gold Rush.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.230
Every library has a librarian.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.393
Well, it happens that in
this sourdough library,

00:00:54.393 --> 00:00:56.726
I'm the sourdough librarian.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.750
When an idea like a
sourdough library pops up,

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.720
and you are able to do it from scratch,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.210
well, it's my baby.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.274
That's why I grew so much into it.

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:17.220
With this one I have a
very special relationship,

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.653
because it was the very first
sourdough starter we had.

00:01:20.653 --> 00:01:23.173
This was my very first
sourdough I saw in my life,

00:01:24.365 --> 00:01:26.195
and so I started refreshing it,

00:01:26.212 --> 00:01:28.550
and I had to bake with it.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.408
I immediately got interested by this dough

00:01:31.665 --> 00:01:33.031
that I'd never seen before.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.798
And being a baker, you
want to know more about

00:01:35.798 --> 00:01:38.830
what's going on in there, and
then you start feeding it,

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.590
and you see it bubbling, and it's alive.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.530
It's like a pet.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.504
In the nineties, many people
had these little Tamagotchi,

00:01:46.504 --> 00:01:49.403
with the little thing
that you had to feed.

00:01:49.403 --> 00:01:51.090
Now if you killed it,

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.160
it was okay, because you could
just reset the whole thing

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.630
and start all over.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.900
Well, here, not.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.032
We have living sourdoughs.

00:01:59.032 --> 00:02:01.840
They are bubbly.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.110
Every two months, we open the jars,

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.872
and we feed the sourdough

00:02:05.872 --> 00:02:08.880
with their original flour,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.190
following the original recipe.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.130
And that guarantees that
they are not changing.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.630
The fact that we decided
to create this library,

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.170
is first of all, to
preserve its biodiversity.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.790
If tomorrow, someone who has a sourdough

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.770
that maybe he or she
inherited from their father,

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.540
or grandmother, or whatever,

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.540
and if he or she would stop
cultivating that sourdough,

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.993
well, it's lost.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.890
In English, we use the word "sourdough,"

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.110
but in many cultures, there
is no link to sourness.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.799
The French ones, they say,

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.574
"pan au levain."

00:02:50.574 --> 00:02:52.306
The Italians, they use

00:02:52.306 --> 00:02:54.280
"lievito naturale,"

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.600
which means "natural yeast."

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.900
But the most beautiful
description for a sourdough

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.333
is the Spanish word,

00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:04.180
"masa madre,"

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.050
which is the "mother dough."

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.050
When a daughter in the past
was going to get married,

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:15.798
she received a piece of
the mother dough with her

00:03:15.798 --> 00:03:18.150
in order to feed her family.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.980
Sourdough is back on the map.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.460
Today, there is a revival.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.910
Many people rediscover sourdough,

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.409
and that's the beauty.

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:35.409
Sourdough bread is so
much better for humankind

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.550
than just regular bread that
is fermented with yeast.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.380
I think that every bread
has something good,

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.213
but sourdough just brings
it to another level.
