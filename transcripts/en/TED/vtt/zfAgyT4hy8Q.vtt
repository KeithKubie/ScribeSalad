00:00:13.952 --> 00:00:15.102
Hello, friends.

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:18.267
I'm happy to see all of you here today.

00:00:18.746 --> 00:00:21.889
This is actually exactly what I say
to the people who visit us

00:00:21.913 --> 00:00:23.771
at the La Crosse Public Library.

00:00:23.795 --> 00:00:25.862
And I say it because I mean it.

00:00:26.668 --> 00:00:29.611
The children who come
into our library are my friends

00:00:29.635 --> 00:00:32.273
in that I care about their needs
and their futures.

00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:35.485
I want them to be happy and successful.

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:39.228
I hope that they'll find great books
or a movie that delights them.

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:42.099
Or the solution to a tricky problem.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.162
Libraries in general
have this wonderful reputation

00:00:46.186 --> 00:00:48.672
of really caring about our communities.

00:00:48.696 --> 00:00:51.636
We put out mission statements
and statements of purpose

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.093
that say that we connect
our community to the broader world.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.430
We engage minds,

00:00:58.075 --> 00:01:00.048
we create lifelong learners.

00:01:01.488 --> 00:01:04.225
And these ideals are really
important to us as libraries,

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:07.990
because we know the power they have
to create a better world.

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:12.712
A more connected world,
a more engaged and empathetic world.

00:01:14.224 --> 00:01:16.898
Books have power, information has power.

00:01:16.922 --> 00:01:19.152
And for the powerless in our communities,

00:01:19.176 --> 00:01:22.224
being able to connect to that
is even more important.

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:26.045
In 1995, Betty Hart and Todd Risley

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:28.712
published a study that found
that working class families

00:01:28.736 --> 00:01:30.700
and those being served by welfare

00:01:30.724 --> 00:01:34.776
experience what we now refer to
as the "30 million word gap."

00:01:35.947 --> 00:01:39.557
Essentially, what they learned
is that children in these families

00:01:39.581 --> 00:01:42.566
are hearing so many fewer words each day

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.776
that by the time they are three years old,

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.838
there's this enormous disparity
in their learned language.

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:51.265
And that gap in words follows them
as they enter school,

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.260
and it results in later reading,
poorer reading skills,

00:01:55.284 --> 00:01:57.132
a lack of success overall.

00:01:58.625 --> 00:02:00.545
Children need to hear words every day

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:03.339
and they need to hear
not just our day-to-day conversation,

00:02:03.363 --> 00:02:05.101
they have to hear rare words:

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:08.538
those outside the common lexicon
we share, of around 10,000.

00:02:09.887 --> 00:02:13.355
I'm going to read you a short snippet
from a children's book

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.503
by one of our favorite authors
in the children's room, Eric Carle.

00:02:16.527 --> 00:02:19.544
Some of you might know his work
"The Very Hungry Caterpillar."

00:02:19.568 --> 00:02:23.220
But this is from "'Slowly, Slowly,
Slowly,' said the Sloth."

00:02:25.288 --> 00:02:27.415
"Finally, the sloth replied,

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:30.500
'It is true that I am slow,
quiet and boring.

00:02:31.177 --> 00:02:32.709
I am lackadaisical,

00:02:32.733 --> 00:02:34.466
I dawdle and I dillydally.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.456
I am also unflappable, languid, stoic,

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.504
impassive, sluggish, lethargic,

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:44.641
placid, calm, mellow,

00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:47.036
laid-back and, well, slothful!

00:02:47.823 --> 00:02:51.418
I am relaxed and tranquil,
and I like to live in peace.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.275
But I am not lazy.'

00:02:54.282 --> 00:02:56.648
Then the sloth yawned and said,

00:02:56.672 --> 00:02:58.139
'That's just how I am.

00:02:58.472 --> 00:03:02.653
I like to do things
slowly, slowly, slowly.'"

00:03:04.085 --> 00:03:09.093
So you can see from this very brief
example from one book in our library

00:03:09.117 --> 00:03:13.326
how Eric Carle used 20 different words
to get the same idea across to children.

00:03:15.474 --> 00:03:19.085
Now we know that a lot of the families
visiting us at the library,

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.442
a lot of our friends,
are struggling financially.

00:03:23.124 --> 00:03:25.823
We know that some of them
are living in poverty,

00:03:25.847 --> 00:03:28.546
and don't have enough to eat
or anywhere safe to live.

00:03:29.022 --> 00:03:31.673
We know that our friend James,
who comes in after school

00:03:31.697 --> 00:03:33.387
and is staying at a local shelter,

00:03:33.411 --> 00:03:34.760
isn't reading at grade level

00:03:34.784 --> 00:03:36.974
and has probably
never read at grade level.

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:39.688
We know we have that 30 million word gap

00:03:39.712 --> 00:03:43.785
and a corresponding achievement gap
by the time kids enter the third grade,

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:47.007
both of which directly correlate
to income level.

00:03:47.737 --> 00:03:51.546
So what's the responsibility of libraries
in addressing these gaps?

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.536
How can we help our friends
be more successful, more educated

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.027
and some day, better global citizens?

00:03:58.813 --> 00:04:02.028
It starts with ensuring
free and equitable access

00:04:02.052 --> 00:04:04.124
to everything libraries offer them.

00:04:04.894 --> 00:04:06.638
Books level the playing field

00:04:06.662 --> 00:04:10.528
by exposing children of every
socioeconomic background to words.

00:04:11.482 --> 00:04:13.216
At the library, we provide programs

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.722
that are based on the five tenants
of early literacy:

00:04:15.746 --> 00:04:18.001
playing, singing, talking,
reading and writing.

00:04:18.936 --> 00:04:20.587
We offer programs for adults

00:04:20.611 --> 00:04:23.477
on computer classes
and job-skills training.

00:04:24.603 --> 00:04:25.803
Business start-ups.

00:04:26.703 --> 00:04:29.974
We do all of this great work
for our community members

00:04:29.998 --> 00:04:34.474
and at the same time, we counteract it
by charging fines and fees of our patrons.

00:04:35.895 --> 00:04:37.760
Today in La Crosse,

00:04:37.784 --> 00:04:40.992
10,000 of our users are unable
to check out library materials

00:04:41.016 --> 00:04:42.682
because of fines and fees.

00:04:43.911 --> 00:04:47.967
If we narrow in on our neighborhoods
experiencing the most poverty,

00:04:47.991 --> 00:04:52.387
those where 82 percent of the student body
is considered economically disadvantaged,

00:04:52.411 --> 00:04:55.411
the number rises to 23 percent
of the neighborhood.

00:04:56.046 --> 00:05:00.158
And these are local numbers, it's true,
but they hold true nationwide.

00:05:00.882 --> 00:05:03.534
In libraries across the country
that charge fines,

00:05:03.558 --> 00:05:07.797
the poorest neighborhoods have the most
number of people blocked from use.

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:12.351
In fact, the Colorado State Library
was so worried about this,

00:05:12.375 --> 00:05:14.193
they published a white paper

00:05:14.217 --> 00:05:15.725
and they stated unequivocally

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:19.515
that it's the fear of fines
that keeps poor families out of libraries.

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:24.785
A colleague of mine took a ride
in a Lyft in Atlanta last year,

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:28.372
and he started chatting with his driver
about libraries, as we do.

00:05:28.976 --> 00:05:33.009
And she told him she grew up
visiting her local library, she loved it.

00:05:33.578 --> 00:05:36.459
But now that she's a parent
with three children of her own,

00:05:36.483 --> 00:05:39.298
there's no way she would allow them
to get a library card,

00:05:39.322 --> 00:05:41.889
because of the strict deadlines
libraries impose.

00:05:42.331 --> 00:05:45.444
She said, "It would be like
another credit card that I can't pay."

00:05:46.585 --> 00:05:50.933
Meanwhile, when other libraries
have experimented with eliminating fines,

00:05:50.957 --> 00:05:55.123
like one in San Rafael
that took away children's fines,

00:05:55.147 --> 00:05:59.337
they had a 126-percent increase
in child card applications

00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:01.004
within the first few months.

00:06:01.601 --> 00:06:04.561
When people aren't afraid
of the fines they might accrue,

00:06:04.585 --> 00:06:07.585
they line up to access
what we have to offer.

00:06:08.823 --> 00:06:10.951
So what are we telling people, then?

00:06:10.975 --> 00:06:13.308
We have these two disparate ideas.

00:06:13.332 --> 00:06:16.634
On the one hand,
we're champions of democracy

00:06:16.658 --> 00:06:22.011
and we claim that we're there so that
every citizen can educate themselves.

00:06:22.532 --> 00:06:24.814
We're advocates for the power
early literacy has

00:06:24.838 --> 00:06:28.215
to reduce that achievement gap
and eliminate the word gap.

00:06:29.215 --> 00:06:31.690
We tell people, "We're here to help you."

00:06:32.553 --> 00:06:33.950
On the other hand,

00:06:33.974 --> 00:06:36.863
if you're struggling financially,
and you make a mistake,

00:06:36.887 --> 00:06:39.783
the kind of mistake
that anyone in this room could make --

00:06:39.807 --> 00:06:43.712
your tote bag that belongs to the library
sits by your back door

00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:46.728
for a couple of weeks
longer than it should,

00:06:46.752 --> 00:06:48.760
you lose a CD,

00:06:48.784 --> 00:06:51.260
you spill your coffee on a book,

00:06:51.284 --> 00:06:53.662
suddenly, we're not here for you
so much anymore,

00:06:53.686 --> 00:06:56.786
because if that happens,
we're going to make you pay for it.

00:06:57.407 --> 00:07:00.374
And if you can't pay for it,
you're out of luck.

00:07:01.137 --> 00:07:03.684
I have been a librarian
for a lot of years.

00:07:03.708 --> 00:07:06.077
And in the past few years,

00:07:06.101 --> 00:07:09.672
I myself have paid
over 500 dollars in late fines.

00:07:11.403 --> 00:07:12.695
Now, you might wonder why,

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:16.184
I mean, I'm there every day,
and I certainly know how the system works.

00:07:16.757 --> 00:07:20.352
But like all of our friends
at the library,

00:07:20.376 --> 00:07:23.503
I am busy, I lose track of things,

00:07:23.527 --> 00:07:25.934
my house is sometimes messy,

00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.355
and I have lost a DVD or two
under the sofa.

00:07:31.236 --> 00:07:35.276
And I have been fortunate enough
to be able to pay

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.061
that 500 dollars
over the last several years.

00:07:38.085 --> 00:07:41.485
If not happily, I at least
had the means to do it.

00:07:42.069 --> 00:07:44.498
So is that fair and equitable service

00:07:44.522 --> 00:07:50.378
if some of us can pay our fines
and continue to operate as we always have,

00:07:50.402 --> 00:07:54.595
and others of us make one mistake
and no longer are welcome back?

00:07:56.244 --> 00:07:57.394
It's simply not.

00:08:00.141 --> 00:08:04.911
Now, why would we continue
to operate under a model that hurts

00:08:04.935 --> 00:08:07.570
our most vulnerable patrons the most?

00:08:07.594 --> 00:08:08.744
There are reasons.

00:08:09.276 --> 00:08:11.363
There are reasons like responsibility.

00:08:11.387 --> 00:08:13.353
There are some libraries that really feel

00:08:13.377 --> 00:08:16.219
that it's our job
to teach people responsibility.

00:08:16.243 --> 00:08:19.260
And they haven't figured out
that there might be ways to do that

00:08:19.284 --> 00:08:20.839
that don't equate to dollars.

00:08:21.664 --> 00:08:25.434
There's also this idea that we share
the resources collectively in a community,

00:08:25.458 --> 00:08:27.061
and so we have to take turns.

00:08:27.417 --> 00:08:30.831
If I keep my "My Little Pony"
movie for too long,

00:08:30.855 --> 00:08:33.665
and somebody else
wants to watch it, it's not fair.

00:08:34.395 --> 00:08:36.156
And then, there's the money.

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.670
Community members
often love their libraries,

00:08:38.694 --> 00:08:42.893
and they don't want us to not be able
to sustain the services we offer.

00:08:44.773 --> 00:08:48.188
Luckily, we can address
all of these things in a variety of ways

00:08:48.212 --> 00:08:51.442
without scaring away
our most vulnerable populations.

00:08:52.244 --> 00:08:55.244
Some libraries have gone
to a Netflix model.

00:08:55.727 --> 00:08:57.284
You might be familiar with this:

00:08:57.308 --> 00:08:58.704
you check things out,

00:08:58.728 --> 00:09:01.164
when you're done with them,
you return them.

00:09:01.704 --> 00:09:04.827
If you don't return them,
you can't check more things out,

00:09:04.851 --> 00:09:08.087
but once you do,
it's all forgiven, it's fine.

00:09:08.954 --> 00:09:10.374
You can check out again.

00:09:10.819 --> 00:09:12.675
Others continue to charge fines,

00:09:12.699 --> 00:09:15.577
but they want to offer alternatives
to their library patrons,

00:09:15.601 --> 00:09:19.281
and so they do things like food for fines,
where you bring in canned goods,

00:09:19.305 --> 00:09:22.395
or read away your fines,
where you can read off your fines.

00:09:22.419 --> 00:09:24.387
There's even another library in Wisconsin

00:09:24.411 --> 00:09:26.734
that offers scratch-off tickets
at their counter,

00:09:26.758 --> 00:09:30.935
so you can scratch off and get
10 or 20 percent off your fines that day.

00:09:30.959 --> 00:09:32.869
And there are amnesty days.

00:09:32.893 --> 00:09:35.744
One day a year, you bring back
your late materials

00:09:35.768 --> 00:09:37.101
and all is forgiven.

00:09:38.664 --> 00:09:42.291
There was a library in San Francisco
that did an amnesty day last year,

00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:45.837
and they welcomed back
5,000 users who had been blocked.

00:09:46.585 --> 00:09:51.298
That same day, they received
more than 700,000 items that were overdue.

00:09:52.392 --> 00:09:55.401
Among them was one book
that was 100 years overdue.

00:09:56.377 --> 00:09:59.964
So I know that sounds ridiculous,
but I know from experience

00:09:59.988 --> 00:10:02.300
that people will stay away
from the library

00:10:02.324 --> 00:10:04.561
rather than face
the authority of the librarian

00:10:04.585 --> 00:10:06.076
when they have late items.

00:10:06.521 --> 00:10:09.879
As Michael might have mentioned,
I've been a librarian for 15 years

00:10:09.903 --> 00:10:12.577
and my mom hasn't been
in a library in decades,

00:10:12.601 --> 00:10:15.228
because when she was young,
she lost a book.

00:10:18.006 --> 00:10:20.458
So, these are great baby steps.

00:10:20.879 --> 00:10:23.252
But they don't go far enough,

00:10:23.276 --> 00:10:27.660
because they make people
jump through hoops.

00:10:28.134 --> 00:10:30.767
They have to come on the right days,
at the right times.

00:10:30.791 --> 00:10:33.832
They might have to have
extra food to share.

00:10:33.856 --> 00:10:36.863
They want to read away their fines,
they need to be literate.

00:10:37.847 --> 00:10:40.428
If we want people
to use the library again,

00:10:41.879 --> 00:10:44.812
we should just get rid
of fines altogether.

00:10:46.236 --> 00:10:48.591
Now, you might think
I've forgotten a money piece,

00:10:48.615 --> 00:10:51.130
where we need to finance libraries, right?

00:10:51.752 --> 00:10:53.767
But there's a couple of things to consider

00:10:53.791 --> 00:10:58.027
when we think about how fines function
in library budgets.

00:10:59.379 --> 00:11:04.372
The first is that fines have never been
a stable source of revenue.

00:11:04.396 --> 00:11:06.133
They've always fluctuated,

00:11:06.157 --> 00:11:10.841
and in fact, they've continued to go down
over the last few decades.

00:11:11.661 --> 00:11:15.282
When the recession hit, especially,
people's ability to pay was hit, as well.

00:11:15.844 --> 00:11:19.137
So for a lot of those 10,000 friends
that we've got at the library

00:11:19.161 --> 00:11:20.820
that aren't able to use it,

00:11:20.844 --> 00:11:22.807
they might never be able to pay us.

00:11:22.831 --> 00:11:24.840
When we talk about
eliminating their fines,

00:11:24.864 --> 00:11:27.588
we're not losing money
so much as the idea of money.

00:11:29.831 --> 00:11:33.608
And thirdly, you might be
surprised to know

00:11:33.632 --> 00:11:37.125
fines on average, nationally,
are about one and a half percent

00:11:37.149 --> 00:11:39.029
of a library's operating budget.

00:11:39.505 --> 00:11:41.315
Now that can still be a lot of money.

00:11:41.339 --> 00:11:44.305
If you're looking at a large library
or a large library system,

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:45.950
the dollar amount can be high.

00:11:45.974 --> 00:11:49.488
But it's an achievable cut
for most libraries to absorb.

00:11:50.768 --> 00:11:55.812
And finally, and maybe most importantly,
fines cost us money to collect.

00:11:56.395 --> 00:11:59.947
When you start to factor in
all of the ways that we collect fines,

00:11:59.971 --> 00:12:04.240
supplies like mailers that we send out
to remind people of their fines,

00:12:05.129 --> 00:12:09.260
services, like collections
management services,

00:12:09.284 --> 00:12:12.530
even telephone and email notifications
can cost libraries money.

00:12:13.264 --> 00:12:17.309
And staff time is a huge
cost for libraries.

00:12:17.804 --> 00:12:20.081
So that our frontline staff
is standing there,

00:12:20.105 --> 00:12:24.019
talking to people about their fines,
sometimes arguing with people about fines.

00:12:25.077 --> 00:12:27.870
When we eliminate all of those pieces,

00:12:27.894 --> 00:12:31.489
if we got rid of fines, we might actually
save money in our libraries.

00:12:31.513 --> 00:12:33.022
Or at the very least,

00:12:33.046 --> 00:12:35.268
we would be able
to reallocate our staff time

00:12:35.292 --> 00:12:38.066
to pursuits that better fit
those missions we talked about.

00:12:40.363 --> 00:12:43.150
The other thing I want everybody
to come away understanding

00:12:43.174 --> 00:12:46.347
is that fines don't actually work
to do what we think they do.

00:12:46.371 --> 00:12:47.613
The debate about fines --

00:12:47.637 --> 00:12:50.926
whether we should fine,
how much we should fine, it isn't new.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.863
We've been talking about it
for almost 100 years.

00:12:54.307 --> 00:12:56.251
As long as that book was overdue.

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:02.061
Study after study has shown
that the reason libraries fine

00:13:02.085 --> 00:13:04.426
is because of strongly held beliefs

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.728
about the effectiveness
of getting materials back on time

00:13:07.752 --> 00:13:09.219
backed by no evidence.

00:13:10.474 --> 00:13:13.607
Basically, we fine
because we've always fined.

00:13:14.871 --> 00:13:19.973
So, the best option for your libraries
is to put their mission first.

00:13:20.776 --> 00:13:24.466
And they will do that
if their community members ask it of them.

00:13:24.918 --> 00:13:27.760
When you leave here,
I hope you'll visit your public library

00:13:27.784 --> 00:13:29.156
and talk to your librarians,

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.244
talk to your neighbors
and community members

00:13:31.268 --> 00:13:32.696
who serve on library boards.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.396
Tell them that you know
how important literacy is

00:13:36.673 --> 00:13:38.673
to everyone in your community.

00:13:39.206 --> 00:13:43.023
That if our libraries
are truly for everyone,

00:13:43.047 --> 00:13:46.537
that they have to get rid of fines
and embrace their entire community.

00:13:47.245 --> 00:13:48.395
Thank you.

00:13:48.988 --> 00:13:52.047
(Applause)
