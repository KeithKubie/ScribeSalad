00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.300
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:22.620
[silence]

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.660
&gt;&gt; JOAN WEEKS: Good afternoon
ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.190
on behalf of my colleagues, and
in particular Dr. Mary Jane Deeb,

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.280
Chief of the African and
Middle East Division,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.250
I'd like to extend
a very warm welcome

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.580
to everyone on this very rainy day.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.280
So thank you for coming.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.230
I'm Joan Weeks, head of
the Near East section

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.500
that is sponsor of today's program.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.630
And we're very pleased
to present this program

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.980
on Islam Facts and Fictions.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.200
But before we start today's
program and introduce our speaker,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.020
I'd like to just give you
brief overview of the division

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.500
and its resources in
hopes that some of you

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.490 position:56%
who are newcomers will come back
and do research in our reading room.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.200
So this is a custodial collection,
a division which is comprised

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.770
of three sections that build
and serve our collections

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.900
to researchers from
around the world.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.710
We cover of 78 countries, and
more than two dozen languages.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.450
The Africa section
includes the countries

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.850
of all of Sub Sahara Africa.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.050 position:56%
The Hebraic section is responsible
for Judaica, and Hebraica worldwide.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.190 position:56%
And the Near East section covers all

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.400
of the Arab countries including
North Africa, and the Middle East,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.410
and covers Turkey, Turkic
Central Asia, Iran, Afghanistan,

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.490
and the Muslims in Western China,
and the people of the Caucases.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.370
After the program we'd invite
you to fill in these surveys

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.030
that we've left in your chairs.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.350
This helps us plan and evaluate
programs for the future.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.360
And I'd also like to invite you
to try out our Four Corners blog,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.980 position:56%
and I've left this little paper that
tells you where you can find that,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.410
with special stories and very in
depth research by our specialists.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.060
And we're on Facebook, so if you
like us on Facebook you'll hear

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.290
about all our latest programs,
and you'll receive alerts.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.570
So, we invite you to
take advantage of this.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.610
Also we invite you to
ask questions at the end,

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.630
but just so that you know,
this is being videotaped,

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.470
and if you ask questions you're
implicitly giving permission

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.290
to be videotaped.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.510
Also we'd like to invite
you after the program

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.200
to the book signing event.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.490
Our authors got a number of books
here for everyone that would

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.680
like one to have it signed.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.620
And so without further
ado I'd like to call

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.290
on my colleague Dr. Muhannad
Salhi, our Arab of world specialist

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.970
to introduce our speaker.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.910
Thank you.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.150
&gt;&gt; MUHANNAD SALHI: Good
afternoon everybody,

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.450
thank you all for joining us.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.440
It gives me great pleasure to
introduce our speaker today.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.960 position:56%
We're very lucky to have him, Dr.
Chase Robinson, who is the president

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.830
and distinguished professor of
history of the Graduate Center

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.810
of the City University of New York.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.450
Since 2013, Chase F. Robinson
has served as president

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.560
of the Graduate Center of the
City University of New York,

the hub of research, doctoral
education, and advanced learning

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.020
for the nation's largest
urban university.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:39.000
Between 2008 and 2013, Robinson was
provost and senior vice president.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.120
Before joining the Graduate Center,
he was professor of Islamic history

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.890
and chairman of the faculty
board of Oriental studies

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.290
at the University of Oxford.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.920
Educated in the United States,
France, and the Middle East,

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.850
he holds a BA from Brown
University and a PHD from Harvard.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.020
A historian of the
premodern Middle East,

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.880
Robinson holds the faculty rank
of distinguished professor,

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.300
and teaches courses
on Islamic history.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.730
He has held the visiting
appointments at the University

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.570
of California Los Angeles,
and the Institute

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.810
for Advanced Studies Princeton.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.990
A member of the council on foreign
relations, he is the author,

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.990
or editor of eight books,
and more than forty articles,

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.600
most recently Islamic
Civilization In Thirty Lives.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.240
He serves on several editorial
boards, including past and present

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.820
in the Cambridge Series in Islamic
Civilization which he chairs.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.320 position:56%
He has written commentaries that

Supplement,

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.920
The Times Literary
Supplement, and many others.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.060
As Joan mentioned, we are
going to have a book signing

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.840
at the end, so please stay and ...

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.040
The book that I mentioned
Islamic Civilization

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.640
In Thirty Lives will be
available for purchase.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:11.850
So without further ado,
Dr. Chase Robinson.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.150
[applause]

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.450
&gt;&gt; CHASE ROBINSON: Thank
you so much for coming,

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:15.880
what a pleasure it is to be here.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:22.560
I'd like to thank Dr.
Salhi as well as Joan

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.200
for her kind comments
in welcoming me.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.070
I'm especially grateful to
all of you for venturing

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.530
out on such inopportune day.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:33.840
I do appreciate it.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.590
It's a great pleasure to talk about
my work, and rather than just talk

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.090
about my work- I don't know my
dog, or my cats, or my wife,

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.860
it's nice to talk about what I
feel strongly about with those

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.490
who I think, at least to
judge by your presence,

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.940
and overcoming the obstacles of the
day, obviously share an interest.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.280
I should also say before I get
going on the substance of my,

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:05.770 position:56%
for the most part informal comments,
that as an educator, as a scholar,

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.350
a researcher, a university
president,

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.000
it is a particular
pleasure to be here.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.720
Can you hear me?

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.480
You can't hear me, I will bark.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.450
A particular pleasure
to be here in a library

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:33.250
in which I did some research a
long time ago, during my PHD.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:44.930
Along the same lines, I think
it is a glory of our democracy

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:50.740
that our civic institutions
are as strong as they are.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.870
It's to our collective credit,
and I think it's also a function

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:02.750
of our democratic spirit
that we cultivate learning,

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.670
we maintain learning, and
we respect the past the way

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:08.960
that we do in libraries.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:16.380
So, what I'll do is I'll say a few
words of autobiographical nature.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:20.680
I will try not to slip into
solipsism, or self-indulgence.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.650
I think it'll become clear why
I'm speaking autobiographically,

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.320
at least initially.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.450
Then I'll make some stray comments
about scholarly responsibility,

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:34.190
and then I'll talk
about the book proper.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:40.900
I've decided just to let the
attractive slides scroll.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.870
I'll let you draw your
own connections

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.790 position:56%
between the comments I'll be making,
especially in the second half

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.600
of my remarks, but
they are attractive.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.440
And I thought if nothing else they
are a good break from the monotony

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.040
of my appearance at the stage.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:00.050
Do enjoy them, they should be for
the most part self-explanatory.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.110
So, a few years ago I gave a
paper at a community college

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:09.590
within the CUNY system, which was
called, Not An Obvious Thing To Do.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:14.680 position:56%
And the reason I've given this paper
this title, is that by that point

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.230 position:56%
of my career I'd been asked, I
don't know 500 times, Jane McAuliffe

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.580
in the audience, she's
probably been asked 500 times,

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.420
why do you do Islamic history?

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.440
It's not an obvious thing to do.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:34.060
None of my forbearers
are Muslim, or Arab.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:38.960 position:56%
I'd never been to the Middle East
before I'd taken interest in Arabic.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:44.690
It was not an obvious thing to do.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:51.220 position:56%
My own background is I think utterly
ordinary in America, which is to say

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:57.690
that I've got immigrants on
both sides of my parents.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:04.870
My mother, her parents
came from what is now,

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:12.990
well the former Yugoslavia, and
they were ethnic Ukrainians.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:17.260
So I grew up in a house
in which my mother

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:21.400
and my grandmother spoke Ukrainian,
obviously to keep secrets from me.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:25.650
But at the same time I grew up in
a house that was filled with kind

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:28.130
of third rate Chin
Wazari, kind of beaten

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:32.040
up late 19th century Chinese
furniture, because my grandfather

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:37.000
on my dad's side had been a
missionary doctor in China.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.650 position:56%
As it happens my mother was a French
teacher, so I think I grew up,

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:47.880
and again I think utterly
ordinary, at least in the respect

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.710
that my parents were
immigrants, or the sons

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:52.880
and daughters of an immigrant.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.410
But fortunate, and I do want to
underline how fortunate I feel,

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:02.290
to have grown up in a household
in which foreign cultures,

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:10.250
foreign languages were taken for
granted, were understood to be part

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:14.030
of one's education,
learning foreign languages,

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.160
and appreciating foreign cultures.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.990
Now as it happened
when I was a teenager,

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:22.690
the Middle East began
to, how shall I put it?

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:27.130
Grow more salient, at least in
the American public imagination.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:34.390
I have dim memories of the long
lines when the price of gas spiked.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:40.010
I have clearer memories, by
this point I was a teenager,

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.050
of course of the Iranian
revolution, of Camp David,

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:47.510
the Iranian revolution, and
the controversy that attached

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:52.060
to Salman Rushdie and
the affair of the fatwa.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.460
So, I think those were
the circumstances

00:10:54.460 --> 00:11:01.710
in which I either wisely, or
unwisely decided not to do what

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:03.700
to my thinking would have
been the obvious thing to do,

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:08.790
which is to study Chinese,
and instead study Arabic.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:12.990
As many of you will know Arabic is
a devilishly difficult language,

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.480 position:56%
but an extremely rewarding language,

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:20.740
a language that reveals
culture in a very powerful way.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:27.430
I began the study of Arabic and
spent some time in the Middle East,

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.750
after having spent a year
in France in high school.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:33.270
I spent two years living in Cairo,
and at that point I threw myself

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:35.840
into early Islamic history.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.700
Now what is early?

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:41.560
Historians like to periodize, it's
not always clear what we mean.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.660
Early Islamic history is typically
thought to be the seventh, eighth,

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.170
or ninth century, then
sometimes historians talk

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.230
about classical Islamic history.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:52.170
As many of you in this
room will know,

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.230
that means the origins of Islam.

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:59.760
Muhammed we think was born
around 570, maybe 580.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.350
We certainly know that the
Hijra, he grew up in Mecca

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:08.060
in a small oasis town
in Western Arabia.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.850
We know that in 622, we
have good evidence for that,

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:16.550
he made his emigration, his
Hijra from Mecca to Medina.

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:20.760
And we know that, and this
date is slightly less secure,

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.880
but we're pretty confident
in 632 he died.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:29.220
So, early Islamic history
covers the appearance of Islam,

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.690
the career of Muhammed, and
then the successor caliphs,

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:39.600
the Umayyad dynasty, and
the early Abbasid empire.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.220
What I like to say about this
period, and I say it shamelessly,

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:48.140
when I'm teaching I brook
no dissent from my students.

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:54.470 position:56%
I say there is no period in recorded
human history more interesting

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.030
than early Islamic history.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:13:02.910
The first century of Islam is
unprecedented as I like to put it,

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:05.820
in its cultural productivity.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.460 position:56%
In the first century of Islam, maybe
first century and half if you'd

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:14.140
like to be more conservative,
a religion was created, Islam,

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:18.270
a language was created, Arabic.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.330
There were varieties of
Arabic that predate Islam,

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:25.210
but it had not been systematized,
hadn't become a written language.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:31.310
A religion was created, a language
was created, an empire was created,

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:35.910
the Umayyad caliphate, the Abbasid
caliphate when at its largest,

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:38.550
stretched from the Western
Mediterranean all the way

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:41.710
to what is now Afghanistan
and beyond.

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:45.380
And finally a people
were created, the Arabs.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:50.290
Because the Arabs as we now know
are very much a function of Islam,

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:52.620
and early Islamic history.

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:58.710
So, I threw myself into this, of
course at the time I wasn't able

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:01.950
to theorize it in the
way that I do now.

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:13.150
But I found it hugely fascinating,
and again to emphasize the fortune

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:17.030
that I experienced, I was
very very fortunate not only

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:23.600
to have received terrific training,
but then to be as was mentioned

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.360
in the introduction, at
Oxford for many years

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.710
in what was probably
the strongest department

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:35.970
in the world in what I do.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.890
[pause] Having been educated,

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:43.860
having been as it were invested
in, I think I was failing.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:47.230
I think I was being irresponsible.

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:49.360
I didn't feel this at the time,

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.700
but in retrospect I think
I was being irresponsible,

00:14:53.700 --> 00:15:02.760
I think I was failing because it's
not enough to publish articles

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.850
in the Journal of the Royal
Asiatic Society, or the Journal

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:12.080 position:56%
of the American Oriental Society, or
an Annual Journal of Syriac studies,

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.360
or the Bulletin of the School
of Royal African studies.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.840
It's not enough, at
least it feels to me now,

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:24.500
to write to pretty small
audiences of scholars

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:34.710
about fairly arcane topics without
speaking to the larger public,

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:39.740
especially in a moment in which
as I've already intimated,

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:43.100
the Middle East was
becoming much more salient.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:58.290
So, about seven or eight years ago,
as it were I woke up and I began

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:05.820
to consider ways in which I
could be more responsible,

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:11.360
and address what I
think we all understand

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:19.590
to be some deep entirely
understandable, but deep levels

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:24.530
of both ignorance, and it
must regrettably be said,

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:28.760 position:56%
hostility towards Islam and Muslims.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:36.200
Let me just give you three or four
indexes of that ignorance and that,

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.560
again I regret to say,
a measure of hostility.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:45.160
I found myself being asked the
kind of questions that were

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:51.430
so fundamental that it made
me wonder how is it that we

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:55.450
as scholars have been so
poor at informing the public.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:17:00.760
Fundamental questions,
why do they hate us?

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.600
What is Jihad?

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.990
Does Islam need a reformation?

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:09.560
What's the difference
between Sunnis and Shiites?

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.900
Was Islam spread by the sword?

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:14.860
What is Sharia?

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:19.790
Fundamental questions, which were
for the most part were being left

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:28.440 position:56%
to polemicists, or apologists, or
ill-informed commentators to answer.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:32.020
That's one index.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:36.870
Another index, and indulge me a
little bit of irreverence here,

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:39.770
is what I call the tale of Agrabah.

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:42.770
Some of you will know
the tale of Agrabah.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:49.280 position:56%
In the heat of the primary season
last year, voters were asked whether

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.360
or not they favored
the city of Agrabah.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:56.240
30% of Republicans
favored bombing Agrabah,

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.400
19% of Democrats favored
bombing Agrabah,

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:04.540
13% of Republicans
thought it was a bad idea,

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:08.060
36% of Democrats thought
it was a bad idea.

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.420
I'm not poking fun at
any political party,

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.570
I have made an oath
to be nonpartisan.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:17.910
44% of Democrats, when asked a
week later in a follow up poll

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:23.640 position:56%
that was commissioned, do they favor
welcoming refugees from Agrabah,

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:28.040
44% did favor welcoming
refugees from Agrabah.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:32.590
Of course you all know that
Agrabah is a confection

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:36.040
of the Disney corporation.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.360
It was concocted in 1992.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.140
It's a setup of course.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:46.160
And I think a question like
that demands a response.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.330
Your average respondent
does not want

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:52.720
to sound ignorant,
so he or she opines.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.410
I don't think you would
get that kind of question

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:57.500
if there were a greater
cultural awareness,

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.750
historical awareness,
geographic awareness.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:09.040
I think it says something
about attitudes that we

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:14.520
so readily answer questions
about places that don't exist.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:20.850
Another index would be the
terrific work that the Pew does.

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:24.180
They've done it in 2015,
they did it again in 2017.

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:27.650
They asked Americans how they
felt about other religious groups.

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:34.690
And they asked Americans to assign
a temperature as a measurement

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:39.280
of their warmth, to assign a
temperature about their feelings

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.270
about other religious groups on
as it were a feelings thermometer.

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:52.170
The warmest Americans felt
was towards Jews, Catholics,

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:58.620
and Evangelical Christians,
at 62, 62, 63, 61 degrees.

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:03.530
The chilliest they felt,
this was the data from 2015,

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:06.410
was about Muslims, 40 degrees.

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:14.610
It says something in a culture
as religious as the United States

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:17.990
that Muslims fared even
worse than atheists

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:20.450
on that feelings thermometer.

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:26.730
The same question was put
more recently and some

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:29.460
of the chilliness has
subsided, we're now up to,

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:32.880
I don't know what you'd call
48, it's obviously not warm.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:40.210
A fourth and final index, and
here much is said about this,

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:43.820
so I'll say very little, and
this is highly politicized,

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:48.640 position:56%
but I think it is uncontroversial to
acknowledge that there is a measure

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:53.350
of Islamophobia at the intellectual
political discursive level

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:57.050
on both the right, and the left.

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:58.840
On the right, it tends
to be associated

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.710
with a neoconservative point
of view, on the left it tends

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:05.850
to be associated with
the new atheists.

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:07.550
And the one example
that I would mention,

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:09.280
and there are several others,

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:13.150
would be Christopher Hitchens'
book, God Is Not Great.

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:19.020
It strikes me as utterly
understandable that a polemic

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:25.300
against religion would take
the form of, as it were,

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:31.140
poking fun at an Islamic expression
"God is great," God is not great.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:36.010
So, we find ourselves in a
world with 1.7 billion Muslims.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:40.840
We find ourselves in a world in
which Islam is the world's largest,

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.610
fastest growing religion.

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:46.960
A child born in 2017 will
probably live in a world

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.050
in which Islam is more
populist than Christianity,

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:53.690
by the end of this century.

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:55.230
And that will be the
first time in roughly four

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:57.880
or five hundred years
that's been the case.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.550
So, I return to this question
of the scholar's responsibility,

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:09.810
and I turn now directly
to the book that I wrote,

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:12.090
a book which gave me
great pleasure to write.

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:20.720
It's a scholars responsibility
obviously, this is benow,

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:25.640
but I'll say it all the same, to
speak out, to educate, to inform,

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:33.050 position:56%
to escape from disciplinary jargon,
to escape the vernacular or the cant

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:36.290
of an academy which can be,
shall we say very forbidding

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:39.670
to those outside of it.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:44.790
In my case, what I wanted to
do was to make a millennium

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:49.180
of Islamic history, a thousand
years of Islamic history readable,

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:53.730
intelligible, provocative,
interesting.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:01.350
The way I organized the book
was in 30 short chapters.

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:04.810
Let me say one or two, three words
about the organization of the book,

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:07.280
and then I'll talk about
the context of the book.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.530 position:56%
30 short chapters, we live in an age

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:14.150
of shall we say declining
attention span,

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:17.310 position:56%
in which shorter form literature ...

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:23.620
I was more than happy as it were,
to embrace the challenge of writing

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:28.300
in such a way that one could spend
10 or 15 minutes and come away

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.890
with an appreciation for an aspect

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:34.720
of Islamic history,
Islamic civilization.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:39.210
I chose obviously to
write biography.

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.930
Why biography?

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:43.770
For a few reasons.

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:52.000
Number one, there is a
continuing, a vexed in my view,

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.470
an entirely inconclusive,

00:23:55.470 --> 00:24:01.720
and increasingly sterile
literature about what is Islam.

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:05.470
Some of you will know Sahaba Maad's
most recent book, hundreds of pages

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:07.560
of long, it really doesn't
answer the question.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:12.500
It tells you what Islam
is not, not what Islam is.

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:20.360 position:56%
Biography to my thinking, refocuses
the questions to what do Muslims do?

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.820
What do Muslims think?

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:26.160
What form do they give to Islam?

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.230
It I think allows us
to avoid, if not all,

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:34.910
at least some of these problems
of essentialism, and perennialism

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:38.700
that attach whenever you try to
define a religious tradition.

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:46.600
I also found biographical writing
an attractive medium because,

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.210
and this ...

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:51.450
Excuse me if it sounds a bit trite.

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:54.000
Every day we write our
own biographies by living,

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.680
and remembering, and narrating.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:03.850 position:56%
And I really wanted people, and this
is fundamental purposes of the book,

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:06.610
something about which I feel
almost a kind of missionary zeal,

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:11.520
I wanted people to understand
Muslims as individuals.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:16.100
What better way than
to tell their stories?

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:19.900
And finally those of you who know
the Islamic literary tradition,

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.710
and it is an extraordinary
literary tradition,

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:26.250
you will know that biographical
writing is a huge component.

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:30.660 position:56%
There are biographical dictionaries
that feature biographies of hundreds

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:33.390
of thousands of individuals.

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:39.230
So this was a kind of
homage, in my very modest way

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:44.160
to such an important feature of
the Islamic literary tradition.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:58.690
Islam is commonly seen as narrowly,
sometimes severely legalistic.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:05.690
It is often seen as intrinsically
violent, even nihilistic.

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:11.850
I set out in this book not just
to make Islamic history readable

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:19.850
or accessible, but to complexify,
to debunk, and I'll do a little bit

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:24.570
of debunking in a moment,
but never to apologize.

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:27.950
If there are any apologetics

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:32.030
in the book then it's a
mistake, which I deeply regret.

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:38.250
Islamic history, the Islamic
tradition, intellectual

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:41.750
and otherwise is an
extraordinary feature,

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:49.520
an extraordinary accomplishment
which deserves respect,

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.810
but is resilient to
criticism in my mind.

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:57.800
The achievement is so
significant, 1400 years of history,

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:02.130
the cultural productivity is
so prolific, the insights are

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:11.060
so trenchant, the creativity, the
productivity are so impressive

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:19.180 position:56%
that to my mind the
responsibility that a scholar has is

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:25.240
to understand it, and present
it, not to apologize for aspects

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:31.860
which may seem less attractive
than people would wish them to be.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:37.360
You will find, those of you
who know something about Islam,

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:41.800
and Islamic history,
some familiar figures.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:46.400
There's a little bit of a test
that I put to experts in the field.

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:51.800
Only one person in the
field knows all 30 subjects.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:57.810
Most of my colleagues know
26, or 27, I put a few jokers

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:02.800
in the deck just to make things
interesting for my fellow scholars.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:11.600
Salah ad-Din Saladin is
the subject of a biography.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.590 position:56%
Someone named al-Ma'mun who is a son

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:18.680
of H r n al-Rash d is
the subject of a biography.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:22.490
Muhammed Ali the cousin,
and son in law of Muhammed,

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:25.850
of course one can't
understand Sunniism

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:28.980
and shiism without understand Ali.

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:32.530
A'isha some of you will know.

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:38.660
Ibn Taymiyya, here we're one remove
I think from a broad awareness,

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:42.840
but those of you who follow
Islamism and Salafism will be aware

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:48.960
of Ibn Taymiyya as a very
significant 14th century scholar.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:55.100
So, on the one hand, and this is
by way of amplifying my comments

00:28:55.100 --> 00:29:01.080
about explaining the tradition
as comprehensively as I can

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:07.510
within the framework of 30
biographies, I do address legalism,

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:12.150
men commanders, fighters, caliphs.

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:16.670
On the other hand, and of
course you'll sense that this is

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:25.810 position:56%
where my provocative part of my work
settles, an area in which I thought

00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:29.120
that most of my readers
would be unfamiliar,

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:32.760
you will find free thinkers, you
will find philosophers, scientists,

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:38.770
cartographers, historians,
poets, one merchant tycoon

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:43.040
of whom I'll say a word or two,
mystics, and one courtesan,

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.700
and I'll say a word about
that courtesan as well.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:52.940
Let me just, for the sake of
being a little bit more precise,

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:55.370
read just a paragraph
from the introduction.

00:29:55.370 --> 00:30:01.380
It puts the best words I could
put to my ideas at the time.

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:06.020
I've composed 30 brief biographies
which can hint at the scale,

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:08.870
diversity, and creativity
of Islamic civilization

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:10.890
over about a millennium.

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:17.430
I should like to emphasize from the
start that diversity and creativity

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:20.780
which were generated in
large measure by that scale.

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:23.780
Not merely the size of
polities, cities, wealth,

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:27.590
networks of learning,
even libraries,

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:31.380
but also intellectual,
and political ambition.

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:34.370
We shall see that for
some Muslim thinkers,

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:38.400
the sky, not God was the limit.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:44.770
In using the terms, diversity and
creativity, I aim to capture a wide

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:50.510 position:56%
and inadequately acknowledged
spectrum of ideas, social practices,

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:53.160
and personal styles,
and commitments.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:56.770
There was legalism, and
dogmatism of course,

00:30:56.770 --> 00:31:00.420
but so too was their hyper
rationalism, skepticism,

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:06.500
inventiveness, iconoclasm,
and eccentric individuality.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:11.710
For the Islamic civilization that I
shall be describing here, dynamism,

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:17.810
experimentation, and risk
taking were the rule.

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:21.880
And I stop in the early 16th
century, not because that diversity

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:28.790 position:56%
and creativity dried up, not because
that civilization stultified,

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:32.080
but because the underlying
economic and political framework

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:38.100
of the preindustrial Middle East
began to undergo major changes.

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:45.490
&gt;&gt; CHASE ROBINSON: Let me give
you four examples very briefly.

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:50.120
And I have considered
pausing the scrolling.

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:54.830
I considered pausing
the scrolling images,

00:31:54.830 --> 00:32:00.120
but I realize I probably wouldn't
be able to start it again.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:06.120
So I said earlier on
that I wanted to debunk

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:15.050 position:56%
and problematize four examples,
each a theme, each trying to debunk,

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:18.070
problematize, what I regard to be,

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:21.970
and I hope you'd agree
a misunderstanding

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:24.280
at the popular level.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:30.960
Islam and women, the
stereotypes are about veiling,

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:38.140
they're about seclusion, about
privatized domestic space,

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:44.000
they're about women disempowered
by political tradition,

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.110
even infantilized by Islamic law.

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:53.400
I tackle four women, A'isha, a
woman named Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:58.040
who was a mystic, a
woman named Arib,

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:01.130
and a great scholar named
Karima al-Marwaziyya,

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:04.620 position:56%
she's one of the jokers in the deck.

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:07.890
Very few scholars know
of Karima al-Marwaziyya,

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:09.610
a very significant
scholar in her day.

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:15.910 position:56%
Let me say a word or two about Arib.

00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:22.570
Arib was born in the early 9th
century in Iraq, Southern Iraq.

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:29.520
She was born in unclear
circumstances, it would appear

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:33.720
that she was born to a very wealthy
family, a family even part of,

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:38.180
or certainly closely connected to
the Abbasid court, but for reasons

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:42.390
that we don't fully understand,
misfortune fell upon that family,

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:50.430
she was sold into slavery, not
an altogether uncommon event.

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:52.930
Slavery was widespread
in the ancient world,

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:58.420
it survives into Islamic
civilization as it does others.

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:03.820
Now the story could have ended
there, but Arib who lived

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:09.180
to probably 95, or 97, we're not
really sure, she died just two

00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:12.560
or three years left
in the 9th century.

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:16.270
She was someone of some
extraordinary talents.

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:21.340
She had a gift for music, she
had a gift for literature.

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:27.490 position:56%
By the time she was a late teenager,
she had gained the attention

00:34:27.490 --> 00:34:29.400
of many members of the court,

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:36.340 position:56%
and she had embarked upon what would
be a six or seven decade long career

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:46.050
as a performer, as a courtesan,
as a public figure in Baghdad,

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:49.080
a city with which you're all
familiar, at least on the map,

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.890
and also the city of Samarra.

00:34:50.890 --> 00:34:53.230
It is hard for a historian of Islam

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:57.990
to watch what's happened
in Samarra take place.

00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:02.910 position:56%
Because Samarra in the middle of the
9th century was an imperial capital.

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:09.230
Just again a few sentences to
give you some sense of Arib.

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:12.340
Arib confounds the social
and gender categories

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:15.750
that we typically impose
upon Islamic civilization,

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:20.200
a slave who sold her
musical and personal services

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:24.960
to the most powerful men of her
time, she was pilot of a career

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:29.250
that rode the waves of Baghdad
culture for nearly a century.

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:31.630
A self-promoting performer,

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:37.300
an inventor of her own brand
of fearless insouciance.

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:44.230 position:56%
In her time she was at once the most
famous, and infamous of the qiyan,

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:49.030
female slave performers
of an urban elite in Iraq.

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:52.780
Nowadays we would call
her a singer songwriter,

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:55.540
because she composed poetry
that she set to music,

00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:59.920
reportedly some 1000 songs.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.740
But above all she was a celebrity,

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:05.260
a mix of Elizabeth
Taylor and Amy Winehouse.

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:10.360
The glory and scourge of
Abbasid Baghdad, and Samarra.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:14.010
"I never saw a more beautiful,
or refined woman than Arib,

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:19.350
" the leading 9th century
authority on music held.

00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:22.950
"Nor one who sang, played
music, wrote poetry,

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:25.280
or played chess so well."

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:28.420
If you were to be a serious
member of the Abbasid court

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:33.510
in this learned culture you
had to be a mean chess player.

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:36.960
"She possessed every
quality of elegance and skill

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:41.560 position:56%
that one could wish for in a woman."

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:46.340
There is on one of the
slides a picture of one

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:54.210
of these slave performers, which
is from an 8th century palace,

00:36:55.710 --> 00:37:04.260
probably drawn, painted, 40 or
50 years before Arib was born.

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:08.390
Second theme, science in Islam.

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:13.030
Again the popular imagination,
well education is

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:15.060
in crisis in the Middle East.

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:22.190 position:56%
A report issued in 2015, showed
that although Muslim populations are

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:24.300 position:56%
about 25% of the world's population,

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:28.270
the majority of Muslim
populations produce about 6%

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:29.690
of the worlds published research.

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:31.970
Of course there are all
sorts of reasons for that,

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:35.770
but in the popular imagination
there is an incompatibility

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:41.420
between the irrationality
of Islam and science.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:46.530
My answer to that, Biruni.

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:51.900
Biruni is an extraordinary
figure of 11th century learning.

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:54.930
He was a genuine polymath.

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:58.190
We tend to use the word
a little bit recklessly.

00:37:58.190 --> 00:38:02.340
In Biruni's case he was a polymath.

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:05.630
He was born in what
is now Uzbekistan,

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:11.390
he appeared to have been
something of a prodigy as a child,

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:20.220
studied music, but by the time
he was advancing towards higher

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:25.680
education, it became clear that
he had very significant talents

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.660
in the exact sciences, mathematics.

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:36.030
By the age of 20, he was observing
the summer solstice and deducing

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:41.880
from observations, a number
of astronomical facts.

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:48.970
He was a very mean theoretical
as well as an applied physicist.

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:54.550
He was as I said, a quite
extraordinary mathematician.

00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:08.450
He commanded the full
spectrum of the sciences,

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:12.710
a term used in Islamic learning
to denote disciplined bodies

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:18.660
of knowledge in ways that
nowadays is hard to fathom.

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:22.780
I mean the closest one would
find would be a Voltaire,

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:26.720
the person who's operating
across that full spectrum

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:31.570
of knowledge before what CP Snow
infamously called the two cultures,

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:36.330 position:56%
humanities, the division between
humanities and the sciences emerged.

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:42.010
In addition to his
extraordinary feats applied

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:46.850
in theoretical science, he
also was a prodigious historian

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:48.820
who wrote arguably one

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:51.790
of the earliest works
of comparative history.

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:55.760
And at the same time, and this
is why one of the respects

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.960
in which he's so interesting,
he was born in Uzbekistan,

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.850
but he was patronized by what's
called the Ghaznavid dynasty,

00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:08.340
and the Ghaznavids were a dynasty
that ruled from Afghanistan,

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:14.800
and waged war, at least for the
first 20 years almost ceaselessly

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.450
in what is now India
on the subcontinent.

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:21.540
And Biruni followed
those campaigning armies,

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:24.680
sucking up Indian learning.

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:29.520
Biruni had not only Arabic,
and Persian, and some Greek,

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:36.890
and some Hebrew, and some
Syriac, he also learned Sanskrit.

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:41.240
So, in addition to being this
extraordinary exact scientist,

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.220
he was a very mean
historian as well,

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:48.570
and he certainly wrote what I
would feel comfortable describing

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:51.700
as the world's first work
of comparative religion,

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:56.270
a book on India in which he
conceptualizes religious traditions

00:40:56.270 --> 00:41:00.610
and compares them to each
other- an Indian tradition,

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:04.020
a Jewish tradition, a Christian
tradition, an Islamic tradition.

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:06.580
There's really nothing else
like it, and he's operating

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:09.680
in the 11th century,
quite extraordinary.

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:14.740
Islam and capitalism.

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:17.690 position:56%
This is another one of my favorites.

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:21.550
Capitalism is retarded one
reads in the Islamic world,

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:25.400
either because of Sharia
, or because of politics,

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:32.620
inheritance law, the relative
weakness of partnerships,

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:34.980
impossibility of joint
stock companies,

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:40.020
endowments that alienate capital
from investment, tax evasion.

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:43.020
There are a whole range of cultural

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:51.160
and religious reasons given why
Islamic economies don't prosper the

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:56.800
way they should, or so we read.

00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:07.790
Abu al-Qasim Ramisht
belongs to the 12th century.

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:17.620
He was from what's now South
West Iran on the coast.

00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:19.630
We know very little about him.

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:23.410
I had to really work hard to
piece together some details.

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:25.960
Interestingly enough he
appears in some histories

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.820
as well as some archives.

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:33.480 position:56%
Let me read to you what one witness,

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:37.990
someone who knew Abu al-Qasim
Ramisht, how he described him.

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:41.770
"Abu al-Qasim Ramisht was one
such wealthy man, a merchant,

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:45.110
a tycoon, and a benefactor."

00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:49.640
A native of the province Fars which
lay in the South West part of Iran.

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:54.290
He made his fortune
by trade and shipping,

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:57.800
especially through
the port of Siraf.

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.020
One observer has it
that Ramisht was one

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:04.030
of Siraf's most wealthy
and celebrated men.

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:07.050
I quote, "It's inhabitants
are very rich.

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:10.320
I was told that one of them
feeling ill drew up his will,

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:13.550
and a third part of his
fortune which he had in cash,

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:16.760
amounted to a million gold
coins, not including the capital

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:20.160
in which he laid out to
people who undertook to trade

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:21.710
with it in a partnership."

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:23.500
Those are technical terms actually,

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:27.210
that partnership is a
financial arrangement,

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:32.390
according to which Ramisht and his
colleagues pooled their capital

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:37.460
and shared at least some of the
risk for long distance shipping.

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:38.940
"Then there is Ramisht."

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:46.670
The source continues, "whose son
Musa I met in Aden in year 539."

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:50.590
Which corresponds to 1144, or 1145.

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:53.580
"He told me that the
silver plate used by him,

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:57.460
when weighed was found
to weigh about a ton.

00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:01.780
Musa is the youngest of his sons,
and he has the least merchandise.

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:06.170
Ramisht himself has four
servants, each of whom is said

00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:08.230
to be richer than his son Musa.

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:12.930
I met someone named Alia Nili
from the countryside of Hela."

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:14.380
A town in Southern Iraq.

00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:17.540
"Who was Ramisht's clerk,
his secretary, and he told me

00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:21.860
that when he returned from China 20
years earlier his merchandise was

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:24.100
worth half a million gold coins.

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:29.230
If that's the wealth of the clerk,
what must Ramisht himself be worth?

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:33.790
It was Ramisht who removed
the silver water spout Kaaba."

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:38.260
The Kaaba as you know sits in the
middle of the sanctuary in Mecca.

00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:41.850
"Replacing it with a gold
one, and who draped the Kaaba

00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:47.660
in Chinese cloth whose
value is beyond estimate.

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:49.950
In some I have heard
of no merchant nowadays

00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:52.440
who is equal Ramisht
in wealth or prestige."

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:59.290
These were acts of conscientious,
he was showing off his wealth.

00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:03.900
He also established benefactions,
and sheltered his wealth.

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:07.520
He made his wealth by
being just one example,

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:13.600
and there would have been hundreds
indeed thousands of shippers,

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:17.530
merchants, by extension
bankers because they lent money,

00:45:17.530 --> 00:45:19.720
who were part of a network of trade

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:22.200
that connected the
Western Mediterranean

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:27.530 position:56%
with the South Indian and China Sea.

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:33.330
All of that trade was possible-
it was facilitated by capital,

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:38.130
by legal instruments,
by coinage, by trust.

00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:42.880
In many respects, in fact many
historians have argued this,

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.570
this was preindustrial capitalism.

00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:52.080
This was a form of
capitalism at work.

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:55.730
A final example, and I'll end here.

00:45:55.730 --> 00:46:00.280
Islam and religious dogma.

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:06.930
Islam we read more less constantly
as fettered by faith, irrational.

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:16.690
My answer there of course is Ibn
Rushd, extraordinary philosopher.

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:20.360
I mentioned Abu al-Qasim Ramisht
belongs to the 12th century,

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:24.230
I've just stayed here in the
9th, 10th, 11th, 12th century,

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:26.900
of course there other examples.

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:31.320
The book begins with Muhammed and
ends in the early 16th century,

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:33.410
but I'm sticking with
the 12th century.

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:39.800
Ramisht was born Iran,
Arib was born in Iraq.

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:44.760
Ibn Rushd or Averroes was born
in Cordoba, of course Spain

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:48.160
in the 12th century was
part of the Islamic world.

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:52.480
He was born into a very
distinguished family of jurists,

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:58.760
of lawyers, but he clearly had had
from an early moment in his life,

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:04.100
a disposition to asking
fundamental questions of the truth.

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:07.590
How does one know things?

00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:12.770
What are the epistemological
basies upon which the law sits?

00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:15.830
How do I understand revelation?

00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:18.030
How do I understand truth?

00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:21.460
Those are not always
questions seek to answer.

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:25.590
Lawyers like to find answers to
problems, either applied problems

00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:28.830
or theoretical problems as
thrown up by the law itself,

00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:31.260
not the underpinnings of the law.

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:37.810 position:56%
At a young age he clearly manifested
an interest in that direction

00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:45.690
and he had the great good
fortune to run into a patron,

00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:53.520
a ruler who commissioned and
fueled his philosophical appetite.

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:57.570
I'll read to you very
briefly the anecdote,

00:47:57.570 --> 00:48:03.930
which in many respects is the pivot
upon which Ibn Rushd's life swings.

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:10.410
"When I entered into the
presence of the caliph Abu Ya'qub,

00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:14.700
I found him with someone named
Abu Bakr Ibn Tufayl alone."

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:17.470
Ibn Tufayl was a philosopher
himself.

00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:21.300
"Abu Bakr Ibn Tufayl
began by praising me."

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:24.610
This is Ibn Rushd speaking
in the first person.

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:29.460
"Mentioning my family, and my
ancestors, and generously including

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:33.120
in the recital achievements
well beyond my real merits,

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:35.510 position:56%
he was flattering me in the presence

00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:41.350
of someone who's patronage he was
trying to arrange for Ibn Rushd.

00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:46.380
The first thing he said to me after
asking my name, my father's name,

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:48.900
and my genealogy, his
bonafides, where do you from,

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:52.190
are you come from a
good family or not?

00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:56.510
The first thing he asked me
was this, what is your opinion

00:48:56.510 --> 00:49:02.340
about the heavens referring to
the views of the philosophers.

00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:05.950
Are they eternal, or
are they created?"

00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:11.290
That's a fundamental question in
Islamic and premodern philosophy,

00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:17.310
is the world created,
or is it eternal?

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:24.250
"Confusion and fear took hold of
me, and I began making excuses

00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:28.550
and denying that I'd ever concern
myself with philosophical learning.

00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:33.450
It was problematic to ask
these fundamental questions.

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:36.870
For I did not know what
Ibn Tufayl had told him."

00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:43.560
In other words, his philosopher
companion had already the caliph

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:45.630
to the idea that here
is a fellow philosopher

00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:48.060
who asks fundamental questions.

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:50.600
Ibn Rushd didn't know that.

00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:54.780
"But the caliph understood
my fear and confusion,

00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:57.630
and turning to Ibn Tufayl began
talking about the question

00:49:57.630 --> 00:50:01.640
of which he had asked me,
mentioning what Aristotle, Plato,

00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:03.100
and all the philosophers had said,

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:05.090
and bringing in beside
the objections

00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:07.210
of the Muslim thinkers
against them."

00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:08.510
What's the point here?

00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:15.740
If we think about our own
tradition, if we think about some

00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:21.900
of the categories of religion and
secular, we think about the rise

00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:26.600
of modern science in the
17th and 18th century.

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:29.420
We don't think really
about Islamic learning.

00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:34.470
In fact Ibn Rushd is
a fascinating example

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:42.470
in which hyper skepticism was cross
pollinating into Southern Europe.

00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:46.820
Ibn Rushd had more than a passing
acquaintance with Aristotle.

00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:52.070
Ibn Rushd, in fact wrote three
separate series of commentaries

00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:57.050 position:56%
on Aristotle, the last of which
deeply learned which were translated

00:50:57.050 --> 00:50:59.930
into Latin very quickly, and began

00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:06.260
to inform Christian European
learning in the 13th century.

00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:08.380
In fact there were
controversies in Paris,

00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:12.960
and other European cities
based on Ibn Rushd's ideas.

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:15.690
And in fact historians of
the enlightenment will say

00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:22.900 position:56%
that there was an underground heresy
that is to say highly iconoclastic,

00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:28.080
highly skeptical views which passed
fundamental questions about God,

00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:32.000
and the world, which owe themselves

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.940
to the Islamic philosophical
tradition, and particular

00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:38.300
to Ibn Rushd's contribution.

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:46.250
"An underground intellectual
heresy" is as one scholar put it.

00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:50.370
13th, 14th, 15th century
Europe, the soil out of

00:51:50.370 --> 00:51:54.240
which our own tradition
grows that was mixed

00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:59.260
in with this Islamic
form of hyper skepticism.

00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:02.350
I could go on, but
I've run out of time.

00:52:02.350 --> 00:52:06.040
I hope I've given you some sense
of what I've tried to achieve

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:08.670
in the book, and I'd be more than
happy to answer any questions.

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:10.470
Thank you.

00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:16.200
[applause]

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:19.640
&gt;&gt; CHASE ROBINSON: The process as
[inaudible] put it, was organic.

00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:22.610
The process was non deliberate.

00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:30.790
On the one hand I wanted to say
something about figures who are,

00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:33.520
for very good reasons
extraordinary influential,

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:38.170
and about whom your average reader
may know already a thing or two,

00:52:38.170 --> 00:52:42.010
Ibn Khaldun, Salah ad-Din.

00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:48.750
On the other hand, and maybe
it's just deeply selfish of me,

00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:50.050
I wanted to learn things.

00:52:50.050 --> 00:52:57.620
I wanted to say new things as
well, and I wanted to stir not just

00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:04.390
to stimulate the curiosity of
readers who don't know much

00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:05.830
about Middle Eastern
Islamic history.

00:53:05.830 --> 00:53:11.460
But at the same time I did
want to introduce figures into,

00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:19.770
if not the canon, then some sense
of personalities and figures,

00:53:19.770 --> 00:53:24.770
who although not widely known,
exemplifies certain traits.

00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:27.560
And a good example would
be Karima al-Marwaziyya,

00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:30.670
she was a Hadith scholar,
and as I said,

00:53:30.670 --> 00:53:33.400
only one Islamicist knows Karima,
and that's because a student

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:38.370
of his wrote a thesis
about Karima al-Marwaziyya.

00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:40.090
She's a wonderful example

00:53:40.090 --> 00:53:48.860
of how women negotiated
these challenging issues

00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:51.980
of modesty and privacy.

00:53:51.980 --> 00:54:00.070 position:56%
So, Karima had enormous significance
within the legal tradition,

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:03.730
or more precisely the transmission
of Hadith, those are sayings

00:54:03.730 --> 00:54:06.930
about the prophet,
because she'd studied

00:54:06.930 --> 00:54:10.590
under a scholar who'd
studied under a scholar

00:54:10.590 --> 00:54:12.340
who who'd studied under Bahari.

00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:15.280
So she was very close to Bahari

00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:17.860
who is a late 9th century
Hadith compiler,

00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:20.170
and an immensely important figure.

00:54:20.170 --> 00:54:23.580
So how do you study with Karima
al-Marwaziyya who is a woman?

00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:28.230 position:56%
You want to study her Hadith because
they come on such high authority.

00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:31.040
So, there are interesting stories
about her just teaching girls,

00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:36.730
or interesting stories about
her teaching boys before they

00:54:36.730 --> 00:54:38.030
become men.

00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:40.030
There are interesting
stories of how she negotiates

00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:41.980
that public private space.

00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:45.120
She was arguably the most
significant Hadith transmitter

00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:48.860
of the time, even though
she was a woman.

00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:50.660
So.

00:54:50.660 --> 00:55:07.510
[pause]

00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:13.330
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: [inaudible]

00:55:13.330 --> 00:55:18.200 position:56%
&gt;&gt; CHASE ROBINSON: It's a very
interesting book about Islamic Spain

00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:25.890
which makes the argument very
forcefully for [inaudible],

00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:34.440
this idea of Muslims,
Christians, and Jews in Iberia,

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:44.890
especially the 12th, 13th,
14th Century, 10th, 11th, 12th.

00:55:44.890 --> 00:55:54.190
Ideas, languages, themes,
problems crossing disciplines

00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:58.720
that in retrospect, we
tend to see as separate.

00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:10.140 position:56%
An extraordinarily fecund, cultural
environment which produced the likes

00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:13.840
of Maimonides, a great
Jewish medieval thinker

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:17.380
who in many respects is a
Muslim, an Islamic thinker.

00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:21.140
Categories for instance, the
law that Maimonides writes

00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:25.910
about is simply not understandable
unless you understand Islamic law.

00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:28.870
So, it's also a beautifully
illustrated book.

00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:31.530
I can recommend it.

00:56:31.530 --> 00:56:34.270
So, I think it's a
very complex question

00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:36.240
and I won't even try to
answer it adequately.

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:39.960
But, I will say that the situation
differs quite dramatically

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:42.760
from one context to the next.

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:47.810 position:56%
So, for instance, I mentioned that
I lived in Egypt for a couple years.

00:56:47.810 --> 00:56:51.590
At that point, this was
the early 80's, early 90's.

00:56:51.590 --> 00:56:53.790
Birth control was being
widely advertised

00:56:53.790 --> 00:56:59.560
and was having real effect on
reducing population growth.

00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:03.220
There's no question- part of the
reason the main driver of growth

00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:05.790
of islamicism demography
in the sense

00:57:05.790 --> 00:57:08.450
that the Muslim populations
tend to be younger

00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:11.270
than non-Muslim populations
and they tend

00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:14.210
to be more prolific of children.

00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:21.700
Those populations are concentrated
in Southeast Asia especially.

00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:24.970
Of course Indonesia as you know, is
the world's most populous country,

00:57:24.970 --> 00:57:27.860
as well as sub-Saharan
Africa and other parts.

00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:33.820
I would say this, that as female
education is a very strong

00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:36.820
correlation to levels of female
education and birth-rights.

00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:40.340
And those levels are
going up all of the time.

00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:45.120
Algeria, Tunisia and there's
a strong argument to be made,

00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:50.030
in fact it has been made, that
population growth is starting,

00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:54.480 position:56%
in the Middle East, given that close
correlation, because of increasing.

00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:59.330
Places like Libya where there was
a lot of women's education as well.

00:57:59.330 --> 00:58:02.820
So, I think in that respect,
the problem is a complex one,

00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:04.420
but also one which is easing

00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:07.510
because of those other
changes that are taking place.

00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:19.210
[pause]

00:58:19.210 --> 00:58:24.780
&gt;&gt; MUHANNAD SALHI: Thank you
very much, Dr. Chase Robinson.

00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:28.970
Thank you all for coming.

00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:30.450
[applause]

00:58:30.450 --> 00:58:34.090
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
