00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.840
Okay, so if you saw my review of the first Cheetah Girls,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.760
You know that I think

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.020
it's the worst of these Disney channel films

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.600
I've seen so far.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.020
So of course, I have to look at Cheetah Girls 2

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.800
and, well, the new is it's not nearly as bad.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.300
Why?

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.600
Well, let's just pick a random scene here:

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.980
"Chill, I've tried everything. She won't budge."

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.480
"There's a dance camp I can teach this summer but,"

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.800
"It's basically babysitting."

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.100
See what they're doing?

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.300
They're TALKING!

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.420
Yeah, they're not giggling, or screaming, or squeaing,

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.320
or jumping up and down, or shouting,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.240
"CHEETAH-LICIOUS!'

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.880
Or doing a dance number out of nowhere!

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.460
They're actually shutting the hell up

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.940
and listening to one another!

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.260
That makes this film a MILLION light-years

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.960
beyond the last one.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.660
Oh, thank heavenly Jesus!

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.320
But, with that said, does it actually make it good?

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.580
*unsure*

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.080
No.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.440
Actually, of all things, it makes it kind of boring.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.380
Now, don't get me wrong, I'd much rather take boring

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.000
Over whatever the hell the last one was!

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.720
But, it doesn't excuse the fact that it's still pretty dull.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.360
As you'd expect, the Cheetah Girls are a big hit,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.900
But it looks like one of them has to leave to go to Barcelona

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.540
Because her mother wants to be with her hopefully soon fiancee who lives there.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.940
The Cheetah Girls find out, OF COURSE,

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.600
There's a gigantic music contest there and decide,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.540
"Why the hell not?"

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.360
They'll go too!

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.360
So they all travel to see the sights,

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.520
Or at least take some postcards...

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.700
(I'm assuming they didn't have a budget to see all the sights)

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.500
And they come across cute boys,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.100
Do some fun dance numbers,

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.800
And even discover another girl entering the contest.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.180
At first it looks like her mother is on board with helping everybody out,

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.000
But

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.140
Oh, no!

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.800
She actually wants to split the Cheetah Girls up!

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.400
Why?

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.620
Because one of the cheetah girls can sing in Spanish!

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.600
And her and her daughter sound really good together,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.160
So she just wants it to be the two of them.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.920
Wait a minute, why doesn't she just join the group?

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.900
Wouldn't that make a lot more sense?

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.380
*confused* Whatever.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.160
So despite her better judgment,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.480
The daughter tries to split the girls up, and

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.700
At first, it seems to work.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.160
Galleria gets so fed up,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.640
That she's eventually gonna go home,

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.480
But then they decide,

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.240
"No! We're all sisters, we're in it together!"

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.580
And they have the big reunion song number,

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.980
And everything seems to be okay.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.500
All's well that ends well...

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.660
Wait a minute,

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.260
There's still 40 minutes left!

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.940
What the hell we gonna do with the rest of that time?

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.420
Well, THE MOTHER tries to sabotage them again!

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.200
Yeah, she sets them up at a club

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.120
Where they get paid,

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.180
But that, unfortunately, means they're professionals,

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.580
And the head of the contest finds out and disqualifies them

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.140
Because it's only for amateurs.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.360
But it looks like the girl that speaks Spanish can still sing

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.000
With the daughter even though she's

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.900
Part of the group that was disqualified?

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.860
She accepted money too...why wouldn't this?

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.840
Ugh! Whatever.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.960
So THEY'RE gonna sing together with the Cheetah Girls'

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.940
Blessings, but then,

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:46.780
Wait a minute!

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.840
The head of the contest figures out that THE MOTHER

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.560
Was the one who set up the paying gig,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.880
KNOWING it was a paying gig,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.900
So that...somehow gets them back in?

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:55.440
What?

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.900
No, who cares let's just

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.200
End on the inevitable wedding between the other mother and The Barcelona Guy

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.680
Which focuses VERY LITTLE on them,

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.000
And instead, the Cheetah Girls singing over their moment.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.640
Yeah, really stealing the thunder from this plot thread!

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.660
At first the bridesmaids in the background,

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.680
And that kind of makes sense,

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.200
But it keeps cutting back to them

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.600
Singing over a pretty landscape like the wedding is kind of secondary!

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.500
No no!

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.920
"Screw the emotions of these two people!"

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.000
"Our egos are too big that you have to focus on us!"

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.760
Or at least that's how it comes across.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.280
that's how A LOT of it comes across.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.840
just an excuse for them to sing. and look pretty,

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.900
And do dance moves.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.500
And-

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.000
Sometimes it's okay!

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.500
Like I really like this scene where they sing this Barcelonan lullaby.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.880
And it's in Spanish and it's really quiet and it's really nice!

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.180
it's only two girls singing and...

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.040
Yeah! That was a nice change of pace.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.960
And a legit nice moment.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.540
There's also a nicely done ballroom dancing scene,

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.300
Where it's only two people dancing.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.500
There's not that many special effects or smoke or lights

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.380
Or distractions.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.660
It's just these two people dancing and they do it really well.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.620
And the fast editing and camera movements here, unlike the other times,

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.440
Don't get in the way or distract you!

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.900
It actually emphasizes what a good job they're doing.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.640
Little scenes like that aren't bad, but for the most part, it's pretty forgettable.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.980
I think this is mainly so kids can just watch it

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.480
And say, "Oh, aren't I so much like Cheetah Girl Number Three?"

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.200
"Oh, Cheetah Girl Number Four is just like my personality!"

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.000
"What if I was there?"

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.800
And if that's something your kids like to do, more power to them.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.180
but for anyone else, it's not nearly as bad as the first,

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.680
But it's a definite past.
