00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:01.715
- Hey, everyone, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.715 --> 00:00:02.548
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:02.548 --> 00:00:05.435
I'm in Weligama, Sri Lanka,
and it's an honor to be here.

00:00:05.435 --> 00:00:06.853
I'm with David, the Hungry Tourist,

00:00:06.853 --> 00:00:08.794
on his Best of Sri Lanka Food Tour.

00:00:08.794 --> 00:00:12.253
Today is gonna be an
unbelievable Sri Lankan food day.

00:00:12.253 --> 00:00:15.153
We've been invited by
Ucith, and Nick, and Lakki,

00:00:15.153 --> 00:00:17.783
and their entire family,

00:00:17.783 --> 00:00:20.324
who are from Weligama
in Southern Sri Lanka.

00:00:20.324 --> 00:00:22.283
They're gonna cook for us a home-cooked,

00:00:22.283 --> 00:00:25.183
everything cooked traditional
over fire in clay pots.

00:00:25.183 --> 00:00:27.023
We're gonna have a lot of fun.

00:00:27.023 --> 00:00:30.743
We're gonna eat a lot of
delicious, incredible food today.

00:00:30.743 --> 00:00:33.326
(upbeat music)

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:41.966
Good, how are you?

00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:42.799
- Good, good, good.

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:43.632
- [Mark] Good to see you again.

00:00:43.632 --> 00:00:44.547
We got here a little bit early,

00:00:44.547 --> 00:00:46.487
but they have already started cooking

00:00:46.487 --> 00:00:49.717
some of the traditional dishes
from Southern Sri Lanka.

00:00:49.717 --> 00:00:51.998
This is a beautiful tropical compound.

00:00:51.998 --> 00:00:56.877
The Nelson family, they own
and operate a wood mill.

00:00:56.877 --> 00:01:00.457
So there's logs; they're
making planks of wood.

00:01:00.457 --> 00:01:03.897
It's gonna be all outside,
everything cooked over fire.

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:05.998
You can already smell
the spices in the air.

00:01:05.998 --> 00:01:09.517
And then Aunty is in charge
of cooking in the back.

00:01:09.517 --> 00:01:11.017
- They have an open gas stove,

00:01:11.017 --> 00:01:12.487
and also they have the old-fashioned one--

00:01:12.487 --> 00:01:13.485
- I'm lost.

00:01:13.485 --> 00:01:14.727
Awesome.

00:01:14.727 --> 00:01:15.644
Fire stove.

00:01:17.685 --> 00:01:20.285
(bubbling)

00:01:20.285 --> 00:01:21.452
Mango chutney.

00:01:22.387 --> 00:01:23.220
- Try one.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.098
- Amazing, okay, cool.

00:01:24.098 --> 00:01:27.157
And then they have the
mango chutney prepared.

00:01:27.157 --> 00:01:30.407
The family is very well known for this.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.063
Oh, wow.

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:36.487
Oh, it's awesome man.

00:01:36.487 --> 00:01:37.629
It's so good.
- Balance of flavor, right?

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:41.379
- Dude, it's sweet, a
little bit spicy, sour.

00:01:48.403 --> 00:01:50.653
(bubbling)

00:01:52.768 --> 00:01:54.476
- This is a tuna curry.

00:01:54.476 --> 00:01:56.757
- [Mark] Wow, smells and dishes going,

00:01:56.757 --> 00:01:58.467
so outside they're cooking dishes too.

00:01:58.467 --> 00:01:59.689
There's a fish curry going.

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.317
There's shrimp that simmering down

00:02:01.317 --> 00:02:02.815
with some herbs and spices.

00:02:02.815 --> 00:02:04.883
The aromas, the steam, the cooking,

00:02:04.883 --> 00:02:06.548
everything is cooked traditional,

00:02:06.548 --> 00:02:10.158
and most dishes are cooked
in clay pots over fire.

00:02:10.158 --> 00:02:12.840
The clay pots just build up the flavor

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.299
and keep using the clay pots.

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.708
That's one of the traditional
ways of cooking in Sri Lanka.

00:02:17.708 --> 00:02:21.541
This is going to be a
feast that I can't wait.

00:02:23.187 --> 00:02:27.011
The whole chair on it, that's awesome.

00:02:27.011 --> 00:02:29.831
(laughs)

00:02:29.831 --> 00:02:32.751
Coconut milk and shredded coconut
is an essential ingredient

00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:34.711
in Sri Lankan food and cooking.

00:02:34.711 --> 00:02:36.251
And they, often times I've just seen

00:02:36.251 --> 00:02:37.651
the traditional coconut shredder

00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:39.571
just on a little wooden stool,

00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:41.290
but this is the deluxe version.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.751
It's on an office chair.

00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:44.881
Then over there, she is
slicing the gotu kola,

00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:47.193
which is in English it's pennywort leaves.

00:02:47.193 --> 00:02:49.460
I remember that from my
last trip to Sri Lanka.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.820
It's a really green, really healthy,

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.070
really earthy tasting herb.

00:02:56.521 --> 00:02:57.503
Really good.

00:02:57.503 --> 00:02:58.336
Brinjal curry?

00:02:58.336 --> 00:02:59.248
- Moju, moju.

00:02:59.248 --> 00:03:00.415
- It has moju.

00:03:01.405 --> 00:03:02.580
- [Mark] The eggplant, right?

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.291
Brinjal, brinjal.

00:03:04.291 --> 00:03:06.726
- It's not processed, right?

00:03:06.726 --> 00:03:09.276
Its with goraka which is--

00:03:09.276 --> 00:03:11.499
- Let's have a taste.

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:12.732
- [Mark] It's okay to taste?

00:03:12.732 --> 00:03:14.113
- [Ucith] Yeah

00:03:14.113 --> 00:03:16.020
- [Mark] This piece?

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.359
- [Aunty] Very spicy, okay?

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:18.442
- [Mark] Okay

00:03:20.062 --> 00:03:22.895
(foreign chatter)

00:03:27.455 --> 00:03:31.758
- This is a fish curry with
garcinia, and then spices.

00:03:31.758 --> 00:03:34.026
There's curry leaves in
it, there's chillies in it.

00:03:34.026 --> 00:03:37.227
This is our favorite
of many in this region.

00:03:37.227 --> 00:03:38.569
And it's specifically a Southern--

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:39.852
- [Ucith] She makes it the
best out of the family,

00:03:39.852 --> 00:03:41.473
so we come all the way
here to justify that.

00:03:41.473 --> 00:03:43.147
- Aunty makes it the best.

00:03:43.147 --> 00:03:45.210
- [Ucith] The longer you keep
it the better the flavors.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.220
- Oh, because of the?

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.121
(indistinct)

00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:50.929
- And it's sour.

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:52.281
- Ah, because that's the garcinia.

00:03:52.281 --> 00:03:54.005
It's very sour, right?
- Right.

00:03:54.005 --> 00:03:55.348
- It's a very sour fish.

00:03:55.348 --> 00:03:57.413
Okay, taste testing.

00:03:57.413 --> 00:03:59.657
(upbeat music)

00:03:59.657 --> 00:04:02.897
Ah yeah, mmm, that's wonderful.

00:04:02.897 --> 00:04:06.018
Ah, there's black pepper in there, too.

00:04:06.018 --> 00:04:08.288
You taste the black pepper,
you taste the sourness,

00:04:08.288 --> 00:04:11.725
Ooh, the sourness
actually keeps on coming.

00:04:11.725 --> 00:04:14.692
And Ucith says that adding some
coconut balances the flavor.

00:04:14.692 --> 00:04:16.882
So that's the fresh grated
coconut on top of that.

00:04:16.882 --> 00:04:19.465
(upbeat music)

00:04:23.241 --> 00:04:24.416
- Oh wow!

00:04:24.416 --> 00:04:25.833
That is stunning.

00:04:26.807 --> 00:04:27.945
That is flavor.

00:04:27.945 --> 00:04:30.862
- [Chef] The coconut milk is fresh.

00:04:38.738 --> 00:04:41.130
- It smells incredible.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.205
This is just an incredible
tropical paradise.

00:04:44.205 --> 00:04:46.844
The greenery, the fruits, the vegetables,

00:04:46.844 --> 00:04:48.203
and herbs and spices.

00:04:48.203 --> 00:04:50.384
It's, oh man, coconuts are just blooming.

00:04:50.384 --> 00:04:51.217
Prawns are done?

00:04:51.217 --> 00:04:52.050
- [Man] Yeah

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.798
- Ah, here they come out right now.

00:04:53.798 --> 00:04:54.798
What a dish!

00:04:57.504 --> 00:04:58.718
Just getting ready to
cook a couple of dishes.

00:04:58.718 --> 00:05:02.135
Fish roe tuna, tuna eggs, tuna roe curry!

00:05:04.283 --> 00:05:06.187
You've got to check out the design on

00:05:06.187 --> 00:05:09.795
the Sri Lankan stove style,
traditional clay style.

00:05:09.795 --> 00:05:13.480
So the charcoal, the
firewood, burn down here.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.429
The clay pot sits above here,

00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:18.256
and then there's airflow on this side.

00:05:18.256 --> 00:05:20.028
Coconut oil.

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:22.278
(sizzling)

00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:25.313
There's onions, there's garlic,

00:05:25.313 --> 00:05:26.451
there's curry leaves,
there's pandan leaves.

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:31.250
That smells incredible already,
and the dish has just begun.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.500
(sizzling)

00:05:38.188 --> 00:05:39.521
The cuttle fish.

00:05:40.531 --> 00:05:41.767
- The boss (laughs).

00:05:41.767 --> 00:05:43.586
This is my mum's oldest sister.

00:05:43.586 --> 00:05:44.786
- Cuttle fish.

00:05:44.786 --> 00:05:46.226
- [Mark] The greatest.

00:05:46.226 --> 00:05:48.809
(upbeat music)

00:05:50.236 --> 00:05:52.486
(sizzling)

00:05:59.896 --> 00:06:02.006
Chili powder, there's curry powder,

00:06:02.006 --> 00:06:04.736
there's pepper, I think that's
tamarind, there's turmeric.

00:06:04.736 --> 00:06:06.387
He added all the spice
in, and then as soon as

00:06:06.387 --> 00:06:08.428
you add that spice in it sort of cakes up,

00:06:08.428 --> 00:06:09.976
and actually the fire is a little too low,

00:06:09.976 --> 00:06:13.625
so we're gonna take
this back to the kitchen

00:06:13.625 --> 00:06:16.932
where the fire is a bit bigger,
to continue the cooking.

00:06:16.932 --> 00:06:19.682
I'm following the fish egg curry.

00:06:20.925 --> 00:06:23.508
(upbeat music)

00:06:24.793 --> 00:06:27.450
(sizzling)

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:28.914
They just added in the fish eggs,

00:06:28.914 --> 00:06:31.722
those are some big
chunks of tuna fish eggs

00:06:31.722 --> 00:06:34.055
just sloshing around in that spice mixture

00:06:34.055 --> 00:06:35.555
with those onions.

00:06:38.788 --> 00:06:41.061
(sharp tapping)

00:06:41.061 --> 00:06:44.460
The fish eggs curry is ready now.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.674
What he did at the end,
is he popped the egg sacks

00:06:47.674 --> 00:06:49.340
to spill out all those eggs.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.651
You can really see that
texture going on now.

00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:54.736
And look how many dishes are ready.

00:06:54.736 --> 00:06:57.049
They're all lining up.

00:06:57.049 --> 00:06:59.632
(upbeat music)

00:07:00.792 --> 00:07:03.471
- [Ucith] This recipe, I just made it.

00:07:03.471 --> 00:07:04.517
- [Mark] So there's onions in here,

00:07:04.517 --> 00:07:07.350
there's chillies, there's chicken.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.725
- Oh yeah, mmm!

00:07:12.725 --> 00:07:15.003
(laughing)

00:07:15.003 --> 00:07:17.086
- [Group] That's so good!

00:07:19.007 --> 00:07:20.490
- [Man] The chillies--

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.281
- [Mark] Oh yes, the viper chillies?

00:07:23.281 --> 00:07:25.448
(rolling)

00:07:28.856 --> 00:07:31.023
(popping)

00:07:32.579 --> 00:07:34.719
So everybody has arrived now.

00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:37.019
Most of the food, I think
actually all the food,

00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:39.089
is ready, but she is just last-minute

00:07:39.089 --> 00:07:41.549
crushing up some chillies
the traditional way.

00:07:41.549 --> 00:07:43.713
And what I love is in
Sri Lanka is they use

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:47.217
a slab of stone with a stone roller,

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:50.502
and that just annihilates,
smashes, the chillies.

00:07:50.502 --> 00:07:53.429
You can even hear them pop.

00:07:53.429 --> 00:07:54.314
- [Man] Get the sound of that.

00:07:54.314 --> 00:07:55.276
- [Mark] Yeah, that pop.

00:07:55.276 --> 00:07:56.647
I need the microphone right there.

00:07:56.647 --> 00:07:59.564
(popping chillies)

00:08:02.987 --> 00:08:05.396
Did you crack that open already?

00:08:05.396 --> 00:08:07.090
- I've just been sucking on this bad boy,

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.637
well there's not much meat on there left,

00:08:08.637 --> 00:08:09.973
because it's all in my stomach.

00:08:09.973 --> 00:08:11.214
- [Tim] I had, like, four of them!

00:08:11.214 --> 00:08:12.525
- [Abram] And then just
a couple of naked seeds.

00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:14.025
- [Tim] Fricking amazing.

00:08:14.025 --> 00:08:16.716
Mark, we're doing a durian
tour, let's do a durian tour.

00:08:16.716 --> 00:08:18.855
We need to try them all!

00:08:18.855 --> 00:08:20.524
- [Abram] Go check it out, my man.

00:08:20.524 --> 00:08:22.104
- [Mark] Oh yes, how's that durian?

00:08:22.104 --> 00:08:22.937
- [Tim] Awesome.

00:08:22.937 --> 00:08:24.854
- [Mark] Oh, thank you.

00:08:25.893 --> 00:08:28.076
(upbeat music)

00:08:28.076 --> 00:08:28.909
Mmm, mmm!

00:08:31.351 --> 00:08:32.184
Oh yeah!

00:08:34.924 --> 00:08:38.507
Oh yeah, it's amazing,
it's so creamy, mmm!

00:08:41.188 --> 00:08:43.016
Okay, what she just brought over,

00:08:43.016 --> 00:08:47.055
this is a family recipe,
this is a pork curry.

00:08:47.055 --> 00:08:48.472
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

00:08:50.199 --> 00:08:51.032
- Amazing flavor.

00:08:51.032 --> 00:08:52.588
- That skin crunches too.

00:08:52.588 --> 00:08:54.416
You get the crunch of that skin,

00:08:54.416 --> 00:08:57.262
the flavor of the cake up of curry paste

00:08:57.262 --> 00:08:58.680
on each piece of meat.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.621
- [Blue T-Shirt Man] Sweet potato.

00:08:59.621 --> 00:09:01.204
- Oh, sweet potato.

00:09:02.549 --> 00:09:06.806
Fried slices of sweet potato,
dusted in chili powder.

00:09:06.806 --> 00:09:09.056
Oh man, and another durian.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.266
Oh this one is even better!

00:09:16.266 --> 00:09:19.599
Softer, a hint more of bitterness to it.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.801
- [Woman] Cassava.

00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:25.274
- [Man] So basically it's sweet cassava,

00:09:25.274 --> 00:09:26.761
with kochi sambar.

00:09:26.761 --> 00:09:29.928
You've got to put this on top of that.

00:09:31.286 --> 00:09:35.536
- Like a shredded cassava
mash-up, with pork curry.

00:09:37.119 --> 00:09:37.952
Oh wow!

00:09:39.844 --> 00:09:41.307
- That's shredded cassava so it has

00:09:41.307 --> 00:09:44.223
a totally different texture, more starchy.

00:09:44.223 --> 00:09:46.695
Mmm, packed full of flavor.

00:09:46.695 --> 00:09:49.939
That's insane, that's amazing.

00:09:49.939 --> 00:09:51.022
The next one?

00:09:52.205 --> 00:09:53.077
- [Man] Do them together.

00:09:53.077 --> 00:09:57.457
- [Mark] The chicken salad
and the sweet potato.

00:09:57.457 --> 00:09:58.540
This is good.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.257
(laughing)

00:10:06.257 --> 00:10:08.340
- The onions are amazing!

00:10:09.227 --> 00:10:11.697
- There's a citrusy taste.

00:10:11.697 --> 00:10:13.878
We're just snacking out
of control right now.

00:10:13.878 --> 00:10:17.120
We can't help ourselves, it's too good!

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.703
(upbeat music)

00:10:32.098 --> 00:10:34.598
Ooh, we've got moringa leaves.

00:10:42.799 --> 00:10:44.689
We're all lining up, self service,

00:10:44.689 --> 00:10:46.709
there's like at least 12 different dishes

00:10:46.709 --> 00:10:48.193
plus a bunch of different garnishes,

00:10:48.193 --> 00:10:51.041
a bunch of different
pickles, a bunch of salads.

00:10:51.041 --> 00:10:54.789
There's rice, it's just
a bounty of a feast.

00:10:54.789 --> 00:10:58.819
It's beautiful, amazing
people, amazing hospitality,

00:10:58.819 --> 00:11:01.194
the generosity, it's like an all-time

00:11:01.194 --> 00:11:03.944
high of excitement, anticipation,

00:11:06.246 --> 00:11:10.574
and beauty of culture,
food, and hospitality.

00:11:10.574 --> 00:11:13.157
(upbeat music)

00:11:14.604 --> 00:11:16.054
I'm going to go for a
little bit of both rice.

00:11:16.054 --> 00:11:19.184
There's white rice, and there's red rice.

00:11:19.184 --> 00:11:20.678
Put the red rice on here.

00:11:20.678 --> 00:11:22.824
This is the brinjal curry, you can see

00:11:22.824 --> 00:11:24.093
that the brinjal is eggplant.

00:11:24.093 --> 00:11:25.136
It's fried, the shallots in here,

00:11:25.136 --> 00:11:29.508
there's chillies in here,
you've got to cup it.

00:11:29.508 --> 00:11:31.341
Pennywort mix, sambal.

00:11:35.213 --> 00:11:36.630
Oh, another dish!

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:39.113
Oh, that one is the jack fruit curry.

00:11:39.113 --> 00:11:40.219
Jack fruit curry, right?

00:11:40.219 --> 00:11:41.293
Prawns curry; You can see the cinnamon,

00:11:41.293 --> 00:11:43.680
you can see the curry leaves in here.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.711
Oh wow, and I'm going
to go with a little bit

00:11:45.711 --> 00:11:47.901
of this sauce on my rice.

00:11:47.901 --> 00:11:50.886
Another sambal, but I
think this is made with

00:11:50.886 --> 00:11:52.171
something fried and crunchy.

00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:56.608
Dry curry, again made
with fish eggs, fish roe.

00:11:56.608 --> 00:11:59.083
I think this is also some
type of a sambal with coconut,

00:11:59.083 --> 00:12:00.828
so I'll put this over the
sambal side of my plate.

00:12:00.828 --> 00:12:04.392
This is a tuna curry, but
made with the garcenia,

00:12:04.392 --> 00:12:05.975
with that sourness.

00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:09.628
Wow, this is just unbelievable.

00:12:09.628 --> 00:12:11.657
This is the dish that we
saw him fully prepare,

00:12:11.657 --> 00:12:13.360
the fish eggs curry.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.458
Look at that texture, you can see how he

00:12:14.458 --> 00:12:18.551
popped those egg sacks just
to let all the eggs bloom out.

00:12:18.551 --> 00:12:19.856
This one, I believe, is coconut.

00:12:19.856 --> 00:12:21.033
We can see the curry leaves in here and

00:12:21.033 --> 00:12:23.826
you can see the little baby shrimp.

00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:26.576
I think this is the one I tasted.

00:12:27.558 --> 00:12:29.875
This is the jack fruit curry.

00:12:29.875 --> 00:12:32.308
Hearty and rich and fulfilling.

00:12:32.308 --> 00:12:35.478
This one is the pineapple curry.

00:12:35.478 --> 00:12:37.561
String beans, they go on.

00:12:40.499 --> 00:12:41.974
I think this is a fish curry as well.

00:12:41.974 --> 00:12:46.153
Right on top, oh you can
no longer see the rice.

00:12:46.153 --> 00:12:47.910
Finish this off with a little
bit of the mango chutney

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:51.229
which I also sampled,
which is unbelievable good.

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:53.812
Okay, there is rice under here.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.649
I tried to get everything.

00:12:58.649 --> 00:13:00.509
A little bit of all of the dishes,

00:13:00.509 --> 00:13:01.773
and there is rice below there, but it's

00:13:01.773 --> 00:13:04.523
completely covered in a layer of,

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.849
there's at least a dozen
different curries here,

00:13:08.849 --> 00:13:10.349
plus all the garnishes,
plus all the sambals,

00:13:10.349 --> 00:13:12.649
plus all the, it's just beautiful.

00:13:12.649 --> 00:13:14.630
I think I'm going to begin
with whatever is in the center.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:17.455
I think that's a mix of both the,

00:13:17.455 --> 00:13:20.405
I think that's a mix of
the jack fruit curry,

00:13:20.405 --> 00:13:21.988
plus some of the pineapple curry.

00:13:21.988 --> 00:13:25.155
You can see the curry leaves in there.

00:13:27.364 --> 00:13:28.197
Wow.

00:13:30.913 --> 00:13:32.802
Got some of the pineapple curry in there.

00:13:32.802 --> 00:13:35.039
You got some of that sweet, tart flavor,

00:13:35.039 --> 00:13:37.297
plus that black pepper in there.

00:13:37.297 --> 00:13:39.920
There's also a tomatoey jam.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.969
The squid here, and that's
also the fish roe curry.

00:13:43.969 --> 00:13:45.709
You can see that texture, the fish roe

00:13:45.709 --> 00:13:47.876
just popping out of there.

00:13:52.912 --> 00:13:53.745
Wow.

00:13:55.854 --> 00:13:57.870
The fish roe in unbelievable!

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.649
It has a really soft texture
and smoky taste to it.

00:14:00.649 --> 00:14:03.519
You taste that roasted curry powder.

00:14:03.519 --> 00:14:06.102
(upbeat music)

00:14:07.723 --> 00:14:09.299
That is spectacular.

00:14:09.299 --> 00:14:12.716
Revolve my plate over to those gotu kola.

00:14:17.979 --> 00:14:20.099
Really green-tasting, really you taste

00:14:20.099 --> 00:14:21.219
the coconut in there too,
the shredded coconut.

00:14:21.219 --> 00:14:23.670
Actually, in that bite
I also had a bite of

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:26.176
the eggplant, the brinjal curry.

00:14:26.176 --> 00:14:28.739
The eggplant is fried then
mixed with the spices,

00:14:28.739 --> 00:14:32.062
so it has a sweet caramelized taste to it.

00:14:32.062 --> 00:14:34.645
(upbeat music)

00:14:37.417 --> 00:14:38.469
Oh wow!

00:14:38.469 --> 00:14:39.476
Okay, moving on to the shrimp now.

00:14:39.476 --> 00:14:42.726
I think I'm gonna eat this whole thing!

00:14:44.284 --> 00:14:46.091
What's amazing is a lot of the dishes

00:14:46.091 --> 00:14:47.650
use similar spices in common,

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.775
but all of the dishes have a different,

00:14:49.775 --> 00:14:51.675
unique taste to them.

00:14:51.675 --> 00:14:53.660
A few different ingredients, and then just

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.730
all of them together just
form a harmony on your plate.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:15:01.480
They're all unique, they're
all ultra-flavorful,

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.601
the spices just stand out.

00:15:03.601 --> 00:15:05.150
The way they've been cooked over the fire,

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.043
you can taste the smoke in the dishes.

00:15:08.043 --> 00:15:09.010
This is the jack fruit curry?

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:09.843
- [Server] Yeah

00:15:09.843 --> 00:15:11.911
- Okay, cool, awesome.

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:13.620
I missed a dish, this
is a jack fruit curry

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.120
with coconut milk.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:20.310
The jack fruit is not fully ripe,

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:22.497
but not fully young either.

00:15:22.497 --> 00:15:24.090
It has different textures to it.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.202
You taste the seeds
which are more potatoey.

00:15:26.202 --> 00:15:28.593
Thank you so much,
- You're welcome, man.

00:15:28.593 --> 00:15:31.262
- This food is stunning.
- It's good having you here.

00:15:31.262 --> 00:15:33.903
- It's really an honor to be here.

00:15:33.903 --> 00:15:35.438
You guys have taken such good care of us.

00:15:35.438 --> 00:15:36.587
- Thank you so much.

00:15:36.587 --> 00:15:38.576
- The authenticity of the food,

00:15:38.576 --> 00:15:42.166
everything about this, the
company, our entire group,

00:15:42.166 --> 00:15:43.548
and their entire hospitality.

00:15:43.548 --> 00:15:44.381
- It's an honor having you here, man.

00:15:44.381 --> 00:15:46.866
- Thank you, thank you so much.

00:15:46.866 --> 00:15:49.686
And we are still digging in.

00:15:49.686 --> 00:15:52.566
I didn't realize that plate
of food really added up.

00:15:52.566 --> 00:15:54.397
- [Ucith] Yeah, you ate
a lot more than that!

00:15:54.397 --> 00:15:56.686
- Dude, that was a pretty
massive plate of food,

00:15:56.686 --> 00:15:58.956
I'm still working on it, happily!

00:15:58.956 --> 00:16:01.526
Just loving every single bite,

00:16:01.526 --> 00:16:04.743
my taste buds are just
overflowing with deliciousness!

00:16:04.743 --> 00:16:07.816
Final bite from this plate, I saved

00:16:07.816 --> 00:16:11.649
a last fish, almost like
a tube, like a shoot.

00:16:16.286 --> 00:16:18.882
The plates are deep, the
food just kept adding up.

00:16:18.882 --> 00:16:20.798
That was stunning!

00:16:20.798 --> 00:16:23.381
(upbeat music)

00:16:25.324 --> 00:16:28.812
And I almost, almost,
forgot about the crab curry!

00:16:28.812 --> 00:16:30.645
That is the next dish.

00:16:34.815 --> 00:16:35.751
Hello there

00:16:35.751 --> 00:16:38.266
- Drenched, drenched in juice, baby!

00:16:38.266 --> 00:16:39.562
- [Mark] Have you taken a
couple of showers during lunch?

00:16:39.562 --> 00:16:40.941
- That's loving life!

00:16:40.941 --> 00:16:42.120
I'm going to have to go for
another shower in a few minutes.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.827
(laughing)

00:16:43.827 --> 00:16:47.277
- [Mark] I think I might join you.

00:16:47.277 --> 00:16:49.285
I had almost forgotten
about the crab curry.

00:16:49.285 --> 00:16:52.727
- [Bald Man] I am just covered,
sweat, snot, crab juice.

00:16:52.727 --> 00:16:54.968
(Mark laughing)

00:16:54.968 --> 00:16:59.385
Because it's the blue crab
it's easier to crack that.

00:17:00.626 --> 00:17:04.793
I got that crab de-shelled,
mix it with the sauce.

00:17:06.712 --> 00:17:09.879
Oh wow, that crab is stunning as well!

00:17:14.376 --> 00:17:17.454
(crunching)

00:17:17.454 --> 00:17:19.521
When you bite that
shell, the juices run out

00:17:19.521 --> 00:17:21.521
on to your chin, oh man!

00:17:23.411 --> 00:17:24.792
- You know, with these
crabs you don't even

00:17:24.792 --> 00:17:25.678
need the crackers,
- No, no

00:17:25.678 --> 00:17:27.673
you just bite into them.

00:17:27.673 --> 00:17:30.254
- Yeah, this type of blue crab,
that's one of the benefits

00:17:30.254 --> 00:17:33.004
of it, the shell is just so thin.

00:17:34.548 --> 00:17:36.211
And then the juice, the curry, just seeps

00:17:36.211 --> 00:17:38.294
into crab into the shell.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.703
And the meat is so tasty!

00:17:46.455 --> 00:17:49.850
(rapid chatter)

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:52.350
- [Announcer] Welcome to
Weligama Food Festival,

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:53.183
- Alright, I'm tapping out

00:17:53.183 --> 00:17:54.016
- Yes!

00:17:54.016 --> 00:17:56.860
- Substitution! It's all you, Mark.

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.340
- Dude, I need a shower with you!

00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:59.660
(laughing)

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:02.940
Wow, the camera is covered in crab,

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.480
my face is covered in crab and curry,

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.545
good thing there's a hose over here!

00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:08.436
(laughing)

00:18:08.436 --> 00:18:10.811
(upbeat music)

00:18:10.811 --> 00:18:13.061
(laughing)

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.432
The post-curry head-wash!

00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:20.710
- This is what's needed!

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:21.543
Your turn!

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:26.180
- That's just too tempting!

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:34.063
Oh yes, oh wow, that feels wonderful!

00:18:34.992 --> 00:18:36.394
What a meal!

00:18:36.394 --> 00:18:40.644
Dude, the digestive-sweats,
the chili curry-sweats.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:45.571
(foreign chatter)

00:18:45.571 --> 00:18:47.904
(splashing)

00:18:57.736 --> 00:19:00.173
- [Lakki] You see this, this is, you don't

00:19:00.173 --> 00:19:04.506
get this in normal coconuts,
it's like jelly inside.

00:19:09.889 --> 00:19:11.722
You put treacle on it.

00:19:13.172 --> 00:19:14.757
- Wow

00:19:14.757 --> 00:19:16.776
You take it with the honey.

00:19:16.776 --> 00:19:18.517
- [David] It's amazing.

00:19:18.517 --> 00:19:20.659
It's amazing, it's the whole thing, huh?

00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:21.832
- [Lakki] Hold on, hold
on, put some of this--

00:19:21.832 --> 00:19:24.249
- Hit me, baby, sweet nectar!

00:19:27.986 --> 00:19:30.283
Wow, it's so soft!

00:19:30.283 --> 00:19:32.316
- [Lakki] It's like gel, right?

00:19:32.316 --> 00:19:34.983
(sharp tapping)

00:19:37.406 --> 00:19:39.656
(cheering)

00:19:43.986 --> 00:19:48.569
- [David] Where's the sugar,
the syrup, the palm sugar?

00:19:50.286 --> 00:19:51.369
Sugar, sugar?

00:19:54.879 --> 00:19:55.712
Let me tell you if it's good first.

00:19:55.712 --> 00:19:56.629
Wait, wait.

00:19:57.476 --> 00:19:58.823
Oh my God.

00:19:58.823 --> 00:20:00.990
- Let me just have a bite.

00:20:09.486 --> 00:20:10.736
That's so soft,

00:20:12.436 --> 00:20:15.103
that's so soft, so silky smooth.

00:20:17.256 --> 00:20:22.006
You're just drowning in the
coconut sugar and palm syrup.

00:20:24.199 --> 00:20:25.032
- Dikiri

00:20:25.032 --> 00:20:25.865
Dikiri

00:20:25.865 --> 00:20:26.698
- Dikiri?

00:20:26.698 --> 00:20:27.531
- Dikiri.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.507
That is like a rare breed
of a mutant coconut.

00:20:32.507 --> 00:20:36.590
- Waited three weeks to
get five dikiri coconuts.

00:20:38.257 --> 00:20:39.429
- [Mark] Thank you!
- You're welcome, man.

00:20:39.429 --> 00:20:43.203
- It is a natural wonder of
the world, without a doubt.

00:20:43.203 --> 00:20:45.197
- Thank you very much.

00:20:45.197 --> 00:20:46.756
- [Mark] Awesome, incredible.

00:20:46.756 --> 00:20:48.047
- It was very nice meeting you.

00:20:48.047 --> 00:20:48.997
- [Mark] Thank you, you too.

00:20:48.997 --> 00:20:52.491
Thank you so much, that was amazing.

00:20:52.491 --> 00:20:54.664
Oh yes, thank you so much!

00:20:54.664 --> 00:20:55.531
Thank you, man.

00:20:55.531 --> 00:20:58.894
He is one of the chefs, amazing!

00:20:58.894 --> 00:20:59.727
- Thank you so much.

00:20:59.727 --> 00:21:01.167
- [Mark] Thank so much, thank you, Mama,

00:21:01.167 --> 00:21:03.887
for your amazing hospitality
and for hosting us,

00:21:03.887 --> 00:21:07.336
and for your food, it's incredible!

00:21:07.336 --> 00:21:09.919
(upbeat music)

00:21:17.446 --> 00:21:18.756
(splash)

00:21:18.756 --> 00:21:20.817
(laughing)

00:21:20.817 --> 00:21:22.817
- Ah, you hit your butt!

00:21:28.707 --> 00:21:30.496
Wow, okay, we made it back.

00:21:30.496 --> 00:21:32.487
Do not go on that slide after a huge meal,

00:21:32.487 --> 00:21:33.623
I just bottomed out!

00:21:33.623 --> 00:21:35.416
That was an unbelievable lunch,

00:21:35.416 --> 00:21:38.298
the food, the hospitality, the culture,

00:21:38.298 --> 00:21:41.657
the Sri Lankan culture, that was just

00:21:41.657 --> 00:21:44.329
an extraordinary, memorable meal.

00:21:44.329 --> 00:21:47.622
Very special, a privilege
to have that opportunity.

00:21:47.622 --> 00:21:50.016
I want to say a massive
thank you to Ucith,

00:21:50.016 --> 00:21:53.866

00:21:53.866 --> 00:21:57.199
to the entire Nelson Family in Weligama.

00:21:58.211 --> 00:21:59.592
That was unbelievable.

00:21:59.592 --> 00:22:03.150
Amazing food, amazing experience
and a learning opportunity.

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:04.604
I want to say a massive thank you to

00:22:04.604 --> 00:22:06.383
everybody who prepared the food,

00:22:06.383 --> 00:22:08.494
everybody we interacted
with, and hung out with,

00:22:08.494 --> 00:22:09.995
and to David, The Hungry Tourist,

00:22:09.995 --> 00:22:11.858
