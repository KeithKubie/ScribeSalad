00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.020
Hey, it's me Destin, I just got home from work. Ignore the thunderstorm in the background

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:15.800
But a couple of things I'd like to do after a long day at work is--the first is I find my wife and plant a big kiss on her.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.240
and then I take my boots off

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.920
That's what I like to do

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.260
So, I wanna tell you something cool that happened today

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.660
YouTube has entered me into a contest called the 'YouTube on the Rise contest'

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.880
It's a contest for people who have a lot less than 100,000 subscribers and I probably have around 9000 subscribers

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.761
and I got them from various experiments
I've done with SmarterEveryDay so

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.489
anyway I'd really like to win this
contest. I was gonna tell you why

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.420
I've got two reasons down the hall. They're
in this room here on the left

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.420
and I have one more reason but let's see
what

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.680
my reasons are doing. "What are you doing?!"

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.060
[Giggling]

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.540
How did you get up there?!

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.540
[Laughing]

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.900
Good girl! Alright, let's go outside.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.720
With all these toys, why are you playing with a box?

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.399
Do you know why?
Why?
 Because boxes are awesome!

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.831
Alright, so anyway, sorry about that.  Those are two reasons why I do my youtube channel

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.420
because what I do is

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.200
I am saving up money for my
children's education

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.990
every time somebody watches a video
ultimately, in the long run, it ends up

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.330
getting closer to

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.200
my children being smart. So the
other day I asked my children on the way home

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.620
what they want to be when they grow up so I can know what I'm saving the money for

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.880
and the response I got was not what I expected

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.240
What what do you guys wanna be when you grow up?

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.240
[Unclear], what do you wanna be when you
grow up?"

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.460
[Unclear]

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.470
What?

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.370
An ice cream girl.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.650
An ice cream girl? Little boy what
do you want to be when you grow up?

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.560
[Unclear]

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.740
A dancing hotdog? [Laughs]

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.100
Who am I to stand in the way of my son's dream of becoming a dancing hotdog.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.240
I mean really.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.290
And who are you to stand in the way his dream of becoming a dancing hot dog?

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.320
so please speak...Wait

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.020
[Giggles]

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.580
So this is what I'd like you to do, if you don't mind, um, if you would

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.069
go to this website, it's the YouTube blog page

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.320
and it's called the "On the Rise Video
Contest" and if you'd vote for "destinws2"

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.600
which is my channel name

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.890
which is Smarter Every Day, if you'd 
vote for that I'd really appreciate it

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.750
and there's a lotta other good people out
there if you don't like my stuff I can understand

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.260
you can vote for them. If we wanna be smart 
about this, if you really do like the stuff

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.599
the smart way to handle this is not
only you vote, but you get your

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:35.650
friends to vote too

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.030
that'd be really cool. I'm not cute, I can't
sing and all that kinda stuff and

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.420
I'm not great at video

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.720
but I do know science and I want other
people to have the same passion for Science that I do

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.960
but anyway if you would please vote 
I would appreciate it.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.280
There's a bunch of other videos that I've already shot that I haven't edited.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.660
I shot rockets in the smallest country in Africa
in-front of a school of young Muslim girls

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.900
to promote science education
that was pretty cool

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.250
we also did a a minor surgery
in Africa on the fly

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.330
I have nothing to offer no incentives
just me

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.610
Alright guys it's bedtime

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.790

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.940

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.100
