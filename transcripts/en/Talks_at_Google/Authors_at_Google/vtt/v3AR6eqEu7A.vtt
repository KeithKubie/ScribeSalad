[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.728 --> 00:00:10.143
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.862 --> 00:00:14.320
HELEN PILCHER:
Well, Hello, Google.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.680
Thank you so much for having me.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.630
It's brilliant to
see you all here.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.550
I'm only slightly
disappointed that there's

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.920
no dogs in the audience
because that would

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.130
have been completely awesome.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.400
But maybe next
time I have a book,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.770
you can all bring your dogs in.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.360
That would be amazing.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.980
So yeah, I'm here to talk about
my book, "Bring Back the King,

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.750
the New Science
of De-Extinction,"

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.590
which is all about, as Kit
said, the ability of scientists

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.010
to bring extinct
animals back to life.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.510
And it's a science that's
very much in development.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.840
It's not quite with us now.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.720
But I think it will be
with us reasonably soon.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.120
And this as you can
see is the book.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.580
Here is my dog, Higgs.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.340
He's modeling the
book there for you

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.160
just to give you an
idea of sample copies.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.510
He's called Higgs
the dog particle,

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.550
which is a joke that
you guys at Google get,

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.614
which I completely love.

00:01:04.614 --> 00:01:06.280
Because people would
normally look at me

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.090
and stare blankly at that point.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.110
So that is Higgs before
he read the book.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.900
And oh man.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.370
That is Higgs afterwards.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.020
I think he found it quite
satisfying, quite exhausting.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.340
So he's my primo
dog, which is good.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.640
So the book asks, which animal
would you like to bring back?

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.140
And I'm doing an event at
New Scientist this weekend.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.260
And we put out a
thing on Twitter just

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.060
to gauge people's
reaction to this.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.200
We said, what
animal from the past

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.080
would you like to
resurrect, just

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.000
to get a feeling of where
people were with this topic.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.650
And sample answers included
the great auk, good example.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.880
Smilodon, which is a
saber-toothed cat, interesting.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.060
And somebody said, I'd like
a pet velociraptor, please,

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.270
which kind of intrigued me.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.470
So I tweeted them back and I
said, why a pet velociraptor?

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.650
And the guy said,
because I fancy a pet

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.350
with retractable claws,
which is kind of interesting.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.170
So I tweeted him back and
I said, how about a cat?

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.668
And he tweeted me back and
said, I'm not a cat person.

00:02:16.668 --> 00:02:18.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.790
So there we are.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.770
And you'll notice also I've
anonymitized these tweets,

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.470
clearly.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.890
I'm not just followed by people
that have Guinea pig avatars.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.682
So there we are.

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:31.140
Other sample answers,
just quickly,

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.830
before I moved on
include, can they

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.161
make a half man,
half woolly mammoth?

00:02:37.161 --> 00:02:38.660
Which is interesting
because I think

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.110
I've been living with
that particular thing

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.550
for about the last 10 years.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.740
He's called a man-noth.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.620
Do you see what I've done there?

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.320
Somebody else said, Margaret
Thatcher clones, thousands

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.370
of them millions, an army.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.580
Slightly disconcerting--
that's not what de-extinction

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.550
is about.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.730
And then somebody hit the
nail on the head almost

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.630
when they said, dodo, then I'd
farm them and start a fast food

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.270
chain-- Dodo's KFD, Doto
Cottage, which was a good joke

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.256
but was topped when
somebody else tweeted.

00:03:16.256 --> 00:03:17.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.710
Man-dodos.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.439
Genius, absolute genius.

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:23.230
OK, so let me tell you
about de-extinction.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.440
I want to start by
telling you a story.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.820
And it's a story about a goat.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.980
But this wasn't any
usual kind of goat.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.870
This was a goat that lived in
the Pyrenees thousands of years

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:37.810
ago.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.240
And these were amazing animals.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.930
They were big, stocky beasts.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.200
They weighed about as
much as a washing machine,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.830
but they were much more agile.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.960
And they had these enormous,
great big curved horns.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.280
And what they used to do is
they used to spring around

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.130
on the mountainsides, casting
impressive honed silhouettes

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.560
against the clear blue
sky cloudless sky.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.640
And they did that brilliantly
for thousands of years

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.340
until we came along at the
end of the 19th century.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.830
And we looked at them, and
we looked at their homes,

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.970
and we looked at our
empty living room walls.

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.140
And you have to remember this
was in a time before IKEA.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.050
So there was nowhere to go to
buy reasonably priced pictures

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.120
or frames.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.820
So all walls were empty
at that point in time.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.086
So they looked at
the bucardo's horns.

00:04:28.086 --> 00:04:29.960
They looked at their
empty living room walls,

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.600
and they thought,
do you know what?

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.350
That would look really good
there, which is a shame.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.880
So we started hunting them,
and their numbers plummeted.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.130
So then if you fast
forward to the year 1999,

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.670
there was only one
left, one bucardo.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.837
And that was an elderly
adult female called Celia.

00:04:51.837 --> 00:04:53.920
And scientists knew that
her time was running out.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.530
They knew they had
to do something.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.160
So they went upon
the mountainside,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.780
and they caught Celia.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.740
And they put a radio tracking
collar around her neck.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.320
And then they let her go.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.320
And they kept an eye on her
to see what she was up to.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.470
And then the next year, the
radio tracking collar let out

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.740
an ominous beep, beep, beep.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.550
And it was the signal
they had been dreading.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.230
They rushed up the
mountain to find her,

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.870
only to discover that Celia had
been crushed by a falling tree.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.440
Can I have an "aww" for Celia?

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.220
AUDIENCE: Aww.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.610
HELEN PILCHER: Thank you.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.040
So the bucardo was no more.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.990
It had to ceased to be.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.990
It was an extinct bucardo.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.704
And that was it.

00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:38.620
And that should be it.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.240
That's what happens
when animals go extinct.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.370
That should be the end of it.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.320
Except that increasingly,
that doesn't

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.370
have to be the case anymore.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.590
So actually, if you
rewind a bit to the point

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.960
when they put the tracking
collar around her neck,

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.150
they did something
else, the scientists.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.360
They actually took a couple of
biopsy samples from the animal,

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.080
and they carted them away
and they froze down her cells

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.130
in liquid nitrogen. And then a
couple of years after she died,

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.130
they thawed these cells and
they did the kind of experiment

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.330
with them that a few
years earlier had been

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.280
used to make Dolly the sheep.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.570
Now, are you guys familiar
with Dolly the sheep?

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.900
I'm guessing you are.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:19.600
So here she is.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.920
I just want to sidetrack and
talk about Dolly for a second.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.100
So Dolly the sheep was, of
course, the first mammal

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.970
to be cloned from an adult cell.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.950
And she showed that you can
take the DNA from an adult cell,

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.060
add it into an egg that's
had its own DNA removed,

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.170
and then use that
to create life.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.410
And that was phenomenal.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.210
So Dolly became this
huge media sensation.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:50.010
The paparazzi literally
followed her every move.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.920
So here she is on the front
cover of "Nature" magazine

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.960
shortly after she was born.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.350
Then here she is
a few years later

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.450
on the front cover
of "Hello" magazine.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.002
And then a few years
after that, sadly--

00:07:06.002 --> 00:07:07.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.570
--on the cover of
"Waitrose Food Illustrated"

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.848
with a little
rosemary and garlic.

00:07:12.848 --> 00:07:17.190
AUDIENCE: The real-- it's
a meal made from the sheep?

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.035
HELEN PILCHER: No.

00:07:18.035 --> 00:07:20.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.070
No, where she's ended
up, she's stuffed

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.350
and she is in a
museum in Scotland.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:28.690
That's her final resting place.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.290
God rest her little fleecy soul.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.330
So that was the experiment
that inspired the bucardo

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.810
scientists, OK?

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.970
So they did the same
kind of experiment.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:44.300
And then in 2003, after hundreds
and hundreds of attempts,

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.060
something incredible happened.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.640
And this is the actual
moment when it happened.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.540
So they created a
little baby bucardo,

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.960
Celia's identical clone.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.280
So this is the moment that
the extinction actually first

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.256
happened.

00:08:01.256 --> 00:08:02.880
And this is actually
over 10 years ago,

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.900
which most people don't realize.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:09.210
So it was a phenomenal
achievement, phenomenal.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.260
And she was beautiful,
this little cone.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.150
She was gorgeous.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:16.960
She had tousled brown fur and
wonky legs and toffee colored

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.460
eyes.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.650
But unfortunately, she
developed breathing problems

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:25.980
and then she died just a couple
of minutes after she was born.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:30.420
So the bucardo isn't
just the first animal

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.100
to become de-extinct.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:36.500
It's also the first animal
ever to go extinct twice,

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.480
which is a bit of a shame.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.990
But I spoke to
the scientists who

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.590
were involved in this
particular piece of work,

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:46.360
and they absolutely
assure me that with time

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.520
and with funding-- those are the
two limiting factors-- they are

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.060
completely convinced
they will be

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:55.850
able to bring the bucardo back--
not just one, but many healthy

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:58.130
bucardos that they'd
like to see released

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.090
into their former range.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.360
So I don't know how
that makes you feel,

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.400
but that story leaves
me with mixed emotions.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.020
I feel pretty sad that we
treated the bucardo so badly.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:12.110
But I feel really excited
for what might be possible.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:15.470
And I want to show you my
favorite photograph of me ever.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:19.384
So this is me on the beach at
Charmouth, as Kip mentioned.

00:09:19.384 --> 00:09:21.300
And I'm the little dude
on the right hand side

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.240
in the awesome red Welly boots.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.220
And I'm about two years old.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.770
And we used to go down
there fossil hunting.

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:32.460
And the rocks there are
198 million years old.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.850
They were formed at
a time when there

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:38.660
were huge, great big reptilian
sea monsters in the sea,

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:42.360
pterosaurs in the sky,
and dinosaurs on the land.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.947
And it made me dream about
bringing back a dinosaur.

00:09:45.947 --> 00:09:47.530
So when you think
about de-extinction,

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.990
you think about what
might be possible.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:53.780
And I begin to wonder, could
you bring back a dinosaur?

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.410
And if you did bring back
a dinosaur, to my mind,

00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:00.490
there's only one contender,
and it's this, T-rex.

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.770
It has to be a T-rex, right?

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:07.560
Once described as the absolute
warlord of the jungle.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.990
Its teeth have, in the
scientific literature,

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:14.754
quite humorously been
described as lethal bananas.

00:10:14.754 --> 00:10:16.920
So if ever there's two words
that don't go together,

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.350
I think it's lethal and banana
or possibly Trump and White

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.214
House.

00:10:22.214 --> 00:10:23.130
[LAUGHTER AND OOH-ING]

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.216
Also quite bad.

00:10:25.216 --> 00:10:26.340
So I was really interested.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.960
Can you bring a dinosaur back?

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.240
So I spoke to the
scientists, and they tell me

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:36.610
it boils down to one raw magic
ingredient, which is this, DNA.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:39.300
And here is some that
I knitted earlier.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.170
So DNA is a very beautiful
molecule, but it's very flimsy.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:44.550
It's very fragile.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.330
And after we die, it
begins to break down.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:48.980
And in exceptional
circumstances,

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.260
it can be preserved
for a long time.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.850
But the oldest thing we have
every extracted DNA from,

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:58.420
meaningful amounts of DNA from,
is less than a million years

00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:59.420
old.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.450
So dinosaurs died out
65 million years ago.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:06.090
So no DNA, no dinosaurs, sorry.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:07.670
So we're not going
to see a dinosaur.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:10.600
The closest thing we will
ever get to a living,

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:15.000
breathing dinosaur
is this, which

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.450
is my dog in a dinosaur
onesie, shortly

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:20.927
before he called the RSPCA.

00:11:20.927 --> 00:11:21.760
So that's dinosaurs.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.500
The other question I get from
people is how, about these?

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.300
How about dodos?

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.660
And I have to say, these
beautiful illustrations which

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.350
are in the book are the work
of a guy called Matt Dawson.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.831
He is fantastic.

00:11:33.831 --> 00:11:34.830
And so this is his dodo.

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:35.996
Could you bring a dodo back?

00:11:35.996 --> 00:11:37.630
Now, they died
much more recently,

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:40.660
so in theory, it might
be a bit more possible.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:45.090
However, where they lived
in Mauritius was very hot.

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.750
And the soil where they fell
when they died was very acidic.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.600
So their DNA is not preserved.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.250
So no DNA, no dodos.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:55.010
Sorry about that.

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:56.670
But it got this idea
going in my head

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:58.753
when I was thinking about
the book, and I thought,

00:11:58.753 --> 00:12:01.480
so you can't do dinosaurs
and you can't do dodos.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.320
You need something from
much more recent history.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.010
How far could you
take this technology?

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:08.240
Where could you go with it?

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:14.140
And I began wondering about
this man, Elvis Presley,

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:18.860
a man deemed so sexy by
the TV stations of the '50s

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:22.230
that they refused to show
him from the waist down.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.380
He was too damn sexy.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.370
And I began to
wonder, could you--

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:27.950
I don't think it's a good idea.

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:29.720
I am not saying that
we should do this.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.870
But as a thought experiment,
with the technology we have,

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:34.540
could this be possible?

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.710
And then I came
across this website,

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:40.930
genuine, genuine website.

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:44.800
Americans for Cloning
Elvis, founded by a guy

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.745
called Bob Meyer, who I spoke
to for the book-- alarmingly

00:12:48.745 --> 00:12:51.180
banned on Facebook.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:55.250
And they have a petition
you can sign if you think

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.420
cloning Elvis is a good idea.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.104
And quite a lot of
people have signed it.

00:13:00.104 --> 00:13:01.520
How serious they
are I don't know.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.660
Anyway, the good thing
about this website

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.590
is it gives you a couple
of ideas of starting

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:08.704
places for Elvis's DNA.

00:13:08.704 --> 00:13:10.370
Because if you want
to bring back Elvis,

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.600
you need a source of his DNA.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:18.390
So the first possible source
of DNA they recommend is this.

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:20.040
These are toenails.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.630
So there's a lady
called Joni Mabe

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:24.940
and she runs a
museum in America.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.450
And she was going
through Graceland

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.670
shortly after
Elvis Presley died,

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:33.690
and she went through his
man cave room, his man den.

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:36.160
And it had a carpet like this
but dark green, shag pile

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.670
carpet.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:40.407
And she kind of got down
to her knees at one point

00:13:40.407 --> 00:13:42.490
and started just feeling
around the carpet-- maybe

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:44.140
a bit odd, but hey.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.520
And her finger
snagged on something.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.280
And she picked it
up, thinking it

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.030
was like a wayward
sequin or something.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:52.370
And it was dark, so she
popped it in her pocket.

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:55.630
And when she got outside, she
discovered it was a toenail.

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:58.370
Now, toenails are
good sources of DNA.

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:00.557
They preserve it
really, really well.

00:14:00.557 --> 00:14:02.140
But you guys are
probably ahead of me.

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.460
This isn't an obvious
choice for bringing back

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:08.030
Elvis because what if it
didn't belong to Elvis?

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:09.970
What if it belonged to
some American tourist

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:11.757
wearing open toed sandals?

00:14:11.757 --> 00:14:13.340
It's an awful lot
of trouble to go to,

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:14.756
so we scratched
that off the list.

00:14:14.756 --> 00:14:16.620
But they have another
source of DNA.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:22.940
And this is Joni Mabe's prized
possession in her Elvis museum.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.040
It's the Elvis wart.

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.500
So in that little
test tube there

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.325
is a test tube of formaldehyde,
and it has a wart.

00:14:30.325 --> 00:14:31.950
Now, Elvis Presley
used to have a water

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:33.350
on the back of his hand.

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:36.690
And before he went into military
service, the wart was removed.

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:41.010
And his doctor had the
foresight to save it.

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:43.370
This is in the days before
eBay, so it was quite forward

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:44.851
thinking.

00:14:44.851 --> 00:14:47.100
And then it was purchased
by the lady from the museum.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.970
And I thought, well maybe
we could get DNA from this.

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:53.690
And we could get DNA from this.

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:55.920
But warts are caused by viruses.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.830
So this DNA is going to be a
mix of human and viral DNA.

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:01.826
So we don't want
to go there either.

00:15:01.826 --> 00:15:03.450
So I kind of ground
to a halt. And then

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:05.500
I thought, well,
hang on a minute.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.170
How about this?

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:11.630
How about Elvis Presley's
famous iconic quiff?

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:15.050
Hair is a really, really
good source of DNA.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:17.320
What would happen
if we did that?

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.880
And I went onto eBay
out of curiosity,

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.460
and I put in the phrase
"celebrity hair,"

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.750
because I was intrigued
to see what would come up.

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:27.600
And it's really
interesting if you do that.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.910
If you put in the
phrase "celebrity hair,"

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:33.560
you can buy locks of hair that
belong to all sorts of people,

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.600
including Abraham Lincoln,
Princess Diana, and Michael

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.660
Jackson, presumably from
before the Pepsi commercial.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.090
I don't know if
you remember that.

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.860
You can buy hair
from Elvis Presley.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.760
And I'd just like to
read you-- if you'll

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.540
humor me-- a small excerpt
from my book of what happened

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:54.508
when I actually bought a
sample of Elvis Presley's hair

00:15:54.508 --> 00:15:56.960
on eBay.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:00.210
So this is chapter 6, "The
King of Rock 'n' Roll."

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:01.900
It goes like this.

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:05.020
"When it finally arrived,
I was more than a little

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.600
disappointed.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.700
Some time earlier I had bought
some of Elvis Presley's hair

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.770
on eBay.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.990
And like a child
waiting for Christmas,

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:17.240
I then had to endure weeks of
over-excitement and speculation

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.872
while I waited for my
purchase to turn up.

00:16:19.872 --> 00:16:23.860
I was expecting something as
iconic as the king himself.

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:27.200
The package, I told myself,
would at the very least

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.960
be made of gold lame and
studded in rhinestones.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.460
It would arrive with great
ceremony, serenaded on

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:38.130
by its own backing band, willed
on by the frenzied scream

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:42.430
of female fans who would camp
outside my house and faint

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.340
when the parcel arrived.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:47.990
But when the postman finally
delivered my precious cargo,

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.900
it was without fanfare.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.790
He didn't even ring the bell.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:55.260
He just popped the plain brown
envelope through the letterbox

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.790
and walked away.

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:01.110
I picked up the drab,
un-Elvisy anti-climax

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:03.080
and turned it over in my hands.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.650
Save for the Memphis
postmark smudged

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.680
across the top
right hand corner,

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:11.180
there was little hint as to the
import's legendary contents.

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.589
Perhaps things would be more
promising on the inside,

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:15.109
I told myself.

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:17.530
Brimming with
nervous energy, all

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:21.050
shook up even-- do you
see what I've done?

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:24.270
I carefully opened the envelope
and teased out the contents.

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:27.869
But the luxuriant quiff of my
dreams was nowhere to be seen.

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:31.370
Instead, I found myself
staring at an A4 sized

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:33.900
certificate of authenticity.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:37.150
'You are now the proud owner
of a genuine strand of Elvis

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.930
Presley's hair,' the
certificate crowed.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:42.390
But where was the hair?

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:44.405
Perhaps they had
forgotten to include it.

00:17:44.405 --> 00:17:48.580
Or maybe it was being sent
separately under armed guard

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.320
from Graceland.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.670
I scoured the shoddily
photocopied piece of paper

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:55.220
for a clue, and it
was only then that I

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:59.440
noticed a blob of dried glue
at the bottom of the page.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.710
Inside it, like an
insect trapped in amber,

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:05.060
was a short strand of hair.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.550
I stared at it,
unable to believe

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:11.900
what my eyes were seeing,
incapable of processing

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.080
what I held in my hands.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.240
Words actually failed me.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:21.100
Not only was the strand
minuscule, smaller

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:25.770
even than a single eyelash
from my face, it was also--

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.615
and I can't bring myself
to say this-- ginger.

00:18:29.615 --> 00:18:31.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:34.150
Elvis Presley, if the
certificate was to be believed,

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.220
was strawberry blonde.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:40.150
As the penny dropped, I felt
so lonesome I could cry I had

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:43.680
spent $14.90 and enjoyed
a longer weight than

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.280
the King's fans had for his
comeback tour only to receive

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.046
what appeared to be Ronald
McDonald's nasal clippings.

00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:51.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:54.640
So I did the only
thing I could think of.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:58.400
I sealed the certificate back
up in its original envelope,

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.470
found a thick black marker
pen, and wrote upon it,

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:07.266
'return to sender,' adding
that the address was unknown.

00:19:07.266 --> 00:19:09.140
The irony, I was sure,
would be lost on them.

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:12.250
But it put a smile
back on my face.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:14.440
Then bright and early
the next morning,

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.370
I sent my letter back."

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:18.260
[CLAP]

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.660
Oh, one person.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:20.598
Thank you very much.

00:19:20.598 --> 00:19:22.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:24.470
So listen, Elvis Presley.

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:26.550
I was so intrigued
with this idea.

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:28.150
I phoned up a
scientist who works

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:30.930
in de-extinction
and I said to him,

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:33.050
can you de-extinct
Elvis Presley?

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:34.050
Tell me.

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:38.230
And he thought about it for a
while, and then he said, yes.

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:43.137
People have been cloning
popstars for decades.

00:19:43.137 --> 00:19:44.220
And I said, you know what?

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.270
You're right, obviously.

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:49.980
Because Simon Cowell, he
produced One Direction,

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.080
didn't he?

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.740
And the scientist said, yes.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:57.040
And that is the reason that
human cloning must never

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.200
be allowed.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:04.720
So it must never be allowed for
all sorts of genuine, ethical,

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.900
moral, health, and
safety reasons,

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:10.360
and also because it leads
to the production of songs

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.840
like "You Don't Know
You're Beautiful."

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.300
So with that, I put
the Elvis idea to bed.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:17.000
OK?

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.180
De-extinction is not about
bringing back dinosaurs.

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.890
It is not about bringing back
the king of roll 'n' roll.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.580
That was just my whim, my folly.

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.691
And then I started exploring
de-extinction more deeply,

00:20:29.691 --> 00:20:31.690
and that's what I want
to talk to you about now.

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:35.540
So there are genuinely
about half a dozen

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.640
de-extinction projects that
are ongoing around the globe

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:42.250
now, trying to bring back
different endangered species

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:43.620
of animals.

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:44.800
This is one of them.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:49.370
This is an animal called
the gastric brooding frog.

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:51.720
And what you've got
here is a big frog

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.970
with a little frog in its mouth.

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:56.970
Now, the big frog isn't
eating the little frog.

00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:00.000
It's actually
giving birth to it.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.830
So this is a frog
that was discovered

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:06.780
in 1973 in the babbling brooks
of Queensland, Australia.

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.510
And what would happen is the
female would lay her eggs,

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:12.420
and then the male would come
along and fertilize them.

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.360
But then the female
would eat them.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.190
She'd swallow them.

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:18.750
They'd pass into her
stomach, which she would

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.600
convert into a makeshift womb.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.170
And then the eggs would
hatch, turn into tadpoles,

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:26.230
turn into froglets.

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.640
She could have about 20 in
her belly at any one time.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.450
And when the time was right, she
would literally burp them up,

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:34.610
literally.

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:37.340
And this is the subject
of a de-extinction project

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:42.110
in Australia under the guidance
of a guy called Mike Archer.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.510
And the guy who kept these
animals in his lab in the '70s

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:46.710
before they went extinct
had the foresight

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:49.390
to save some body
parts in the freezer.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:51.660
And they're using
those for cloning.

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:52.901
So that's one project.

00:21:52.901 --> 00:21:54.900
This is another project
that you're all probably

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:58.210
a bit more familiar with,
the rather wonderful

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:03.510
woolly mammoth, that iconic
species from the last ice age.

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:05.370
Now, the woolly mammoth
is a good candidate

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:07.590
for de-extinction
maybe because we have

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:10.260
plentiful sources of its DNA.

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:14.710
It's quite common place to
find tusks and teeth and bones

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:17.100
in the melting
permafrost of Siberia.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:20.130
And sometimes--
sometimes-- scientists

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.830
come across stuff like this.

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:25.160
OK, so this might
not look like much,

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.450
but this is actually pretty
much the entire torso

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:32.010
of a woolly mammoth that was
found in a remote Siberian

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:34.290
island in 2012.

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:37.000
And when they looked
at it at autopsy,

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.730
they realized that not only
did it have fur and hair,

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:45.312
it had skin and
flesh and muscle.

00:22:45.312 --> 00:22:46.770
And when they cut
into it-- I spoke

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:49.620
to one of the scientists who
was at the autopsy-- it said it

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.640
looked like it had fresh meat.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:55.010
It looked like it was a fresh
beefsteak so well-preserved

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:55.810
was it.

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:57.690
This animal was
frozen continuously

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:00.810
for the last 40,000 years.

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:02.720
And there were three
different groups

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.880
of scientist trying to bring
back the woolly mammoth.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:10.890
And the first two were hoping
to use carcasses like this,

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.910
get cells from them, and use
the DNA inside those cells

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:16.660
for cloning.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:19.990
And that's an
amazing thing to try.

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:25.330
However, as an ex-cell biologist
myself, I'm slightly skeptical.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:26.970
Because these mammoths
have been frozen

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:30.650
for a very long time with no
kind of protective chemicals

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:32.190
to protect the
cells like we would

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:35.680
do if we were freezing
cells in a lab.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.140
So the cells shatter.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.400
The DNA leaks away.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.410
It's quite a tall order.

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:43.040
But fortunately,
there is a third group

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.340
who are trying to bring
back the woolly mammoth.

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:49.800
And if I have to put my faith
in one particular group,

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.500
it's this group.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.760
And it's led by a guy
called George Church who

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.140
works at Harvard.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.170
And my faith in
George Church is based

00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:00.030
on two particular reasons.

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:03.560
The first is that he is a
remarkably intelligent guy.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.280
He has a brain the
size of a planet.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.190
He is so innovative.

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:10.200
He has this amazing
genetics lab, kitted out

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.210
with all the latest stuff
and an army of people

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:15.540
working for him who are
equally as brilliant.

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:17.910
And the second
reason is that he has

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:20.950
this enormous gray bushy beard.

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:24.260
So he looks a lot like God.

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.270
So if I'm going to put
my faith in one group,

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:28.710
it's going to be the
one led by the guy that

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:32.450
looks like he would belong on
the roof of the Sistine Chapel.

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:34.210
And he's not trying
to clone a mammoth.

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:37.070
He's trying to do
something different.

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:41.150
So what he's doing is he's
getting elephant cells,

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:46.009
and then he's editing mammoth
genes into elephant cells.

00:24:46.009 --> 00:24:47.800
And he's using this
technique of the moment

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.500
that everyone's buzzing about
called CRISPR/Cas9 which

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.260
enables scientists
to edit genomes

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:55.720
with pinpoint precision.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.620
So he's taking the genes that
made the mammoths mammoth-like

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:01.290
in different
elephants, genes that

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:04.390
control the growth of their
fur, their big, thick rolls

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:07.870
of subcutaneous fat, and
their special hemoglobin that

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:10.520
ferried oxygen around
at low temperatures,

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:13.460
and they're putting them
into elephant cells.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.340
And they're going to use
those to create life.

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:17.900
And I wish him well.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:19.787
And a third project is this.

00:25:19.787 --> 00:25:21.870
It centers around this
bird, the passenger pigeon.

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:24.161
Now, this is a bird that's
really well-known in America

00:25:24.161 --> 00:25:26.490
where it used to live
before it went extinct.

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:28.840
It went extinct at the
beginning of the 20th century.

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.400
But before that, for tens
of thousands of years,

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:37.820
the passenger pigeon existed in
the vast mind-boggling numbers.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.800
It was a beautiful
athletic bird.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:44.580
And a flock could contain
billions of birds.

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:48.380
A flock could be 100 miles
long and a mile wide.

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.110
It could take days
to pass overhead.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:53.850
And when it did, it
blotted out the sun.

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:56.366
They were like an avian eclipse.

00:25:56.366 --> 00:25:57.740
And then one day,
they were gone.

00:26:01.079 --> 00:26:03.120
And the scientist who's
trying to bring them back

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.430
is using this same
gene editing technology

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:09.977
to try and do that and some
very clever cell biology.

00:26:09.977 --> 00:26:12.060
So there's three of the
projects that are ongoing.

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:16.270
But of course, the most
important question is this.

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:17.671
Why?

00:26:17.671 --> 00:26:19.430
Why are scientists
trying to do this?

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:22.170
What is the point?

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:24.500
It's the most important
question to ask.

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.220
And there are lots of
reasons why personally I

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:30.070
think de-extinction
might be worth a shot.

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.830
The first is this.

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:33.350
If you think about the
animals we've just mentioned,

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:36.040
think about the causes
of their extinction,

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.544
the gastric brooding
frog went extinct

00:26:38.544 --> 00:26:39.960
because it suffered
from something

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.820
called the chytrid fungus.

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:45.070
And in fact, amphibians
all around the globe

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.700
are being affected
by this fungus.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:50.010
And there's a massive
amphibian die off going on,

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:53.300
and we're spreading that
fungus around the globe

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:55.710
through the
commercial, transport,

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:57.900
and trade in amphibians.

00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:01.050
Humans were implicated in the
demise of the woolly mammoth.

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:02.870
It may not have been
exclusively our fault,

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:04.580
but we were implicated.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.160
And the passenger pigeon, we
shot every single last one

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.010
of them out of the sky.

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:11.980
So you could argue
that where we've

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:15.180
played a role in the
downfall of a species

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.480
and where we have the technology
to do something about it,

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.379
maybe we have a
moral obligation.

00:27:20.379 --> 00:27:22.170
And I think that's an
interesting argument.

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:25.820
I think it's good, but I
don't think it's enough.

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.720
So when you think
about extinctions,

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.220
people tend to think about
things from the distant past.

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:33.752
They think about
dodos and dinosaurs.

00:27:33.752 --> 00:27:35.210
But actually, of
course, extinction

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:38.120
is happening all
around us today.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.750
We live in a time
of mass extinction

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:43.176
where extinction
rates are spiking.

00:27:43.176 --> 00:27:45.050
In the time we've been
in this room together,

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:47.410
another species has gone.

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:50.270
And extinction rates
are 1,000 times higher

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:52.490
than during pre-human times.

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:54.250
So this is our fault.

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:57.330
And why it's important is
because all living things

00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:59.110
are part of an ecosystem.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:03.540
And I think of ecosystems
as games of giant Jenga,

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:05.790
you know, the game where
you stack the bricks

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:07.666
and you have to take them away.

00:28:07.666 --> 00:28:09.040
Well, as you take
the bricks away

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.400
or you take the species
away, for a while,

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.530
everything's kind of fine.

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:16.940
But then it gets wobbly,
and then it crumbles.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.210
But because we're in
a mass extinction,

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:21.330
a period of mass
extinction, it's

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:24.570
not just like playing
a game of giant Jenga.

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:30.390
It's like playing a game of
giant Jenga with a toddler.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:32.040
It's all going to
come crashing down.

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:37.054
So it's important.

00:28:37.054 --> 00:28:38.970
Think about what we might
learn along the way.

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:43.100
If we could work out how the
gastric brooding frog changed

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.120
its stomach into
a womb, we might

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.960
be able to work
out new therapies

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.210
for stomach ulcers,
people recovering

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:52.810
from stomach surgery.

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:55.970
And if you go for
animals that are unique--

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:58.490
genetically unique like
the gastric brooding frog--

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:01.350
you don't just put a twig
back on the tree of life.

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:05.120
You replenished
an entire branch.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:09.240
So I think for me,
de-extinction is about restoring

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.840
lost biodiversity.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:12.530
That's the key.

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:15.400
It's about putting animals--
de-extinction is not

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.660
about making lowly zoo exhibits.

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:21.690
It's about making healthy,
genetically diverse populations

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:24.970
of animals that could
be returned to the wild

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:27.580
where they could interact
with their ecosystem

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.790
in a positive and
meaningful way.

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:31.830
And that is a tall, tall order.

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:36.159
We need to think about what
we do very, very carefully.

00:29:36.159 --> 00:29:37.700
But in my last five
minutes, I'd just

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.991
like to mention something else.

00:29:38.991 --> 00:29:45.170
So if de-extinction is about
increasing biodiversity,

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:47.500
then maybe it's a
form of conservation.

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:48.240
Maybe.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.440
And I put a cup of
chamomile tea here,

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.590
because when I make
this point, sometimes

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:55.100
I get shouty tweets
from conservationists

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.680
who get very angry with me.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.710
And they say, well,
de-extinction and conservation

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:01.212
are completely distinct.

00:30:01.212 --> 00:30:02.420
You can't lump them together.

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:03.430
You can't.

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:05.210
Because conservation
is about helping

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:09.130
the living, and de-extinction
is about the dead.

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:10.860
And I think that is
a reasonable point.

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:12.500
I don't have a
problem with that.

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.040
But there are two points
that I make at that.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.010
The first is this.

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:23.180
If we can get DNA
from museum specimens

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:29.370
like this surprised looking
cat, or from mammoth teeth,

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:32.980
or from a pickled
Tasmanian tiger in a jar--

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:35.820
we can get DNA from
all these things.

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.380
If we can take DNA
from cells that

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:42.800
came from endangered species
that have been frozen away,

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:46.780
if we can get DNA from that and
we can use that DNA to create

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:51.370
life, then maybe some
types of creatures

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:54.470
aren't quite as
extinct as others.

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:57.960
Maybe there are different
degrees of extinctness.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.840
And I think that's a really,
really interesting concept.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.630
So dinosaurs are well
and truly extinct.

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:04.400
They're never coming back.

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.870
But we've suddenly got
this blurry spectrum

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:10.550
between life and death
that didn't exist before.

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:12.670
And that fascinates me.

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:15.170
And the other point is this.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:17.990
Apart from my dog, this is
probably my favorite animal

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:19.430
on the planet.

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:21.550
This is the northern
white rhino.

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:25.910
And there are just three of
these animals left, three.

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:29.720
And they live in a
wildlife reserve in Kenya.

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:33.220
And there's a grandfather,
a mother, and a daughter,

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:36.870
but they are too old,
too ill, and too related

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:38.400
to breed naturally.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:42.420
So basically, they are
functionally extinct.

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:45.930
Here are animals that are alive
but that are the walking dead.

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:47.330
They're ghosts.

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:52.240
So if we do nothing,
they're extinct already.

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.800
So I would argue that
attempts to bring back

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:58.340
the northern white rhino
count as de-extinction.

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:00.139
It is a form of conservation.

00:32:00.139 --> 00:32:02.180
And there is a guy who
works out of Berlin called

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:06.025
Thomas Hildebrandt who was
doing some amazing work trying

00:32:06.025 --> 00:32:07.400
to save the northern
white rhino,

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.499
using some of these
new high techniques.

00:32:10.499 --> 00:32:12.540
And I'd like to leave you
with one final thought.

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:16.550
If we're prepared to think
about de-extinction, if we're

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:18.850
prepared to at least
consider in the future

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:25.080
that it might be a positive
force, I think, why stop there?

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.420
How about if we
accept as we must

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:30.520
that the world is changing,
that it's warming,

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.630
that habitats are changing?

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:36.460
How about, for example, we use
these gene editing techniques

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:39.730
that we have to improve
the fate of the endangered

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:41.970
species on our planet?

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:45.820
What about if when scientists
bring back the gastric brooding

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:49.030
frog they add in
some genes to make

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:51.250
it resistant to the
chytrid fungus that

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:54.130
would kill it if we released
it into the wild today?

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:57.080
Maybe that's worth
thinking about.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.710
Maybe we could
engineer fish to be

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:03.591
able to survive
rising temperatures.

00:33:03.591 --> 00:33:05.090
And this is another
very key animal.

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:07.460
This is the black-footed ferret.

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:10.710
These animals currently-- all
living black-footed ferrets

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:13.610
today-- are descended from
seven founder members.

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:15.570
They're very, very inbred.

00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:18.910
And they're the subject of
a massive captive breeding

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:19.434
project.

00:33:19.434 --> 00:33:21.100
But when they're
released into the wild,

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.225
they die because there's
a disease out there that's

00:33:23.225 --> 00:33:25.550
nobbling them called
sylvatic plague.

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:30.820
So plans are afoot to edit
genetic diversity back

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:32.650
into the black-footed ferret.

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:35.870
And plans are afoot
to edit in genes

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:39.530
that confer resistance to the
disease that is killing it.

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:41.790
And the black-footed
ferret could possibly

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:46.850
become the very first
genetically altered wild

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:47.720
animal.

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.620
It's something that
the FDA in America--

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:54.910
sorry, no the FDA-- the American
authorities are considering.

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:56.940
So there we are, de-extinction.

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.900
I don't want you to go
away with the message

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.358
that it's about to
happen tomorrow.

00:34:00.358 --> 00:34:01.600
It's not.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:05.690
But the science is moving
at a very, very quick pace.

00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:07.330
And I believe this is possible.

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:10.130
And de-extinction won't
stop with the birth

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:14.120
of the first healthy
de-extinct animal.

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:17.000
That will be the beginning
of a long process

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.860
that we'll see these
animals nurtured

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:21.280
in captivity for a short while.

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.400
They will be able
to grow up, check

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.780
to make sure they're
healthy, check

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:27.730
to see that they
can breed naturally,

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:30.060
and then-- and this is the
most difficult part of all,

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:32.380
probably-- released
into the wild

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:35.210
under the guidance of ecologists
where you would hope they would

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:39.090
flourish and interact with the
environment in a positive way.

00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:44.650
So we have at our fingertips
these incredible processes--

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:48.730
gene editing, stem cell
biology, assisted reproduction--

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:52.510
that cannot only bring
back extinct species.

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:57.270
They can also sculpt the
future of life on our planet.

00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:59.600
And I'd like to finish
with a quote, which

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.870
I think is particularly
relevant at this point.

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:06.320
I think it was
Spiderman's uncle who

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:12.040
once said, "With great power
comes great responsibility."

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.670
So I think we need to
consider our next move very,

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:15.830
very carefully.

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:17.500
Thank you very
much for listening.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.602
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.960
KIT: So we have some
time for questions.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.050
Brilliant.

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:31.377
If you could speak into the
microphone, that'd be great.

00:35:31.377 --> 00:35:32.210
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:37.380
You say that human cloning has
understandably been outlawed.

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:40.180
Where does the boundary lie?

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:43.190
Would we be allowed to
de-extinct Neaderthals,

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:48.169
Austral-- [GIBBERISH] and
other such Homo [GIBBERISH].

00:35:48.169 --> 00:35:50.210
HELEN PILCHER: It's really
interesting, actually.

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:52.259
So there's a chapter
in the book about them

00:35:52.259 --> 00:35:53.300
that you just mentioned--

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:54.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:56.960
--that includes Neanderthals,
and it's very interesting.

00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:00.360
Because of course human cloning,
human reproductive cloning,

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.440
is widely banned,
not in every country,

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.367
but in most developed
countries, and rightly so.

00:36:05.367 --> 00:36:07.450
But actually, when those
laws were being drawn up,

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:12.200
nobody was even thinking
about pre-humans.

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.060
And there are currently
as I understand

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:19.100
it no laws forbidding cloning
a Neanderthal because it's not

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:20.880
Homo sapiens.

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.585
Now, I think by extension
as we learn more and more

00:36:23.585 --> 00:36:25.460
about Neanderthals,
we're learning that these

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.960
weren't some primitive savages.

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.850
These were very sophisticated
people for their time.

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:32.660
They'd been around
much longer than us

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:34.850
and were capable of doing
some amazing things.

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:38.150
They were very, very human
for want of a better word.

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:39.900
And I don't think
cloning a Neanderthal is

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:41.640
a good idea at all.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.210
But what's
interesting is that we

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:48.910
find the technology, in theory,
is there to make it happen.

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:50.970
And currently, there's
no legislation in place

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:52.510
to stop it from happening.

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:55.500
But scientist in their right
mind is considering it,

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:56.897
I'm pleased to say.

00:36:56.897 --> 00:36:58.480
And I don't think
anybody ever should.

00:37:05.849 --> 00:37:07.390
AUDIENCE: Do you
think we should have

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:11.450
any concerns about a number of
hybrid species being produced

00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:14.330
as a result of gene editing?

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:17.080
HELEN PILCHER: Well, I think
that's an interesting question.

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:21.730
If we start putting genes
into endangered species,

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:23.430
for a start, we're
not necessarily

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:26.147
talking about putting
genes from another species.

00:37:26.147 --> 00:37:27.980
We're not necessarily
talking about crossing

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:29.770
genes between species.

00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:31.720
It could be that we find
some frogs out there

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.310
that are already
immune to chytrid

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:36.270
and we might be able use
that genetic sequence.

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:38.520
But in fact, that's
kind of a moot point.

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:43.470
This idea of using gene editing
to kind of enhance wildlife

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:45.880
is actually a very
logical extension

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:49.034
to something that happens
in the natural world

00:37:49.034 --> 00:37:50.200
and in conservation already.

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.520
So in the natural
world, hybridization

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.720
does occur between species.

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:54.890
Not often, but it does.

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:57.720
Certainly within the bird
world, it's really quite common.

00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.490
There was a study
recently where they

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:01.660
analyzed the DNA
of a pile of birds

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:05.680
and found suspicious genes
that came from other species.

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:09.330
And then the other thing
is that conservationists

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:11.390
are very conservative.

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:12.590
That's a very good name.

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:15.320
And they tend not to like
things that are terribly new.

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.150
But one conservation
practice that's

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:19.580
been going on for a
long time is that when

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:21.680
populations of animals
dwindled down to very,

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:23.520
very low numbers,
what they will do

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:27.640
is introduce animals from
a separate population

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:30.320
to introduce genetic diversity.

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:34.040
And sometimes that occurs not
necessarily within species

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.960
but within the sub species.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:39.050
So the Florida panther is
kind of a famous example where

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:42.430
the Florida panther was
seriously depleted in numbers,

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:44.472
getting desperately inbred.

00:38:44.472 --> 00:38:45.680
And then this is a while ago.

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:48.340
People imported
the Texas panther.

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:52.270
And they interbred, and
things got better as a result.

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:54.620
So this might seem kind
of new and unfamiliar,

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:56.840
but I would argue
actually this is something

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.870
that happens naturally.

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:02.450
One of the scientists--
a conservation

00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:04.740
biologist-- he said,
look, for years and years,

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:08.860
people have been solving this
problem by moving the animals.

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:11.190
I'm suggesting we
move the genes.

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:13.330
The end result is
probably the same.

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:14.880
Although maybe if
we do it our way,

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.713
we've got a little bit
more control over it.

00:39:18.854 --> 00:39:20.020
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:23.810
Is anyone looking at putting
back plant life or other fauna

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:25.555
or flora, rather,
instead of just fauna.

00:39:25.555 --> 00:39:27.055
HELEN PILCHER: I
didn't particularly

00:39:27.055 --> 00:39:28.180
look at plants in the book.

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:32.120
But what we have, of course,
are these amazing seed banks,

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:34.490
these repositories of
seeds where they're

00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:38.870
trying to harvest as many seeds
as they can before plants go

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:39.380
extinct.

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:41.005
And of course, if
you've got the seeds,

00:39:41.005 --> 00:39:42.730
it's relatively straightforward.

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:44.950
So I don't know about
de-extincting plant life.

00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:47.200
But going to the other end
of the spectrum where we're

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.470
thinking about gene
editing, of course

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:52.030
GM is commonplace in the
[INAUDIBLE] world now.

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:54.690
But the first
genetically modified tree

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:56.620
is the American chestnut.

00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:59.360
And that had a gene
from wheat pasted

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.920
into the gene of
the chestnut tree

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:04.070
because it was suffering from a
particular type of blight that

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:06.791
was completely hammering
this type of tree.

00:40:06.791 --> 00:40:08.540
And they're now at the
stage in the States

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:10.960
now where they're considering--
they've got test plots,

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.640
and they're considering
about how they might possibly

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:14.990
return this tree to the wild.

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:21.520
AUDIENCE: Do you need
DNA from both genders

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.368
in order to be able to
bring a species back?

00:40:24.368 --> 00:40:28.190
And how many individual
DNA do you need in order

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:32.280
to have enough diversity?

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.260
HELEN PILCHER: Do you
need a male and a female?

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:35.400
Yes.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:39.290
So, you know, this depends
on us having samples

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:41.290
in museums of mixed genders.

00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:46.000
And if we don't, maybe we
think about hybridizing, say,

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.909
a northern white rhino
with its living cousin,

00:40:48.909 --> 00:40:49.950
the southern white rhino.

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:52.790
So you might not make a
pure northern white rhino.

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:55.220
But you at least save its genes.

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.220
And then over time, you
can breed a purer animal

00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:58.790
as time goes on.

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:02.819
And in terms of a
founding population size,

00:41:02.819 --> 00:41:03.860
we don't know, basically.

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:06.400
It depends on all sorts of
things like the generation

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.640
time of the animal.

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:11.530
So the black-footed ferret
was presumed extinct.

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:13.070
In the 1980s, they
thought it had

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:15.212
been wiped out by this
plague that was killing it.

00:41:15.212 --> 00:41:17.420
And they went out and caught
every single last animal

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:20.060
they could find from
the plains in Wyoming.

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:21.870
They brought 18
animals into captivity.

00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:23.050
This was 1989.

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:25.450
And it was seen as this
amazing conservation thing.

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:27.930
Nobody had ever gone
out there and captured

00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:30.797
all the members of a
species in the wild

00:41:30.797 --> 00:41:31.880
and put them in captivity.

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.300
It was really
radical for its time.

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:37.330
The problem was that from
these 18 founder members,

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:39.790
only seven survived.

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:43.760
And 9,000 ferrets later, through
this captive breeding project

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:46.230
that they have ongoing,
they're beginning

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:48.380
to show signs of inbreeding.

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:52.700
But they have cells from some
of the original animals that

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:57.560
were caught that for whatever
reason didn't manage to breed.

00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:00.060
And they figure
that if they manage

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:05.750
to create new animals from
two of those original animals,

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:07.340
they increase the
size of the founding

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.517
population from seven to nine.

00:42:09.517 --> 00:42:11.600
And they think that will
give them a decent chance

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:15.050
of enough genetic diversity.

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:18.220
But it's a question that
varies from species to species.

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:22.300
And genetic diversity is quite
a stochastic random process.

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:24.910
So it has a lot to do with a
random shuffling of the genes

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:26.440
when creatures reproduce.

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:29.170
You might be lucky and get
away with a very small founding

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:29.820
number.

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:31.730
Or in some cases, it
might take a larger one.

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:35.787
AUDIENCE: OK, nice talk.

00:42:35.787 --> 00:42:36.620
Thank you very much.

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:36.960
HELEN PILCHER: Thank you.

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.126
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:42:38.126 --> 00:42:43.640
So you talk about there's a
lot of technology to recreate

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.320
animals that are extinct.

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:47.130
Do we have that
amount of technology

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:51.350
to like predict the impact of
this animal in the environment?

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:53.780
Because if we bring
back the mammoth

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:56.330
and we put him somewhere,
whatever, somewhere that would

00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:59.070
be nice for him,
what can we expect

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:01.269
from him destroying everything
else because there's

00:43:01.269 --> 00:43:02.060
an imbalance there?

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:03.696
Or like the pigeon.

00:43:03.696 --> 00:43:05.070
Because we have
a pigeon problem.

00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:06.550
There's lots of pigeons.

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:11.362
If we put a new pigeon
there, what can happen?

00:43:11.362 --> 00:43:14.400
Do we have technology
to think about it?

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:18.820
To understand what might happen
with these dead animals coming

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:19.460
back?

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:20.974
And just one more thing.

00:43:20.974 --> 00:43:22.390
Do you think that
if someone finds

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:25.390
like a very big
piece of dinosaur,

00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:27.250
like they found from
the mammoth, maybe

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:28.740
they can come back?

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:30.030
That would be awesome.

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:30.977
Like "Jurassic Park."

00:43:30.977 --> 00:43:32.310
HELEN PILCHER: Wishful thinking.

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:38.170
All right, well, so the first
question-- de-extinction

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:40.030
at the moment is a
process in development.

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:41.984
It's kind of at the
cell biology stage

00:43:41.984 --> 00:43:43.400
and at the create
an animal stage.

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.050
And what's missing,
in my opinion,

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:46.862
is this kind of
long-term thinking

00:43:46.862 --> 00:43:48.820
where we start thinking
about what happens when

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:49.977
these animals are released.

00:43:49.977 --> 00:43:52.310
And that's not to say that
the thinking is not going on,

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:54.870
but that's a discussion that's
really just starting now.

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:57.920
And we need ecologists brought
on on these discussions

00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.630
from a really early point.

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:02.020
And not only that, we
need paleoecologists.

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:04.790
So we need people that
have studied these animals

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:05.800
the first time around.

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:06.970
They've looked at their remains.

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:09.261
They've learned from what
happened when this animal was

00:44:09.261 --> 00:44:10.702
around the first time around.

00:44:10.702 --> 00:44:12.910
And certainly with a passenger
pigeon, that something

00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:13.380
that's happening.

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:15.463
The guy who's leading the
passenger pigeon project

00:44:15.463 --> 00:44:16.820
is a guy called Ben Novak.

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:18.540
And he's passionate
about the project.

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:21.010
And he's gone through all
the historical records.

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:23.360
And he has a very,
very clear idea

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.900
of how passenger pigeons,
when they were alive,

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:27.990
interacted with
their environment.

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:31.050
So they were like this
swarm of feathered locusts.

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:34.270
These birds would
land and devastate

00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:36.020
the deciduous woodlands
where they landed,

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.395
which doesn't
sound great, right?

00:44:37.395 --> 00:44:38.810
But bear with me.

00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:40.210
So they would land on masse.

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:41.210
They would topple trees.

00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:43.770
They would cover the
forest floor in guano.

00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:46.480
But from that apparent
devastation came life.

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.450
So a stagnant, closed,
canopy woodland

00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:51.510
turned into one that was sunlit.

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:53.800
And the guano
fertilized the ground.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.490
And it paved the
way for the growth

00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:59.230
of all sorts of
different plants which

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:01.890
brought in insects and small
mammals and amphibians which

00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:04.630
brought in big grazers
which brought in predators.

00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:07.330
And he's modeled this whole
thing very, very carefully.

00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:12.290
And he is pretty confident that
because the passenger pigeon

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:16.690
was such a keystone
species, its actions

00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:19.880
have these repercussions
across the entire landscape.

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.640
But if you introduced it
back into that environment,

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:26.990
it would drive this recycling
of the eastern North American

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:30.750
forest that has been absent
since it's being gone.

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:34.710
But that's something we need to
think about really carefully.

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:37.710
You know ultimately,
we don't know.

00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:39.540
And ultimately, we
need to build that

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:42.029
into the release
of these animals.

00:45:42.029 --> 00:45:44.570
We also need to think about a
get out plan for these animals.

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:47.951
You know, the world is riddled
with invasive species that

00:45:47.951 --> 00:45:49.700
are causing-- they're
responsible for most

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:52.246
of the extinctions that are
happening certainly on islands.

00:45:52.246 --> 00:45:53.370
They're a big, big problem.

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:55.260
You don't want
anything that you go

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:58.990
to all this trouble of creating
to be considered a pest.

00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:00.590
You don't have to kill it again.

00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:02.840
So these are things that we
need to think about really

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:05.550
carefully, and I hope that
answers the first question.

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:07.384
And the second question
is with dinosaurs,

00:46:07.384 --> 00:46:09.425
there's a lady called Mary
Schweitzer in America.

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:13.950
She studies dinosaur
bones, and she's

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:18.590
seen these really
tantalizing glimpses

00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:22.410
of biological molecules
inside dinosaur bones.

00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:24.290
So I wouldn't call
them proteins,

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:27.010
but she sees signs of proteins.

00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:29.590
She sees signs of cells.

00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:32.850
And her results are
pretty controversial.

00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:36.610
And yet, they're beginning to be
backed up by some other groups.

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:38.670
There was a group
at UCLA last year

00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:41.010
who found something similar.

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:43.080
People haven't really
looked in dinosaur bones

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:44.830
for these kind of
biological molecules

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:47.000
because we've been taught
at school that they

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.080
are-- it's mineral--
that they're inorganic.

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:53.372
But that dogma is potentially
beginning to change now.

00:46:53.372 --> 00:46:55.580
And she went even further
because for her, of course,

00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:59.750
the natural progression is to
say, could DNA be in there?

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:04.690
And she ran some tests on
some quite ancient dinosaur

00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:08.631
bones and sees signs of DNA.

00:47:08.631 --> 00:47:10.130
So I'm not saying
there's DNA there,

00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:12.160
but she saw a signature of DNA.

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:15.860
However, it's one
thing for DNA maybe

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:18.180
to be there in fossils,
which is questionable,

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:19.680
fossils of that age.

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:23.100
It's quite another for it
to be in any usable form.

00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:25.760
And I don't think we will
ever get DNA in a usable form

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:26.990
from dinosaur bones.

00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:29.440
You have to be
able to reconstruct

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.530
the genetic
sequence, the genome,

00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:34.110
to give you that set of
instructions to create life.

00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:36.384
And would you like
a pet dinosaur?

00:47:36.384 --> 00:47:37.350
AUDIENCE: Sure!

00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:38.960
HELEN PILCHER: Me
too, but sadly,

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:40.140
we're going to have
to settle for dogs

00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:41.880
and bring them in-- it'd
be better bringing in dogs

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:42.838
to work than dinosaurs.

00:47:42.838 --> 00:47:45.240
That could get messy.

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:46.562
KIT: One here.

00:47:46.562 --> 00:47:48.270
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks
a lot for your talk.

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:48.530
HELEN PILCHER: Thank you.

00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:49.655
AUDIENCE: I thought you were
interesting and engaging.

00:47:49.655 --> 00:47:50.556
I have one question.

00:47:50.556 --> 00:47:51.930
It seems like the
biggest problem

00:47:51.930 --> 00:47:55.790
is having a source of DNA
and from dangerous species.

00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:58.640
Are we doing anything to create
a sort of bank for the future?

00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:01.220
Because if it's not today,
it might be in 100 years.

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:03.850
These techniques will
be finalized and work.

00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:06.090
So are we thinking about
building this instead of

00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:10.032
relying on single museums that
might have one species' DNA

00:48:10.032 --> 00:48:10.990
or something like that?

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:13.170
Are we doing
something more global?

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:16.260
HELEN PILCHER: Yeah, so we've
got this massive repository

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:19.140
of DNA in museums.

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:22.010
But it's much better
to have frozen cells

00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:24.211
because then you've got
something that is alive

00:48:24.211 --> 00:48:25.210
that you can start with.

00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:26.800
It's far easier
to start with DNA

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:30.550
inside a living cell than
DNA inside a stuffed museum

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:31.500
specimen.

00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:34.410
So the museum specimens
are kind of like a source

00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:36.240
of last recourse, if you like.

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.810
What is really important
are the viable cells

00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:40.880
that are frozen in vats
of liquid nitrogen.

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:42.610
And there are
multiple initiatives

00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:44.901
all around the world that
are doing exactly what you're

00:48:44.901 --> 00:48:45.490
thinking of.

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:48.820
The biggest one is at the
San Diego Zoo in America

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:50.930
where they have something
called the frozen zoo.

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:55.170
And through their zoo there but
also through many other zoos

00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:58.000
and wildlife collections
around the world,

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.012
they send body parts
to San Diego Zoo,

00:49:02.012 --> 00:49:03.220
and they culture these cells.

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:04.764
And they freeze them.

00:49:04.764 --> 00:49:06.930
The guy who leads this is
a guy called Oliver Ryder,

00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:08.263
and I heard him speak last year.

00:49:08.263 --> 00:49:11.620
And he said he's always getting
interesting things in the post.

00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:14.650
So apparently there was some
orca at SeaWorld or somewhere

00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:16.290
that had just given birth.

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:17.910
And they grabbed
the umbilical cord,

00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:19.284
and they packed it in dry eyes.

00:49:19.284 --> 00:49:21.700
And they sent it to him, and
they cultured cells from that

00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:23.050
and they froze them down.

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:26.660
So yes, and that's
the interesting thing.

00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:29.770
That if we have these frozen
cells in liquid nitrogen,

00:49:29.770 --> 00:49:33.230
you have a species maybe
in stasis, not quite alive,

00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.990
not quite dead.

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:35.580
I mean, clearly it is dead.

00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:37.530
But it's not as dead
as some other things.

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:41.680
So yes, people are trying to
collect as much biodiversity

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:43.670
as they possibly can
and squirrel it away

00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:44.640
for a rainy day.

00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:46.210
And it's not just
there, actually.

00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:48.390
I should say the main
point of these things

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:51.280
is not really there for
bringing animals back to life.

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:54.910
The main reason for these
cells being collected

00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:56.740
is to use them as a
source of learning.

00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:59.650
They're used in research
papers all around the world.

00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:03.130
But by studying DNA
from endangered species,

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:05.710
you get an idea of the health
of these endangered species.

00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:08.310
You can see if they're going
through a genetic bottleneck.

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:11.390
It can give you some idea of how
to manage your captive breeding

00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:12.570
programs.

00:50:12.570 --> 00:50:15.100
So the cells that
are being frozen away

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:19.100
are being used for all
sorts of excellent purposes.

00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:21.490
And de-extinction is maybe
just a glint in the eye

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:23.020
somewhere off to
the side of that.

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:25.310
But it could be used
for that in the future.

00:50:28.292 --> 00:50:29.783
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:29.783 --> 00:50:34.256
What's the difference,
then, between [INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:34.256 --> 00:50:37.735
So that's the same--
[INAUDIBLE] same lines.

00:50:37.735 --> 00:50:40.035
Is it just going to
be a woolly elephant?

00:50:40.035 --> 00:50:41.910
HELEN PILCHER: It's
going to be a mammothant.

00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:43.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:44.062
Or an elemmoth.

00:50:44.062 --> 00:50:45.020
No, you're quite right.

00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:45.700
It won't be.

00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:48.970
If George Church has his way,
he's not calling it a mammoth.

00:50:48.970 --> 00:50:51.840
He's saying he's making
a cold adapted elephant.

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:54.630
He's making an elephant--
his creature-- I should also

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:57.330
say none of these creatures that
get de-extincted if and when

00:50:57.330 --> 00:50:59.700
it happens will be the
same as the originals

00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:02.200
for many, many
reasons, many reasons.

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:04.580
One of the reasons is
their genetic makeup.

00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:06.670
So George Church is
an extreme example

00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:09.510
where he will end up, if
he succeeds in his quest,

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:12.590
with an animal that is
genetically overwhelmingly

00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:16.187
elephant with a little
sprinkling of mammoth DNA.

00:51:16.187 --> 00:51:17.770
But he says, well,
hey, I'm completely

00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:20.350
fine with that so
long as this animal

00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:23.310
acts like a woolly
mammoth and can perform

00:51:23.310 --> 00:51:25.720
the same ecological
role as a woolly mammoth

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:28.037
when we put it back,
say, into Siberia.

00:51:28.037 --> 00:51:29.620
Then I don't have a
problem with that.

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:32.080
And that's the way the
de-extinction community feels.

00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:35.000
It's not about creating
an absolute replica.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.555
It's about something that will
fulfill a lost ecological need.

00:51:38.555 --> 00:51:40.180
AUDIENCE: I had a
really quick question

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:44.450
about the pregnancy or
the surrogacy rather.

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:47.160
Say, for example, with
the bucardo goat was,

00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:49.190
how do you select
the animal to carry

00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:50.870
the bucardo goat [INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:54.990
Is it a similar mountain goat
that shares a lot of the DNA?

00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:57.660
Also for the woolly mammoth,
would that potentially

00:51:57.660 --> 00:51:59.480
be an elephant?

00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:00.680
How is that process?

00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:02.096
HELEN PILCHER:
What you need to do

00:52:02.096 --> 00:52:04.172
is you need to find the
closest living relative.

00:52:04.172 --> 00:52:06.380
So, you know, I said it's
great if you can bring back

00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:08.540
an animal that is
genetically distinct.

00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:10.139
Well, of course
the problem there

00:52:10.139 --> 00:52:12.180
is that if it is genetically
distinct and unique,

00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:13.684
what do you use as a surrogate?

00:52:13.684 --> 00:52:15.600
Which is where something
like a frog is great.

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:17.850
Because you don't
need a surrogate.

00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:19.660
If you don't need a
womb, you've removed

00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:21.010
a whole lot of problems.

00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:23.480
Now, with the bucardo,
they used obviously

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:24.730
an existing type of goat.

00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:27.760
They had to create a particular
hybrid because the bucardo's

00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:30.540
closest living
relative ended up being

00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:33.570
really flighty and difficult
to look after in captivity.

00:52:33.570 --> 00:52:36.330
And it literally
climbed the walls

00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:38.800
and was so neurotic they
couldn't work with it.

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.600
So they created a
hybrid goat where

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:44.300
they bred its closest living
relative with a domestic goat

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:46.980
and found that that worked
really well as a surrogate.

00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:50.150
So, I mean, when I
give these talks,

00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:53.050
you don't get a flavor
of the huge amount

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:56.020
of research and effort that
goes into what happens.

00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:57.700
So just choosing
the right surrogate

00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:00.574
and getting it to work was
massive for the bucardo team.

00:53:00.574 --> 00:53:02.490
And yet, with a woolly
mammoth, my big problem

00:53:02.490 --> 00:53:05.670
with a woolly mammoth
is that it involves

00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:10.050
using elephant eggs, which are
in really, really short supply,

00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:11.950
and elephants as surrogates.

00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:14.530
Now, there is one potential
way around getting

00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:15.892
hold of elephant eggs.

00:53:15.892 --> 00:53:17.350
Scientists are now
in this position

00:53:17.350 --> 00:53:23.720
where they can take skin cells,
reprogram them into stem cells,

00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:26.640
and use them to
generate egg and sperm.

00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:29.250
So that potentially is
a very exciting tool

00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:30.440
we have at our fingertips.

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:32.740
It's been demonstrated in mice.

00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:34.950
The whole process hasn't
been shown particularly

00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:37.850
for endangered species, but
people are working on that.

00:53:37.850 --> 00:53:40.725
So maybe we can get a hold
of a load of elephant eggs

00:53:40.725 --> 00:53:42.551
to perform these techniques.

00:53:42.551 --> 00:53:44.050
But then you still
need a surrogate,

00:53:44.050 --> 00:53:46.160
and I don't feel
good about that.

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:49.240
You know, elephants are
seriously endangered.

00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:51.970
They're not
experimental animals.

00:53:51.970 --> 00:53:54.970
And George Church-- he was
amazing-- will say to you,

00:53:54.970 --> 00:53:55.479
come on.

00:53:55.479 --> 00:53:56.020
Think bigger.

00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:56.561
Think bigger.

00:53:56.561 --> 00:54:00.160
Think artificial womb.

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:02.250
Until we get to that point
or until the elephant's

00:54:02.250 --> 00:54:02.650
[INAUDIBLE].

00:54:02.650 --> 00:54:03.330
But you know what,
I'm never going

00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:05.663
to be comfortable with using
an elephant as a surrogate.

00:54:05.663 --> 00:54:07.400
For me, that is a
massive stumbling block

00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:08.640
with the woolly mammoth.

00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:12.000
And we need to think about the
repercussions of every-- we

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.590
can't sacrifice one endangered
species to bring back

00:54:15.590 --> 00:54:16.980
another from the dead.

00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:18.500
So all of these
questions need to be

00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:21.712
thought about really deeply.

00:54:21.712 --> 00:54:23.753
KIT: With that, please
join me in a massive round

00:54:23.753 --> 00:54:25.060
of applause for Helen Pilcher.

00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:26.101
HELEN PILCHER: Thank you.

00:54:26.101 --> 00:54:29.010
[APPLAUSE]
