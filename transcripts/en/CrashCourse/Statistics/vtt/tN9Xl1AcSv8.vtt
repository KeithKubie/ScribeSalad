00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:05.180
Hi, I’m Adriene Hill.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.170
This is Crash Course Statistics.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.280
In the last video we talked about why we care
about statistics.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.320
How we use statistics.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.660
And Statistics is math.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.980
So we thought we’d take a detour from the
traditional curriculum to talk about how to

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.430
think about numbers.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.140
Really, really big numbers.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.740
Really small numbers.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.960
And how to make sense of them.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.550
We’re also going talk about mathematical
thinking.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.620
And fighter jets.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:37.700
INTRO

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.700
Chances are, if you are watching this channel,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.260
and certainly if you are commenting below,
you are literate.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.290
You understand language and how to use it.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.730
But--are you equally comfortable with numbers?

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.670
I’m not talking about being able to calculate
square roots in your head.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.120
Or instantly tell whether or not 17321 is
prime or not.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.120
(It is.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.120
I looked it up.)

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.399
Numeracy is about being able to wrap your
head around what it means when politicians

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.570
talk about a one-point-five-trillion-dollar
budget hole.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.240
It’s about getting a handle on how much
you should really lose sleep over the chance

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.799
of an Ebola outbreak.

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.040
And how to compare that risk to the chance
of being killed by a terrorist.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.310
Or a snake bite.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.220
Or dying from an opioid overdose.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.180
And what those comparisons might tell us about
the time and resources we spend trying to

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.480
address those problems.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.440
Mathematical thinking is about seeing the
world in a different way.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.220
Which means sometimes seeing beyond our intuition
or gut feeling.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.980
Because it turns out most of our guts are
good at digesting food and pretty bad at math.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.760
Infants less than a year old can discern between
three objects.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.529
I am much more advanced than an infant and
can pretty easily comprehend the difference

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:42.200
in one and a hundred.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.540
Even the difference between a hundred and
a thousand or maybe even ten thousand.

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.600
For most of us, once numbers get really big,
we lose our ability to have any intuitive

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:52.639
sense of them.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.580
The distinction between a million and a billion
and a trillion is really hard to visualize.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.420
There are 100-trillion bacteria in each of
our bodies and non-mathematical guts.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.419
100-trillion.

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:07.430
There are an estimated 10- quintillion insects
that are alive right now.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.130
And an estimated 300-sextillion stars in the
universe.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.360
So how do you even begin to think about those
big numbers and what they mean?

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.190
Let’s go to the THOUGHT BUBBLE.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.560
Take a minute to visualize the difference
between one and one hundred and one thousand

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.129
and a hundred thousand and a million.

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.019
That’s a lot of dots a whole lot of dots.`

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.569
There are other good ways to try to make sense
of big numbers.

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.680
You can try to put the number in context.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.319
The US debt is in the neighborhood of 20-Trillion
dollars.

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.879
About 323 million people live in the US.

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:46.299
So--the debt owed for each person is about
sixty-two thousand and five hundred dollars.

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.350
You can turn a big number into a unit of measurement
you are more comfortable with.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:57.520
The Kola Superdeep Borehole, which is the
deepest artificial point on earth is 40,230 ft deep.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.160
I have no idea how deep that is.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.209
Until you tell me that it’s 7 and a half
miles down.

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.689
And I can start to picture it.

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.650
You can have reference points for big numbers,
ready to go.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.990
There are about 100-thousand words in a 400
page novel.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.740
About 46-thousand people show up to Dodgers
games in Los Angeles.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.120
I can roughly visualize that.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.379
A million people taking to the streets to
protest--might be easier to think of as 21

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:23.750
Dodger Stadium’s worth of people.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.740
Or 14 and a half crowds for a Real Madrid
match.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.040
Time can help us go even bigger.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.140
A million seconds is a little less than 12
days.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.659
What about a billion seconds?

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.310
Do you think you are a billion seconds old?

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.739
Are you older than 32?

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.370
It takes 32 YEARS for a billion seconds to
pass.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.439
And what about a trillion seconds?

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.780
Think you or I will be alive after a trillion
seconds passes?

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.200
Sorry to break it to you.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.200
But no.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.200
We will not.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.670
Even if you are destined to be the Guinness
Book of World Records oldest woman.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.340
There is a 100% chance, barring massive medical
breakthroughs that you will be dead.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.460
It takes 32-thousand years for a trillion
seconds to tick by.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.140
Thanks thought bubble.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.860
A quick note about scientific notation.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.840
Scientific notation can be really helpful
for calculating with big numbers, but not

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.160
necessarily helpful for understanding them.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.460
Without context, exponents can be non-intuitive
if that’s a word in their own way.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.460
10 to the 39th and 10 to the 32nd sound like
they might be close.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.610
But 10 to the 39th is 10-MILLION times larger
than 10 to the 32nd.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.600
We’re not going to run the dots on that
one.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.220
There are about 7-point-six billion people
on earth.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.400
7-point-6 BILLION.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.740
Understanding the sheer number of people out
there in the world, can help us make sense

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.040
of the common-ness of coincidences or improbable
events.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.060
Some statisticians call it the “law of truly
large numbers”.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.660
The idea here is that with a large enough
group, or sample, unlikely things are completely

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.820
likely to happen.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.020
Consider this example from statistician David
Hand.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.400
On September 6th, 2009, the Bulgarian lottery randomly selected as the winning numbers

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.200
4, 15, 23, 24, 35, 42.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.840
And then, four days later, on September 10th,
the Bulgarian lottery randomly selected new

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:17.960
winning numbers.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.210
4, 15, 23, 24, 35, and 42.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.360
Exactly the same numbers.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.400
People freaked out.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.640
Bulgaria’s sports minister ordered an investigation.Was
it fraud?

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.660
Something else?

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.000
Hand says calm down.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.660
It’s just coincidence.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:39.480
He lays out the math to prove it--but part
of the argument here is the law of truly large numbers.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.580
If you consider the number of lotto drawings--every
week--around the world--over years and years--

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:50.160
“it would be amazing” he wrote, “if
draws did not occasionally repeat.”

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.750
Speaking of those incredibly unlikely things...we
need to talk about the flip side of incredibly

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:55.750
big numbers….

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.570
The incredibly small numbers--that can also
be hard to comprehend.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.140
Take the likelihood of winning a Mega Millions
jackpot in the US.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.340
Right now it’s about one in 302.6 million.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:13.920
The probability that you’d win the jackpot
is 0.000-000-003-305.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.900
Let’s put the teeny-tiny chance of that
happening in some perspective 302.6 million

00:06:18.911 --> 00:06:22.010
is the number of seconds in more than 9 and
a half years.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.690
So, to borrow here from a very funny post
by Tim Urban on Wait But Why that’s like

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.700
knowing that a hedgehog will sneeze once in
the next 9 and a half years and betting on

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.520
the exact second... during those nine and
a half years... that the hedgehog will need

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.520
a tissue.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.940
I’m going with May 2nd, 2:23 and 33 seconds
PM, 2021.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.710
Our inability to judge small numbers does
more than just cause us to misjudge our chances

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:47.720
of winning the lottery.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.780
It causes us to worry about the wrong things.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.540
To fear the wrong things.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.350
Take your chance of dying from Ebola.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.610
If you live in the US--the chance that you’ll
be killed by Ebola in any given year is pretty

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.300
close to your chance of winning the mega millions
lottery.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.420
One in 309.6 million.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:09.450
It is, among the very, very least likely ways
anybody living in the US will die in a year.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:14.130
Though you are, by some accounts, LESS likely
to be killed by a terrorist attack in the

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:15.610
US committed by a refugee.

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:23.171
In a 2016 study, researchers calculated that
at one in 3.64 Billion chance in the US in

00:07:23.171 --> 00:07:24.171
a given year.

00:07:24.171 --> 00:07:27.130
And you far more likely to be die in dozens
of other ways.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:31.380
There is a one in 6 million chance someone
living in the US will be killed in a given

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.460
year by bee sting.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.340
A one in 708-thousand chance that they’ll
die falling from a ladder.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.670
A one in 538 chance they’ll die in a given
year from cancer.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:45.050
And...not a big cause of death...but did you
know people die in sand holes that they or

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:46.740
their friends have dug out at the beach.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:47.740
They crawl in.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.480
Looking for a little time in the sand hole.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.480
And woosh.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.640
The hole suddenly collapses and they are buried.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.040
Stay out of sand holes.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.430
I’m going to stop because it’s stressing
me out.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:59.120
The point here is that it’s worth taking
the time to think through small numbers.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.370
Cause they can help you figure out what’s
actually worth worrying about.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.370
And what isn’t.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:08.500
What you might want to act on and what you
might want society to take more and less seriously.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.690
My personal take away is that I’d be way
better off spending more time exercising and

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.760
less time looking around obsessively for poisonous
snakes.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.580
Cause the annual odds of dying from a snake bite in the US are only about one in 34

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:25.560
million, but the odds of dying from heart
disease in any given year are one in 534.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.800
Thinking mathematically isn’t just about
understanding numbers better.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.130
It’s about asking important questions about
the world around us.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.839
And letting numbers illuminate those questions.

00:08:34.839 --> 00:08:39.409
One of my favorite examples mathematical thinking
is the story of Abraham Wald and the missing

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:40.409
bullet holes.

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:44.560
Hat tip here to mathematician Jordan Ellenberg
for highlighting the story.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:49.060
Let’s go to the News Desk.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.860
World War II: Manhattan.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.640
A group of statisticians and mathematicians
are hard at work trying to protect American

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.960
fighter pilots.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:01.640
Their task--trying to figure out how to best
armor planes without making them too heavy

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.050
so our heroes to outrun and outwit the enemy.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:09.630
In an effort to figure out how to best protect
our planes, the statisticians pour over data

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:14.330
of the planes that returned from fighting--looking
at where they took damage.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:15.990
Where the bullet holes were.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:20.770
That data showed there were more bullet holes
in the fuselage and fuel system and not as

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:22.450
many in the engines.

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:25.000
So how do we save our American heroes?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.520
The exceptional statistician Abraham Wald
studied the data and came back with the advice...that

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.930
surprised everyone to put the armor where
the bullet holes weren’t.

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:36.060
Over the engines.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:40.810
Wald realized the bullet holes should have
been more evenly distributed over the planes.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:45.730
If fewer planes were returning with holes
in the engines--that meant those planes weren’t

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.130
returning home.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:52.780
Wald has the exceptional realization the data
wasn’t a random sample of all planes.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.710
It only represented the planes that returned.

Thinking mathematically gives us something to go on other than our guts, and their trillions of bacteria.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.920
Thanks for watching. I'll see you again next time.
