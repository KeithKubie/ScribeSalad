00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.870
In summary, UML provides a rich vocabulary for modeling system structure.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.210
And the UML class model diagram exhibits many, many different features.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.310
However, there's no need for you to use all of its affordances. Particularly at

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.640
the start of the modeling process. Never the less, each affordance implies

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.140
a question to be answered. What is the multiplicity? Are these values ordered?

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.420
What's the qualifier? Does the system that you are modeling,

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.640
exhibit the property expressed by that affordance? One of the important

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.580
benefits of modeling, is that it encourages you to face these questions early,

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.360
in the development process. Because if you forget and they,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.120
they may later come back to haunt you.
