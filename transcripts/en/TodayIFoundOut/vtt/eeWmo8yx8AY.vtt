00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:21.790
One of the six simple machines, a screw is
nothing more than an inclined plane wrapped

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.420
around a center pole.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.310
While today screws come in standard sizes,
and typically are tightened by turning clockwise

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.640
(and loosened by turning counterclockwise),
this is a recent invention.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.620
A great example of how things that seem simple
can be really hard to do right, the development

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.860
of the predicable system we enjoy today took
2,000 years to invent.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.370
Archytas of Tarentum (428 BC – 350 BC),
a friend of Plato, is believed to have invented

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:56.039
the screw around 400 BC, while Archimedes
(287 BC – 212 BC) was one of the first to

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.489
realize the screw’s ability to fix things
together, as well as to lift water.

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.519
The Romans developed hand-cut screws and made
them with bronze and silver.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.620
Early on, screws of all sizes were used to
press olive oil, help irrigate canals and

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.880
drain bilges, and, of course, attach things
together.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.110
Nonetheless, since these early screws were
made by hand, threads were rarely precise

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.960
and varied according to the preference of
the craftsman.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.500
By the mid-16th century, Jaques Besson of
the French court had invented a lathe that

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.619
would cut a screw, although it took another
100 years for the process to take off.

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.990
The modern lathe was later created by the
Englishman Henry Maudsley in 1797, and with

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.729
it, screw threads could be cut with great
precision.

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.409
Despite this, there was no uniform system
for either screw sizes or threads.

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.360
This was remedied by Maudsley’s apprentice,
Joseph Whitworth (1803-1887), beginning in

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.550
1841 when he presented a paper advocating
for a uniform system of screw threads to the

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.289
Institute of Civil Engineers.

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:58.020
His two-pronged suggestion was simple: (1)
the angle of threads should be standardized

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.520
at 55 degrees; and (2) the number of threads
per inch should be standardized, although

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.030
they would vary depending on the diameter
of the screw.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.490
That the screw would turn to the right when
being tightened was likely already a well-established

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.450
principle and is thought to be because right-handed
people are stronger when they screw clockwise

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.620
(supinate), and the vast majority of people
are right-handed (between 70% – 90%).

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.010
(See: Why Some People are Right Handed And
Some Left Handed)

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.390
In any event, Whitworth’s idea was popular,
and soon after he suggested it, the British

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.890
Standard Whitworth, with its rounded roots
and pyramid thread crests, was adopted throughout

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.480
England, the United States and Canada by the
1860s.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.500
Nonetheless, it was not an easy screw to make
as it required “three kinds of cutters and

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.420
two kinds of lathe.”

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.080
To alleviate some of the problems with manufacturing
a British Standard Whitworth, American William

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.390
Sellers in 1864 invented a thread that had
flat roots and crests, a not insignificant

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.520
modification as this screw could be made with
“just one cutter and lathe.”

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.280
Faster, easier and cheaper, the Sellers screw
thread became popular in the United States

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.400
and soon became standard among America’s
railroads (two of which at this time were

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.400
working on the transcontinental route).

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.750
The British stuck with Whitworth’s slightly
fussier screw, although the different standards

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.600
posed few problems until World War II when
British, Canadian and American troops co-mingled

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.100
their equipment and repair parts.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.940
After the war, in 1949, Canada, the United
States and the United Kingdom agreed to the

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.610
Unified Thread Standard, based on the inch,
with a 60-degree profile.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.510
Shortly after, the UK adopted the metric system
and in 1960, its International System of Units

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.340
(SI), as well as its ISO metric screw thread,
also with a 60 degree profile.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.330
Globally, a right-turning metric screw is
the standard, although in the U.S., about

00:03:35.330 --> 00:04:02.700
60% of screw threads still follow the inch-based
Unified Screw Thread System.
