so an organization that's been around

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:06.850
so an organization that's been around
 

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:08.370
so an organization that's been around
for a while has to have core values it

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:08.380
for a while has to have core values it
 

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:09.600

doesn't want to change just for its own
 

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.180
doesn't want to change just for its own
sake but it has to be open to it so

sake but it has to be open to it so

those are some of the issues that
innovators have to face one of the

takes a lot of time and resources to do

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:08.450
takes a lot of time and resources to do
 

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:09.030
takes a lot of time and resources to do
it

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:09.040
it

sometimes the organization gets caught

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:11.810
sometimes the organization gets caught
 

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:13.780
sometimes the organization gets caught
in a political and symbolic battle

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:13.790
in a political and symbolic battle
 

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:17.050
in a political and symbolic battle
around its strategy and sometimes and

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:17.060
around its strategy and sometimes and
 

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:18.040
around its strategy and sometimes and
this is one of the more interesting

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:18.050
this is one of the more interesting
 

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.560
this is one of the more interesting
parts of a strategic planning by saying

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:20.570
parts of a strategic planning by saying
 

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:22.990
parts of a strategic planning by saying
what you're going to do you also say

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:23.000
what you're going to do you also say
 

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.970
what you're going to do you also say
what you're not going to do and that can

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:24.980
what you're not going to do and that can
 

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.620
what you're not going to do and that can
then generate political opposition

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:26.630
then generate political opposition
 

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:28.990
then generate political opposition
internal opposition from the people who

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:29.000
internal opposition from the people who
 

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.400
internal opposition from the people who
want to do the things you've decided not

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:30.410
want to do the things you've decided not
 

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.230
want to do the things you've decided not
to do because it means you set

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240
to do because it means you set
 

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.510
to do because it means you set
priorities okay the second one is

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:34.520
priorities okay the second one is
 

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.910
priorities okay the second one is
re-engineering and this is basically

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:36.920
re-engineering and this is basically
 

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.010
re-engineering and this is basically
starting over and saying we're going to

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:39.020
starting over and saying we're going to
 

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:43.600
starting over and saying we're going to
do this differently how do you do this

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:43.610
do this differently how do you do this
 

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:47.050
do this differently how do you do this
you identify the steps that add value

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:47.060
you identify the steps that add value
 

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.480
you identify the steps that add value
you eliminate the steps that don't add

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:49.490
you eliminate the steps that don't add
 

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:52.960
you eliminate the steps that don't add
value and you redesign work processes to

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:52.970
value and you redesign work processes to
 

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:55.630
value and you redesign work processes to
emphasize speed quick turnaround and so

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:55.640
emphasize speed quick turnaround and so
 

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.180
emphasize speed quick turnaround and so
forth that's reengineering it's not easy

00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:58.190
forth that's reengineering it's not easy
 

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:01.600
forth that's reengineering it's not easy
to do and very often you have entrenched

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:01.610
to do and very often you have entrenched
 

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:03.610
to do and very often you have entrenched
interest in an organization that will

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:03.620
interest in an organization that will
 

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.320
interest in an organization that will
fight it and then the other problem is

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:05.330
fight it and then the other problem is
 

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.150
fight it and then the other problem is
while you're re-engineering who's

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:07.160
while you're re-engineering who's
 

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.890
while you're re-engineering who's
dealing with the customers who's

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:08.900
dealing with the customers who's
 

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.900
dealing with the customers who's
collecting the money who's keeping the

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:10.910
collecting the money who's keeping the
 

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:13.000
collecting the money who's keeping the
organization alive that's why this is a

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:13.010
organization alive that's why this is a
 

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:17.040
organization alive that's why this is a
high-risk strategy in the private sector

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:17.050
high-risk strategy in the private sector
 

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.570
high-risk strategy in the private sector
you've seen instance of this often

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:19.580
you've seen instance of this often
 

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.940
you've seen instance of this often
accompanied before or after a lot of

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:21.950
accompanied before or after a lot of
 

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:25.570
accompanied before or after a lot of
layoffs in the public sector it's often

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:25.580
layoffs in the public sector it's often
 

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.040
layoffs in the public sector it's often
a reorganization we create a new

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:27.050
a reorganization we create a new
 

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:30.130
a reorganization we create a new
organization so in New York City the

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:30.140
organization so in New York City the
 

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.660

human resources administration used to
 

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.880
human resources administration used to
deal with the foster care program which

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:33.890
deal with the foster care program which
 

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.860
deal with the foster care program which
is when children are taken away from

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:35.870
is when children are taken away from
 

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.590
is when children are taken away from
their parents because they're abusive or

their parents because they're abusive or
 

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.360
their parents because they're abusive or
their parents die and they have to find

their parents die and they have to find
 

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:42.640
their parents die and they have to find
another set of parents for them that's

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:42.650
another set of parents for them that's
 

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:43.990
another set of parents for them that's
foster care okay

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.000
foster care okay
 

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.720
foster care okay
used to be done by HRA now it's done by

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:43.690
time
 

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:46.139
time
what I'd say is that what you're trying

00:26:46.139 --> 00:26:46.149
what I'd say is that what you're trying
 

00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:49.289
what I'd say is that what you're trying
to do in benchmarking is look at the

00:26:49.289 --> 00:26:49.299
to do in benchmarking is look at the
 

00:26:49.299 --> 00:26:51.389
to do in benchmarking is look at the
best people in the world the people with

00:26:51.389 --> 00:26:51.399
best people in the world the people with
 

00:26:51.399 --> 00:26:53.789
best people in the world the people with
the best reputation get them to let you

00:26:53.789 --> 00:26:53.799
the best reputation get them to let you
 

00:26:53.799 --> 00:26:55.409
the best reputation get them to let you
look at how they're doing it and try to

00:26:55.409 --> 00:26:55.419
look at how they're doing it and try to
 

00:26:55.419 --> 00:26:57.330
look at how they're doing it and try to
copy them okay

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:57.340
copy them okay
 

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:59.850
copy them okay
the benefit of this is it keeps you open

00:26:59.850 --> 00:26:59.860
the benefit of this is it keeps you open
 

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:01.649
the benefit of this is it keeps you open
to other models you look at how other

00:27:01.649 --> 00:27:01.659
to other models you look at how other
 

00:27:01.659 --> 00:27:04.379
to other models you look at how other
places are doing things so I look at

00:27:04.379 --> 00:27:04.389
places are doing things so I look at
 

00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:05.850
places are doing things so I look at
when I'm very interested in waste

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:05.860
when I'm very interested in waste
 

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:07.350
when I'm very interested in waste
management so I look at other countries

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360
management so I look at other countries
 

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.580
management so I look at other countries
and how they do it because they're

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:08.590
and how they do it because they're
 

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:11.460
and how they do it because they're
better than the United States is I I was

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:11.470
better than the United States is I I was
 

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:12.749
better than the United States is I I was
at a dinner the other night where where

I learned that in Paris they collect the

00:27:14.249 --> 00:27:14.259
I learned that in Paris they collect the
 

00:27:14.259 --> 00:27:16.259
I learned that in Paris they collect the
garbage every day okay

00:27:16.259 --> 00:27:16.269
garbage every day okay
 

00:27:16.269 --> 00:27:18.919
garbage every day okay
pretty interesting in New York we don't

00:27:18.919 --> 00:27:18.929
pretty interesting in New York we don't
 

00:27:18.929 --> 00:27:20.820
pretty interesting in New York we don't
okay we'll have to leave something for

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:20.830
okay we'll have to leave something for
 

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:25.019
okay we'll have to leave something for
the rats now benchmarking is a very

00:27:25.019 --> 00:27:25.029
the rats now benchmarking is a very
 

00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:27.450
the rats now benchmarking is a very
low-tech low-cost technique and it

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:27.460
low-tech low-cost technique and it
 

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:32.100
low-tech low-cost technique and it
doesn't disrupt organizations okay on

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:32.110
doesn't disrupt organizations okay on
 

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:34.200
