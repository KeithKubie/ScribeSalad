00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.060
As more mass shootings grow into a daily occurrence
in the US, it seems we can’t turn to lawmakers

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:14.810
for solutions, but can we turn 
to science?

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:15.810
Science can tell us a lot.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.600
About the world around us, the universe beyond,
even what’s going on in the cells in our

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.600
finger tips.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.680
But it can’t tell us a whole lot about gun
violence.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.170
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) and the National Institute of Health

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.200
(NIH) have been banned from getting any kind
of federal funding for firearm related studies

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.960
for the last 20 years.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.780
In 1996, Former Republican Congressman Jay
Dickey of Arkansas pushed for an amendment

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.800
on a funding bill that forbid the use of federal
funds on studies that “promote gun control.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.670
A move he’s come to later regret, he even
told NPR that he wants “science and science

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.579
investigation and examination to take the
place of politics”.

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.899
He originally meant for the bill to stop “the
collection of data to go to gun control advocacy”

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.479
But the vague language put the brakes on any
further research.

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.470
Scientists just became too scared that they
would lose their funding if they studied gun

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.899
violence, and rightfully so.

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.680
Congress retroactively punished the CDC for
carrying out gun research the previous year.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.869
In 1995, the CDC spent 2.6 million dollars
on gun violence research.

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.070
At first some members of congress wanted to
strip all the funding for the entire CDC’s

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.200
injury control center, a total of over 40
million dollars.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.020
But they compromised for taking just the same
amount that had been spent on gun violence

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.799
the previous year, 2.6 million.

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.110
With such large sums at risk, scientists were
scared to study it and “Sponsors were spooked

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.270
to fund stuff that had to do with guns”
according to one researcher from Duke University.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.340
So it’s no wonder we know so little.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.340
I mean over the past four decades, NIH has
funded just three studies on gun violence.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.690
Check out a comparison of NIH studies.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.039
They have studied disease like rabies, cholera,
and polio.

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:54.390
Take rabies for example.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.429
It killed just 63 people globally from the
years 1973 to 2012.

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.369
The NIH completed 89 studies on it.

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.479
In comparison, over the same time period gun
violence killed over 4 million people, yet

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.130
the NIH completed just 3 studies on the subject.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.620
You might be saying, "But guns aren’t diseases!"

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.730
But the fact is, research organizations like
the CDC and the NIH study other things potentially

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.530
harmful to human health besides diseases,
like deaths by drowning or car accidents.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.790
And even if they study these things, they
aren’t suggesting we ban pools or cars,

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.520
they are just interested in making them SAFER.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.360
And in 2013, President Obama agreed.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.670
After the wake of the horrific Newtown Elementary
School Shooting, he gave an executive order

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.520
that the CDC and the NIH return to researching
gun violence.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.590
But unfortunately, not much has changed.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.510
Congress still blocks funding on firearms
when they can and researchers are still left

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.480
quaking in their sensible shoes.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.480
CDC spokeswoman Courtney Lenard told the Washington
Post that “It is possible for us to conduct

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.670
firearm-related research...but our resources
are very limited.”

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.110
So what do researchers know about gun violence?

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.790
Well according to the CDC we know that around
33,600 people die every year from firearms

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.480
across all categories.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.240
That’s about the same number as those who
die from car accidents.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.680
And from the few studies available, like one
published in the New England Journal of Medicine,

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.860
found that having a gun in the home is linked
with an increase in the risk of homicide in

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:21.860
the home.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.310
Other risk factors include substance abuse
and a history of violence.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.720
And another study from the Journal of Epidemiology
found that having a gun in the home increases

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.170
the risk of suicide for adult men.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.340
But there are so many basic questions we have
yet to answer.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.470
For starters, no one knows how many guns are
out there in the US.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.300
There’s no national registry.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.300
We don’t know why people want to own a gun
or even what percentage of gun owners go on

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.010
to commit a crime with their firearm.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.040
Basic things that science needs to answer.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.030
Like Richard Berk, a criminology professor
at the University of Pennsylvania said in

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.910
a letter to Joe Biden, “I see no upside
to ignorance”.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.360
So I guess more research is needed.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.440
I know I know, you’re probably sick of hearing
about gun violence and mass shootings.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.800
But these events are just as horrific even
the 300th time around.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.070
So why have we stopped caring about mass shootings?

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.770
Have we become desensitized?

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:37.319
Trace has the answer in this video, right
here.
