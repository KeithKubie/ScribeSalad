00:00:00.171 --> 00:00:02.982
- In earlier mathematics
that you may have done,

00:00:02.982 --> 00:00:05.789
you probably got familiar
with the idea of a factor.

00:00:05.789 --> 00:00:06.926
So for example, let me just pick

00:00:06.926 --> 00:00:09.382
an arbitrary number, the number 12.

00:00:09.382 --> 00:00:14.382
We could say that the
number 12 is the product of

00:00:14.552 --> 00:00:18.730
say two and six; two
times six is equal to 12.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:19.958
So because if you take the product of

00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.517
two and six, you get 12, we could say

00:00:21.517 --> 00:00:23.837
that two is a factor of
12, we could also say

00:00:23.837 --> 00:00:25.151
that six is a factor of 12.

00:00:25.151 --> 00:00:27.752
You take the product of
these things and you get 12!

00:00:27.752 --> 00:00:32.236
You could even say that
this is 12 in factored form.

00:00:32.236 --> 00:00:33.683
People don't really talk that way

00:00:33.683 --> 00:00:35.815
but you could think of it that way.

00:00:35.815 --> 00:00:39.417
We broke 12 into the things
that we could use to multiply.

00:00:39.417 --> 00:00:41.283
And you probably remember
from earlier mathematics

00:00:41.283 --> 00:00:43.040
the notion of prime factorization,

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.042
where you break it up into
all of the prime factors.

00:00:45.042 --> 00:00:46.492
So in that case you could break the six

00:00:46.492 --> 00:00:48.294
into a two and a three, and you have

00:00:48.294 --> 00:00:53.294
two times two times three is equal to 12.

00:00:53.697 --> 00:00:55.625
And you'd say, "Well, this would be 12

00:00:55.625 --> 00:01:00.175
"in prime factored form or the
prime factorization of 12,"

00:01:00.175 --> 00:01:04.300
so these are the prime factors.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.095
And so the general idea,
this notion of a factor

00:01:08.095 --> 00:01:10.798
is things that you can multiply together

00:01:10.798 --> 00:01:12.748
to get your original thing.

00:01:12.762 --> 00:01:14.852
Or if you're talking about factored form,

00:01:14.852 --> 00:01:17.275
you're essentially taking the
number and you're breaking

00:01:17.275 --> 00:01:19.029
it up into the things
that when you multiply

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:21.697
them together, you get
your original number.

00:01:21.697 --> 00:01:23.076
What we're going to do now is extend

00:01:23.076 --> 00:01:25.743
this idea into the algebraic domain.

00:01:25.743 --> 00:01:29.196
So if we start with an expression,

00:01:29.196 --> 00:01:31.527
let's say the expression is

00:01:31.527 --> 00:01:35.552
two plus four X,

00:01:35.552 --> 00:01:38.362
can we break this up into the product

00:01:38.362 --> 00:01:41.499
of two either numbers or two expressions

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:44.579
or the product of a
number and an expression?

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.183
Well, one thing that might jump out at you

00:01:47.183 --> 00:01:50.486
is we can write this as

00:01:50.486 --> 00:01:55.265
two times one plus two X.

00:01:55.265 --> 00:01:57.094
And you can verify if you like

00:01:57.094 --> 00:02:00.126
that this does indeed
equal two plus four X.

00:02:00.126 --> 00:02:02.588
We're just going to distribute the two.

00:02:02.588 --> 00:02:07.422
Two times one is two, two times two X

00:02:07.422 --> 00:02:11.820
is equal to four X, so plus four X.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.992
So in our algebra brains, this will often

00:02:15.992 --> 00:02:18.487
be reviewed as or referred to as

00:02:18.487 --> 00:02:22.644
this expression factored
or in a factored form.

00:02:22.644 --> 00:02:23.935
Sometimes people would say that

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:26.893
we have factored out the two.

00:02:26.893 --> 00:02:28.305
You could just as easily say that

00:02:28.305 --> 00:02:30.372
you have factored out a one plus two X.

00:02:30.372 --> 00:02:35.266
You have broken this thing
up into two of its factors.

00:02:35.266 --> 00:02:37.194
So let's do a couple of examples

00:02:37.194 --> 00:02:38.882
of this and then we'll
think about, you know,

00:02:38.882 --> 00:02:40.787
I just told you that we
could write it this way

00:02:40.787 --> 00:02:42.730
but how do you actually figure that out?

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.731
So let's do another one.

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:47.147
Let's say that you had, I don't know,

00:02:47.147 --> 00:02:51.832
let's say you had, six, let
me just in a different color,

00:02:51.847 --> 00:02:56.127
let's say you had six X

00:02:56.127 --> 00:03:01.127
six X plus three,

00:03:01.396 --> 00:03:03.204
no, let's write it

00:03:03.204 --> 00:03:06.484
six X plus 30, that's interesting.

00:03:06.484 --> 00:03:08.549
So one way to think about it is

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.186
can we break up each of these terms

00:03:11.186 --> 00:03:13.809
so that they have a common factor?

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:17.353
Well, this one over here,
six X literally represents

00:03:17.353 --> 00:03:22.126
six times X, and then 30,
if I want to break out

00:03:22.126 --> 00:03:24.346
a six, 30 is divisible
by six, so I could write

00:03:24.346 --> 00:03:27.549
this as six times five,

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.017
30 is the same thing as six times five.

00:03:30.017 --> 00:03:31.330
And when you write it this way,

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.237
you see, "Hey, I can factor out a six!"

00:03:34.237 --> 00:03:35.703
Essentially, this is the reverse

00:03:35.703 --> 00:03:37.657
of the distributive property!

00:03:37.657 --> 00:03:40.521
So I'm essentially undoing
the distributive property,

00:03:40.521 --> 00:03:43.699
taking out the six, and you
are going to end up with,

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:48.699
so if you take out the six,
you end up with six times,

00:03:49.823 --> 00:03:51.316
so if you take out the six here,

00:03:51.316 --> 00:03:52.805
you have an X, and you take out

00:03:52.805 --> 00:03:55.239
the six here, you have plus five.

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.628
So six X plus 30, if you factor it,

00:03:57.628 --> 00:04:00.815
we could write it as
six times X plus five.

00:04:00.815 --> 00:04:02.985
And you can verify with
the distributive property.

00:04:02.985 --> 00:04:05.491
If you distribute this six, you get

00:04:05.491 --> 00:04:09.005
six X + five times six or six X + 30.

00:04:09.005 --> 00:04:09.927
Let's do something that's a little bit

00:04:09.927 --> 00:04:11.419
more interesting where we might

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:13.770
want to factor out a fraction.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.290
So let's say we had the situation ...

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.652
Let me get a new color here.

00:04:18.652 --> 00:04:20.404
So let's say we had

00:04:20.404 --> 00:04:25.187
1/2 minus 3/2,

00:04:25.187 --> 00:04:27.293
minus 3/2 X.

00:04:27.293 --> 00:04:29.541
How could we write this in a, I guess

00:04:29.541 --> 00:04:31.245
you could say, in a factored form,

00:04:31.245 --> 00:04:33.573
or if we wanted to factor out something?

00:04:33.573 --> 00:04:34.913
I encourage you to pause the video

00:04:34.913 --> 00:04:37.324
and try to figure it out,
and I'll give you a hint.

00:04:37.324 --> 00:04:39.730
See if you can factor out 1/2.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.559
Let's write it that way.

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:42.845
If we're trying to factor out 1/2,

00:04:42.845 --> 00:04:44.816
we can write this first term as

00:04:44.816 --> 00:04:47.851
1/2 times one and this second one

00:04:47.851 --> 00:04:52.851
we could write as minus 1/2 times three X.

00:04:53.578 --> 00:04:55.956
That's what this is,
3/2 X is the same thing

00:04:55.956 --> 00:04:59.360
as three X divided by
two or 1/2 times three X.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.345
And then here we can see
that we can just factor

00:05:01.345 --> 00:05:03.520
out the 1/2 and you're going to get

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.233
1/2 times one minus three X.

00:05:08.233 --> 00:05:10.560
Another way you could
have thought about it is,

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.017
"Hey, look, both of these are products

00:05:13.017 --> 00:05:15.376
"involving 1/2," and
that's a little bit more

00:05:15.376 --> 00:05:18.428
confusing when you're
dealing with a fraction here.

00:05:18.428 --> 00:05:20.119
But one way to think about it is,

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:23.252
I can divide out a 1/2
from each of these terms.

00:05:23.252 --> 00:05:25.787
So if I divide out a 1/2 from this,

00:05:25.787 --> 00:05:28.253
1/2 divided by 1/2 is one.

00:05:28.253 --> 00:05:31.267
And if I take 3/2 and divide it by 1/2,

00:05:31.267 --> 00:05:33.751
that's going to be
three, and so I took out

00:05:33.751 --> 00:05:35.798
a 1/2, that's another
way to think about it.

00:05:35.798 --> 00:05:37.287
I don't know if that confuses you more

00:05:37.287 --> 00:05:38.893
or it confuses you less, but hopefully

00:05:38.893 --> 00:05:42.808
this gives you the sense of
what factoring an expression is.

00:05:42.808 --> 00:05:44.911
I'll do another example,
where we're even using

00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:49.911
more abstract things, so
I could say, "AX plus AY."

00:05:50.705 --> 00:05:52.929
How could we write this in factored form?

00:05:52.929 --> 00:05:55.309
Well, both of these terms have products

00:05:55.309 --> 00:06:00.309
of A in it, so I could write
this as A times X plus Y.

00:06:00.554 --> 00:06:02.625
And sometimes you'll hear people say,

00:06:02.625 --> 00:06:04.981
"You have factored out the A,"

00:06:04.981 --> 00:06:07.532
and you can verify it if
you multiply this out again.

00:06:07.532 --> 00:06:11.903
If you distribute the A,
you'd be left with AX plus AY.
