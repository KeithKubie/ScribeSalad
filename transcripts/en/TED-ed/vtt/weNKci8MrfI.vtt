00:00:14.834 --> 00:00:15.985
About 100 days ago,

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.303
we landed a two-ton SUV
on the surface of another planet,

00:00:19.327 --> 00:00:20.770
on the surface of Mars.

00:00:20.794 --> 00:00:23.849
This is one of the first pictures
we took there with our rover,

00:00:23.873 --> 00:00:25.177
looking out at Mount Sharp.

00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:27.255
I kind of cry a little bit,

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.009
choke up, when I see this picture.

00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:31.644
Why Mars and why do we look
at these other planets?

00:00:31.668 --> 00:00:33.986
Part of it is to understand
our own planet --

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.259
what's the context for us?

00:00:35.283 --> 00:00:38.155
We live on this amazing planet,
but Mars is a lot like Earth.

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:39.336
It's similar in size.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.590
During the daytime, it can
get up to 70 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:00:43.614 --> 00:00:46.107
So, it's so like Earth,
but at the same time,

00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:47.492
this is a barren landscape.

00:00:47.516 --> 00:00:50.363
You don't see any trees,
you don't see any cactuses growing,

00:00:50.387 --> 00:00:51.546
anything like that.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.602
Today I'm going to tell you
about how we got from Earth to Mars

00:00:54.626 --> 00:00:55.927
and why it's so cool.

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:59.483
So one of the things we start with
is a blank sheet of paper.

00:00:59.507 --> 00:01:02.674
We knew from the previous missions
in 2004, Spirit and Opportunity,

00:01:02.698 --> 00:01:04.461
there was water on Mars in the past.

00:01:04.485 --> 00:01:06.071
But what's the next step?

00:01:06.095 --> 00:01:08.658
We're looking for an even more
fundamental level of,

00:01:08.682 --> 00:01:11.048
what does it take to have life survive?

00:01:11.072 --> 00:01:13.818
And so, to have that kind
of knowledge and understanding,

00:01:13.842 --> 00:01:16.294
we have to carry
a mass amount of instruments.

00:01:16.318 --> 00:01:17.914
We have to carry the kind of labs

00:01:17.938 --> 00:01:20.247
that people have whole rooms
devoted to on Earth

00:01:20.271 --> 00:01:22.147
inside of, essentially, a small car.

00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:23.893
And we shrunk it all down

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:26.138
to something that weighs
about as much as I do,

00:01:26.162 --> 00:01:30.054
and then put it inside of this rover
that weighs as much as your car does.

00:01:30.078 --> 00:01:32.872
And that rover is now
on the surface of Mars,

00:01:32.896 --> 00:01:34.702
but it's so heavy,

00:01:34.726 --> 00:01:37.813
and so it kind of takes
a special challenge for us

00:01:37.837 --> 00:01:39.876
to make it all work and come together.

00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:44.090
So we look at our tool of,
what do we have to land stuff on Mars?

00:01:44.114 --> 00:01:45.756
And one of the options is airbags.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.932
We've done it before.

00:01:46.956 --> 00:01:49.319
Airbags are pretty cool,
they bounce around a lot.

00:01:49.343 --> 00:01:51.614
You could never put a human
inside of an airbag,

00:01:51.638 --> 00:01:53.479
because they would get squashed.

00:01:53.503 --> 00:01:56.233
But the problem with airbags is,
the airbags you see here,

00:01:56.257 --> 00:01:59.804
which landed the smaller rover --
it's like 400 pounds, the entire rover --

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:01.628
were about the size of this room.

00:02:01.652 --> 00:02:04.087
So you can imagine the size
of airbags it would take

00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:05.638
to land a two-ton rover on Mars.

00:02:05.662 --> 00:02:07.678
And they'd have to be made
out of materials

00:02:07.702 --> 00:02:09.052
that don't even exist today,

00:02:09.076 --> 00:02:12.215
so it'd be some kind of exotic material
that we'd have to develop

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.594
and it may or may not work.

00:02:13.618 --> 00:02:14.872
So, what about rockets?

00:02:15.363 --> 00:02:18.662
You know, you see all the rocket ships
landing in old movies,

00:02:18.686 --> 00:02:21.567
all rockets on the bottom --
it's a cool idea.

00:02:21.591 --> 00:02:23.584
It works when they're pretty light still,

00:02:23.608 --> 00:02:26.333
but the problem is, these rockets
have to be pretty strong

00:02:26.357 --> 00:02:28.096
to actually softly land you on Mars.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.572
And so they would be so powerful
they could dig holes into the ground

00:02:31.596 --> 00:02:33.850
and then you would just
end up inside of a hole

00:02:33.874 --> 00:02:35.552
and not be able to drive out of it.

00:02:35.576 --> 00:02:37.108
So, not the best design.

00:02:37.893 --> 00:02:41.106
But what if I could take the rockets
and move them up?

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.676
And that's what we came up with.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.387
It's a rocket-powered jet pack;
we call it the Sky Crane.

00:02:45.411 --> 00:02:48.315
Basically, this big rocket
sits on top of our rover

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:50.983
and when we're ready to land,
the rocket hovers in place

00:02:51.007 --> 00:02:53.268
and we slowly lower
the rover to the ground.

00:02:53.727 --> 00:02:56.224
And then we touch down,
we're actually on the wheels,

00:02:56.248 --> 00:02:57.893
we're ready to drive, day one.

00:02:59.615 --> 00:03:02.333
But in addition to that,
the scientists were like,

00:03:02.357 --> 00:03:04.560
"We actually want to go
somewhere interesting."

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:06.116
The last two missions were cool,

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.682
but they basically landed in what was like
landing in the plains or desert.

00:03:09.706 --> 00:03:10.857
Not very exciting.

00:03:10.881 --> 00:03:14.096
We all know from the exciting places
on Earth like the Grand Canyon,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.619
those are, for the scientists,
the most interesting,

00:03:16.643 --> 00:03:18.226
because you see that whole layer,

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.714
you see years and years
of history all in one place.

00:03:20.738 --> 00:03:22.753
The same thing is true
for where we landed.

00:03:22.777 --> 00:03:25.151
We wanted to land somewhere
that was unique,

00:03:25.175 --> 00:03:28.088
that had this crater wall
where things had been dug up for us,

00:03:28.112 --> 00:03:29.977
where mountains were pushing things up.

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:32.700
But the problem is, if you landed
with the older systems,

00:03:32.724 --> 00:03:36.077
you could've landed on the side
of that mountain and just tumbled off,

00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:39.428
could've been the side of a cliff,
the crater wall or a large boulder.

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:41.034
So we needed a kind of technology

00:03:41.058 --> 00:03:43.335
to help us land in a very small area,

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.321
and that was this little
guided entry from Apollo.

00:03:46.345 --> 00:03:47.783
We took it from the 1960s.

00:03:47.807 --> 00:03:51.246
We flew over like the manned vehicle,
because they have to pick up men,

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.223
you can't just land all over the place.

00:03:53.247 --> 00:03:55.705
And then we landed, like,
spot-on in the middle.

00:03:55.729 --> 00:04:00.039
And in fact, it was so spot-on
that when we did it,

00:04:00.063 --> 00:04:05.206
it was basically like a quarterback
launching towards Mars --

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.595
like a quarterback, though,
that was in Seattle,

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:10.537
throwing at a receiver that was moving
here in Giants Stadium.

00:04:10.561 --> 00:04:12.687
That's how accurate we were.
Kind of awesome.

00:04:13.004 --> 00:04:14.260
But you only get one shot,

00:04:14.284 --> 00:04:16.394
and so we actually have to design a system

00:04:16.418 --> 00:04:19.013
that we can build and test and operate,

00:04:19.037 --> 00:04:21.783
and so it's not just about
can we get it to Mars,

00:04:21.807 --> 00:04:23.191
but, if it's only one chance,

00:04:23.215 --> 00:04:25.530
how do you make sure
that one chance goes well?

00:04:25.554 --> 00:04:28.856
So there's all these processes
to make sure things are built properly.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.619
Then we go out to the desert
and drive around and test it.

00:04:31.643 --> 00:04:35.176
We fly things in F-18s to make sure
the radar systems work in high speeds.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.095
Then, most importantly, we test the team
to make sure they know how to operate it.

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:41.866
We don't want to miss it
because we sent the wrong command

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.975
and now it's going
to be rebooting forever.

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:46.391
So, that guy Fred there,
he did a lot of that.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.301
And then we launched it
on this rocket to Mars.

00:04:50.989 --> 00:04:52.489
We landed 2,000 pounds on Mars,

00:04:52.513 --> 00:04:54.585
but the entire thing
was about 10,000 pounds

00:04:54.609 --> 00:04:56.048
when we lifted off from Earth,

00:04:56.072 --> 00:04:59.341
all the fuel and the solar arrays
and everything else that we needed.

00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:00.852
And, again, we were so accurate

00:05:00.876 --> 00:05:03.636
that we landed in this, like,
little pin-point on Mars.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.017
In the meantime, though, we had to design
a landing system that worked.

00:05:07.041 --> 00:05:10.267
And I told you about the actual physics
of it, but here's the catch:

00:05:10.291 --> 00:05:13.361
Mars is about 14 minutes
away from Earth in light speed,

00:05:13.385 --> 00:05:15.865
which means if I try
to control it with a joystick,

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.494
I would be always controlling
to 14 minutes in advance,

00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:19.669
so it wouldn't work.

00:05:19.693 --> 00:05:23.435
So we had to give it all the smarts
and knowledge it needed to make it happen.

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:26.294
So we built in all these
smarts and algorithms

00:05:26.318 --> 00:05:28.812
and told it here's what
you're going to have to do,

00:05:28.836 --> 00:05:32.900
and it goes from basically
five times the speed of a speeding bullet

00:05:32.924 --> 00:05:34.101
to about a baby's crawl,

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:35.615
all within about seven minutes,

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:37.786
which are called
the seven minutes of terror,

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.347
because I was about to throw up.

00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:40.524
(Laughter)

00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:44.403
But today we're on the surface of Mars,
and this was one of the panoramas we took

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:45.859
a couple days after we landed,

00:05:45.883 --> 00:05:48.189
and it's amazing to me,
because you look at this,

00:05:48.213 --> 00:05:49.612
and can see the Grand Canyon,

00:05:49.636 --> 00:05:52.876
you can see your own planet,
you can imagine walking on the surface.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.152
And so what we're going to do
and continue to do

00:05:55.176 --> 00:05:57.861
is to understand
what makes Mars so special

00:05:57.885 --> 00:05:59.712
and what makes Earth even more special

00:05:59.736 --> 00:06:01.411
that we're all here together today.

00:06:01.435 --> 00:06:03.344
So we'll see where Curiosity takes us --

00:06:03.368 --> 00:06:04.520
not just our rover,

00:06:04.544 --> 00:06:06.060
but our sense of exploration.

00:06:06.084 --> 00:06:07.235
Thank you.

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:09.687
(Applause)
