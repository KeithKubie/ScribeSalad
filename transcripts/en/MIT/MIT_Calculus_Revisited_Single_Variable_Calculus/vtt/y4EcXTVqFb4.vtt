00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.040
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.340
Our lecture today actually has
us backtrack a little bit to a

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.110
concept which is actually more
fundamental than that of

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.590
differentiability.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.060
It's a topic which is called
'continuous functions'.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.320
In other words, our lecture
today is concerned with a

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.440
topic called Continuity.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.730
And actually, the topic of
continuity had its roots way

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.150
back at the beginning of our
course when we first raised

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.970
the question: does the limit of
'f of x' as 'x' approaches

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.950
'a' equal 'f of a'?

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.990
Remember, when we first started
talking about the

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.120
limit concept, our intuitive
approach was to say, look-it,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.440
as 'x' gets arbitrarily close
to 'a', 'f of x' gets

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.550
arbitrarily close to 'f of a'.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.610
And we saw that this particular
definition had a

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.850
few loopholes in it, even though
intuitively this is

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.380
what we would have liked.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.110
And so what I want to do today
is to see what happens if we

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.580
can be sure that the limit of 'f
of x' as 'x' approaches 'a'

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.420
equals 'f of a'.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.500
What is implied if this happens

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.490
to be a true statement?

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.930
And my first claim is that it is
implicitly implied that 'f

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.980
of a' must at least
make sense.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.720
Otherwise, we wouldn't have
written it over here.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.650
In other words, 'f' must be
defined when 'x' equals 'a'.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.910
'f of a' must be defined.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.050
Now to correlate that with
material that we've had

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.660
previously, let's go back
to an example that we've

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.570
discussed before, or at least
an example which is close to

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.830
something we've studied
before.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.320
Let's define 'f of x' to be 'x
squared minus 1' over 'x - 1'.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.410
Now you see as long as 'x' is
not equal to 1, we can cancel

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.260
'x - 1' from both numerator and
denominator, leaving this

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.040
equal to 'x + 1'.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.050
And we then see what?

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.390
That the limit of 'f of
x' as 'x' approaches

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.270
1 is equal to 2.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.930
On the other hand, notice that
'f of 1' turns out to be 0/0

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.180
in this case, which
is undefined.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.260
In other words, in this
particular case, the limit of

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.930
'f of x' as 'x' approaches 1
is not equal to 'f of 1' if

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.340
only because 'f of 1'
isn't even defined.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.480
And again, by way of a review,
let's look at this thing

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.790
pictorially.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.800
Remember, 'x squared minus 1'
over 'x - 1' is 'x + 1' except

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.800
when 'x' equals 1.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.310
Consequently, to graph 'y'
equals 'x squared minus 1'

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.750
over 'x - 1', we simply graph
'y' equals 'x + 1' with the

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.190
point corresponding to 'x'
equals 1, meaning the point 1

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.210
comma 2 deleted.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.930
In other words, this point
deleted is the graph 'y'

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.690
equals 'x squared minus
1' over 'x - 1'.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.030
You see again there is no
definition at 'x' equals 1

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.300
because this point is missing.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.850
It would be the 0/0 form.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.880
Now, to be sure, we can clean
this up in the sense that we

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.130
could define a new function 'g
of x' to be 'x squared minus

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.250
1' over 'x - 1' as long as 'x'
is not equal to 1 and define

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.620
it to be 2 when 'x' equals
1, which, by the way,

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.480
geometrically is just a fancy
way of writing the equation of

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.930
the line 'y' equals 'x + 1'.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.520
In other words, all we're saying
is that letting 'g of

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.760
x' be 2 when 'x' equals 1 plugs
the little hole to the

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.960
periods over here.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.270
Now again, I hope that this
seems fairly familiar from our

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.540
discussion on limits, but for
the time being, all I want us

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.100
to see is that as soon as you
write down that the limit of

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.700
'f of x' as 'x' approaches 'a'
equals 'f of a', you at least

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.920
imply that 'f of a'
must be defined.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.850
Let's see another property
that's implied by our

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.370
definition.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.820
I claim, as you might expect,
that if the limit of 'f of x'

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.170
as 'x' approaches 'a' is 'f of
a', that means that 'f of x'

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.290
is near 'f of a' when
'x' is near 'a'.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.700
In other words, my claim is that
the curve 'y' equals 'f

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.820
of x' is unbroken in
a neighborhood

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.350
of 'x' equals 'a'.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.280
And to see what I mean by
that, let's look at this

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.340
picture over here.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.990
Suppose, for example, that our
curve 'y' equals 'f of x'--

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.090
let me darken this up so that we
can see it a little better.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.340
Suppose that curve had a break
at 'x' equals 'a', OK?

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.790
Now, let's say 'f of
a' is over here.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.440
What I could do is now pick an
interval surrounding 'f of a',

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.190
if there was a break over here,
such that this band

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.090
never touched or included
the top curve here.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.630
Now notice, from this point of
view, that no matter how close

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.860
'x' gets to 'a', as long as 'x'
is greater than 'a', 'f of

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.240
x', which is up here on this
dark curve, can never be

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.870
within epsilon of 'f of a'.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.610
In other words, if there's a
break in the curve I could

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.340
always fix it up so that the
limit of 'f of x' as 'x'

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.260
approaches 'a' is not
equal to 'f of a'.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.910
At any rate, with these two
properties as motivation, let

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.210
us now give our basic
definition.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.880
And the basic definition is
simply this: a function 'f' is

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.810
called continuous that 'x'
equals 'a' precisely if the

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.800
property that we were discussing
is present, namely,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.170
if the limit of 'f of x' as
'x' approaches 'a' is

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.050
equal to 'f of a'.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.910
We generalize this definition
and say 'f' is called

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:15.640
continuous on the entire
interval 'I', or on the

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.530
interval 'I', if the limit of 'f
of x' as 'x' approaches 'a'

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.940
is equal to 'f of a' for
each 'a' in 'I'.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.030
In other words, notice that
our first definition is a

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.030
local property.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.360
Namely, we define continuous or

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.090
continuity at a given value.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.940
And then if the function happens
to be continuous at

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.110
every point, then we call the
function itself continuous.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.700
What the thing means pictorially
is that if the

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.300
function is continuous at 'x'
equals 'a', it means that in

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.100
terms of the graph of the
function, that in a

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.480
neighborhood of the point 'a'
comma 'f' of a on the graph,

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.720
in a neighborhood of that point,
in other words, in a

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.230
sufficiently small interval
surrounding that point, the

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.870
curve itself must be unbroken.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.510
Now, you see, this may
sound trivial.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.220
Remember, when we first started
talking about limits,

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.960
we had the feeling that limit of
'f of x' as 'x' approaches

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.470
a should always equal
'f of a'.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:21.130
And the reason for this was that
instinctively we seem to

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.260
always think of continuous
functions.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.840
We think of what?

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.070
Things changing in such a way
the graph of the change is

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:32.280
unbroken even though, of course,
there are places where

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.660
discontinuities occur.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.335
At any rate, what I'm saying
is that many of the results

00:07:37.335 --> 00:07:39.920
that I now want to discuss
with you, which are very

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.940
important properties of
continuous functions, may seem

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.500
self-evident because we keep
thinking about any function as

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.600
being continuous.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.410
But I will try to emphasize the
fact that these properties

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.670
are not true if the function
is not continuous.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:58.260
I also would like to show a
balance between geometric

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.500
ideas and analytic ideas.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.630
In other words, let me start off
by seeing what things seem

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:07.770
to follow about continuous
functions based primarily on

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:09.550
the graph idea.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:13.340
For example, I claimed that
continuous functions assume

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.990
their maximum and minimum values
on any closed interval.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:20.880
Now, this sounds like a big
mouthful, and it also sounds

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.650
kind of trivial.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:24.350
You say doesn't any function
have a maximum and minimum

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.440
value on a closed interval?

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.360
And the answer is no.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.500
For example, take the
curve 'y' equals '1

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.630
over ''x - 1' squared''.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:36.700
Notice that when 'x' is 1, 'y'
is infinite, which means that

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.039
if we graph this particular
function, we find that the

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.090
graph does something
like this.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:43.770
In other words, it goes--

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:47.100
it jumps up here, comes
back, et cetera.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:52.400
Now, what is the highest value
or what is the highest point

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.510
on our graph here?

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.070
Well, notice that the graph
is broken here.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.390
It's discontinuous when
'x' equals 1.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:01.060
Notice that the curve
rises to infinity.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:05.850
In other words, the maximum
value is undefined on this

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:07.090
particular closed interval.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:09.470
You see there's a
jump over here.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.290
Of course, the fact that this
is an infinite jump may make

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.330
you feel uneasy if
you don't feel

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:15.840
comfortable with infinity.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.240
So let me paraphrase this just
a little bit in terms of a

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.370
finite jump.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.790
Let me write down the
following function.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:28.610
Let's think of the function 'f
of x' equals 'x' if 'x' is

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:29.840
less than 1.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.610
Then as soon as 'x' is at
least as big as 1, the

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.620
function becomes 'minus x'.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.380
In other words, graphically,
we have the line 'y' equals

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.670
'x' from 0 up to 1, but
not including 1.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:45.560
And then at 1, the function
jumps down to minus 1 and

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.310
becomes the line 'y'
equals 'minus x'.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:50.800
Let's look, for example,
at the closed interval

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.370
again from 0 to 2.

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:56.390
What is the biggest value?

00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:00.590
What is the maximum that the
function can have if 'x' is

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:01.950
between 0 and 2?

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:07.510
Well, notice that as 'x' gets
closer and closer to 1, 'f of

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:11.150
x' gets closer and closer to 1,
But 'f of x' never equals

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.880
exactly 1, because when
'x' is 1, the curve

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.460
jumps down to here.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.050
In other words, notice that as
'x' gets arbitrarily close to

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:24.310
1, 'f of x' increases and gets
arbitrarily close to but

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.150
never equals 1.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:29.580
In other words, notice that by
picking 'x' to be less than 1,

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.780
we can make 'f of x' as close
to 1 as we want, but we can

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:36.300
never make it exactly equal to
1 because of this jump which

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.980
takes place over here.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.730
You see, this discontinuity
causes us a little bit of

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.270
difficulty.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.530
By the way, we can use
this example from

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:46.140
another point of view.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.000
If we just look at the part
where it says 'f of x' is

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.040
equal to 'x' where 'x' is less
than 1, that means that we'll

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.920
just look at this part
of the curve.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.410
Notice that this part of
the curve is unbroken.

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:02.560
And yet as 'x' approaches 1, 'f
of x' approaches but never

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.090
equals 1, which means that to
get the maximum value in here,

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:10.170
I would have to include the
end point 'x' equals 1.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.150
In other words, notice that
even if the function is

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:17.880
continuous, if the interval is
open, it may not assume the

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.170
maximum value.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.950
In other words, you may not be
able to find the value of 'x'

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:25.230
in that interval such as the
function will be maximum at

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.650
that particular value.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.790
Now again, this is making a
mountain out of a mole hill in

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:32.480
terms of your intuition because
these are result which

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.945
I'm sure you believe
are true anyway.

00:11:34.945 --> 00:11:36.850
In other words, it
seems to be true.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:40.250
But all I hope is that these
little examples here show you

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.470
what the importance of
continuity is, because as we

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:47.330
progress later in our work,
these so called fine points

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.660
are going to become crucial
in many of our proofs.

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:55.260
And by the way, I think it's a
truism to say that if you make

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.970
fine points seem very, very
important before you get to

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:02.190
use them and don't emphasize
them, people tend to think

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:04.290
that you overestimated
your case.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:08.400
So I prefer not to beat this to
death and wait until such

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.340
times in our course that we need
these results before I

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.740
emphasize them more.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.190
So these are results which are
in the textbook, which I'll

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:17.850
test you on in the exercises and
the like, but just want to

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:21.580
go through with you now so that
you get an overall idea.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.360
Another result that's rather
clear geometrically is

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.760
something called the
intermediate value theorem.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.730
Suppose that 'f' is continuous
on the closed interval from

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:31.900
'a' to 'b'.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.740
And without loss of generality,
let's suppose 'f

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.310
of a' is less than 'f of b'.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:39.920
The same kind of an argument
would hold if 'f of b' were

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.400
less than 'f of a', but I just
need some sort of an

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.600
orientation.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.830
Now I say let 'm' be any number
such that m is what?

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:49.440
Between 'f of a' and 'f of b'.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.900
In other words, 'm' is greater
than 'f of a' but

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.540
less than 'f of b'.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.210
You see, if 'f of b' were less
than 'f of a', I would just

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.470
reverse the inequality
signs here.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:01.600
At any rate, what my claim is
that we can find the number

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.770
'c' in the open interval from
'a' to 'b' such that 'f of c'

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:07.610
equals 'm'.

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:10.110
Again, this may sound
kind of complicated.

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:13.430
All it says in terms of
a picture is this.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:20.780
If our curve goes from point 1
to point 2 where the height of

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:25.170
'p1' is 'f of a' and the height
of 'p2' is 'f of b',

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:29.680
then it must assume every
intermediary height between 'f

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:33.890
of a' and 'f of b' on that
particular interval.

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:36.810
Again, you can think of
that in terms of an

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:38.250
automobile, if you want.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:42.160
If an automobile goes from a
speed of 20 miles an hour to a

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.000
speed of 30 miles per hour in
what we think of as being

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.550
continuous motion, then at some
time in that interval, it

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:54.640
must've had any particular
speed you want to mention

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.080
between 20 and 30 miles.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.620
In other words, we don't
visualize a car going from 20

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:02.430
miles an hour to 30 miles an
hour, say, without at one time

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:05.430
having passed the speed
of 27 miles per hour

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:06.850
or some such thing.

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:10.110
And geometrically, you see,
this proof is very simple,

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:12.840
namely, draw the line
'y' equals 'm'.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.410
And now what you're saying is
you want to get from this

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:23.680
point to this point.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.320
And the idea is that the only
way you can get from this

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.120
point to this point without
crossing this line is if

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.430
someplace along the way, you
jump over this line.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.750
In other words, geometrically,
all you're saying is lookit,

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:42.520
if I have to join 'p1' and 'p2'
with an unbroken line,

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:46.010
then I must cross the line
'y' equals 'm' someplace.

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:49.820
By the way, notice I say that at
least one place, the curve

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:53.040
could have done something
like this, for example.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.200
But the important
point is what?

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.870
There's at least one number
'c' such that 'f

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.230
of c' equals 'm'.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:02.830
Again, somebody might think in
terms of an end run and say

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:05.830
couldn't we have done something
like this and not

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.070
cross this line?

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:10.570
That brings us back again
to our concept of

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:12.060
single-valuedness.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.500
In other words, notice, if we
remove the restriction that 'f

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.560
be a' single-valued function,
in other words, if 'f' can

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.590
double back, notice that if we
think of the line 'y' equals

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:27.060
'm' as being endless, the
point remains what?

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.420
That you must someplace cross
this line in going

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.280
from 'p1' to 'p2'.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.760
But if we remove the
single-valued restriction,

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.230
then the point at which
you cross this line

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.690
would not have to be--

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:46.020
see, in this case, 'c' would
not be in the open interval

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:54.610
from 'a' to 'b' since 'f'
is not single- valued.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:57.350
And what I'm hoping this
discussion does for us is

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:00.460
gives us a good geometric
feeling as to what is

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:04.360
happening in terms of a
continuous function.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.410
By the same token, remember
our basic definition of

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:11.180
continuity goes back to
our concept of limit.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.300
And our concept of limit has
been cemented down fairly

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.430
firmly from an analytical point
of view, and that means

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:20.410
that we can also see these
things theoretically as well

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:21.590
as pictorially.

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:25.570
And hopefully what we will do
is combine pictorial and

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:27.930
analytic aspects to
the best possible

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:30.000
advantage for solving problems.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.780
But to show you what I mean by
this, let's look at a few

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:36.310
analytical properties of
continuous functions.

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:41.560
For example, suppose 'f' and 'g'
are both continuous at 'x'

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:42.710
equals 'a'.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:46.290
And suppose we define 'h' to
be the sum of 'f' and 'g'.

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:50.730
In other words, 'h of x' is 'f
of x' plus 'g of x', OK?

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:54.010
Let's compute the limit of 'h
of x' as 'x' approaches 'a'.

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:57.410
By definition, the limit of 'h
of x' as 'x' approaches 'a' is

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:00.630
the limit of the quantity 'f
of x' plus 'g of x' as 'x'

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:01.870
approaches 'a'.

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:07.230
Now, if we look at this
particular expression, notice

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:10.579
that because of our theorems on
limits, we can do an awful

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:13.819
lot with this without having
to make any recourse to our

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:14.849
picture at all.

00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:18.099
For example, notice that we can
say right away that since

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:20.220
the limit of a sum is the sum
of the limits, this is the

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.910
limit of 'f of x' as 'x'
approaches 'a' plus the limit

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:25.290
of 'g of x' as 'x'
approaches 'a'.

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:29.170
Secondly, since 'f' and 'g' are
continuous at 'x' equals

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:31.930
'a', by definition of continuous
that 'x' equals

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:34.700
'a', this says that the limit of
'f of x' as 'x' approaches

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:35.990
'a' is 'f of a'.

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:39.410
The limit of 'g of x' as 'x'
approaches 'a' is 'g of a'.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.690
Therefore, this expression is
'f of a' plus 'g of a'.

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:46.960
But by the definition of 'h',
this is just 'h of a'.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.340
And if we now look at
this, we see what?

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.730
That the limit of 'h of x'
as 'x' approaches 'a'

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:55.250
equals 'h of a'.

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:59.090
Notice that this result came
about under the assumption

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.760
that 'f' and 'g' were both
continuous that 'x' equals

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.060
'a', and what have we
proven over here?

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.470
This is precisely the statement
that 'h' is

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.680
continuous at 'x' equals 'a'.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.500
In other words, what we've now
proven analytically is that a

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.640
sum of two continuous
functions is

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.560
a continuous function.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.470
By induction, we could prove
this for the sum

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:19.880
of more than two.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.160
We can in a similar way by using
limit theorems prove

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.898
things like the product of two
continuous functions is

00:18:25.898 --> 00:18:28.300
continuous, et cetera.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.690
We also were on the verge of a
topic like this when we talked

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.520
about differentiability
sometime back.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.990
Namely, I claim that there is
an interesting connection

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:39.690
between differentiable and
continuous, and that the

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:43.070
connection is that any
differentiable function is

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:44.220
continuous.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.020
And by the way, the proofs
utilizes that which we used in

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.040
our first lecture on derivatives
in this block.

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:54.200
Namely, we take the expression
'f' of--

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.370
we want to show that if 'f prime
of a' exists, that 'f'

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.690
must be continuous at
'x' equals 'a'.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:03.550
That means we want to show that
the limit of 'f of x' as

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:06.240
'x' approaches 'a' is 'f of
a', and that's the same as

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.550
saying we want to show that this
difference approaches 0

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:10.360
and the limit.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:14.320
And the trick is we take 'f of
x' minus 'f of a' and write it

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:20.230
as ''f of x' minus 'f of a'
divided by 'x - a'' times 'x -

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:23.270
a', the idea being that we'll
now take the limit as 'x'

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:24.130
approaches 'a'.

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:27.760
The limit of a product is the
product of the limits.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.360
The limit of this as 'x'
approaches 'a' is just going

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.600
to be 'f prime of a'.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.390
That's our definition
of derivative.

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:37.090
And the limit of 'x - a' as 'x'
approaches 'a' is just 0.

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:38.920
In other words, putting
these steps together,

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:39.870
look what we get.

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:43.820
The limit as 'x' approaches 'a',
'f of x' minus 'f of a',

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:47.010
is the limit as 'x' approaches
'a' of this bracketed

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:51.400
expression ''f of x' minus 'f of
a' over 'x - a'' times the

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.340
limit of 'x - a' as 'x'
approaches 'a'.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:58.420
By definition, 'f' being
differentiable at 'a' means

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:02.430
that this limit exists and is,
in fact, 'f prime of a'.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:06.530
But any finite number
times 0 is still 0.

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:09.350
And therefore, it follows that
the limit of 'f of x' as 'x'

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:11.150
approaches 'a' is 'f of a'.

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:16.780
There's a legitimate analytic
proof that differentiability

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:18.650
implies continuity.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:21.760
Now, it's not necessarily true
that continuity implies

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.190
differentiability.

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:25.720
And you see even though you
can prove these things

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.370
analytically, if you don't
form some picture in your

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:32.720
mind, you frequently will my
wind up memorizing results

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.890
rather than having a
feeling for them.

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:39.870
What I mean by having pictures
and proofs coexist is this.

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:42.570
Instead of saying to yourself,
let's see, continuity is a

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:44.550
weaker condition than
differentiability, it's a

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:45.890
strong-- which one is it?

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:47.520
You say look-it.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.880
We identified continuity
with unbroken.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.230
Remember, continuous
means unbroken.

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:55.380
What did differentiable mean?

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.480
Differentiable meant that the
curve had a tangent line, and

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.260
that, in turn, meant that
the curve was smooth.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.290
In other words, we may think
of differentiable as the

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:07.960
geometric analog of smoothness,
continuity as the

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.740
geometric analog of
unbrokenness.

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:13.990
And now I think it's very easy
to see pictorially that a

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:18.430
smooth curve must be unbroken,
but an unbroken curve doesn't

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:19.630
have to be smooth.

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:22.540
And in fact, a very trivial
illustration of this is the

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:25.900
graph 'y' equals the absolute
value of 'x'.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:27.740
You see, well, what
happens here?

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:32.370
At the origin, notice that we
have a sharp corner, but that

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.030
the curve itself is
unbroken there.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:37.080
You see, I can draw the curve
without taking the pencil off

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.550
the paper, the chalk
off the board.

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:40.340
That's what continuity
means from an

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:41.910
intuitive point of view.

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:43.900
Yet I have a sharp corner.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.680
It's not smooth here.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.030
That's why I write smooth
in quotation marks.

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:52.490
Hopefully, the textbook,
together with our exercises,

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:54.050
will make this much
clear to you.

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:57.350
But notice again in terms of
the picture how an unbroken

00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:00.450
curve doesn't have to be smooth,
but a smooth curve has

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:01.410
to be unbroken.

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:04.180
Now, the point is we
could say much more

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:05.830
about continuous functions.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.580
I think that all we have
to say, though, has

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:09.770
already been said.

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:12.180
It'll be reinforced
in the text.

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:13.870
We'll have exercises on this.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:16.810
But the important thing for now
is to understand what we

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:20.605
mean by continuous, how we will
use it in the future, and

00:22:20.605 --> 00:22:23.860
at any rate, we'll be talking
about that more later.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.640
And so until next
time, goodbye.
