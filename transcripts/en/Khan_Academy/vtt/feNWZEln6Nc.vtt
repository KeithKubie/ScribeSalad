00:00:00.497 --> 00:00:01.449
- [Voiceover] Let's see
if we can figure out

00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:05.650
the volume of this figure over here.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.508
They've given us some of the dimensions.

00:00:07.508 --> 00:00:09.655
We see this side over
here is two centimeters,

00:00:09.655 --> 00:00:12.583
this is seven centimeters,
this is 12 centimeters,

00:00:12.583 --> 00:00:15.483
this is five centimeters,
this is three centimeters.

00:00:15.483 --> 00:00:17.956
And so like always, pause this video

00:00:17.956 --> 00:00:20.463
and see if you can figure it out.

00:00:20.463 --> 00:00:22.240
Well there's a bunch of ways to do this,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.598
but the way I'd like to do it is

00:00:23.598 --> 00:00:26.802
just to break it up into
two rectangular prisms.

00:00:26.802 --> 00:00:28.462
So what I'm gonna do is, in fact most

00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:30.156
of the reasonable ways to do this

00:00:30.156 --> 00:00:32.363
would be to break it up
into two rectangular prisms,

00:00:32.363 --> 00:00:34.081
and the ones that jump out at me

00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:39.027
is one prism like this that is

00:00:39.027 --> 00:00:41.230
three centimeters wide,

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.519
five centimeters high,

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:46.479
and then it is seven centimeters long,

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.163
or seven centimeters deep.

00:00:48.163 --> 00:00:49.637
So this one right over here.

00:00:49.637 --> 00:00:50.798
And if this part right over here

00:00:50.798 --> 00:00:55.105
was transparent you would
see it look just like this.

00:00:55.105 --> 00:00:57.343
You would see it look just like this.

00:00:57.343 --> 00:00:59.789
And so this one once again,

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.158
it is three centimeters wide,

00:01:06.143 --> 00:01:10.545
seven centimeters long.

00:01:10.545 --> 00:01:12.228
So this distance right over here

00:01:12.228 --> 00:01:15.107
is going to be the same as
this distance right over here.

00:01:15.107 --> 00:01:17.397
So seven centimeters long.

00:01:17.397 --> 00:01:20.513
So the width times the length

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:23.762
times the height is five centimeters.

00:01:23.762 --> 00:01:25.722
Gets us to, let's see.

00:01:25.722 --> 00:01:28.875
Three times seven is 21,

00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:31.321
times five is equal to,

00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:33.892
20 times five is 100,
one times five is five.

00:01:33.892 --> 00:01:36.128
So it's going to be 105.

00:01:36.128 --> 00:01:39.071
We can say 105 cubic
centimeters, cause you have

00:01:39.071 --> 00:01:41.428
centimeters times centimeters
times centimeters.

00:01:41.428 --> 00:01:43.030
So this blue part right over here,

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.852
this blue rectangular prism,

00:01:44.852 --> 00:01:49.571
has a volume of 105 cubic centimeters.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.050
So now we can separately
figure out the volume

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.924
of what I'm now highlighting
in this magenta color.

00:01:55.924 --> 00:01:58.134
What I'm highlighting
in this magenta color.

00:01:58.134 --> 00:01:59.595
If this was transparent, you would see

00:01:59.595 --> 00:02:02.474
this part back over here
and right over here.

00:02:02.474 --> 00:02:04.378
So what are its dimensions?

00:02:04.378 --> 00:02:07.675
Well, we know its height
is two centimeters,

00:02:07.675 --> 00:02:11.878
we know that this
dimension right over here,

00:02:11.878 --> 00:02:14.119
I guess you could say its depth,

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:16.463
we could call it that,
is seven centimeters.

00:02:16.463 --> 00:02:17.686
But what is this right over here?

00:02:17.686 --> 00:02:20.062
If we want to consider
this, maybe it's length,

00:02:20.062 --> 00:02:21.828
or maybe it's width, depending on

00:02:21.828 --> 00:02:23.603
what we want to call it.

00:02:23.603 --> 00:02:26.633
Well, let's see, this whole
thing is 12 centimeters,

00:02:26.633 --> 00:02:29.374
from here to here is 12 centimeters,

00:02:29.374 --> 00:02:33.587
and we know that from here
to here is three centimeters,

00:02:33.587 --> 00:02:38.242
so this piece right over here
must be nine centimeters.

00:02:38.242 --> 00:02:40.947
So that must be nine centimeters,

00:02:40.947 --> 00:02:43.687
is this distance right over here.

00:02:43.687 --> 00:02:46.369
So the volume of this magenta part

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:50.607
is going to be nine centimeters
times seven centimers

00:02:50.607 --> 00:02:53.322
times the height, times two centimeters.

00:02:53.322 --> 00:02:56.121
Which is going to get us, let's see,

00:02:56.121 --> 00:03:01.107
nine times seven is 63,
63 times two is equal to,

00:03:01.107 --> 00:03:04.422
60 times two is 120,
three times two is six,

00:03:04.422 --> 00:03:08.903
so it's 126 cubic centimeters.

00:03:08.903 --> 00:03:11.016
So the total volume of the entire thing

00:03:11.016 --> 00:03:13.558
is going to be the volume
of the magenta stuff,

00:03:13.558 --> 00:03:17.796
which is 126 cubic centimeters,

00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:20.013
plus the volume of the blue stuff,

00:03:20.013 --> 00:03:24.529
plus 105 cubic centimeters.

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:27.554
And that's going to give
us, for the entire figure,

00:03:27.554 --> 00:03:30.241
six plus five is 11,

00:03:30.241 --> 00:03:32.853
so one plus two is three, that's really

00:03:32.853 --> 00:03:35.534
one ten plus two tens is three tens.

00:03:35.534 --> 00:03:38.554
And then 100 plus 100 is 200,

00:03:38.554 --> 00:03:43.323
so we get 231 cubic centimeters

00:03:43.538 --> 00:03:46.041
is the volume of the entire thing.

00:03:46.041 --> 00:03:48.089
Fascinating.
