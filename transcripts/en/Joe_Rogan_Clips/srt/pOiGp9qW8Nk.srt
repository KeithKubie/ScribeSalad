1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,250
If they've got their own guys
that's, that's great. Jackson,

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,780
they've got their own people.
Um,

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,920
but you know w w there's plenty of people
on the roster that have an MMA coach

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,600
and a grappling coach and that's it.
So the performance institute, we,

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,700
we feel we can help and support those guys
as well. You can bridge the gap. Right.

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,690
And we're not trying to displace the
programs where athletes already have

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,553
resources,

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,770
but I don't know of another MMA gym
globally that has the capacity around

9
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:27,180
assessment that we do. So yeah, we have,

10
00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:30,660
we have some really great practitioners
but Bose and of our strength coach and

11
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:35,430
his team can not write programs for
570 athletes. Yup. It's not possible.

12
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:38,190
But what we can do is
assess those athletes,

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,700
provide that feedback back to their
strength coaches and have conversations

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,640
about how those coaches
can use that data to,

15
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:47,610
to support the development of that athlete
and that that goes across the board

16
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:49,110
for all of our performance services.

17
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,220
What's pretty amazing resource because
if you're a young fighter and all you

18
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:57,630
have is access to the people around you,
you get, if you're fighting in the UFC,

19
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,290
you get to have access like
instantaneously to this
gigantic group of people

20
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,480
where it's like when forest,
when you were coming up,

21
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,740
you mean you are a real pioneer. I mean
that was, that was not available to a guy.

22
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:09,040
Like, you know, I mean

23
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,690
I tell the story all the time,

24
00:01:10,691 --> 00:01:13,600
but so I was actually a little bit
ahead of my time. I had, you know,

25
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,440
I had an actual strength coach that
had letters behind his name and went to

26
00:01:17,441 --> 00:01:22,090
college to be a strength coach. Not there
was like an ex bodybuilder. Uh, I had a,

27
00:01:22,091 --> 00:01:22,421
you know,

28
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:26,950
a relatively good nutritionist who at
least had a degree in chemical biology.

29
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,380
Uh,
I had a good physical therapist,

30
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,700
but I didn't really have like
I was my coach, you know,

31
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,250
at the end of the day I was the head
of performance. So I'd go do Jujitsu.

32
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,850
Jujitsu coach wants you to go hard and
then you go kickbox but you're going to

33
00:01:39,851 --> 00:01:43,810
go light. But it's kicked
by it so you don't, and then
you know, and now you know,

34
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,560
nobody's the strength coach and
nutritionist on different pages.

35
00:01:47,561 --> 00:01:51,820
So I think just understanding that
everything has to work together,

36
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,560
which I didn't really understand.

37
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,011
Well,

38
00:01:54,011 --> 00:01:59,011
the one I'm saying is that you kind of
had to pave a path because when a guy

39
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:02,560
like you was doing all that stuff with
a real legitimate strength condition

40
00:02:02,561 --> 00:02:04,030
coach,
real legitimate nutritionist,

41
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,150
how many other people were doing that at
your time? Not that many, but I, yeah,

42
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,020
be around good people like Randy couture,
chocolate down.

43
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,780
Those were kind of guys I got to hang
out with and say, well, he does this.

44
00:02:13,781 --> 00:02:16,390
He does a chuck actually what
ended that much of this stuff.

45
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:21,080
But Randy was, Chuck's was right. I know
what I'm doing. K. All right. Yes sir.

46
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,390
Yeah, he'd just existed
on pure savagery. Um,

47
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,670
when you step back and look
at your career, like how,

48
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,890
how amazing is it to be able to step off
from there and do something like you're

49
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:37,490
doing now for the UFC
performance institute was just
very meaningful for young

50
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:37,911
fighters.

51
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:41,660
When you really do get a chance to
give back with your experience and your

52
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:45,080
understanding of the right way and the
wrong way, the mistakes that you've made.

53
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,330
I mean, it's huge. I
mean, that's the whole,

54
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:51,040
I mean that's the whole genesis kind of
from, from my involvement in the pie.

55
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:54,130
Like, oh look, here's the
10,000 mistakes I made. Yeah,

56
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,670
you're gonna make mistakes too. But he,
these are the ones you don't need to make.

57
00:02:57,671 --> 00:03:02,620
You know, again, the sport's changed, man.
It's 25 years old. Every other sports,

58
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:06,310
so all been around so long.
Our sport changes all the time.

59
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,530
I forget who was talking about it,
but you know,

60
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:11,860
even the guys fighting 10 years ago
probably couldn't compete with guests

61
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:13,360
fighting today,
you know?

62
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,010
But I mean what I would say as well
and is not only for the fighters,

63
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,140
Forrest is a huge results for us.
The bet,

64
00:03:19,141 --> 00:03:22,140
the best piece of technology we have
is that they'll handle it leads from my

65
00:03:22,141 --> 00:03:23,910
office to up to four Esophagus,
right?

66
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,140
Because ultimately he's a massive results
for us that are not necessarily coming

67
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:32,940
from an NMA background and are trying
to support the MMA community to,

68
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,840
to bounce ideas off to essentially
Beta test things from a thought process

69
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:37,471
perspective.

70
00:03:37,471 --> 00:03:42,000
And he's a huge part of the performance
institute philosophy because we can use

71
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:42,834
and call upon his ex.

72
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,830
Here's another funny thing. When we
were putting together the, the uh,

73
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,430
the team for the Pii,
I kind of shied away from,

74
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,400
people already do an MMA.
I wanted combat sports.

75
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:57,270
Everybody that's done it has done
judo boxing on an Olympic level.

76
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,650
They've done combat sports.

77
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,790
But I wanted like a fresh set of eyes
coming from a different, you know,

78
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:07,170
than just ah, you know, cause I know
really good MMA strength coaches.

79
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,000
I know pretty good. Emma, you
know, you, you know, good. But get,

80
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,410
get that fresh set of eyes.
You know,

81
00:04:13,411 --> 00:04:17,640
nutrition actually was a little different
because the rest of the world does not

82
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:22,550
understand awake cut for an MMA fight.
It's not like a, you know, we go to Exos,

83
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,630
you go to any high level
facility and they, you say,

84
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,300
I'm going to lose 8% of my body weight,
and then competed on Saturday.

85
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:30,660
They're like, no, don't just fight
in highway class. I'm like, yeah,

86
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:33,240
that actually isn't gonna work out for me.
They,

87
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,840
they just won't comprehend it
though. No, no. You'll perform
better. Like, no, no, no.
