00:00:04.056 --> 00:00:05.930
FEMALE SPEAKER: So,
Gloria, welcome to Google

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.557
and YouTube it's amazing
to have you here.

00:00:08.557 --> 00:00:10.390
GLORIA STEINEM: I'm
dependent on all of you,

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:11.875
so I'm really glad to see you.

00:00:11.875 --> 00:00:13.500
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well,
you're definitely

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.860
a woman that needs
absolutely no introduction,

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.360
but I will have to take at
least a minute to embarrass you.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.930
I actually don't
think that's possible,

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.090
but you are truly
someone who has

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.310
changed the lives for everyone
in this room, both men

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.970
and women.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.670
You've been an icon of the
entire women's movement

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.300
for many, many decades.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.730
You're a writer, you're an
activist, you're an organizer,

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.140
and you're just an
incredibly inspiring woman.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.530
You co-founded Ms. Magazine.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.710
You've got numerous awards,
including the National Magazine

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.050
Award, the Society of Writers
Award from the United Nations,

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.170
and recently-- and it
should have happened decades

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.190
before-- the Presidential
Medal of Freedom

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.656
from President Obama.

00:00:59.656 --> 00:01:01.296
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:01.296 --> 00:01:02.046
Pretty incredible.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.520
As an activist, you helped
launch the National Women's

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.950
Political Caucus, a
group that supports

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.500
women seeking public office.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.640
She's been arrested for
protesting Apartheid

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.510
in South Africa.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.110
And this summer, she visited
North Korea to promote peace.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.590
Incredibly important,
given everything happening.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.910
And she's an author of
this incredible new book,

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.457
"My Life on the Road."

00:01:27.457 --> 00:01:29.040
I literally stayed
up half the weekend

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.652
reading every page of it.

00:01:30.652 --> 00:01:32.110
That's her eighth
book, by the way.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.177
So if you love this one, make
sure you check them all out.

00:01:35.177 --> 00:01:37.010
And your book is getting
incredible reviews.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.080
And it's so exciting
to have you here,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.194
but I have to say, personally,
I'm probably the most excited,

00:01:42.194 --> 00:01:43.860
because I've had the
privilege of having

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.110
a few dinners and long
lunches with you over time.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.490
And she's someone who
deeply has inspired

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.730
me-- her depth of knowledge
in almost any topic you

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.090
can possibly think of,
around politics, economics,

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.990
third world, development, the
women's movement in the US,

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.960
of course.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.210
But it's far, far beyond that.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.830
And what I love about
every conversation with you

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.330
is you challenge me
to think differently,

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.460
to go back to the
assumptions on which I've

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.740
based any point of view.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.760
And you always leave me in that
conversation feeling inspired

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.340
that I need to do something.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.170
So I hope that every
person in this room

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.340
will be equally inspired today
to think deeper than you ever

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.400
have about the subjects
that matter to you,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.870
and to be also someone
who takes action.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.140
So with that in mind-- and of
course we're in Silicon Valley,

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.020
one of the hot topics
in Silicon Valley

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.640
has absolutely been
women in leadership.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.030
We have some women now running
some of our big tech firms.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.792
We have an increasing number
of women in STEM leadership,

00:02:46.792 --> 00:02:49.250
and we also have some women on
the boards of Silicon Valley

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.140
companies.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.640
But at the same
time, I think we all

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.090
know we haven't done enough.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.890
And it's really
important our user

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.550
base is highly representative.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.100
We need to make sure we
have diverse leadership

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.910
to ensure that the
quality of our products

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.250
and services in the next
evolution are gonna be amazing.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.250
You've have so many great
experiences over time.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.700
What advice do you have for us
as leaders in Silicon Valley?

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.880
What should we be
thinking about and doing

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.680
to try to help speed progress?

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.680
GLORIA STEINEM: First, I
have to worry about how

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.810
to follow that introduction.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.525
I don't know if I
can follow myself.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.710
Well, it's partly what I think
of as the Mozart's sister Sandy

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.810
learnt to Sandy
learner syndrome.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.020
Mozart had a slightly
older sister.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.830
Do you know this?

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.700
You probably know this.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.780
And they traveled together as
child geniuses through Europe.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.280
And we know about
Mozart's sister,

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.444
because Mozart wrote
letters to her.

00:03:48.444 --> 00:03:50.110
They wrote back and
forth to each other.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.400
They were closer
than anyone else,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.280
because they'd been traveling
their whole childhood

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.530
to perform in Europe's capitals.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.410
And he said she was
the talented one.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.150
Now, she was sent
home at 16 to marry.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.530
And she became a teacher
of other musicians.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.540
So I think part of it is
just listening and learning

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.420
to the folks who
were already there,

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.700
and learning how
to identify them.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.830
I also think about Sandy Lerner.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.270
Do you know who Sandy Lerner is?

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:33.530
She was the co-inventor of
whatever the invention that all

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.257
of Cisco was based on, right?

00:04:35.257 --> 00:04:36.090
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yup.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.130
GLORIA STEINEM: Yup.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.650
And she is still out there
inventing new sound systems

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.730
and so on.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:50.580
But after Cisco got started, she
found it inhospitable and left.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.050
But she was the
co-inventor of the router,

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.210
I guess one would say, right,
on which Cisco was based.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.610
So I'm just saying that
to say that they're there.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.030
I mean, it isn't like the
women and men who are talented

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.010
in this way are not there.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.650
The question is
how to find them.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.380
Now, my college, Smith
College, started at the bottom,

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.060
because they had been sending
engineering students from Smith

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.730
to UMass, which is nearby.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.770
But they were not called
on equally in class,

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.660
and had a certain
amount of harassment.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.170
And this was relatively recent.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.400
This is not Mozart.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.890
So finally Ruth Simmons, the
great the president of Smith,

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.520
started an engineering
school at Smith.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.750
And that's part
of the answer too.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.380
It really has to do with
being open, and looking.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.680
And if you're not
requiring degrees

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.480
and completed PhDs of men, don't
require them of women either.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.810
Because there's huge
talent out there.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:06.060
Women are usually required to
have degrees that men are not.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.790
And it is the culture
once you're here.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.310
And it is-- I mean, I
don't have to say this--

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.640
it is having one job, not two.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.750
So as has Sheryl
Sandberg points out,

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.200
if you want to have children,
if women plan to have children,

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.180
the single most important
career decision you will make

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.110
is who your partner is.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.780
Is that partner really
going to be equal in terms

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:33.990
of child bearing?

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.370
And then there is the fact
that we live in the one

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.600
developed democracy in the
world with no national system

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.220
of child care, and
that affects you too.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.280
So at all those levels, we
just need to be aware and open,

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.545
and then it will work.

00:06:49.545 --> 00:06:51.170
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
you're such an icon.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.350
Thank you for those.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:56.950
GLORIA STEINEM: I'm not--
the word icon calls out

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.520
for iconoclast, you know.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.770
So I think, oh wait, no.

00:07:03.142 --> 00:07:04.850
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well,
I mean, I think you

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.600
you're always challenging the
status quo, that's for sure.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.160
And as you think about all the
things you've done and pushed

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.180
in terms of how to put women
in the right conversations

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.690
at the right time, as you look
at those issues you worked so

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:22.770
hard to change, do you feel like
we've made the progress you'd

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.120
hope we'd make?

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.470
And what are some of
the things that you'd

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:30.009
like to see happen
over the next 10 years?

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:32.050
GLORIA STEINEM: No, we
haven't made the progress,

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.530
but I think part of
it was my naivete.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:37.130
I thought in the
beginning that if we

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:42.470
got the majority of Americans
to change consciousness,

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.770
and support a certain
set of issues related

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.970
to equality by sex,
race, ethnicity,

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.930
sexuality, and so on,
that that would do it.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:57.050
I just overestimated
our democracy big time.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:01.480
And also I overestimated
or underestimated

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.860
the degree of resistance.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.610
And here's why in a
deep sense this affects

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.090
what we're talking about today.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.370
Unfortunately, our
courses on economics

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.700
don't start with reproduction.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.330
They start with production.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.740
It happens that reproduction
is much more basic.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:23.820
And the very definition of
androcentric or patriarchal

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.090
systems is controlling
reproduction,

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.820
and that means controlling
women's bodies.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.900
So that means a
whole set of things,

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.659
like you're valued when
you're young and can either

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:39.200
have children or
look after children.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.909
You're valued for your
womb more than your brain.

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:48.500
And it also is redoubled
if there is a racial caste

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.300
system, or a caste system
like in India, or class,

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.440
because to maintain
those separations,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:01.160
it's doubly important
to control reproduction.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.460
It's also connected of course
to the environmental movement.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.860
I mean, I'm really glad
that the pope spoke out

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:08.810
about global warming.

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.320
This is good.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.010
He's against global warming.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.120
He's for dogs.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:18.890
I'm really grateful for
both of those things.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:24.360
But it happens that he's part
of a huge patriarchal structure

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.410
that forces women to have
children whether they want them

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:28.010
or not.

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:32.210
And that's the single biggest
cause of global warming,

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:34.730
just the overload of
human beings on Earth.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:41.130
If you let women decide over
the long term when and whether

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.740
to have children, it boils down
to a little over replacement

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.650
level, just because
it's a health issue.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:49.810
So some women have six.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:53.340
Some women have one or none,
and it always works out.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.010
But right now child
marriage, and suppression

00:09:56.010 --> 00:10:00.050
of contraception, abortion--
incidentally, the Church

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.760
approved of abortion
until the 1840s.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.375
No, I won't go there,
but it's interesting.

00:10:09.454 --> 00:10:10.870
And then when they
disapproved, it

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.830
was all about the deal
with France for population.

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:18.850
It wasn't about what
the dialogue is now.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:22.570
Anyway, I think I didn't
see the depth of it.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:26.550
I didn't understand that
reproduction is the whole ball

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:32.730
game in many ways,
for how many workers,

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:38.900
how many soldiers, what race,
caste, or class they are.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:43.550
And so the fact that we as
women, as female human beings,

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.850
have to seize control of
the means of reproduction--

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.970
even sounds radical,
doesn't it--

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:53.720
in order to be
healthy is the biggest

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.450
determinant of
whether we're educated

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.390
or not, healthy or not,
work outside the home

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.750
or not, and how long we live.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:05.410
But as you can see by
what's going on now,

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:10.920
and having lost the battle
somewhat in Washington

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.980
to control reproduction
and to eliminate

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:17.700
sex education, contraception,
and abortion, and so on,

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.300
they're now doing it
in state legislatures,

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:24.030
where the ultra right
wing has a lot more power.

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:25.120
So it is basic.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.020
I think I did not
understand that it is basic,

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:32.320
which is all the more reason
that we are going to succeed

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.420
in saying that
reproductive freedom is

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.085
a fundamental human right,
like freedom of speech.

00:11:37.085 --> 00:11:38.460
FEMALE SPEAKER:
So when you think

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:42.140
about reproductive
freedom and looking ahead,

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.370
is that the biggest single
thing that you think

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.921
will help shift the
tide, and really

00:11:47.921 --> 00:11:50.420
ensure that some of the things
you've tried to make progress

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:55.460
on in the broader scheme
will really carry forward?

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:59.350
GLORIA STEINEM: I don't think
there's a hierarchy of what

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:00.610
we should work on.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:04.420
I think we each need to
work on what hurts the most,

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:05.655
or what we know the best.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.980
Because it's all important.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:19.340
So for instance, it right
now for the first time

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:24.530
that we're aware of, there is so
much violence against females.

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:28.200
Violence means son preference.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.720
It means child marriage.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.260
It means FGM.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.990
It means domestic
violence in this country.

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.280
It means sexualized
violence in war zones.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.540
Anyway, if you add
all of that up,

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.150
for the first time
that we know of,

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:46.590
there are fewer females
on Earth than males.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.900
And this is dangerous.

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:54.770
So certainly wherever we
are, being aware of violence

00:12:54.770 --> 00:13:02.140
and understanding the why of
it, and understanding that it's

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:06.550
connected to everything else.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:08.980
What's an example?

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:16.460
For instance, let's take this
country, domestic violence.

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:20.970
Violence at home is
the biggest indicator

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:24.000
that there will be
violence outside the home.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.070
We're looking at and are
faced with the racist violence

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:33.230
of our cops, some of our cops.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:36.170
It turns out that that
is completely connected

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:38.970
to violence at home.

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:41.860
And the cops have
four times the rate

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.670
of domestic violence
in their families

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:46.880
that the nation at large does.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.480
But that is not taken as a
predictor of other violence

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.380
and dealt with either
by helping people

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:57.630
or by eliminating them
as a job applicants.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.870
We're not making
the connections yet.

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:01.870
FEMALE SPEAKER: So I
really take away your point

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:04.040
of go to the root cause
and some of the drivers.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.440
It reminds me of a quote that
I wrote down from your book.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.530
And I've actually heard you
say this in other talks,

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.190
and I think it's very inspiring.

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:15.710
"There is no such thing
as gender, race, or class.

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:17.800
They are cultural inventions.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.060
We are all linked, not ranked."

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.090
I really thought that was
a beautiful statement.

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:24.640
Can you tell us what
you meant by that?

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.830
GLORIA STEINEM: Yeah,
I've just done an event

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:31.580
with Ta-Nehisi Coates and
Bryan Stevenson, whose work I

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.800
hope you know, and I hope
you read their books.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:39.210
And it was great, because we
were all trying to say this.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:42.340
On the one hand,
there is no gender.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.920
There is no race.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:44.960
There is no class.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.660
There is no caste.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:52.730
On the other hand, we as human
beings are very adaptable.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:54.400
The good news is
that we're adaptable,

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.330
and the bad news is
that we're adaptable.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:15:00.560
We survive, because
we're so adaptable.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.970
We're born with immature
brains, unlike other animals,

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:06.850
who can get up and walk
around 20 minutes later.

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:11.670
So we have a really long
period of dependency.

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:16.060
So we're deeply adaptable
and influenceable.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:23.500
So race, and class, and caste,
and gender are embedded in us.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.640
But we made them
up as human beings.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.000
We made them up.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.590
And if you look at
the ancient cultures,

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:36.220
the original cultures, many
of which are still with us,

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.440
there's not even he and
she in the language.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.530
There's no gender.

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:41.590
People are people.

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:43.800
What a concept.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:49.250
There's no word for nature,
because we're part of nature.

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:54.777
So I think what's great about
Ta-Nehisi's book and Brian's

00:15:54.777 --> 00:15:56.360
book is that they
are saying the same.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:02.310
They are trying to make us see
how deep racism is, and sexism

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:05.390
too, at the same time
that they fully understand

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:06.790
that it doesn't exist.

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:09.120
And those, I think,
are the two ideas

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.070
we need to go forward with.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.670
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
as a person of ideas,

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:18.380
you're someone that really
emphasizes both in your book

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:22.600
but in your life how much
transformative ideas often

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.630
come from unexpected places.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:27.740
It's certainly something I
took away in reading the book.

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:31.020
Of all the people that
you've met, who has really

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.971
had the greatest impact on you?

00:16:33.971 --> 00:16:35.720
GLORIA STEINEM: You
mean I have to choose?

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.610
FEMALE SPEAKER: No, a few.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:43.380
GLORIA STEINEM: It's
hard, but I would

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:46.550
say because I've
been in more touch

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:49.440
here with people
in Indian Country

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:55.630
than in other countries, I mean,
it's the original cultures, OK?

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:58.080
So it's the Khoi and the
San in Africa, which we all

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.700
came from, the Dalits in India.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:05.030
But since I live here,
it's Indian Country here.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.390
I once made a button that said,
the truth will set you free,

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:13.849
but first it will piss you off.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:20.650
Because I was so mad
that nobody ever told me

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:23.829
what was here before
Columbus showed up,

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:27.030
that there were pyramids
bigger than the ones in Egypt,

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:31.900
that there were earthworks, the
biggest system of earthworks

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:36.910
in the world, that
there were cultures

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:40.710
with great sophistication
about pharmacology,

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:46.280
about agriculture, and that
they were what we would call

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:51.890
egalitarian cultures that
were whose model, at least as

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:55.590
much as we know, because there
were 500 different ones, whose

00:17:55.590 --> 00:18:00.390
model was the circle,
not a pyramid.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.940
So people were connected.

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:06.600
People were linked, not ranked,
and also linked to nature.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:14.050
You could do a great
experiment to just

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:18.430
find out who lived here, and
how did they live right here?

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.910
There's something intimate
about vertical history.

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:24.090
You can go out and put your
hand on the land and say.

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:25.890
Who was here and
probably still is here?

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:29.220
There were more
tribes in California

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.190
than any other part
of the country.

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:36.580
So on that basis, I would
say that Wilma Mankiller, who

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:41.630
was the chief of the Cherokee
Nation influenced me the most.

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:44.420
And she's no longer with
us, but before she died,

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.840
we were trying to
do a book together

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.040
which I'm gonna try to do.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.440
I mean, I want this
to be practical.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.340
I don't want it to be
theoretical and out there.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.040
So I'll give you an example.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.300
We were taking examples
from original cultures

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.640
around the world,
and taking ones

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.810
that we could do to make
a bridge, to keep us

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:12.470
from thinking, oh that's either
the romantic or terrible past

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:14.540
or something, but
just practical things.

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:20.270
For instance, in of the
oldest cultures in Ghana,

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:24.380
when someone does an
anti-social destructive thing,

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:27.960
they are indeed
punished with isolation,

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.350
which may be a universal
human punishment, since we're

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:32.770
communal people.

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:34.090
We need each other.

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:35.850
Communal animals.

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:38.100
Not like our
solitary confinement,

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:42.960
mind you, just a brief
period of isolation.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:47.440
And when that person is
brought back into society,

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.990
there is a long
ritual amount of time

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:52.020
in which everyone
who knows that person

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:56.960
tells that person every good
thing he or she ever did.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.020
We could do that.

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.250
We do the reverse.

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:02.180
We take votes away.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.390
We take jobs away.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:04.340
We punish forever.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:11.300
We've just won a tiny victory
of getting rid of the box

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.330
at the beginning
of job applications

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.489
that says whether you've
ever been arrested or not,

00:20:17.489 --> 00:20:19.030
and at least putting
it at the bottom

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:21.660
after you've seen all
the qualifications.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.820
So there are a ton
of things like that.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.730
I mean, I don't know
why we're so-- well,

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:30.950
history is political.

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:32.130
We should remember that.

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:34.150
There are two things--
history and the past,

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.709
and they're not the same.

00:20:36.709 --> 00:20:38.000
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's so true.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.840
We had the opportunity to
be deeply inspired by Bryan

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.360
Stevenson recently.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.190
He was at Google Zeitgeist.

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:47.040
So for anyone one
here at Google,

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.630
you can go on to watch
the videos from Zeitgeist,

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:53.120
one of the most compelling talks
I've ever heard in my life.

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.770
And I think genuinely
many people talk about him

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:59.440
as the next Martin Luther King,
really pushing the thinking

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.810
on that concept of
what we're doing

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:05.370
as a society and our
collective responsibility.

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:09.480
As I think about so
many of the passages

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.610
in this book, another one
I wanted to highlight,

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.855
because I think it's
so relevant to us

00:21:14.855 --> 00:21:18.510
at Google and as a leader,
you wrote in the book,

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:21.200
"one of the simplest
paths to deep change

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:26.360
is for the more powerful to
listen as much as they speak."

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.140
And that really made
me think about so many

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.210
of the conversations
that we've had.

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:33.340
And I think that inspiration
I always find from you

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:36.290
is that connection
to something deeper,

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:41.181
to that historical context,
to all that framework.

00:21:41.181 --> 00:21:43.805
How did you learn to become such
a good listener and connector?

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:49.800
GLORIA STEINEM: I think
we choose our professions

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:54.060
a little bit on our
persona, what we want to do.

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:59.330
So I have wanted to be two
things in my life, a dancer,

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:01.520
because I had the
completely bonkers idea that

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.180
was gonna get me out of Toledo.

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:06.580
I was gonna dance my
way out of Toledo.

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.680
Because I think show
business is to girls

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.020
what sports is to boys.

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:13.490
It's the only way, or at
least in poor neighborhoods,

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:15.040
it's the only place you
see somebody who looks

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.210
like you who's getting out.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.040
A dancer and a writer,
and as a speech teacher

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.010
said to me, no wonder
you're in such trouble

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:26.640
speaking-- because
I was terrified.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.460
Those are the two professions
in which you don't have to talk.

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:42.400
So I once wrote a long essay
about the politics of talking.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.934
Because I also believed that
women talk more than men do.

00:22:45.934 --> 00:22:47.850
I thought it's probably
one of the few ways we

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:49.480
can show our power.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.640
But the studies are
the reverse, actually.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:55.140
In general, men talk more than
women do, even about subjects

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.080
of female expertise.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:03.870
And what happens is that
women introduce topics

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:09.220
until one captures the attention
of the men in the group,

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.840
and continue with it.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:14.170
Whereas men-- I'm
sorry to generalize,

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:17.320
because I'm sure that it's not
true of the men in this room,

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:21.770
but in a kind of
sociological way--

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:25.410
whereas men feel completely
comfortable sitting

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:29.040
there talking about their work
while women are listening.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.630
And women don't do that.

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:32.030
If the men are
not participating,

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:35.690
they get anxious and start
to introduce other subjects.

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:39.310
So just the politics of
talking interested me.

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:46.110
And I realized from living
in India-- it's a long story,

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:51.260
but anyway, if you want
people to listen to you,

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:53.330
you have to listen to them.

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:57.990
And if you have
not been powerful,

00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:01.440
you have to speak as much
as you listen if you're not

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:05.330
the powerful one in this group.

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:07.970
And sometimes,
that's as difficult.

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.360
Because those of us
who may have been

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.370
in a position of lesser power
have protected ourselves

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:16.210
by not talking.

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:22.260
I mean, I felt like an open
mouthed bird in flight, just

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:25.420
the first time when
I began to talk.

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.360
I felt so vulnerable.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.360
But if you balance
talking and listening,

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.985
it's a very organic
step to equality.

00:24:34.934 --> 00:24:36.850
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's
actually very profound,

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:39.500
an organic step to equality,
talking and listening.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.890
I think that's one thing I
could definitely take out

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:45.450
of this room to really commit,
because I do think that's

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:47.550
one of the biggest
challenges as a leader is

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:50.260
to ensure that you're
listening as much as talking.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.760
As you talked about people that
influenced you, in the book,

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.290
you talked a lot
about your father

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:57.840
and what a profound
impact he had on you.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.110
And it also sounds like a
complicated relationship,

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:03.730
because it was harder
for you to attend school

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:05.070
through the age of 11.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:10.490
How did that experience in the
world shape you as a person?

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:12.490
GLORIA STEINEM:
Well, at the time,

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:17.120
my father was kind of a
gypsy, I should explain.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.050
We lived in Michigan.

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:19.300
He had a little summer resort.

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:20.900
He hated the cold
weather, so as soon

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.540
as it got cold at
Halloween, I left school,

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:27.200
and we all got in the house
trailer and schlepped, buying

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.280
and selling antiques, to
Florida or California.

00:25:33.134 --> 00:25:34.300
So I wasn't going to school.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.716
And of course I wanted to go
to school like the other kids

00:25:36.716 --> 00:25:39.220
I saw in movies.

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:42.260
But in retrospect, I realized
that it was probably not bad,

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:46.402
because I missed a
lot of brainwashing.

00:25:46.402 --> 00:25:48.235
I didn't read all those
Dick and Jane books.

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:53.160
I paid a penalty.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:56.050
I still can't add, subtract,
and my geography is nowhere,

00:25:56.050 --> 00:26:00.220
but my vocabulary is
off the-- because I

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:01.840
was reading all the time.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.530
But still, I think
it was important

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:05.610
that I missed that
kind of brainwashing.

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:10.250
And also, I have to say
that it was important

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:14.520
that my father treated me
like a buddy, a friend.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:18.110
His favorite story about me
was that when I was, like,

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:20.870
five or something, we went
to a little country store,

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:22.880
and I asked him for a nickel.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.380
And he said what for?

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.810
And according to him, I
said you can give it to me

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:29.240
or not give it to me, but
you can't ask what it's for.

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.970
And to me, this
story is about him,

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:35.427
because he said that's right.

00:26:35.427 --> 00:26:36.510
And he gave me the nickel.

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:40.410
FEMALE SPEAKER: I thought
that was pretty great.

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:43.570
A good negotiator,
even early on.

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:46.780
So given it's election season,
I can avoid this topic,

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:49.350
because you've been such a
passionate supporter of women

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:51.170
getting into public office.

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:54.850
You're a vocal Hillary
Clinton supporter.

00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:56.350
Are things different
for Hillary now

00:26:56.350 --> 00:27:00.020
than they were
the last election?

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:04.566
GLORIA STEINEM: My sense is
that they are, but we'll see.

00:27:04.566 --> 00:27:06.840
If you'll remember
the last time,

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:10.210
I mean, first of all,
it was not so urgent,

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:12.530
because you had to
be on LSD to see

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:17.080
the difference between
Hillary and Obama on issues.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.260
The whole first year
people, would say

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.111
are you supporting
Hillary Clinton or Obama,

00:27:21.111 --> 00:27:21.985
and I would say, yes.

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:28.180
But she had so much more
experience with the ultra right

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:32.410
wing, which is so crucial.

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:35.820
And I think that the lack
of that experience for Obama

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.380
made it harder for
him in Washington

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:40.250
in the first couple of years,
because being a good person,

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:45.550
he thought he could reach out
and somehow this would work.

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:48.215
And he didn't quite realize that
if the right wing had cancer,

00:27:48.215 --> 00:27:50.090
and he had the cure,
they wouldn't accept it.

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:58.950
But then, even though
I supported her

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:02.680
based on her experience, I
didn't think that she could

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:09.090
win, because I thought that
too few people had seen women

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:12.660
in public authority,
and almost all of us

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:17.840
have seen female authority
in childhood, which I think

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:21.500
is why some of the big,
serious television guys

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.930
behaved so badly,
and said things like,

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:28.200
she reminds me of my first
wife outside alimony court,

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.020
and I cross my legs
whenever I see Hilary.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:32.090
What is that about?

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:35.280
I think they felt
regressed to childhood,

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:41.430
because the last time they saw
a powerful woman, they were six.

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:42.830
Now, I think that's different.

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:44.790
I think it's not
completely different,

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:48.810
but I think partly thanks to
Hillary herself, but thanks

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:54.000
to great Californian women, like
Barbara Lee and Maxine Waters,

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.010
and thanks to Barbara
Mikulski, and thanks to women

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:00.980
in all kinds of
business ventures,

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.914
we're a little more
accustomed to seeing women

00:29:02.914 --> 00:29:03.830
in public authorities.

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:05.535
So I think it might
be possible now.

00:29:05.535 --> 00:29:07.160
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well,
it's interesting,

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.868
because a lot of people
have been talking

00:29:08.868 --> 00:29:11.850
about how to some
extent, Carly Fiorina is

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:14.790
taking a lot of the brunt
that Hillary got last time,

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:19.280
talking about her looks,
getting off on many side points

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.920
rather than focusing
on her record,

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.510
her ability to
perform in office,

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:26.170
the real ideas that
are coming out.

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:28.810
What's your sense on
why the media continues

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:30.910
to go off on these
tangents and not

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:34.360
really just allow the
candidates to be the candidates?

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.210
GLORIA STEINEM:
Well, the Women's

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:38.610
Media Center, which
I helped to start,

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:44.820
we try to keep track of
fair coverage in that way.

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:48.260
And so we were
critical of the media

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:51.920
both for Carly Fiorina
and Sarah Palin,

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:55.330
who were criticized in ways that
their male counterparts would

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:56.070
not have been.

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:59.340
At the same time, I'm dead
set opposed to both of them,

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:07.350
because Carly Fiorina is
against every majority issue

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:10.670
that women want,
every single one.

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:14.790
It's outrageous.

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:18.010
So I'm completely
happy to that she

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:22.200
has served to prove that
it isn't about biology.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:27.890
It's about
consciousness But she's

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:32.160
kind of the Clarence
Thomas of the situation.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:36.311
FEMALE SPEAKER: Sorry, any Carly
Fiorina supporters in the room.

00:30:36.311 --> 00:30:37.560
GLORIA STEINEM: I'm not sorry.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:45.650
I mean, hello?

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:48.950
There's no issue that
the majority of women

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:52.440
want that she supports.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.840
At least, I haven't found one.

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:54.930
Maybe you can tell me one.

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:57.840
But anyway, there are too
many that she doesn't support.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.100
And she lied about Planned
Parenthood completely,

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.385
and she knew better, right?

00:31:01.385 --> 00:31:04.230
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
that was a scary moment.

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:07.110
So we have a lot issues
right now in the country,

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:08.200
in the world.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.470
As you think about
your vast experience

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:13.910
on so many of these
topics, I think

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:16.620
one of the things that curse
occurs to so many of us

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:19.880
is that as a society, we're
really struggling to separate

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.310
the urgent from the important.

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:25.260
Is there a single
issue on your mind

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:27.960
as we go into this election
that really needs to be

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.180
at the center of the plate?

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:37.670
GLORIA STEINEM: I
mean, we don't have

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:41.110
to say how economically-- we're
as economically polarized as we

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:42.235
were in the Depression now.

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:48.160
But what worries me is that when
we say big things like that,

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.400
we get stunned out of activity.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.870
So I think what we
need to do is look

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:57.340
at the place we know the
most and it hurts the most

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:58.375
and attend to that.

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:05.200
For instance, part of the reason
we're so economically divided

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.120
is that young people
and old people

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:11.620
are graduating from
colleges and universities

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.450
indentured, in huge debt.

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:18.450
That was not
happening in my era.

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:20.160
It's much worse now.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.460
Why is that happening?

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:24.950
Because state
legislatures-- the moral

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:28.750
here is we really need to focus
on state legislatures more.

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:32.190
We do it somewhat better
in California, New York,

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:35.260
and a few others,
but we need to do it

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:37.840
a lot more, because the
state legislatures have been

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:41.590
taking money away from
universities and building

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:43.620
prisons with it.

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:44.810
It's part of the reason--

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:46.268
FEMALE SPEAKER:
$60 billion a year.

00:32:50.181 --> 00:32:51.930
GLORIA STEINEM: Because
state legislatures

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:55.310
are controlled by the
interests they regulate

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:57.740
for the most part,
especially insurance,

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:00.030
but a lot of other ones too.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:04.780
So what we need to
focus on the big issues,

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:09.700
but in a way that's
practical, that we don't get

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:14.240
stunned into inactivity.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.882
Does that make sense?

00:33:15.882 --> 00:33:17.590
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
think it's complicated.

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:20.680
This morning, I came from a
really interesting discussion

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:25.500
with a number of economists,
the CEO of Cisco, John Chambers,

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.120
and a few others
who were talking

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.650
a lot about the digital economy.

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:32.440
McKinsey just published a
new piece of research that

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.030
actually put more facts out.

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:35.700
When you talk about
income inequality,

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.470
there's a lot of
discussion about,

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:42.250
will digital technology really
end up automating so many jobs,

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:44.160
and we'll have a
lot of people that

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.770
are even more disenfranchised.

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:48.310
And I thought the data was
incredibly interesting.

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:51.720
It actually said that only 5% of
jobs will really be automated,

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:56.860
but the big challenge is
that 30% to 40% of jobs

00:33:56.860 --> 00:34:01.400
will have components of them
re-imagined, and therefore

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.410
fundamental occupations
and work itself will

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:06.240
need to shift significantly.

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.546
So that does become, then, a
very big societal challenge

00:34:10.546 --> 00:34:11.920
that we have to
take on, which is

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:15.199
that this is gonna happen over
the course of a few years,

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:17.909
maybe three to five years,
whereas the Industrial

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:19.590
Revolution happened
over decades.

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:23.260
So it was much easier for
people to slowly reposition

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:25.449
themselves, find
different paths.

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:27.840
And so I do think as a
society one of things

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.830
that we think a lot about is
the impact that the Digital

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:33.199
Revolution is having on society.

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:35.620
Do you have any points
of view on that, and what

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:38.659
we could do as Google--
as you know, we deeply

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:42.374
care about the world around us--
to help manage that transition?

00:34:47.664 --> 00:34:49.580
GLORIA STEINEM: In this
room above all others,

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:53.320
I don't have to say how
important technology

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:56.900
is in democratizing
knowledge, and allowing people

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:59.712
to say what otherwise they
were dependent on the media.

00:34:59.712 --> 00:35:00.920
I don't have to say all that.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:08.997
And I do worry about
the distancing function

00:35:08.997 --> 00:35:09.580
of technology.

00:35:13.086 --> 00:35:14.460
I don't know if
it's still there,

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:15.918
but on the Google
campus, there was

00:35:15.918 --> 00:35:19.700
a map with searches going up
in colored lines in real time.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:20.900
Is it still there?

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:25.020
And you can see whole parts
of the world that are dark.

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:29.200
You can see where
literacy is low, where

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.630
electricity is unavailable.

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:33.630
So we have to remember
that technology

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:38.970
can be divisive in a big way.

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:41.730
And we also have to
remember that technology

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:42.865
doesn't allow empathy.

00:35:46.025 --> 00:35:50.450
You know the oxytocin, or the
so-called "tend and befriend"

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:52.200
hormones that both
men and women are

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.880
flooded with if you hold
a child, for instance?

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:59.240
It's what allows us to know
what other people are feeling.

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:02.930
I asked my friendly
neurologist if that

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:08.160
could be produced from reading,
as much as I love books,

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.280
or from the screen?

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:10.180
And she said, no.

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:13.579
You have to be together
with all five senses.

00:36:13.579 --> 00:36:15.120
It's part of the
reason people can be

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:18.520
so mean to each other online.

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.830
And we need to remember that.

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:24.960
It's pretty crucial.

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:28.527
McClellan said it long ago,
high tech means high touch.

00:36:28.527 --> 00:36:29.110
Remember that?

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:31.220
I think that's what he meant.

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:34.025
But now I think we're
really seeing it big time.

00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:36.150
FEMALE SPEAKER: Actually,
one of the biggest topics

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:38.510
of conversation around
this was actually

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:42.956
as jobs are reformed, because so
many of the computational tasks

00:36:42.956 --> 00:36:44.330
or other things
can be automated,

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:47.510
whether you're a doctor, or
in many other professions,

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:49.990
that actually the
humanity of work

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:52.290
would actually be
emphasized even more.

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:54.440
So in fact, now medical
schools or places

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.120
like that are fundamentally
rethinking the curriculum,

00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.870
because it's no longer
who has the encyclopedic

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:01.720
memory of all the things.

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.471
You can actually
have that automated.

00:37:03.471 --> 00:37:05.220
Now what really matters
is that connection

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:06.850
between doctor and patient.

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:09.050
So I do think, actually,
technology and humanity

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:10.949
can come back around.

00:37:10.949 --> 00:37:12.240
GLORIA STEINEM: Yeah, I do too.

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:15.120
I just think we have
to be conscious of it.

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.150
We have to make it happen.

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:20.820
I once read a whole
essay by a doctor

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:24.570
who was mourning
the stethoscope,

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:27.170
because he said, how
can you possibly know

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:29.220
what's going on in the
body of your patients

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:32.070
unless you put your
ear on their chest,

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:37.740
unless you feel the vibrations
of that person's body?

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:43.070
And look how far we are, way
further than the stethoscope.

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:47.400
So I just think we need
to be conscious of it.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.090
And while we're
doing it, also, we

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:52.210
need to think of ways to do it.

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:53.850
I mean in terms of employment.

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:55.530
That's the "it" I'm thinking of.

00:37:55.530 --> 00:38:06.460
So for instance, why not make
the status salary for the job

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:08.970
instead of for the person?

00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:12.030
Anybody who gets that
job, gets that salary.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:16.330
They may perform better
or less well along the way

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:19.950
and get fewer or more raises,
but at least at entry level,

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:23.220
or when they first
take that job,

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:28.770
you're not gonna have to
bargain and get somebody cheap.

00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:30.180
We could do that.

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:32.570
That's not rocket science.

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:35.100
And it would help enormously.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:39.890
And it would help the
economy, because right now,

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:43.320
the single biggest economic
stimulus would be equal

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.700
pay for women of all races.

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:51.100
I think it would put $400
billion, something huge.

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:52.459
And women are gonna spend it.

00:38:52.459 --> 00:38:54.500
They're not gonna put it
in a Swiss bank account.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.170
And then on top
of that, the kids

00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:59.600
who are most likely to
need government services

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:02.470
are most likely to be in
a female-headed household.

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:04.440
So you're gonna
reduce the demands

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.860
for government services.

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:07.080
I mean, it's a win-win.

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.885
We could do this.

00:39:09.885 --> 00:39:11.510
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
I'm gonna open it up

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:13.000
for questions in a minute.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.250
So please feel free
to stroll to the mic

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:18.355
as I pursue one
additional question.

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.130
So what's your advice?

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:25.660
There's a lot of amazing
women in this audience.

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:28.050
They are feeling empowered.

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:30.690
They work for a company that
highly values free speech.

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:34.550
We value them speaking
out, and taking initiative,

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:35.440
and having a voice.

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:37.850
What would you
recommend to them?

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:40.000
How could they most
make a difference

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.480
as women coming up the ranks?

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.510
GLORIA STEINEM: Actually,
my really deep advice is

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:46.310
don't listen to me.

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:47.970
Listen to yourself.

00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:53.730
Because you know what's
unfair, or what talent

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:56.593
you have that you're
unable to use.

00:39:56.593 --> 00:39:59.430
You know things I don't know.

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:05.024
So we're here to empower
each other, right?

00:40:05.024 --> 00:40:07.190
I mean, I sit around, of
course, and think of things

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:08.350
that Google could do.

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:10.710
I'll just say one,
because why not?

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:21.420
We've spent a huge amount of
time and effort explaining,

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:24.250
and we have convinced
the country,

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:29.020
we have shown the country,
that rape, sexual assault,

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:30.920
is not about sexuality.

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:33.220
It's about violence.

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:37.290
And actually, always
worry about saying

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:41.920
the rate of sexual assault,
say one in five women on campus

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:45.100
and so on, because it makes
it sound like one in five men

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:45.820
is a rapist.

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:48.780
No, in New York State, at
least, the average rapist

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:50.800
has raped 14 times.

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:55.110
I mean, it's men who
are hooked on it.

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:56.920
It's a superiority crime.

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:59.790
It's not about
sex, and most rapes

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:02.655
involve objects, not penises.

00:41:02.655 --> 00:41:05.220
So it's about domination.

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:08.040
They're hooked on the
drug of domination.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:13.350
OK, so we have demonstrated
that sexual assault and rape

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:15.700
are about violence, not sex.

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:20.660
We have not demonstrated that
pornography is not erotica.

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:24.120
Porne means female
slaves in Greek.

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:26.890
It's about domination and
violence, and the infliction

00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:30.090
of pain and control and so on.

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:34.040
Eros, erotica, means love.

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.635
It implies mutuality,
free choice.

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:43.050
And I don't think the
pornographers wouldn't

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:45.590
mind being listed as
part of pornography,

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:47.960
but I think the people
who are doing erotica

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:51.140
would love being
listed as erotic.

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:53.071
Could you do that?

00:41:53.071 --> 00:41:53.570
Hello?

00:41:59.765 --> 00:42:03.730
But just to recognize the
difference would be huge, huge.

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:08.000
Because what's literally
killing people now

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.270
is that pornography
is viewed as sex.

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:16.770
And kids are getting sex
education via pornography

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:21.470
online without understanding
that, wait a minute.

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:23.700
There is such a thing
as mutual pleasure.

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:27.307
It's not about roles
and domination.

00:42:27.307 --> 00:42:29.640
FEMALE SPEAKER: So it looks
like we have some questions.

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:34.366
AUDIENCE: With
the recent release

00:42:34.366 --> 00:42:36.700
of Ruth Bader
Ginsburg's biography,

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:38.940
I've been reading much
more about her career,

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:42.400
and hadn't realized that all
of the cases that she took

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:46.600
to the Supreme Court
when she was at the ACLU

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:50.270
were actually defending
men, about how

00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:52.780
gender inequality affected
men, in an attempt

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:56.220
to create incremental change.

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:58.920
And it's really sparked
a lot of interest

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:06.290
on my part about over time
how do we bring both genders

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:08.640
in order to create more change?

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.100
In fact, for all the
gentlemen who are here,

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:14.470
it's very gratifying to see
that there are gentleman here,

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:19.520
because sometimes at women's
talks around gender equality,

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:22.060
you actually only see women.

00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:27.690
Do you think that it's
still necessary to utilize

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:30.580
how gender inequality
affects men

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:33.090
in order to create that change?

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:37.420
And do you also think
that we could be or should

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:40.842
be doing a better job
bringing all genders along

00:43:40.842 --> 00:43:42.216
for these sorts
of conversations?

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.930
GLORIA STEINEM: Certainly men
have become way more active

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:52.715
in terms of asking
for parental leave.

00:43:52.715 --> 00:43:55.320
It's not maternity
leave anymore.

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:59.930
At least in most places,
it's parental leave,

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:04.810
which is clear in Europe as
well in terms of social policy.

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:10.870
And gender discrimination
obviously affects everybody.

00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:16.110
I mean, men may be in a prison
that has wall-to-wall carpeting

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:20.460
and people to serve you
coffee, but it's a prison,

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:26.160
because it's not the full
circle of human qualities.

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:30.580
It doesn't allow
men the full circle,

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:33.180
just as it doesn't allow
women the full circle.

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:39.490
And there are more and
more men in this world,

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:42.080
in this country-- look
at the public opinion

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.840
polls-- who understand that.

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:45.420
Gender punishes everybody.

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:48.200
It divides up human qualities.

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:52.950
It also, I have to say, causes
us to divide everything.

00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:55.209
The world is divided
into two kinds of people,

00:44:55.209 --> 00:44:57.750
those who divide the world into
two kinds of people and those

00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:00.080
who don't.

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:03.520
It's part of the reason we have
a press that thinks there's

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:04.891
two sides to every question.

00:45:04.891 --> 00:45:06.640
There are not two sides
to every question.

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:07.515
There's 6, 12, 17, 3.

00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:12.660
It depends on the question.

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:19.930
So the crazed idea of
gender punishes all about us

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:21.770
in a wide variety of ways.

00:45:24.567 --> 00:45:25.650
AUDIENCE: Thanks for this.

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:26.483
This has been great.

00:45:26.483 --> 00:45:28.520
So I was really
struck by the way

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:33.817
you revisit the past, and
your notion of history.

00:45:33.817 --> 00:45:35.400
But sometimes I
struggle, because when

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:38.592
I see some something
from the recent past,

00:45:38.592 --> 00:45:40.050
it kind of feels
like brainwashing,

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:42.510
which is another part that
you mentioned as well.

00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:44.450
So could you talk a
little bit about how

00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:46.850
to progressively
revisit the past,

00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:49.350
or revisit it in a
thoughtful way that

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:51.670
doesn't continue brainwashing?

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:55.010
GLORIA STEINEM: I think
that we have approached

00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:59.800
that by having what I think
of as remedial history

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.310
of the recent past.

00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:05.010
So we have African-American
women's history,

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:08.270
gay and lesbian history,
Asian-American history,

00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:12.040
Native American--
this is all remedial.

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:15.640
We're nowhere near
human history.

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:20.490
And we haven't really a done
the thing we need to do,

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:23.400
which is to start
when people started.

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.820
We don't.

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:28.250
At least, I mean
did anybody here

00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:30.490
study history that started
when people started,

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:32.710
100,000 years ago?

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:35.360
I certainly didn't.

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:38.490
And if we had, we
would have seen

00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:43.650
that for 90% of human
history or more,

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:52.580
there was a very, very different
idea of-- the paradigm was

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:53.390
the circle.

00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:54.890
There weren't straight lines.

00:46:57.510 --> 00:47:01.720
Have you ever flown
out of a city or town

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:05.210
in Africa in a little plane, and
then you get into the Kalahari,

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:07.285
you get into some big territory?

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:14.435
All the straight lines go,
and everything is curved.

00:47:14.435 --> 00:47:19.810
The people plow
around a tree, or plow

00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:24.600
in circles or curves, which
is way better for erosion.

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:27.210
The straight line is
just about possession.

00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:29.240
It's not inevitable.

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:32.490
I mean, there's just so
much that we're not seeing.

00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:37.380
A friend of mine is
writing a book called,

00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:39.650
"Everything We Want
Once Was Here,"

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:42.510
and I think that will help us.

00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:44.010
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
here's a question

00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:47.350
from our Dory so people that are
tuning in via the live stream

00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:49.000
that couldn't it in person.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.480
And I think it's related
to the first question that

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:56.390
was asked, perhaps with
an action item component.

00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:59.730
So the question is, "I
still find resistance

00:47:59.730 --> 00:48:01.660
from seemingly
educated and support

00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:05.640
of men around the concept
of feminism and equality.

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:08.710
What, as empowered women, can
we do in our everyday lives

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:11.290
to encourage male
peers to embrace

00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:14.364
feminism and the movement
for gender equality?

00:48:14.364 --> 00:48:15.280
GLORIA STEINEM: Leave.

00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:18.550
I don't know.

00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:21.100
Do whatever you
think is necessary.

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:24.620
Talk, leave, explain.

00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:28.660
Maybe this person has been
discriminated against himself,

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:33.470
because of race, or
ethnicity, or religion,

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:39.100
and if you hook it to that,
will begin to understand.

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:42.220
Whatever it is, try it.

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:45.460
But it's not your job, either.

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:48.390
So if you can't do it,
just leave and find

00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:49.762
some place where you can do it.

00:48:49.762 --> 00:48:51.220
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
love that concept

00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:52.800
of finding common ground.

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:56.500
I think so many people-- they're
such good evidence that when

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:59.130
people have to go to
the root of an issue

00:48:59.130 --> 00:49:03.090
and explore it together, it's
amazing how most people will

00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:06.355
find that those issues-- I think
it's one of the reasons why

00:49:06.355 --> 00:49:07.730
so many people in
our own company

00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:10.063
have been excited about things
like YouTube, which allow

00:49:10.063 --> 00:49:12.910
everyone to have a voice, and
so many people that have felt

00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:15.260
discriminated against or
bullied or whatever it is,

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:17.270
to be able to
express themselves,

00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:19.400
and miraculously there
are millions and millions

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:23.260
of people who want to share in
that conversation with them.

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:25.536
Or that our work
on virtual reality,

00:49:25.536 --> 00:49:26.910
where there's such
great evidence

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:30.830
that when we go to
the halls of power,

00:49:30.830 --> 00:49:34.260
in the UN or other places, and
we allow people to really go

00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:37.810
and see what it feels like
to be that Syrian refugee,

00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:40.590
and then they have to
make that policy decision,

00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:43.744
they actually feel very, very,
very different about what

00:49:43.744 --> 00:49:46.160
they're doing, because they've
been able to put themselves

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.100
in the humanity of the other.

00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:50.330
And I think so
often as individuals

00:49:50.330 --> 00:49:53.780
we forget that everyone has
their own reference point.

00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:57.009
And maybe, to your point,
that man felt at some point,

00:49:57.009 --> 00:49:58.550
per the first
question, discriminated

00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:00.940
against themselves,
and therefore they're

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:03.460
struggling to really understand
that they maybe taking

00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:06.289
that common ground, I think,
often works incredibly well.

00:50:06.289 --> 00:50:07.830
GLORIA STEINEM:
Yeah, there's nothing

00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:09.420
more important than empathy.

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:11.570
Maybe kindness, just
general kindness,

00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:16.190
is even more important, but
then definitely comes empathy.

00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:20.160
But I do think we have to
understand how powerful

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:22.780
the way we were raised is.

00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:27.340
And if, as the
early cultures say,

00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:31.670
it takes four generations
to heal one act of violence,

00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:34.340
and if somebody has
really been raised

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:42.000
feeling that his or her identity
depends on being dominant

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.770
or being obedient, it may not
be possible in one generation.

00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:49.265
I mean, we change by increments.

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:57.220
So trust your instinct
about how much

00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:01.785
you can do to make change in
that particular situation.

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:05.550
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:05.550 --> 00:51:06.715
My name is Susanna.

00:51:06.715 --> 00:51:08.530
It's so nice to be
here with everyone,

00:51:08.530 --> 00:51:10.979
and to ask you this question.

00:51:10.979 --> 00:51:13.270
One of the things that I
really admired about your work

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:15.750
is your recognition that
feminism incorporates

00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:18.700
so many other different
issues other than just gender

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:21.693
equity, for example,
systemic racism and so many

00:51:21.693 --> 00:51:23.510
of the other issues
that you've discussed

00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:25.270
in developing countries.

00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:27.930
And you mentioned earlier
about having a consciousness,

00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:31.040
and having conversations
about your own feminism.

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:33.000
And for so many of
us, feminism includes

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.180
topics like systemic racism,
like immigration laws

00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:39.967
that are not the best.

00:51:39.967 --> 00:51:41.550
But sometimes, our
work here at Google

00:51:41.550 --> 00:51:44.770
doesn't incorporate those
elements of our consciousness

00:51:44.770 --> 00:51:46.150
in our day-today day lives.

00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:48.569
So especially with
election coming up,

00:51:48.569 --> 00:51:51.110
what do you think we can do to
bring our consciousness either

00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:53.900
into the workplace, or to carry
our experience here at Google

00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:56.441
out into the workplace, and to
make the change that we really

00:51:56.441 --> 00:51:58.719
wanna see?

00:51:58.719 --> 00:52:00.760
GLORIA STEINEM: I think
they're not other issues.

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:03.385
I think they're all the same
issue, if you know what I mean?

00:52:03.385 --> 00:52:04.920
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:10.150
GLORIA STEINEM: So I think
we need to behave that way,

00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:17.800
and we need to beware, because
I hope we don't get back

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:23.630
into another situation like
the Obama-Clinton race,

00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:27.040
when reporters were asking
questions like, which

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:30.450
is more important, sex or race?

00:52:30.450 --> 00:52:33.549
I mean, that's an
unacceptable question.

00:52:33.549 --> 00:52:34.215
It's ridiculous.

00:52:37.110 --> 00:52:44.270
So I hope that we can keep
our connections clear.

00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:48.050
And that means we need
to approach it that way.

00:52:54.310 --> 00:52:56.995
If we'd been invisible, we need
to name ourselves, and emerge,

00:52:56.995 --> 00:52:58.420
and do all of that.

00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:02.110
But we're way past the
stage where movement

00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:05.090
should be in silos like this.

00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:06.625
Movements are all connected.

00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:12.270
The press is not
yet-- I don't mean

00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:13.900
to overgeneralize
about the media,

00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:17.720
but there's still
putting people in silos.

00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:20.640
So we have to be
very aware of that.

00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:25.050
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:28.540
So thank you so
much for being here.

00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:31.640
I am definitely a feminist.

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:34.580
I wanna see more
female managers.

00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:40.440
That said, in my career, I
have encountered many deeply

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:42.540
stereotypical female managers.

00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:46.510
So I find myself taking this
uncomfortably sexist position,

00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:50.110
where I'm not willing
to work in a job

00:53:50.110 --> 00:53:52.540
where I would have
a female manager.

00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:55.380
So I'm wondering if you
can help us understand

00:53:55.380 --> 00:54:00.280
what we can do as employees to
work with our female managers

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:02.800
to help them overcome
what's happening,

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:06.650
but also if you've
seen counterproductive

00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:08.710
characteristics in
female managers,

00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:12.380
and just how we as a
culture can overcome that.

00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:12.880
Thank you.

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:15.213
GLORIA STEINEM: Well, we're
back to Carly Fiorina again.

00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:17.870
Yeah, sure.

00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:18.882
It's not about biology.

00:54:18.882 --> 00:54:19.923
It's about consciousness.

00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:27.020
So clearly there are
people who look like you

00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:30.100
and behave like them.

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:32.900
You're less likely to find
them in political life

00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:36.170
than anywhere else, because
they had to get elected.

00:54:36.170 --> 00:54:41.770
And so usually, they had to have
their constituency behind them.

00:54:41.770 --> 00:54:45.330
You may find them
in corporate life,

00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:48.170
because they're
likely to be promoted,

00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:52.400
because the people promoting
them maybe unconsciously

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:57.390
understand that they're
gonna keep their group down.

00:54:57.390 --> 00:55:01.920
So it's not uncommon
to find a queen bee,

00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:07.290
as they say, in a
corporate situation.

00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:11.080
And I think you just have to
behave the way you would want

00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:13.320
somebody to behave toward you.

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:18.790
First, talk to her, and
be as open as you can,

00:55:18.790 --> 00:55:23.340
and explain the problem, and
hope that maybe that will work.

00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:29.010
And if it doesn't work, then
proceed accordingly, and tell

00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:31.100
other people, organize.

00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:34.765
It's very demoralizing to have
somebody who looks like you

00:55:34.765 --> 00:55:37.770
and behaves like them,
but it's inevitable,

00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:41.390
because we internalize the
power structure around us.

00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:43.230
There will always
be some of that.

00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:44.670
Not always.

00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:47.664
At the moment, there
will be some of that.

00:55:47.664 --> 00:55:50.205
FEMALE SPEAKER: Were there any
other questions from the Dory?

00:55:52.232 --> 00:55:54.440
FEMALE SPEAKER: There was
one question I remember off

00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:55.231
the top of my head.

00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:00.340
As you look back on your
life, was there one moment

00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:02.770
that you are most proud of?

00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:05.150
And if it hasn't happened
yet, is there something

00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:08.250
that you wanna put your stamp on
that you will be the most proud

00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:10.444
of?

00:56:10.444 --> 00:56:11.860
GLORIA STEINEM:
Yes, I'm at an age

00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:13.600
now where people ask
me things like that.

00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:15.420
What are you the most proud of?

00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:18.260
And I always say I
haven't done it yet.

00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:21.020
And a reporter said to me
the other day, in this life,

00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:23.560
he said?

00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:26.610
But i live in the future.

00:56:26.610 --> 00:56:30.787
I think maybe we acquire a habit
of mind when we're children.

00:56:30.787 --> 00:56:32.370
I don't know, but
because I was always

00:56:32.370 --> 00:56:37.190
trying to get out as a child,
I still live in the future.

00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:39.060
So I definitely
haven't done it yet.

00:56:42.610 --> 00:56:47.620
And I don't know that I can
think of one accomplishment.

00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:50.680
I guess I would just
want people to think

00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:59.520
that I left the world around me
a little kinder, and more just,

00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:04.520
and more equal than it
was when I got here--

00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:06.040
something like that.

00:57:10.234 --> 00:57:13.410
Does anybody here wanna try
to answer this question?

00:57:13.410 --> 00:57:15.129
Do you wanna try to
answer this question?

00:57:15.129 --> 00:57:17.170
FEMALE SPEAKER: No, but
what this is interesting,

00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:21.030
if you think of what's behind
it, just listening to you even

00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:24.720
over time, like, I remember
hearing you speak 10 years ago

00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:26.600
even versus now.

00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:31.150
The one thing I would
say is you've really

00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:35.810
put everything in perspective,
I think, as you've gone along.

00:57:35.810 --> 00:57:39.270
And what I love is that
ability and that humility

00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:42.280
of understanding how big
these problems really are,

00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:43.700
and how systemic they are.

00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:45.970
And so you do, to your
point, have to look back,

00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:48.462
but you also have
to look forward.

00:57:48.462 --> 00:57:49.170
But I don't know.

00:57:49.170 --> 00:57:50.580
I can say that,
I, for one, would

00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:52.770
be a person who would
say you've definitely

00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:54.460
left the world a
better place than you

00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:58.100
found it, and definitely
more just than when we all

00:57:58.100 --> 00:57:58.932
got started.

00:57:58.932 --> 00:58:00.390
GLORIA STEINEM:
Well, what's fun is

00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:03.420
to just change
whatever comes at you,

00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:06.050
and to figure out how you
can creatively change it.

00:58:06.050 --> 00:58:08.520
Like, at my age now,
people are always saying,

00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:11.750
who are you passing
the torch to, right?

00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:13.500
So I always say, wait a minute.

00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:16.690
I'm not giving up my
torch, thank you very much.

00:58:16.690 --> 00:58:18.070
I'm keeping my torch.

00:58:18.070 --> 00:58:22.540
And I am using it to
light other torches.

00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:24.430
Because the whole
idea that there's one

00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:26.140
torch is total bullshit.

00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:28.110
No wonder we don't
know where we're going.

00:58:28.110 --> 00:58:31.520
Everybody needs a torch.

00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:34.455
FEMALE SPEAKER: Anyone here
willing to carry a torch?

00:58:34.455 --> 00:58:35.830
GLORIA STEINEM:
But it's fun just

00:58:35.830 --> 00:58:40.210
to transform images like that,
which are hierarchical images.

00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:42.590
There's one person
with the torch?

00:58:42.590 --> 00:58:44.880
No wonder we're in such
deep shit, you know?

00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:47.870
Nobody knows.

00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:50.040
And it's fun to do that.

00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:57.020
And also, it's fun
to value what is--

00:58:57.020 --> 00:59:00.840
Alice Walker has a wonderful
poem that in something like,

00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:02.460
and this shall be
our revolution.

00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:06.950
We shall value what is plentiful
more than what is rare.

00:59:13.050 --> 00:59:15.620
So in a hierarchical kind
of structure like this,

00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:18.780
you're not supposed to
value laughter or joy.

00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:26.740
And the reason why is because
it happens that laughter

00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:29.710
is the only free emotion.

00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:33.320
You can compel fear, we know.

00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:37.620
You can even compel love if
you're isolated and dependent

00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:38.640
for long enough.

00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:41.670
But you can't compel laughter.

00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:45.370
It happens when two things
come together and make a third.

00:59:45.370 --> 00:59:47.520
It happens when
you have an idea.

00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:49.165
It's like an orgasm of the mind.

00:59:52.090 --> 00:59:54.900
And in original
cultures, especially

00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:58.777
at least in Native American
cultures, there is a figure.

00:59:58.777 --> 01:00:00.110
I've forgotten what he's called.

01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:01.720
Maybe somebody here remembers.

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:04.180
It's a he or a she, naturally.

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:06.815
And it's not a jester,
but it's a word like it.

01:00:06.815 --> 01:00:07.540
It's trickster.

01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:08.331
It's the trickster.

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:16.000
it isn't about making a
king laugh, like a jester.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.930
It's about laughter itself.

01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:22.260
And the idea is that laughter
breaks into the unknown,

01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:24.130
from the known to the
unknown, and you can't

01:00:24.130 --> 01:00:26.674
pray unless you can laugh.

01:00:26.674 --> 01:00:28.340
All right, that's a
pretty good measure.

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:31.420
Don't go any place where
they won't let you laugh.

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:34.930
You know that you're
being imprisoned.

01:00:34.930 --> 01:00:38.860
And it's why
monotheistic, patriarchal,

01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:41.740
hierarchical religions
don't let you laugh.

01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:45.650
Whereas the ancient
religions let you laugh.

01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:47.250
It was quite OK.

01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:51.110
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm getting
the "it's time" sign.

01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:53.640
Because I know everyone has
an incredibly busy schedule,

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:59.110
including Gloria, who's been
so gracious with her time

01:00:59.110 --> 01:01:00.100
in coming here today.

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:01.900
She's got an incredibly
busy schedule

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:02.910
for the rest of the day.

01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:05.670
I cannot tell you how much
it means to everyone that

01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:09.630
you're here, especially
to me, personally.

01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:12.370
And I had to end with
a quote from your book,

01:01:12.370 --> 01:01:14.680
because it ties to what we
were just talking about.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:18.300
"We have to behave as if
everything we do matters,

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.880
because sometimes it does."

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:24.962
Thank you for doing so much that
matters, and congratulations

01:01:24.962 --> 01:01:25.670
on your new book.

01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:28.420
[APPLAUSE]
