00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.029
If you followed the previous step,

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:06.700
you saw that text like this
can turn into text like this.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.340
And even though you don't
know how this happened,

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.840
you probably can guess that these tags
here had something to do with it.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.270
Somehow the computer was interpreting
those things differently

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.570
than how a person would.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.910
And that is a huge idea.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.590
Because before this experience
you probably didn't even

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.820
know what you didn't know
about making web pages.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.630
And now, even though you don't really
know how to talk to a computer,

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.720
you may have some understanding of
what talking to a computer even means.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.310
You're beginning to know,
what you don't know.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.170
And may even have a basic intuition for
what coding even is.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.220
Because coding a computer,
is just telling a computer

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.540
what you want it to do, by writing text,
in a way it can understand.
