00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.450
But what if you want to actually know
what's going on inside human brains?

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.720
And presuming, presuming these
are people you actually like.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.010
So how would you measure what's
going on in their brain?

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.680
Well, you're not going to stick
electrodes in their brain.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.580
What you're going to do
is something called fMRI.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.680
Okay, or
a functional magnetic resonance imaging.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.360
So many of you probably have had an MRI,
or

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.700
an MRI uses strong magnetic fields to
sort of mess around with electrons in

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.580
order to be able to get
differential density measurements.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.040
Well, you can do something cool also.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.890
You can use a dye contrast that
the magnetic fields perturb

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.040
differently depending upon how much
oxygen is in that part of the the blood.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.940
So, just like we did before with that
experiment with the monkeys where you

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.090
injected, sort of, that radioactive
isotope connect the oxygen.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.580
Now what we can do is we can have you
have die contrast, go into an fMRI,

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.320
have you look at things, and see what
parts of your brain are lighting up.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.020
All right?

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.000
So here's an example, sort of
notionally of an fMRI activation, so

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.370
this is of course obviously a
reconstruction based on the density, and

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.110
here you can see the activity
that's being done.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.290
This is a three dimensional
reconstruction.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.440
This is what a slice would
actually look like, right?

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.910
This is a single activation slice.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.830
And these colors are different levels
of activation compared against a,

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.800
a background activation.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.490
So one of the areas that people were
studying a lot, and arguing about was,

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.480
was there a part of the brain that
seemed very responsive to faces, okay?

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.970
And it's called the fusiform face area,
and

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.940
it's a little bit controversial
as to whether, or

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.150
not something really responds to just
faces, or other sorts of patterns.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.190
This is a paper recently 2004, actually
Nancy Kanwisher, last author there,

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.650
was a graduate student,
when I was, same department, and

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.660
she does great work on
understanding physiology.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.260
And, and these, this paper's one of the,
well known papers, Grill-Spector et al.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.130
And they're just focusing on this area,
this FAA, fusiform face area,

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.230
in terms of understanding
where faces light things up.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.430
One of the reasons for looking at faces
is that there's been a long history of

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.140
sort of faces being special in,
in human vision.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.030
So there's examples that very,
very early on in an infant's life

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.810
they have a preference, and they do
test called preferential looking,

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.840
if you put something up does
the infant tend to look this way, okay?

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.280
So the, the,
the experimenter holds something.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.820
The experimenter doesn't know whether
it's a picture of actually a face,

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.730
something blank like this, or something
that has the face pieces on it.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.020
All the experimenter does is he,
he or she holds something up, and

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.400
he just says, yep,
I think he looked this way.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.440
Yep.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.460
Nope.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.930
And the question is do you
tend to get the looking more

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.720
when you actually put
up a picture of face?

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.010
And the answer is,
says here er, early minute,

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.026
very early in life there seems
to be a preference for faces.

00:02:56.026 --> 00:02:59.226
Likewise there were responses
of various other things,

00:02:59.226 --> 00:03:03.898
responding to, this is a cell recording,
that when shown faces, responds, and

00:03:03.898 --> 00:03:08.400
when shown these other things,
fruits, hands, et cetera, don't.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.880
Likewise, there are measurements
using this fMRI

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.730
of areas that respond to faces.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.920
And so, this is another paper,

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.990
another picture from that same
paper I showed you before.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.340
And you'll see here that
they've got different

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.010
object types that they're showing,
and the idea is that different parts.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.690
See, so you see this area here that
lights up really well with faces,

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.180
and doesn't here, here,
here, here, or there?

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.260
And the idea is that these
are other objects that,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.540
sort of, took the same,
amount of location, and intensity, and

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.860
et cetera, but
only lit up when the faces were there.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.560
So it was an example of understanding
a part of the brain doing a particular

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.150
process.
