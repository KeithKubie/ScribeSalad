00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.010
Hey you, yes you!

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.330
Do you know you can speak in another language?

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.690
The universal language of touch.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.130
Hey everyone - Julia here for DNews.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.070
Humans are social animals.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.339
We thrive best when we can communicate with
others effectively.

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:24.169
One of the most underrated tools in our talking
toolkit, non-verbal communication, particularly

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:25.169
touching.

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.769
Whether it’s a slap on the butt in the locker
room, a hug from a friend, or flirtatious

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.920
touch on the arm we say a lot without uttering
a word.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.410
Psychologist Matthew Hertenstein from DePauw
University asked participants to judge the

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.710
emotion from a stranger that they couldn’t
see, but they could touch.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.600
Participants correctly identified emotions
like, anger, disgust, happiness and others

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.760
75% of the time!

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.020
But what is it about touch that means so much?

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.250
Let’s start where touch begins, in our nerves.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.090
Feelings of touch originate from nerve fibers
in our skin.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.860
There’s two kinds of nerves, fast and slow.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.920
Slow nerve fibers send signals to the insular
cortex which also processes taste, pain, and

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.920
emotion.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.380
These unmyelinated fibers convey sensations
like deep pain, temperature and pleasant touch.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.450
These nerve cells called C tactile (CT) afferents,
stir up emotions from a single touch.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.749
They’re found only in our “hairy” skin
like thighs and forearms.

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:18.479
Scientists know that animals like cats and
dogs have these nerves but for a long time

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.390
thought we lost them when we lost a lot of
our body hair.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.109
However, researcher Francis Mcglone, thinks
these cells developed huge importance for

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:26.619
grooming behaviors.

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.709
So touch is important and feels nice, but
why?

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:32.869
Touch triggers the release of oxytocin, a
feel good, bonding hormone.

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.740
not only does it bond, but it relaxes us too.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.040
Couples who hug each other regularly have
more oxytocin in their blood and report feeling

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.040
less stressed.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.600
Certain kinds of touch signal cooperation
and trust.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.810
A reassuring hand of the forearm or shoulder
for example.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.450
The pressure on pressure sensors in your skin
called Pacinian corpuscles, stimulates a part

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.100
of your brain called the vagus nerve which
relaxes you by slowing your heart down and

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.619
decreasing blood pressure.

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.689
Maternal touching has been shown to be hugely
important to development and bonding.

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.729
In the infamous Rhesus monkeys study of the
50s, researchers replaced monkey moms with

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.729
dummys.

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.780
One dummy was made with wire but had a bottle,
the other was made with terry cloth but had

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.780
no bottle.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.430
The monkeys above and beyond prefered the
“contact comfort” provide by the terry

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.500
cloth mom.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.890
The monkeys would literally starve, because
they choose the safety and “warmth” of

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.060
their “mother” over the wire dummy with
food.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.550
While you could never do a study like that
with humans, there have been studies shown

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.120
that babies born prematurely do better when
held by their parents for a few hours a day

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.040
than those just keep in an incubator.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.440
Other studies show that babies held awkwardly
or reluctantly had less attachment than those

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.730
who were held in a more nurturing way.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.450
Babies held securely and frequently showed
superior cognitive development up to 8 years

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.450
later.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.480
Touching increases not just strong mother-and-child
bonds, but even weaker social bonds.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.200
Teammates who support each other through high
fives or slaps on the back create better teams,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.420
even factoring for things like salary and
performance.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.980
Another example, if a waiter lightly touches
your arm or shoulder, you’re more likely

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.390
to give them a higher tip.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.320
These of course are all socially acceptable
situations.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.520
Inappropriate touching from creepers is a
whole different ball game and perhaps the

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.920
topic of a different episode in the future.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.620
