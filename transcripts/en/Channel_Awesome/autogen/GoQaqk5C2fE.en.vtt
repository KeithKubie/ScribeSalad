00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
that and then they don't
 

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
that and then they don't
definitely<00:09:23.380><c> not</c><00:09:23.500><c> swamp</c><00:09:23.830><c> princes</c><00:09:24.220><c> what</c><00:09:24.400><c> work</c>

was<00:09:24.970><c> we're</c><00:09:25.240><c> back</c><00:09:25.450><c> at</c><00:09:25.870><c> WV</c><00:09:26.470><c> not</c><00:09:27.460><c> I</c><00:09:27.730><c> don't</c><00:09:28.420><c> think</c>

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
was we're back at WV not I don't think
 

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
was we're back at WV not I don't think
so<00:09:28.900><c> I</c><00:09:29.230><c> could</c><00:09:29.740><c> be</c><00:09:29.860><c> wrong</c><00:09:30.040><c> it</c><00:09:30.370><c> doesn't</c><00:09:30.910><c> look</c><00:09:31.180><c> like</c>

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:31.210 align:start position:0%
so I could be wrong it doesn't look like
 

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
so I could be wrong it doesn't look like
we're<00:09:31.510><c> mates</c><00:09:31.690><c> maybe</c><00:09:31.960><c> that's</c><00:09:32.440><c> an</c><00:09:32.620><c> animation</c>

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:33.070 align:start position:0%
we're mates maybe that's an animation
 

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:34.740 align:start position:0%
we're mates maybe that's an animation
actually<00:09:33.760><c> train</c><00:09:33.970><c> um</c>

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:34.750 align:start position:0%
actually train um
 

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
actually train um
I'm<00:09:34.990><c> not</c><00:09:35.140><c> just</c><00:09:35.290><c> talking</c><00:09:35.500><c> with</c><00:09:35.560><c> the</c><00:09:35.650><c> animation</c>

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:36.070 align:start position:0%
I'm not just talking with the animation
 

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not just talking with the animation
but<00:09:36.190><c> like</c><00:09:36.340><c> that</c><00:09:36.550><c> the</c><00:09:36.670><c> problem</c><00:09:36.970><c> is</c><00:09:37.030><c> most</c>

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:37.210 align:start position:0%
but like that the problem is most
 

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:40.530 align:start position:0%
but like that the problem is most
animations<00:09:38.050><c> I</c><00:09:38.140><c> need</c><00:09:38.440><c> a</c><00:09:38.530><c> plot</c><00:09:38.830><c> that</c><00:09:39.460><c> we're</c><00:09:40.360><c> back</c>

I<00:09:40.690><c> forget</c><00:09:40.960><c> I'm</c><00:09:41.320><c> trying</c><00:09:41.590><c> to</c><00:09:41.650><c> think</c><00:09:41.770><c> of</c><00:09:41.830><c> all</c><00:09:41.920><c> the</c>

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.010 align:start position:0%
I forget I'm trying to think of all the
 

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
I forget I'm trying to think of all the
ones<00:09:42.160><c> in</c><00:09:42.250><c> the</c><00:09:42.340><c> year</c><00:09:42.550><c> that</c><00:09:42.760><c> were</c><00:09:42.940><c> so</c><00:09:43.270><c> you</c><00:09:43.330><c> would</c>

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:43.450 align:start position:0%
ones in the year that were so you would
 

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
ones in the year that were so you would
need<00:09:43.600><c> to</c><00:09:43.720><c> get</c><00:09:43.840><c> are</c><00:09:43.960><c> five</c><00:09:44.140><c> but</c><00:09:44.350><c> yeah</c><00:09:44.590><c> um</c><00:09:44.890><c> but</c>

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:45.430 align:start position:0%
need to get are five but yeah um but
 

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:47.610 align:start position:0%
need to get are five but yeah um but
yeah<00:09:45.970><c> I</c><00:09:46.000><c> think</c><00:09:46.390><c> this</c><00:09:46.660><c> would</c><00:09:46.810><c> be</c><00:09:46.840><c> it</c><00:09:47.140><c> we</c><00:09:47.320><c> can't</c>

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:47.620 align:start position:0%
yeah I think this would be it we can't
 

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:52.230 align:start position:0%
yeah I think this would be it we can't
think<00:09:47.920><c> of</c><00:09:48.070><c> them</c><00:09:48.220><c> yeah</c><00:09:49.120><c> um</c><00:09:50.100><c> yeah</c><00:09:51.100><c> but</c><00:09:51.550><c> uh</c><00:09:51.580><c> but</c>

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
think of them yeah um yeah but uh but
 

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
think of them yeah um yeah but uh but
yeah<00:09:52.540><c> and</c><00:09:52.720><c> this</c><00:09:52.840><c> was</c><00:09:53.020><c> one</c><00:09:53.200><c> of</c><00:09:53.260><c> those</c><00:09:53.350><c> I</c><00:09:53.500><c> think</c>

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:53.530 align:start position:0%
yeah and this was one of those I think
 

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.730 align:start position:0%
yeah and this was one of those I think
was<00:09:53.830><c> pushed</c><00:09:54.510><c> relatively</c><00:09:55.510><c> hard</c><00:09:55.840><c> back</c><00:09:56.200><c> then</c><00:09:56.500><c> in</c>

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:56.740 align:start position:0%
was pushed relatively hard back then in
 

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:58.170 align:start position:0%
was pushed relatively hard back then in
terms<00:09:56.920><c> of</c><00:09:57.130><c> like</c><00:09:57.310><c> that</c><00:09:57.490><c> it</c><00:09:57.610><c> was</c><00:09:57.730><c> in</c><00:09:57.910><c> light</c><00:09:58.150><c> I</c>

00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:58.180 align:start position:0%
terms of like that it was in light I
 

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
terms of like that it was in light I
think<00:09:58.480><c> there's</c><00:09:58.600><c> like</c><00:09:58.690><c> a</c><00:09:58.750><c> Wendy's</c><00:09:59.290><c> Happy</c><00:09:59.950><c> Meal</c>

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:00.130 align:start position:0%

and even with this one I'd argue like
 

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.700 align:start position:0%
and even with this one I'd argue like
there's<00:11:31.760><c> ideas</c><00:11:32.630><c> for</c><00:11:32.900><c> good</c><00:11:33.050><c> elements</c><00:11:33.470><c> in</c><00:11:33.560><c> there</c>

know<00:11:41.540><c> again</c><00:11:41.990><c> I</c><00:11:42.170><c> think</c><00:11:42.260><c> that's</c><00:11:42.560><c> a</c><00:11:42.800><c> whole</c>

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:43.010 align:start position:0%

everything<00:21:46.070><c> to</c><00:21:46.220><c> it</c><00:21:46.370><c> it</c><00:21:46.460><c> feels</c><00:21:46.670><c> like</c><00:21:47.000><c> um</c><00:21:47.620><c> but</c>

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:48.620 align:start position:0%
everything to it it feels like um but
 

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.050 align:start position:0%
everything to it it feels like um but
turns<00:21:48.830><c> out</c><00:21:48.980><c> was</c><00:21:49.130><c> that</c><00:21:49.250><c> greater</c><00:21:49.460><c> moving</c><00:21:49.790><c> yeah</c>

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:50.060 align:start position:0%
turns out was that greater moving yeah
 

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.460 align:start position:0%
turns out was that greater moving yeah
so<00:21:50.270><c> I</c><00:21:50.300><c> mean</c><00:21:50.510><c> it</c><00:21:50.630><c> doesn't</c><00:21:50.780><c> that</c><00:21:51.080><c> makes</c><00:21:51.230><c> a</c><00:21:51.320><c> huge</c>

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:51.470 align:start position:0%
so I mean it doesn't that makes a huge
 

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:54.520 align:start position:0%
so I mean it doesn't that makes a huge
difference<00:21:51.530><c> but</c><00:21:51.920><c> still</c><00:21:52.010><c> uh</c><00:21:52.400><c> so</c><00:21:53.360><c> yeah</c><00:21:54.080><c> I</c><00:21:54.320><c> think</c>

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:54.530 align:start position:0%
difference but still uh so yeah I think
 

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
difference but still uh so yeah I think
