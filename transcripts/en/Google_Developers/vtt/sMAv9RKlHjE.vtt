LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to the Googleplex.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.820
Before I worked here,
I always wondered

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.120
what it'd be like to
come to the Googleplex,

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.650
meet up with a Googler,
and have coffee with them

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.040
and just chat about what
they do, how they do it,

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.104
and why they do it.

00:00:13.104 --> 00:00:15.395
Today, we're going to be
talking with Francis Ma, who's

00:00:15.395 --> 00:00:17.210
a product manager
on the Android team.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.810
And he's going to tell us all
about how you can build better

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.690
apps using Google Play services.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:23.761
Francis, welcome.

00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:24.885
It's good to have you here.

00:00:24.885 --> 00:00:26.020
FRANCIS MA: Thanks, Laurence.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.550
Nice to be here.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.640
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So one of the things

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.710
that, when we started
prepping for this episode

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.970
and we started saying, hey,
we're going to Francis Ma on,

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.160
every time I talked to a
Googler they were all like,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.360
oh, you're going
to have Francis on!

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.990
I worked with him on this
and I worked with him

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.320
on that-- it seems like
you've been around the block.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.945
Tell us about yourself
and what you do.

00:00:41.945 --> 00:00:44.280
FRANCIS MA: So I've been working
at Google for a couple years

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.780
now.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.980
And I've been fortunate enough
to work on different products.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.850
Most recently, before
joining Android,

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.532
I was on the Google+ team
working on our social efforts.

00:00:54.532 --> 00:00:55.490
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.781
So it sounds like a lot of fun.

00:00:56.781 --> 00:00:58.050
FRANCIS MA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.350
It's just great.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.850
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Today, now, you're

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.627
working on Google Play
services as part of your task.

00:01:04.627 --> 00:01:06.210
Now what is this
Google Play services?

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.050
What does it do?

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.200
What's so cool about it?

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.370
FRANCIS MA: Google Play
services is a unified SDK

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.480
that we offer to Android
developers as a way for them

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.800
to integrate with Google
services and Google APIs.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.180
LAURENCE MORONEY: So you say
it's a unified way that they

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.638
can access these
services and APIs.

00:01:22.638 --> 00:01:24.350
How is it unified?

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.990
FRANCIS MA: So the idea
is that, as a developer,

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.400
you can get one SDK, which is
the Google Play services SDK,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.900
and through that, you'll have
access to the various Google

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.670
platform APIs that we offer
from things like ads, analytics,

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.350
Google Wallet, et cetera.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.060
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
the design pattern

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.830
that I follow when
I'm coding-- something

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.550
for Maps and for
Wallets and for Ads--

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.330
it's going to be the
same because of this?

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.170
FRANCIS MA:
Absolutely, and that's

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.730
one of the ideas behind
Google Play services

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.650
when we started, was
we wanted to offer

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.120
a consistent experience
for Android developers

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.650
to be able to integrate
with various features

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.600
and functionalities
that Google offers.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.710
So for example, if you
integrated with Google Maps

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.639
and then later on you choose
to integrate with Google

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:13.870
Analytics, the same
paradigm and the model of it

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.280
is very consistent so
that the learning curve,

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.350
you don't have to relearn
something entirely different.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.279
And it's very convenient for
you to add more into your app.

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:23.820
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's really cool.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.070
So if I learn the methodology to
build Maps into my application,

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.900
that methodology's
going to transfer over

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.710
to-- I don't know
if I use location

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.380
or-- that's really, really cool.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.270
I like it.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.540
But you used a couple
of words there that kind

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.840
of sprung up in my mind,
like developer experience.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.790
And developer
experience I know is

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.559
something that's very
important in Google.

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:45.100
And it's something that you're
particularly passionate about.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.641
Can you tell us a
little bit about it

00:02:46.641 --> 00:02:48.380
and what you're
doing in that space?

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.080
FRANCIS MA: When we
look at building an API,

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.830
we really look at
it as a product.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.590
And an analogy of that, if
you were using a consumer app,

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.960
we would look at the
visual design of it,

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.110
the user experience of it.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.199
What is it like to pick up
the app, install the app?

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.240
What's the [? onboard ?]
[? inflow, ?] et cetera?

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.790
Now you look at,
for developers, it's

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.810
not just about the API design,
but about the life cycle

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.050
of how developers
discover that API.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.450
How do they learn about it?

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.670
How do you integrate it?

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.230
And how are you able to build
a successful app on top of it?

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.820
And so when we talk about
developer experience,

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.490
we really want to
think about end

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.780
to end such that we can
offer a delightful experience

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.410
for developers, to make it
easy for you to plug it in.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.290
And earlier we touched on the
consistency as one example.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.880
So the experience
of learning one API

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.060
makes it much more familiar
or easy for developers

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.184
to pick up the next.

00:03:40.184 --> 00:03:42.600
LAURENCE MORONEY: So the Android
platform is very diverse.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.940
There's a lot of
different versions.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.380
And there's a lot of
things that developers

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.760
will need to learn to be
the best possible developer.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.830
Is there anything that we're
doing in Google Play services

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.050
to make that easier for them?

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.758
FRANCIS MA: Yeah.

00:03:51.758 --> 00:03:54.120
So Google Play services,
it's a little bit

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.800
different in that it works
across all major versions

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.360
of Android dating back to
version 2.3, the Gingerbread

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.480
release, and up.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.150
So as a developer, once you
integrate with the Google Play

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.570
services' APIs,
we assure that it

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.990
works across all
of these devices,

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.950
helping you reach the 1
billion active Android

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.279
devices as a developer.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.574
LAURENCE MORONEY: 1 billion.

00:04:18.574 --> 00:04:19.240
FRANCIS MA: Yes.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.240
LAURENCE MORONEY: And so
just to reinforce that,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.990
just make sure I
understand you right,

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.090
if I build my application
using Google services

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.250
and using Google
Play services, then

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.730
it's going to work
on Gingerbread.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.380
It's going to work on Kit Kat.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.030
It's going to work on Honeycomb,
Lollipop, all of those things

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.330
without me needing
to change anything.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.288
FRANCIS MA: Absolutely.

00:04:36.288 --> 00:04:38.050
And another aspect of
Google Play services

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.100
is that we also provide
automatic updates.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.260
So as an example, if
you integrated with,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.020
let's say the location
API that we offer,

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.140
and over time if we come up
with a more optimal way of,

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.940
let's say, detecting location to
be able to offer more precision

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.480
and in a more
power-efficient manner,

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.342
you would get that
for free for your app.

00:04:57.342 --> 00:04:59.050
So as a developer,
you integrate it once,

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.424
you don't have to
worry about it.

00:05:00.424 --> 00:05:02.850
And you also are able to get
the update benefits as well.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.725
LAURENCE MORONEY: One
question I have to ask.

00:05:04.725 --> 00:05:06.970
Like Android-- we've been
talking about funny names

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.000
like Kit Kat and
FroYo and Lollipop

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.175
and-- does Google Play services
have strange names like that?

00:05:12.175 --> 00:05:13.437
FRANCIS MA: We go by cheeses.

00:05:13.437 --> 00:05:14.520
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cheeses?

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.440
FRANCIS MA: Yeah.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.790
Alphabetically-ordered cheeses.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.580
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Alphabetically-ordered cheeses.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.190
FRANCIS MA: Yes.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.050
LAURENCE MORONEY: That
must be hard to find names.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.790
So what cheese are
we on right now?

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.950
FRANCIS MA: We are
on the N release.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.690
LAURENCE MORONEY:
N. N. I can't think

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.106
of a cheese that
begins with an N.

00:05:27.106 --> 00:05:29.230
FRANCIS MA: Yeah, well,
we cheated a bit there.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.357
We have the Nacho Cheese.

00:05:32.357 --> 00:05:34.690
So not quite a cheese, but
we call it the Nacho release.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:35.856
LAURENCE MORONEY: Very good.

00:05:35.856 --> 00:05:37.760
So after N then is
going to come O.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.550
FRANCIS MA: It's going
to become O. Yeah.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.320
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Can you tell us

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.640
what cheese is going to be
the star of the next version?

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.100
FRANCIS MA: We are
calling the next one Orla.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.137
LAURENCE MORONEY: Orla.

00:05:45.137 --> 00:05:46.470
I've never heard of Orla cheese.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.280
I'm going to have to go down to
my cheesemonger and buy some.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.850
Then whenever you
shift, do you have

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.376
a party for when the new version
of the bits have been cut?

00:05:55.376 --> 00:05:58.096
FRANCIS MA: Yeah, the
cheese-cutting party.

00:05:58.096 --> 00:06:00.382
LAURENCE MORONEY: A party
where you cut the cheese?

00:06:00.382 --> 00:06:02.490
FRANCIS MA: We do
buy the cheese.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.562
And we gather and we'll share
it as a mini-celebration, yes.

00:06:05.562 --> 00:06:06.520
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.603
I'll have to look forward
to what Orla looks like.

00:06:08.603 --> 00:06:09.462
FRANCIS MA: Yep.

00:06:09.462 --> 00:06:11.420
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
getting back to developers

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.790
now-- away from
cheeses for a moment--

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.449
we are very much living in
a mobile first world now,

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:17.990
and developers of
course have to live

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.573
in that world ahead
of everybody else.

00:06:19.573 --> 00:06:22.420
And they have unique challenges
in the mobile first world.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.950
It's very different from web
development or desktop or even

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.420
cloud development.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.659
What kind of challenges do
you see developers facing?

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:30.700
And what are we doing to
make their lives easier?

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.033
FRANCIS MA: Yeah, absolutely,
I think building on mobile

00:06:33.033 --> 00:06:35.920
is a very different challenge
than building on the web.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.330
As an example, if
you think about it,

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.282
the code that you
deliver to end users

00:06:41.282 --> 00:06:42.365
is running on a computer--

00:06:42.365 --> 00:06:43.470
LAURENCE MORONEY:
A really small one.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.320
FRANCIS MA: --that you
don't control, right?

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.260
The user might be
driving in some location

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.690
where the network
connectivity might be sparse.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.990
The battery is a concern because
a user has that with them

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.420
on the go all day.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.600
And so as a developer, you
really have to think about some

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.710
of these nuances from
a user's perspective,

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.620
and how do you
make that optimal.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.080
How do you make it
so that it's fast

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.310
and make it work well on
the diversity of devices

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.440
that are out there?

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.640
And so with Google
Play services,

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.190
what will help you
is we think a lot

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.110
about optimizing
for mobile things

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.600
like offline connectivity
and so forth.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.290
And so as a developer,
these are things

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.850
that you can worry less about
and focus more about how

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.480
you can differentiate
your app and really build

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.300
things and focus on
making your app great.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.170
And let Google
help you solve some

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.842
of the fundamental problems
of building on mobile.

00:07:40.842 --> 00:07:41.800
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.439
So with building for
fundamentally a device that

00:07:44.439 --> 00:07:46.980
sits in your pocket most of the
time, and it's a tiny device,

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.185
there are complex scenarios.

00:07:49.185 --> 00:07:50.780
And with Google Play
services, you're

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.780
taking the complexity
out of those scenarios

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.692
and helping developers to
build better apps, as it were.

00:07:55.692 --> 00:07:56.650
FRANCIS MA: Absolutely.

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:57.320
LAURENCE MORONEY:
What advice would you

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.810
have for developers
to get started

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.740
as the best possible
mobile developers today?

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.281
FRANCIS MA: Use
Google Play services.

00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:04.510
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Well, of course.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:06.882
Any quick advantages that
they could reap right away?

00:08:06.882 --> 00:08:07.840
FRANCIS MA: Absolutely.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.220
As I touched on before, we
offer many Google services

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.780
through the same SDK.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.230
So as an example,
integrating Google Analytics

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.450
is a really good way
for you to get insight

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.430
into what users are doing so
that you can get that feedback

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:23.000
and optimize your app
to build a better app.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.590
Or another example is using
the fused location provider,

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:31.720
which we help you figure out
the best way to get the user's

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.450
location if you're building
a location-aware app.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:37.049
And so you don't have to worry
about, do you use the GPS,

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.740
do you use Wi-Fi signals, and
all kinds of different things.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.970
We just have the simple
location API for you,

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.697
and you can just
integrate that and focus

00:08:43.697 --> 00:08:45.280
on things that
differentiate your app.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.460
LAURENCE MORONEY: And then that
optimizes your battery, right,

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.715
so you're not overusing
it, that type of thing.

00:08:48.715 --> 00:08:49.335
FRANCIS MA: Absolutely.

00:08:49.335 --> 00:08:50.285
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:08:50.285 --> 00:08:51.720
Well, Francis, thanks
for being here.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.900
It's been great
talking with you.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:53.691
I've learned a lot.

00:08:53.691 --> 00:08:55.930
I hope the viewers have
learned a lot, too.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:56.930
FRANCIS MA: My pleasure.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:57.755
It's been fun.

00:08:57.755 --> 00:08:58.020
LAURENCE MORONEY: All right.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.464
So, everybody, this has been
another episode of "Coffee

00:09:00.464 --> 00:09:01.130
with a Googler."

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.447
Thanks for watching this far.

00:09:02.447 --> 00:09:04.030
