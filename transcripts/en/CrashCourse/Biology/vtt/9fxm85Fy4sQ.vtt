00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.910
All members of the kingdom Animalia
need oxygen to make energy.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.130
Oxygen is compulsory.
Without oxygen, we die.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.490
But as you know, the
byproduct of the process

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.509
that keeps us all alive, cellular
respiration, is carbon dioxide,

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.720
or CO2, and it doesn't
do our bodies a bit of good,

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.440
so not only do we need
to take in the oxygen,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.450
we also have to
get rid of the CO2.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.180
And that's why we have the
respiratory and circulatory systems

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.930
to bring in oxygen from
the air with our lungs,

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.399
circulate it to all of our cells
with our heart and arteries,

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.039
collect the CO2 that we
don't need with our veins,

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:40.280
and dispose of it with
the lungs when we exhale.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.800
Now, when you think of
the respiratory system,

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.079
the first thing that you
probably think of is the lungs.

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.890
But some animals can take
in oxygen without lungs,

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.249
by a process called simple
diffusion, which allows gases

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:01.489
to move into and pass
through wet membranes.

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.160
For instance, arthropods have
little pores all over their bodies

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.000
that just sort of let oxygen
wander into their body,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.400
where it's absorbed by
special respiratory structures.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.980
Amphibians can take in
oxygen through their skin,

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.220
although they also have
either lungs or gills

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.390
to help them respire,

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.500
because getting all your
oxygen by way of diffusion

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.690
takes freaking forever.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.570
So why do we have to have
these stupid lung things

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.220
instead of just using
simple diffusion?

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.800
Well, a couple of reasons.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.310
For starters, the bigger the
animal, the more oxygen it needs.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.350
And a lot of mammals are pretty
big, so we have to actively

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.240
force air into our lungs in
order to get enough oxygen

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.370
to run our bodies.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.620
Also mammals and birds
are warm blooded,

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.280
which means they have to regulate
their body temperatures,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.770
and that takes many, many calories,

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.280
and burning those calories
requires lots of oxygen.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.830
Finally, in order for oxygen
to pass through a membrane,

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.520
the membrane has to be wet,
so for a newt to take oxygen

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.220
in through its skin, the skin
has to be moist all the time,

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.130
which, you know, for a newt,
isn't a big deal, but, you know,

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.320
I don't particularly want to
be constantly moist, do you?

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.950
Fish need oxygen, too, of
course, but they absorb oxygen

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.659
that's already dissolved in
the water through their gills.

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.939
If you've ever seen a fish gill,
you'll remember that they're just

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:16.060
sort of a bunch of filaments
of tissue layered together.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.299
This gill tissue
extracts dissolved oxygen

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.060
and excretes the carbon dioxide.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.599
Still, there are some
fish that have lungs

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.239
like Lungfish, which we call
Lungfish because they have lungs.

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.879
And that's actually where
lungs first appeared

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.099
in the animal kingdom.

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.480
All animals from
reptiles on up respire

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.359
with lungs deep in their bodies
basically right behind the heart.

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:37.969
So while us more complex
animals can't use diffusion

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:41.989
to get oxygen directly,
our lungs can.

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.019
Lungs are chock full of
oxygen-dissolving membranes

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.629
that are kept moist with mucus.

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.670
Moist with Mucus...
another great band name.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.459
The key to these bad
boys is that lungs

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.450
have a TON of surface
area, so they can absorb

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.829
a lot of oxygen at once.

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.079
You wouldn't know from looking
at them, but human lungs

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.980
contain about 75 square meters
of oxygen-dissolving membrane.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.230
That's bigger than
the roof of my house!

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.439
And the simple diffusion
that your lungs use

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:10.810
is pretty freakin' simple.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.950
You and I breathe oxygen in
through our nose and mouth.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.060
It passes down a pipe called
your larynx which then

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.620
splits off from your esophagus
and turns into your trachea,

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.840
which then branches
to form two bronchi,

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.620
one of which goes into each lung.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.730
These bronchi branch off
again, forming narrower

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.389
and narrower tubes
called bronchioles.

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:33.340
These bronchioles eventually
end in tiny sacs called alveoli.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.930
Each alveolus is about a fifth
of a millimeter in diameter,

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.930
but each of us has about
300 million of them,

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.230
and this, friends, is
where the magic happens.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.629
Alveoli are little bags
of thin, moist membranes,

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:47.870
and they're totally covered in

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.650
tiny, narrow blood-
carrying capillaries.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.599
Oxygen dissolves through
the membrane and is absorbed

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.389
by the blood in these capillaries,
which then goes off

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:57.010
through the circulatory
system to make cells

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.329
all over your body
happy and healthy.

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:01.900
But while the alveoli are
handing over the oxygen,

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.499
the capillaries are switching
it out for carbon dioxide

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:07.309
that the circulatory system just
picked up from all over the body.

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:10.290
So the alveoli and capillaries
basically just swap

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.629
one gas for another.

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.819
From there, the alveoli takes
that CO2 and squeezes it out

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.799
through the bronchioles,
the bronchi, the trachea,

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.139
and finally out of your
nose and/or mouth.

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.930
So inhale for me once!
Congratulations!

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.430
Oxygen is now in
your bloodstream!

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.270
Now exhale! Wonderful!

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.479
The Co2 has now
left the building!

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.580
And you don't even have to think
about it, so you can think

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.210
about something more important
like how many Cheetos

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.060
you could realistically fit into
your mouth at the same time!

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.930
So, now you're all,
"Yeah, that's great Hank,

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.520
but how do lungs actually work?

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.419
Like how do they do the
thing where they do

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.370
where they get moved to come
in and out and stuff?"

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.740
Well, eloquent question!
Well asked!

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.240
Lungs work like a pump,
but they don't actually

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.500
have any muscles in them that
cause them to contract and expand.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.970
For that we have this
big, flat layer of muscles

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.430
that sits right underneath the
lungs called the thoracic diaphragm

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.860
At the end of an exhalation,
your diaphragm is relaxed,

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.800
so picture an arch pushing
up on the bottom of your lungs

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.430
and crowding them out so that
they don't have very much volume.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.759
But when you breathe in,
the diaphragm contracts

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:13.620
and flattens out, allowing
the lungs to open up.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.310
And as we know from
physics, as the volume

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.699
of a container grows larger,
the pressure inside it goes down.

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:21.479
And the fluids, including
air, always flow down

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.330
their pressure gradient, from
high pressure to low pressure.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.680
So as the pressure in our lungs
goes down, air flows into them.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.889
When the diaphragm relaxes,
the pressure inside the lungs

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:31.889
becomes higher than
the air outside,

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.139
and the deoxygenated
air rushes out.

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:35.680
And THAT is breathing!

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.009
Now, it just so happens that
the circulatory system

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.000
works on a pumping mechanism
just like the respiratory system.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.759
Except, instead of moving air
into and out of the lungs,

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:46.039
it moves blood into
and out of the lungs.

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:49.569
The circulatory system moves
oxygenated blood out of the lungs

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:51.349
to the places in your
body that needs it

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:54.759
and then brings the deoxygenated
blood back to your lungs.

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:57.379
And maybe you're thinking,
"Whoa, what about the heart?!

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:00.460
Isn't the heart the whole
point of the circulatory system?"

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.199
Well settle down!
I'm going to explain.

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:03.419
We're used to talking
about the heart

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.479
as the head honcho of
the circulatory system.

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:09.349
And yeah, you would be in serious
trouble if you didn't have a heart!

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:13.650
But the heart's job is to basically
power the circulatory system,

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.189
move the blood all around
your body and get it back

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:20.310
to the lungs so that it can pick up
more oxygen and get rid of the CO2.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.060
As a result, the circulatory
system of mammals

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.970
essentially makes a figure-8:

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.569
Oxygenated blood is pumped from
the heart to the rest of the body,

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:29.680
and then when it makes its
way back to the heart again,

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.599
it's then pumped on a
shorter circuit to the lungs

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:36.530
to pick up more oxygen and
unload CO2 before it goes back

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.229
to the heart and starts
the whole cycle over again.

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:40.819
So even though the heart
does all the heavy lifting

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:43.939
in the circulatory system,
the lungs are the home base

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:45.169
for the red blood cells,

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:48.030
the postal workers that
carry the oxygen and CO2.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.860
Now, the way that your
circulatory system moves

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.849
the blood around is pretty nifty.

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:53.699
Remember when I was
talking about air moving

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:55.629
from high pressure to low pressure?

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:56.879
Well, so does blood.

00:06:56.879 --> 00:07:00.240
A four chambered heart, which
is just one big honkin' beast

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.849
of a muscle, is set up
so that one chamber,

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:04.969
the left ventricle,
has very high pressure.

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:07.580
In fact, the reason it seems
like the heart is situated

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.979
a little bit to the left of center
is because the left ventricle

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:13.580
is so freaking
enormous and muscley.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.060
It has to be that way in
order to keep the pressure

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.430
high enough that the oxygenated
blood will get out of there.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.849
From the left ventricle,
the blood moves through the aorta,

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:25.180
a giant tube, and then
through the arteries,

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.330
blood vessels that carry
blood away from the heart,

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:28.620
to the rest of the body.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.280
Arteries are muscular and thick-
walled to maintain high pressure

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.219
as the blood travels along.

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:36.469
As arteries branch off
to go to different places,

00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:40.310
they form smaller arterioles
and finally very fine

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.650
little capillary beds, which,
through their huge surface area,

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:45.289
facilitate the delivery of oxygen

00:07:45.289 --> 00:07:47.069
to all of the cells in
the body that need it.

00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:50.530
Now the capillary beds are
also where blood picks up CO2,

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.280
so from there the blood
keeps moving down

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.129
the pressure gradient
through a series of veins.

00:07:55.129 --> 00:07:57.469
These do the opposite of
what the arteries did:

00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:59.289
instead of splitting off
from each other to become

00:07:59.289 --> 00:08:01.210
smaller and smaller,
little ones flow together

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:02.550
to make bigger and bigger veins

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.240
to carry the deoxygenated
blood back to the heart.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.379
The big difference between
most veins and most arteries

00:08:07.379 --> 00:08:10.400
is that instead of being
thick-walled and squeezy,

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.020
veins have thinner walls,
and have valves that keep

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.960
the blood from flowing backwards.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:15.599
Which would be bad.

00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:17.259
This is necessary
because the pressure

00:08:17.259 --> 00:08:19.740
in the circulatory system
keeps dropping lower and lower,

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.639
until the blood flows
into two major veins:

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:25.860
The first is the inferior vena
cava, which runs pretty much

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.770
down the center of the
body and handles blood

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:29.439
coming from the lower
part of your body.

00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:32.180
The second is the superior
vena cava, which sits on top

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:35.529
of the heart and collects the
blood from the upper body.

00:08:35.529 --> 00:08:37.709
Together they run into the
right atrium of the heart,

00:08:37.709 --> 00:08:41.320
which is the point of the lowest
pressure in the circulatory system.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.950
So, all this deoxygenated blood
is now back in the heart.

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:45.940
And it needs to sop
up some more oxygen,

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.050
so it flows into
the right ventricle,

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:50.700
and then into
the pulmonary artery

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.470
now arteries, remember,
flow away from the heart,

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.720
even though in this case
it contains deoxygenated blood,

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.389
and pulmonary means "of the lungs,"

00:08:59.389 --> 00:09:02.160
so you know this is
the path to the lungs.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.380
After the blood makes
its way to the alveoli

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:08.070
and picks up some fresh oxygen,
it flows to the pulmonary vein,

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.329
remember it's a vein because
it's flowing to the heart,

00:09:10.329 --> 00:09:12.250
even though it contains
oxygenated blood

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.230
and from there it
enters the heart again,

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:15.829
where it flows into
the left atrium

00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:17.750
and then into
the left ventricle,

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.630
where it does the whole
body circuit again.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:23.570
And again and again and again.
And that is the way that we work!

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:25.779
Our hearts are really
efficient and awesome,

00:09:25.779 --> 00:09:29.339
and they have to be, because
we're endotherms, or warm-blooded,

00:09:29.339 --> 00:09:31.970
meaning that we maintain a
steady internal temperature.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.990
Having an endothermic
metabolism is really great

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.089
because you're less
vulnerable to fluctuations

00:09:36.089 --> 00:09:39.279
in external temperature than
ectotherms, or cold-blooded animals

00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:41.380
Also, the enzymes that do
all the work in our bodies

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.389
operate over a very narrow
range of temperatures.

00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:47.750
In humans that range is between
36 and 37 degrees Celsius.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.190
But the trade-off is that
endotherms need to eat

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:54.070
constantly to maintain our high
metabolisms and also create heat.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.160
And for that we need
a lot of oxygen.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.130
Hence, the amazing,
efficient 4-chambered heart

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.440
and our gigantic freakin' lungs.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.560
Ectotherms, on the other
hand, have slow metabolisms

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.660
and don't need as much
in the way of food.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.639
A snake is totally pumped if
it gets a meal once a month.

00:10:08.639 --> 00:10:11.889
So, since ectotherms aren't doing
much in the way of metabolizing,

00:10:11.889 --> 00:10:13.769
they don't need much
in the way of oxygen.

00:10:13.769 --> 00:10:15.720
So their circulatory
systems can be, you know,

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.100
a little bit janky and
inefficient: it's still cool.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.790
Remember back when we were tracking
the development of chordates?

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:22.470
One of the signs of complexity
was the number of chambers

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:23.440
in an animal's heart.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.560
Fish only have two chambers,
one ventricle and one atrium.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.050
The blood gets oxygenated as
it moves through the gills,

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.620
and then carries oxygen
through the rest of the body,

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.690
back to the heart where it's
moved through the gills again.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.040
But reptiles and amphibians
have three-chambered hearts:

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.070
they've got two atria
but only one ventricle.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.180
And what that means is
that not all the blood

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.120
gets oxygenated every time it
makes a full pass around the body.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.300
So oxygenated blood gets
pumped through the body

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.160
and mixed up with a
little deoxygenated blood.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.980
Not super efficient, but again,
it doesn't really have to be.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:51.620
So there you have it.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.990
The how and why behind
how oxygen gets to

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.230
all the places it needs to be!

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:57.500
The question is:

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.019
What powers the diaphragm?

00:10:59.019 --> 00:11:00.410
What powers the heart?

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.769
Where does that energy come from?

00:11:02.769 --> 00:11:05.600
Well, it comes from
the digestive system.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.410
And that's what we're going
to be talking about next time.
