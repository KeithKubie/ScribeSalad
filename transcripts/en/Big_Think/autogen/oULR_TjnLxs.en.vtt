what reductionism allows you to do is to

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250
what reductionism allows you to do is to
 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.120
what reductionism allows you to do is to
take a complex problem and focus on one

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130
take a complex problem and focus on one
 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.759
take a complex problem and focus on one
component of it and try to understand it

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769
component of it and try to understand it
 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.420
component of it and try to understand it
in some detail and sometimes you can

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430
in some detail and sometimes you can
 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.340
in some detail and sometimes you can
just do it by focusing on one component

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350
just do it by focusing on one component
 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.429
just do it by focusing on one component
all the times it requires selecting a

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439
all the times it requires selecting a
 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.410
all the times it requires selecting a
particular biological system if you're

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420
particular biological system if you're
 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.390
particular biological system if you're
working in biology in which that

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400
working in biology in which that
 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.269
working in biology in which that
component is prominent or easy to study

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279
component is prominent or easy to study
 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.999
component is prominent or easy to study
and that allows you to study in depth

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009
and that allows you to study in depth
 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.430
and that allows you to study in depth
the problem that would be hard to do if

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440
the problem that would be hard to do if
 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.630
the problem that would be hard to do if
you looked at it in all of its

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640
you looked at it in all of its
 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.470
you looked at it in all of its
complexity for me the reductionist

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480
complexity for me the reductionist
 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.240
complexity for me the reductionist
approach was really a very profitable

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250
approach was really a very profitable
 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.139
approach was really a very profitable
and not something that I really thought

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149
and not something that I really thought
 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.350
and not something that I really thought
a lot about before I originally went to

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360
a lot about before I originally went to
 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.639
a lot about before I originally went to
medical school with the idea of becoming

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649
medical school with the idea of becoming
 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.910
medical school with the idea of becoming
a psychoanalyst I didn't have a strong

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920
a psychoanalyst I didn't have a strong
 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.700
a psychoanalyst I didn't have a strong
biological background at all and then in

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710
biological background at all and then in
 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.130
biological background at all and then in
my senior year at medical school there

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140
my senior year at medical school there
 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.229
my senior year at medical school there
was a five-month selective period in

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239
was a five-month selective period in
 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.340
was a five-month selective period in
which you could do whatever you wanted

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350
which you could do whatever you wanted
 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.529
which you could do whatever you wanted
to and I thought that even a

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539
to and I thought that even a
 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.420
to and I thought that even a
psychoanalyst she knows something about

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430
psychoanalyst she knows something about
 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.310
psychoanalyst she knows something about
the brain so I took an elective in brain

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320
the brain so I took an elective in brain
 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.789
the brain so I took an elective in brain
science there were very few people doing

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799
science there were very few people doing
 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.980
science there were very few people doing
brain science in those days but Columbia
