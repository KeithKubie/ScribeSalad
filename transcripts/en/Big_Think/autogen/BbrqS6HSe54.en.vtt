fantastic answer to your question but

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199
fantastic answer to your question but
 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:44.810
fantastic answer to your question but
basically what we can see is that the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820
basically what we can see is that the
 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.390
basically what we can see is that the
way things are playing out is very

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400
way things are playing out is very
 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:57.969
way things are playing out is very
uncomfortable the future could involve

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:57.979
uncomfortable the future could involve
 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:02.509
uncomfortable the future could involve
substantial breakdowns so that the

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519
substantial breakdowns so that the
 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.759
substantial breakdowns so that the
people who were involved in our research

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769
people who were involved in our research
 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.300
people who were involved in our research
were very concerned about capital

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310
were very concerned about capital
 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.810

the volatility they saw the in the
 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.870
the volatility they saw the in the
extent to which the capital markets were

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880
extent to which the capital markets were
 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.090
extent to which the capital markets were
drifting away from their function of

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100
drifting away from their function of
 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.039
drifting away from their function of
serving industrial markets and were

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049
serving industrial markets and were
 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.580
serving industrial markets and were
simply trading systems and they were

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590
simply trading systems and they were
 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.950

inequality of income within countries
 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.550
inequality of income within countries
and then across countries really bad so

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560
and then across countries really bad so
 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.660
and then across countries really bad so
that even though China and India by say

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670
that even though China and India by say

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:04.849
2050 or 2040 are expected to have
together as much as say forty percent of

the people in those countries will still

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390
the people in those countries will still
 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.309
the people in those countries will still
have incomes that are like a third of

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319
have incomes that are like a third of
 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.520
have incomes that are like a third of
those in developed nations and an

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530
those in developed nations and an
 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.850
those in developed nations and an
average and the averages are a problem

average and the averages are a problem
 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.199
average and the averages are a problem
because even if you look at those

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209
because even if you look at those
 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.880
because even if you look at those
nations what you see are the poor are

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890
nations what you see are the poor are

like well that kind of inequality is

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840
like well that kind of inequality is
 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.600
like well that kind of inequality is
very rough in an age where television

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610
very rough in an age where television
 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.650
very rough in an age where television
makes everything visible to everyone and

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660
makes everything visible to everyone and
 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.990
makes everything visible to everyone and
it's very soon when I say everyone on

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000
it's very soon when I say everyone on
 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.699
it's very soon when I say everyone on
their cell phones so inequality then

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709
their cell phones so inequality then
 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.600
their cell phones so inequality then
leads to migration that can be highly

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610
leads to migration that can be highly
 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.910
leads to migration that can be highly
destabilizing and so we see for example

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920
destabilizing and so we see for example
 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.970
destabilizing and so we see for example
in Europe populations that's shrinking

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980
in Europe populations that's shrinking
 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.449
in Europe populations that's shrinking
because of age Western Europe and what

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459
because of age Western Europe and what
 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.490
because of age Western Europe and what
are the voters want the voters want more

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500
are the voters want the voters want more
 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.069

benefits they want lower taxes they want

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079
benefits they want lower taxes they want
 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.840
benefits they want lower taxes they want
show it shorter working weeks and they

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850
show it shorter working weeks and they
 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.080
show it shorter working weeks and they
want no immigration so what we're

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090
want no immigration so what we're
 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.610
want no immigration so what we're
looking is we're moving towards a

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620
looking is we're moving towards a
 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.849
looking is we're moving towards a
something that's going to break down and

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859
 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.430
so if we if what is the role of business

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440
so if we if what is the role of business
 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.470
so if we if what is the role of business
leaders but the role of business leaders

is to as a community globally to
 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.710
is to as a community globally to
recognize these problems and to start

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720
recognize these problems and to start
 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.740
recognize these problems and to start
making a difference and interestingly

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750
making a difference and interestingly
 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.120
making a difference and interestingly
there are companies that are doing just

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130
there are companies that are doing just
 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.500
there are companies that are doing just
that a a few are based in the United

that a a few are based in the United
 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.130
that a a few are based in the United
States more outside

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140
 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.470
well I think if you look at china

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480
well I think if you look at china
 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.330

these days by bringing cell phones too I

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680
these days by bringing cell phones too I
 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.009
these days by bringing cell phones too I
think it's essentially a million
