00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:10.049
Between July 25 and September 23, 2001, the
people of the southern India state of Kerala

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.691
witnessed, on numerous occasions an extraordinary
sight: blood colored rain.

00:00:14.691 --> 00:00:15.691
Although most reports limited the color of
the rain to that striking red that resembled

00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:16.691
blood, some people also reported seeing green,
black and even yellow rain as well.

00:00:16.691 --> 00:00:20.410
Eye-witnesses also reported that accompanying
the early instances of colored rain were loud

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.450
thunderclaps and flashes of lighting.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.800
And following the weird rain’s first appearance,
many trees shed their leaves, with the leaves

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.620
turning grey and appearing to be burned.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.190
Whether any of these reports were exaggerated
or not, the colored rain was a scientific

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.680
curiosity and, as scientists are wont to do,
they got to studying the phenomenon.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.360
Early on it was determined that in each milliliter
of rain, about 9 million red particles could

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.360
be found.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.550
However, perhaps corroborating the stories
of those who reported other colored rain,

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.190
it was found that while most particles were
red, there were some that were tinted green,

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.850
bluish grey and yellow.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.059
The Centre for Earth Science Studies in Kerala,
which learned that the pH of the rain was

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.320
neutral, also found it had large amounts of
nickel, manganese, titanium, chromium and

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.320
copper.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.319
The red particles, themselves, were determined
to be mostly carbon and oxygen with small

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.369
amounts of iron and silicon.

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.060
This led the Centre to at first attribute
the likely cause of the colored rain to an

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.189
exploding meteor; however, further research
showed the particles contained spores.

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.149
While there was quite a bit of hoopla over
some researchers speculating the spores may

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.970
have had extraterrestrial origin, given initial
reports of lack of any DNA found and some

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.429
still going with the “exploding meteor”
idea, in fact, the Tropical Botanical Garden

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:39.109
and Research Institute eventually found that
the particles were spores of “a lichen-forming

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:44.209
alga belonging to the genus Trentepohlia”
that they believed came from local sources.

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:48.979
They opined that heavy rains preceding the
events triggered widespread growth of the

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.459
lichens, which in theory would have increased
the number of spores in the air.

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:55.969
However, while that was their best guess,
they noted they thought it unlikely that the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.289
lichens would simultaneously release enough
spores to account for the colored rain.

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.259
They further were baffled at how the spores
would have risen so high in the atmosphere

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.489
as no nearby, recent weather phenomenon seemed
a likely culprit to have caused such an upswell.

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.720
Approximately a decade and a half after the
event, some of the mystery may have been solved.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.420
In 2013, scientists continuing to study the
event, not only found the missing DNA, but

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.340
not long after researchers revealed that the
precise species of the algae was Trentepohlia

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.620
annulata, which was not native to India, hence
explaining why no local weather phenomenon

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.890
around that time explained how the spores
got so high in the atmosphere.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.950
The researchers ultimately speculated that
the spores were introduced through the clouds

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:35.950
from Austria.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.120
Of course, weird rains are nothing knew to
history.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.170
As we’ve covered before, Kentucky even had
a Cloudy with the Chance of Meatballs-like

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.670
rain in 1876 when chunks of meat literally
rained from the sky.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.180
Moving more recently in history, in early
2015, a strange, milky rain fell on parts

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.960
of Idaho, Oregon and Washington.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.510
Scientists eventually learned it was caused
by a dust storm from southern Oregon, where

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.620
the dust had a “high amount of saline, similar
to the composition of milk.”

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.290
Going back to relatively ancient times, Greek
philosopher Heraclides Lembus (2nd century

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.280
BCE) recorded a rain that included so many
frogs falling from the sky, “the houses

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.400
and the roads have been full of them.”

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.070
While you might think this couldn’t have
actually happened, in better documented times

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:23.220
(2005), a small town in Serbia had a rain
of non-native frogs, some of which survived.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.380
The primary hypothesis for why frogs (or fish,
snakes, stones, meat or maggots) occasionally

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.490
fall from the sky is that waterspouts or tornadoes
suck them up and then drop them somewhere

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.490
else.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.850
While the hypothesis hasn’t been definitively
proven for small animal rain, it’s not unheard

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.850
of for small-animal sized objects to be picked
up by tornadoes and then travel even as far

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.910
as 50-200 miles before being deposited back
on solid ground.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.370
Note, too, when talking extremely light objects,
like large dust particles, these have been

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.600
documented travelling thousands of miles and
falling in rain, including yellow dust from

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:03.670
the Gobi Desert falling on Washington state
in 1998 (~5600 miles or 9000 km), and Saharan

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:19.750
dust travelling across the Atlantic Ocean.
