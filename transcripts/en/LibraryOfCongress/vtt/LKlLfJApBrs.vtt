&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:18.310
[ Silence ]

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.580
&gt;&gt; Georgia: Thank you
everyone for your patience,

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.600
and here is Gary Groth to speak

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.640
about Fantagraphics
and the Graphic Novel.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.440
Thank you.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.280
[ Applause ]

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.350
&gt;&gt; Gary Groth: Well thank
you very much for coming.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.080
As Georgia said, this
were celebrating --

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.310
We happen to be celebrating
our 40thh anniversary this year

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.550
which is a little terrifying.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.000
We have a celebratory tome
coming out around November.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.460
And we just sent it to the printer.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.590
It's a 700 page oral
history of the company

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.250
with about 200/250 participants,
artists, writers, journalists,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.590
critics and various observers.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.330
One of the people who contributed
to the oral history mentioned

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.960
in a letter accompanying
his interview

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.930
that Fantagraphics has
traversed half the entire history

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.410
of the comic book, of the American
comic book, which I probably knew,

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.600
but didn't quite register,
and which kind of shocked me

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.740
when it did register, because comic
books were started around 1933/1935

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.700
and Fantagraphics started in 1976.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.660
So, we have in fact been around
for half the entire history

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.840
of comic books.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.270
What I want to do today is
to give you a history --

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.410
They asked for a history
of Fantagraphics.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.110
I thought that might be a
little too self-serving,

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.030
so I wanted to make it -- Because
we've been around for the history

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.470
of what essentially is the growth
of comics as mature art form

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.780
and as the graphic novel, I
wanted to give you a history

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.100
of Fantagraphics and the history
of comics in the last 40 years.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.400
I'm starting with my history
which was as a comic book fan.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.900
I was -- I grew up here in
the Washington D.C. area.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.370
As a matter of fact, I grew up
in both Virginia and Maryland,

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.450
both sides of D.C. And when I
was growing up in the 1960s,

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.980
I was an obsessive
comic book reader.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.850
These are the kinds of
comics I read, mostly Marvel

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.500
and DC Comics -- read
them assiduously.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.730
And by the time I was
13-years-old in 1967,

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:52.640
I started publishing a fan
magazine about comic books.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.950
And this is the cover to the
second issue of the Fanzine.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.430
As you can see, I stole the
logo from the Fantastic Four.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.560
I put this together in my bedroom.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.140 position:56%
I would basically put sheets of
paper into a typewriter, type on it.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.740
It was full of articles.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.040
It was actually full.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.720
I actually had interviews
with cartoonists.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.660
Artists at the time
were from Marvel and DC,

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.720
people like Sal Buscema
and John Buscema.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.630
I would send them questions in
the mail through Marvel and DC

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.080
and then they would -- they
would actually write back.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.820
I would actually send them
questions on pieces of paper

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.340
and leave the room for answers,

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.010
and they would dutifully
throw out the answers.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.310
This is when there were a lot
of comic books being published

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.080
at that time, and there was
what was called Comics Fandom,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.050
which I was very much
a part of that age.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.700
And this was a loose
knit group of fans

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.240
that lived all throughout
the country, and we would go

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.760
to comic book conventions, which
was an incredibly exciting thing

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.430
to do at the time.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.740
I'm sorry this isn't bigger.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.130
This is a photograph
of the banquet held

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.570
in the 1969 New York
Art Comic Convention

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.980
in New York City, Statler
Hilton Hotel.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.780
And this was a banquet
celebrating Hal Foster,

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.340
the artist who did Prince Valiant.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.620
The arrow is pointing
toward Hal Foster.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.880
He was interviewed
by an artist named,

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.070
Gil Cane who is sitting
right next to him.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.930
And this is a great snapshot of
the comic book industry in 1969.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.480
This room is filled with comic
book professionals, Al Williamson.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:31.340
If you know Al Williamson, he's
seated right there, John Buscema.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.580
I mean just many, many people that
work in the comic book industry

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.470
and the comic strip industry at the
time were there, including a lot

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.930
of fans who became professionals
later on and including me.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.760
I happened to be in the front row
because the table I was sitting

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.850
at was off to the right
was out camera view,

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.210 position:56%
so they put the chairs in the front.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.270
Anyway, you know, something like
this was an incredibly exciting.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.430
That's a picture of me in my
office AKA the spare bedroom

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.150
in my parent's house, hard at
work on one of my Fanzines.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.030
You can see -- let me see,

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.580
that's what's called a
typewriter in front of me.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.510
And to the left of me
is a tape recorder.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.280
I think that's a reel-to-reel
tape recorder,

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.310
which is what I would
tape interviews on.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.050
This is when I was of
course a little bit older.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.730
I was probably about 16 or so, and
I would actually go to New York.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.920
When I went to New York, I
would bring this gigantic --

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.130
now this gigantic, you
know, 15 pound tape recorder

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.510
and tape interviews
with professionals.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.660
Eventually as I got
older, this is probably --

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.640
I published these two magazines.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.940
The magazines got better.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.240
The Fanzines got better.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.750
I got a little bit
better at designing them.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.790
I got a little more
sophisticated in terms

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.210
of design and editorial content.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.000
I went from Xeroxing them
in my father's office

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.550
to actually having
them printed offset.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.970
And this would've been around 1972.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.520
Now somewhat simultaneously with
this, was a, what I consider

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.700
to be the first comic's revolution,

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.080
which was the Underground
Comix Movement

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.000
and amateur magazines
published by professionals.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.610
This is a copy of Witzend,
which was a magazine published

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.760
by Wallace Wood, who was a
professional at that time --

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.880
started of EC Comics and
he was working for DC,

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.900
Marvel and many other
publishers at this time.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.190
In 1965, he started publishing
a magazine called Witzend

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.190
out of frustration at the
restricted editorial edicts

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.490
of the companies he worked for.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.420
He hated doing what he was doing.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.770
He hated -- he notoriously
hated editors.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.320
He hated being told what to do and
he hated the content of comics.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.260 position:56%
So he started his own magazine which
he invited his fellow professionals

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.740
in and which he edited himself.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:10.800
In 1964 and 1966, Frank Stack
started publishing The Adventures

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.280
of Jesus and Jack Jackson
started publishing God Nose.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.720
These were the very, very
beginning of underground comics,

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.600
which would flourish
a few years later.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.920
These two artists happened
to be from Texas.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.380
They would eventually
migrate to San Francisco.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:30.960
New York City was the epicenter
of underground comics in 1966.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.410
These are two images
by Robert Crumb,

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.670
The East Village Other ran comics

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:42.380
and would eventually
run a comic supplement,

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.920
which the underground cartoonist
in New York would contribute to.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.750
There were a lot of underground
cartoonists located in New York

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:53.040
at that time, Kim Deitch,
Spain Rodriguez,

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.540
Trina Robbins and many others.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:02.460
Now underground comics I
think represented a liberation

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.820
from everything that had
gone before in comic books.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:10.650
The content in comics were always
aimed at - targeted a children.

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:16.760
Underground comics were the first
time in the history of comics

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:21.560
when you had autonomous cartoonists
who wanted to tell stories,

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:27.250
own their work, retain their rights
and consider themselves as artists

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:31.940
and not as either craftsmen
or employees or people

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.240
who were just doing
what they were told.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.330
These were people -- these were
artists who were interested

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.890
in self-expression,
comics as self-expression.

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:46.660
And to me, I noticed
underground comics a little late

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:51.160
because I was a little too young
to have experienced them early on.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.580
But -- So I got into
underground comics when I was

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.290
like leaving high school, 1972.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:59.220
I was probably 17 or 18.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.690
And they were a revelation to me.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.730
They were just unlike
anything I'd ever seen before.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.030
They were clearly anarchic.

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:07.080
They were clearly artists doing
exactly what they wanted to do

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:15.890
as opposed to following the dictum
of editors of publishing companies.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.710
So at 19, I went to college.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:22.560
I had a long and ultimately
failed college career.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.330
I was restless, and so my --

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.390
I didn't quite know
what I wanted to do.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:31.920
I studied journalism at
the University of Maryland,

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.940
and ostensibly, I did want
to become a journalist.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:39.730
But I guess I also had
-- Well, first of all,

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:44.420
I wasn't sure if I was actually
employable, and I resented working

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.200
for other people and
I did have a kind

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.500
of entrepreneurial sense about me.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.090
So my partner and I decided that we
wanted to start publishing company.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:55.920 position:56%
My partner at the time, Mike Catron,
who was also studying journalism

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.450
at the University of Maryland --

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:58.750
So we decided that if we wanted

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.730
to start a publishing
company, we needed money.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.260
And I had put on comic
book conventions

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.410
in the Washington D.C. area,
so I knew how to do that.

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:09.570
So the thing we thought we could do
is put on a Rock N Roll convention.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.440
This would generate
vast sums of money

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.740
and we would start a
publishing company.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:18.270
So 1975, we started it in 1974.

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.730
I would've been 19.

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:25.220
And so we start with this
idea putting on the equivalent

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.590
of a comic book convention, but
we thought since more people

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:31.270
like Rock N Roll than like
comics, this was a sure bet.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.360
So, we actually rented the
Shoreham Americana Hotel,

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.900
which I think is the
Americana Omni Hotel now.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:41.820
It's still here, which
was a gigantic hotel.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.450 position:56%
And we started promoting this
convention throughout the Washington

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:46.750
D.C. area.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:51.100
We literally worked 20 hours a day
for something like nine months.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.850
We got -- we secured speakers

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:55.680
for the convention
including Hunter Thompson.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.320
We got Rock bands to play.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.590
We had a room of memorabilia and
collectables just like they do

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:02.090
at comic book conventions.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:06.020
We had Rock critics from Rolling
Stone attending the convention.

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:12.480
Okay, I'm going to go back to this.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.570
The convention was a complete bomb.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.180
We put everything we had into it.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:22.110
I dropped out of college after
my third year of college.

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:23.770 position:56%
I was studying Journalism as I said.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:26.440
We both dropped out to do
nothing but work on this,

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:30.430
and it looked like it was
going to be a success.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.820
I mean we had radio
stations promoting it.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:37.600
We really did an amazing job
and it's like nobody came.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.630
I mean people came, but
far too few people came,

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.960
and we lost everything that we had.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.260
In fact, we lost more than we had.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.560
We made negative money.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.090
I spent the next year
gainfully employed,

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:49.570
just paying people back
what they [inaudible].

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:53.300
But in the meantime, a friend
of mine offered to finance --

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.460
because we were -- I was
so interested in putting

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.670
out -- in actually publishing.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.650
I had a space in my
apartment that was set aside

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:05.310
for pay stubs [phonetic],
layouts, typewriter.

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:10.130
A friend of mine decided that
one way we could make use

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:13.660 position:56%
of the failed Rock N Roll Convention
was to use the mailing list

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.110
and start a Rock N Roll Fanzine.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:19.040 position:56%
We weren't interested in Rock N Roll
that much, but we were interested

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.880
in publishing, so this
was a way of publishing.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.110
So we started publishing kind of
a collectable magazine called,

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:27.830
Sounds Fine in Washington.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.380
So we actually had a setup where
we could put together a magazine.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.720 position:56%
We used a local printer to print it.

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:41.720
And this was 1975/1976,
and these were the kind

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.020
of comics being published.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.900
Now in 1976, comics had
really hit some sort of nadir.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.920
You can go through
the history of comics

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.110
and there's usually something
good being published.

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:52.840
In the 1950s, you had EC Comics.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.500
You had John Stanley's Little Lulu.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.550
You had Carl Bark's Donald Duck.

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:58.850
You had Harvey Kurtzman working.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:01.140
You had Bernie Krigstein
doing interesting work.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:05.660
Well this was a period where there
was almost nothing good being done

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:06.960
in the mainstream comics.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.300
I mean it was just complete crap.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.660
And I didn't quite realize that at
the time, because I had really kind

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.890
of stopped reading comics.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:22.190
But in 1976, I'm sorry -- This
is -- In 1974, there were --

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:24.520
Underground comics were
still being published,

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.920
but they were on their last legs.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:31.660
In 1974, a guy by the name of
Mike Friedrich started Star Reach,

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:35.490
which was a kind of intermediate
magazine, which was somewhere

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:37.740
between underground comics
and mainstream comics.

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.260
He would get mainstream
comic artists

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.210
to do exactly what
they want, which was by

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:43.760
and large what they were doing
for mainstream comic except

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.130
with some more sex and violence.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:51.110
In 1976, Harvey Pekar started
publishing American Splendor

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:55.040
inspired by the undergrounds.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:14:02.700
1978, the first two regularly
published independent comics were

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.040
started by Richard and
Wendy Pini with Elfquest

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.970
and Dave Sim with Cerebus.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.850
1978, a publisher by the name

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:17.020
of Eclipse started
publishing graphic novels.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.210
Their technique at the time was to
take artists from mainstream comics

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:23.080
and offer them a better
contract, creative freedom

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.960
and let them do exactly
what they wanted.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.260
These are two examples.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.990
One was a detective
story and one was a kind

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:31.750 position:56%
of post-apocalyptic action thriller.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:38.260
And in 1976, Mike Catron
and I took over some --

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:42.610
a collector's magazine
called, The Nostalgia Journal.

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:44.910
This was -- this had been
published for 26 issues.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:46.230
They were struggling to make it.

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:48.530
They were being in Texas.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:52.700
We decided that we could inject
new life into the magazine,

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.660
change the direction of the
magazine from nostalgia in general,

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:59.660
which was about movies and serials
and music and so forth from the 40s

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.490
and 50s and change the
focus into comic books,

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:05.830
which is what we knew
about, which we cared about.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:09.650
Now, I have a copy of Arcade
which was a magazine edited

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:12.180 position:56%
by Art Spiegelman and Bill Griffith.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:14.550
And I considered this
to be something

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.260
like the last gasp
of Underground Comix.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.240
Underground Comix still
continued to be published,

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.860
but this was the last
issue of Arcade.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.310
Less than six issues, it was
an ambitious magazine edited

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:26.800
by Spiegelman and Griffith,

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:31.860
published by Print
Mint in the Bay Area.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.610
And they were striving to
get newsstand distribution,

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:36.990
because the head shot network

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:40.070
that sustained Underground
Comix were collapsing.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:42.570
This was an experiment that failed,

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:46.290
although it was an
excellent magazine to try --

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:48.940
both transcend underground
and embody underground.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:53.820
And we published the first issue
our Nostalgia Journal literally

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:57.010
within a month of the
last issue of Arcade.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:05.590
One of the intents of
the magazine is we wanted

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:10.770 position:56%
to finally impose critical
standards and journalistic standards

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:15.460
on the content of comics and
on the comic book industry.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:19.540
I was in high dudgeon about this
because I realized at that point

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.170
that the history of comic
books was the history

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:24.680
of exploiting creative talent.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.880
Almost all of comics were
done on a work-for-hire basis,

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:33.250 position:56%
which means that the company owned
all of the work that the artist did.

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:37.170
The artist got a pay-to-page
rate, owned nothing,

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:39.970
never had a pension and --

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.550
-- and it struck me that
if we were going to --

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:50.770
if the medium was going to advance
that we had to use the model

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:54.310 position:56%
from the Underground Comix, which is
that the creator owns his own work,

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:58.860
generates his own work and is the
autonomous creator of that work.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.860
And that's what we started to do.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:09.510
This is an example -- We
interviewed Will Eisner

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:15.400
who created The Spirit
in 1940 I think.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.180
And so what we do is we started
turning our pages over to artists

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:21.260
who we admired and respected

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.870
and who we thought were doing
the best work in comics.

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:27.710
At the time, we started
giving them a voice.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:33.170
And this is a good example of
the kind of feature we would run.

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:34.530
You can see where Will Eisner said,

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:37.390
"I believe that sequential art is
the oldest communicating art form.

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.470
It has served humanity
since early man

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:43.330
because it has the ability
to transmit a story.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:46.260
I would like to be joined by
other artists in an effort

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:47.930
to produce literature
and comic art."

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:53.420
For us at this time, it was
probably around 1977/78,

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.310
this sort of thing is
like a rallying cry.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:59.550
You know the history of Fanzines
were the kind of Fanzines

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:02.330
that I published, which were
just gosh, wow, Fanzines.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:03.630
We were just, you know,

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.340
we just loved everything
coming out of comic books.

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.900
We worshipped the artists
who did them.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:12.520
And so for the first time, we had
a sustained magazine whose intent

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:19.590 position:56%
and mission was to try to propel
comics into a greater sphere of art.

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:24.090
And something like this
for example was inspiring.

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:31.870
We would interview artists who we
thought were mavericks in form,

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:38.280
who pushed against the
editorial strictures of comics,

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.810
people like Wally Wood,
artists Gil Kane.

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:45.110
Gil Kane was one of the
most eloquent critics,

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:49.380
not only of the medium but
of the industry he worked in.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:57.650
We give artists a voice who were
having disputes with the companies

00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:00.160
which was the first
time that ever happened.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.250
And we were vociferous about this.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:06.310
We would -- we were criticizing
the main company's Marvel

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:09.670
and DC month in and month out.

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:14.410
An issue did not go by when we did
not run a pretty brutal critique

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:17.920
of what was going on, the
status quo of the business.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:24.960
We would review the work itself,
which could be incredibly harsh.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.740
When someone like Steve
Gerber or someone

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.070
like Frank Brunner had a
dispute with a company,

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:36.790
we would give them
opportunity to talk about it.

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:40.420 position:56%
There was -- Previously in the comic
book industry, there was this code

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:42.240
of silence where people --

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.070
I mean people just simply
didn't talk about it.

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:48.410 position:56%
Artists who had been in the industry
for a long time were very reticent.

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:53.470
The new generation --
The only artist who broke

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:57.180
that mold was Gil Kane, but the new
generation of artists were willing

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.480
to talk about what they considered

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:05.240
to be the degradations
of the comics industry.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:13.100
So we would simultaneously run
journalism such as a report

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:20.440
on an attempt to start a Comics
Guild, which was a meeting

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:25.530
in Neil Adams' studio in
19 -- I think it was 1978.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:29.690
And virtually every comic book
artist working in the field was

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:34.590
in that room was a gigantic
studio, and it must have had 50

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:39.550
or 60 artists in it, everybody
from editors to artists

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:41.740
like Steve Ditko, attended
this meeting.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.870
Neil Adams organized it.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:47.570
And of course -- You know
previously, there has never been

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:51.350
that level of an attempt to
actually start a union or a guild.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.230
So that was in the atmosphere.

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:55.080
We would for example --

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.960
I would debate Frank Miller to
whether Batman was fascistic.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.350
I mean, these were
important of the day.

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:05.800
We would interview what we
thought were progressive cartoons

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:12.440
like Art Spiegelman who was editing
Raw along with Francoise Mouly.

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:15.710
So were trying to interview
the best artist we could find

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:20.650
at that time while simultaneously
attacking the status quo.

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:23.500
This was a little later,
but one of the --

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:28.430
One of the campaigns I'm most proud
of is when Marvel Comics refused

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:29.810
to return Jack Kirby's art.

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:32.810
This is a prime example of
what we were doing at the time.

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:35.960
Marvel started returning
art work to creators,

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:39.340
which they had held up until then.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:43.720
But they refused to return Jack
Kirby's art unless he signed a very

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:48.840
long extensive retroactive
work-for-hire contract,

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.630
which he refused to sign.

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:56.040
And so we literally started a
campaign to force marvel to --

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.150
to embarrass Marvel
into returning his art.

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:03.010
We collected signatures
from professionals.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.900
We sent out petitions to
comic book retail stores.

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:10.230
We ran many, many news
stories about it.

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:11.530
We interviewed people about it.

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:13.370
We interviewed Jack about it.

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:16.340
Ultimately, he got his art back.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:22.770
He was -- he ultimately was willing
to sign a short one page form.

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:26.390
Now the magazine, it's
hard to describe

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:29.020
because the times have changed
so much, but the magazine was

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:32.580
so divisive that the industry was
really polarized between those

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.750
in the industry who loved the
magazine, loved what we were doing,

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:38.360
enjoyed our mission
statement and those

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:42.720 position:56%
who absolutely despised the magazine
and wished it would go away.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:46.170
And those were essentially the
companies themselves and a lot

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:49.360
of people that worked
for the companies.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:55.690
So, in 1979, we ran an interview
with science-fiction author

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:58.300
by the name of Harlan Ellison.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:02.890
And based upon this quote, the
comic book writer he was talking

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:07.020
about sued us for two
million dollars.

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.560
Now this was 70 --
We ran the interview

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:14.730
in 1979 and he sued us in 1980.

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:21.530
I think 19 -- Later that year, I
ran an editorial where I talked

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:26.620
about publisher to
publisher competing magazine

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:28.880
with a comic strip and we sold it.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:36.250
And I accused him of a career
of hustling as a monument

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:40.200
to selfish opportunism and
spiritual squalor wealth.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:47.320 position:56%
Shortly after that appeared, he also
sued me for two million dollars.

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:56.180
And then not long after that,
unbowed, we published along review

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:58.810
of a comic then an artist by
the name of Rich Buckler did

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:02.890
for Archie comics, where he
basically plagiarized Jack Kirby

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:04.190
panel for panel.

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:06.200
So we ran a big two-page
spread with a 48-page --

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:10.900
48 point headline announcing
he plagiarized Jack Kirby.

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:18.790
And he also sued us for almost
a half a million dollars.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:25.460 position:56%
So in 1981 -- by 1981, we were
fighting three law suits for a total

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.600
of about four and a
half million dollars.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.540 position:56%
And we didn't have a pot to piss in.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.220
I mean, we were operating
out of a large house.

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:36.990
There were probably about five
or six of us working there.

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:38.890
We worked there and we lived there.

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:40.330
We were all in our twenties.

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:43.580
I was probably about 26.

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:45.450
And I knew nothing about lawyers.

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:46.750
I knew nothing about lawsuits.

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:48.190
I had never been sued.

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:51.630
They might think this would
be terrifying and it was,

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:56.200 position:56%
but it was also exhilarating because
it meant we were having an effect.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.860
It meant that we were having
an impact on this industry,

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:02.910
that we were making waves, that
people were paying attention to us.

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:08.450
This was so incredibly divisive in
the industry that it's hard to --

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:15.710
it's hard to describe -- There
was actually a comic convention,

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:18.750
the same convention
I went to in 1969.

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:25.100 position:56%
And this occurred around 1982 or
1983, where I was at the convention.

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.720
I caught wind that Michael
Fleischer who was suing us

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:31.820
for two million actually
secured a room at the convention

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:37.720
in the convention hall to get
artists on his side to do sketches

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.410
so that he could sell the sketches
and contribute all that money

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:42.830
to his lawyer to help sue us.

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:46.530
So when I discovered
that, I flipped out,

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:51.700
and asked the convention organizer,
Phil Seuling if I could get space

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.860
to have artists of my
own to do sketches.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.670
I mean, I just felt we needed to
have some sort of parody there.

00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:59.990
So he reluctantly agreed.

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:02.070
And that night, I called around,

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:08.380
and the artists I got were
Art Spiegelman, Burne Hogarth,

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:12.760
Mike Coluda [Assumed
Spelling] and Gil Kane.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:17.020
And so we sat the smallish
rooms, smaller than this room --

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:18.400
maybe about half the
size of this room.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:21.070
We were on one side and
they were on the other side.

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:24.860
And I wasn't too interested
in raising money.

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.420
I just wanted to be
there as a presence.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.070
And we stayed there for a few hours

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:30.840
until the convention
organized walked in there.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.180
And it was just horrible.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:33.710
I mean people walked in
the room and it was just

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:37.350
like this horrible poisonous
atmosphere forum, you know,

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:39.990
just two sides glowering
at each other.

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:43.570 position:56%
And the organizer finally came in
and he said, "You all have to leave.

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:44.870
You're ruining my convention."

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:49.590
It's like -- it's like this space
was just so poisonous and horrible

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:50.990
that -- which I was happy to do.

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:53.340
So we all -- we all filtered out.

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:56.670
But that's how divisive it
was within the industry.

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:59.420
I mean, you know, the people that
were suing us had their supporters.

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:00.720
They were being egged on.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.970
They said, you know, you got to
put these guys out of business.

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:08.040
The Fleischer lawsuit
took seven years

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.820
and 200 hundred thousand
dollars to win

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:15.560
and we did finally win it in 1987.

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:18.810
And we were so happy.

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:22.590
We were so celebratory that
we won that we featured it

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:24.070
in an issue of the magazine.

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:25.700
This was the cover of the magazine.

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.520
That is a drawing --
a drawing Don Simpson.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.370
The main character is Jim Shooter
who was the editor and chief

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:39.900
of Marvel Comics, who was in
fact organizing artists to work

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:44.220
against -- you know, to do things
against us like that signing.

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:48.450
He testified against
us during the trial.

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:55.230 position:56%
And in the issue, we actually
published transcripts of depositions

00:27:55.230 --> 00:28:01.800
and -- trial depositions and
transcripts of the witness stand.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:06.580
The other two lawsuits
by the way we also won,

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:08.860
although they were much easier.

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:10.970
Now in 19 -- So we were
publishing this magazine.

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:13.810
It's a very, very contentious
magazine about comics.

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:16.250
We were on the one hand championing
work that we thought was good,

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:20.050
but there was so little work being
done and in the 70s and early 80s,

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:21.830
it was hard to find work.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:24.030
There were a handful of
underground comics being published.

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:28.190
There was Harvey Pekar,
but very little.

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:32.690
So 1981, we fell into
publishing comic books.

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:35.100
This was the first
comic we published.

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.160 position:56%
It's a graphic novel by Jack Jackson
called, "Los Tejanos," the history

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.330
of the Mexican-American War.

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:42.700
I got to know Jack, as I
got to know so many artists

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:46.030
by interviewing them
in the Comics Journal.

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:48.560 position:56%
Our Underground Comic's columnist --

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:52.120
We actually had an underground
column in the magazine

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.400
which we ran every issue, and there
was approximately one underground

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.340
comic coming out per month
at least so we could write

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:58.990
about underground comics.

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:00.290
He interviewed Jack.

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:04.030
I got to know him, and he just
asked me if I'd be interested

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:09.460
in publishing this graphic
novel he was working on.

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.990
And we had the distribution
infrastructure.

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:14.300
We were being distributed
to comic book stores.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:15.600
The Comics Journal
is being distributed

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.450
to comic book stores,
and I thought, Why Not?

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:20.000
We can just add this to our
-- to our infrastructure.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.340
We can just put it in the pipeline.

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:25.330
So 1981, we published a
graphic novel, Los Tejanos.

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:31.120
And in 1982, we published what I
consider our flagship magazine,

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:34.080
"Love and Rockets,"
the Hernandez brothers.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:37.600
Again, we were publishing a,
you know a critical magazine,

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.900 position:56%
a magazine that would review comics,

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:41.370
so the Hernandez brothers
self-published their own Love

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:42.670
and Rockets.

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:44.490 position:56%
They went to whatever the equivalent
of a Kinkos was at the time.

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:47.980
They published a 32-issue
comic called, Love and Rockets

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.760
and they sent it to the
Comics Journal for review.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.960
And I opened the envelope
and I read it.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:57.750
And I was so astonished
at how good it was.

00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:59.050
It was just such a
breath of fresh air.

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:00.350
It was different from
Underground Comix.

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:03.910
It was unlike anything I'd
ever seen in comics before.

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:08.800
It had a naturalistic
interpretation of life.

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.460
It had sex but it wasn't about sex.

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:14.290
So I wrote a glowing review
of it for the Comics Journal.

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:19.570
And I think it was some time after
I wrote the review, and Gilbert

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:23.410
and Jaime would contribute spot
illustrations of the magazine.

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:26.790
So I was somewhat aware of them.

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:28.650
I don't know if I really
corresponded with them or not,

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:30.860
but at some point I
got a hold of them.

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:34.150
And it was just a spur of the
moment thought, but I asked them

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:35.450
if they'd be interested

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:38.150
in us publishing this
as a regular magazine.

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:39.450
They seemed young.

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:41.520
They seemed like they could,
you know, turn out work.

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:46.690
They were excited and
enthusiastic and they said, yes.

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:50.230
So we started publishing
Love and Rockets in 1982.

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:55.530
It was my idea to actually make
it a 64-page magazine size comic,

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:58.570
and the reason for that is
because I wanted to distinguish it

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:01.080
from the regular pamphlet-sized
comic books

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.380
that were being published
at the time.

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:05.490
I wanted people to know
that this was different.

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:09.420
Hence 64 pages which was a
lot thicker, a lot meatier

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:14.380
and the magazine size which back
then denoted something I hoped

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.780
different and more serious.

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:23.750
So we published Love
and Rockets quarterly.

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:28.030
With the fifth issue, we turned
it into a 32-page magazine,

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:33.150
which we thought was more
prudent in terms of market.

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:39.090
And in the early 80s when we were
-- we were living in Connecticut.

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:41.700
We moved from Maryland to
Connecticut because we needed

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.100
to get closer to New York
which was the epicenter

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:45.550
of comic book culture at the time.

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:47.830
All the comic publishers
were publishing in New York.

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:49.400
And if you were publishing
a magazine [inaudible],

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.400
we needed to be around them,
so we moved to Connecticut.

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:55.090
So while we were in Connecticut, we
started publishing Love and Rockets

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:57.930
and we started publishing
other, you know,

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:00.070
other books and other magazines.

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:04.000
Our philosophy was that good
cartooning is good cartooning.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.390
We did really care if
it was contemporary.

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:10.030
We wanted preserve great
cartooning from the past,

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:13.650 position:56%
so we started publishing collections
of Popeye and Prince Valiant.

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:19.460
We started publishing a magazine
in 1981 by the name of Nemo,

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:24.700
which was a magazine devoted to
the history and newspaper strips

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:28.630
and illustrations and gag cartoons.

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:31.840
A historian by the name of
Richard Marshall edited it for us.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:35.200
He lived a few miles away
from us in Connecticut.

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.160 position:56%
So it was a real easy collaboration.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.700
He would basically put
the magazine together.

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.750
He would drive down and we would
pull a couple of all-nighters

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:46.920
and put the whole magazine
together in our basement.

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:51.050
And this is the house we
worked out of in Connecticut.

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:55.240 position:56%
It was a gigantic six bedroom house.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:59.060
One way we survived is
by keeping overhead low.

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:02.530
And one way to keep overhead low is
to live in the place you work in.

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:04.590
And so that's what we did.

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:07.610
The entire basement of
the house was the office.

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:10.650
We started encroaching
upon the second floor.

00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:12.270
We all lived there.

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:16.050
We all worked there, and we lived
in this place for six years.

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:17.700
This was located in
Stamford, Connecticut,

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:21.440
which is a bedroom
community of Manhattan,

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:23.780 position:56%
and where we clearly did not belong,

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:26.950
because this was an
incredibly ritzy neighborhood.

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:30.770
We were surrounded by doctors and
lawyers and TV network executives.

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:32.910
And the only reason I think
they rented it to us is

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:35.210
because the owner never
actually met us.

00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:36.510
The owner lived in Puerto Rico,

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:39.360
and I guess this was
just a house he owned.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:45.460
And our neighbors, you know, it
had a very, very long driveway,

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:47.350
which we shared with
the other house.

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:49.770
And I think our neighbors never
understood what we were all

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:51.070
doing there.

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:53.820
And the back of the house
has board on the floor,

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:57.670
so it was very isolated
which is what we needed.

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:01.200
From my Connecticut
move to Los Angeles,

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:05.820
that's where we started
publishing yet more comics.

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:11.780
We started publishing Peter
Bagge's Neat Stuff in 1985.

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:15.980
We started published Jim
Woodring's Jim magazine I think

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:25.260
in 1987 and Dan Clowes in 1986.

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:29.260 position:56%
Pete Bagge visited us in Connecticut
and brought his portfolio over,

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:31.890
and originally wanted it
edited and [inaudible]

00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:33.190
that he wanted it edited.

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:36.930 position:56%
And I suggested, no, why don't we
just do a solo magazine of your own?

00:34:36.930 --> 00:34:39.720
These are all -- By the way,
Bunista Van Jimer [phonetic] size

00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:42.570
because we were still trying
to push the magazine agenda.

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:45.070
We were trying to push the
distinction between comics,

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:50.150
you know, and what we did.

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:51.450
I met Jim.

00:34:51.450 --> 00:34:52.750
Gil Kane introduced me to Jim.

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:56.720
They were both working
in Animation at the time.

00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:01.710 position:56%
And Jim showed me these amazing auto
journals that he self-published.

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:05.410
And of course, you know, the
first thing I thought is,

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:06.710
we should publish this.

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:11.970
It's its own magazine and you can
put together a magazine that was,

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:16.310
you know, would be
widely distributed.

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:20.570
And Dan Clowes just out of the
blue sent us a proposal called,

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:22.380
"Lloyd Llewellyn."

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:26.480
Dan was living in Chicago at the
time, and I thought it was so good

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:30.140
that I offered to publish it,
and we debuted it as a supplement

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:31.440
in an issue of Love and Rockets

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:35.590
which by then had achieved
some degree of success.

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:40.740
In the 1980s, we continued
publishing --

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:44.860
You know, I wanted to
expand what we were doing.

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:47.470
I wanted to branch out
from newspaper strips

00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:50.890
and from comic books into
other forms of cartooning

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:52.310
and these are two good examples.

00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:56.450
These are both represent that
we published around 1988,

00:35:56.450 --> 00:36:00.590
Ralph Steadman's, America and Jules
Feiffer graphic novel, Tantrum.

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:07.240
It was 1987 when we started
publishing Robert Crumb,

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:10.070
who had by then even by
then become a legendary peer

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:11.770
in underground comics.

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:18.320
I met Crumb when I called him up to
ask him to do a cover for an issue

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:22.040
of the Comics Journal with
our Harvey Pekar interview.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:25.040
And Harvey Kurtzman told me
that Crumb was very skittish

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:27.040
and that I should mention
his name when I called,

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:29.760
otherwise he might hang up on me.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.690
And so I did, called him up,

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:34.980
and kind of battered my
way through his defenses.

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:36.390
And he opened up a little.

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:39.530
He did the cover for
Harvey Pekar's issue.

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:43.920
And then I did a long
interview with Crumb himself.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:47.920
I drove up to Summers -- I'm
sorry to Winters, California,

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.210
and hung out with him for a while.

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:54.670
And it was during one of those
trips in winter in his studio

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:58.240
when I broached the subject of
doing the complete Crumb comics.

00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.780
And I pitched it that we could --

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:05.080
we would publish everything he
ever did from 1964 to present.

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:08.560
And he was sort of
wary of that idea,

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.140
but I finally talked him into it.

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:13.350
I talked him into sending
me tons of his sketch books,

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:19.010
a lot of his original art, and into
doing new covers for the books.

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:21.770
We started publishing
underground comics.

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:27.120
These were in the late 80s as well,
Skip Williamson, Scum Also Rises

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.420
and Howard Cruse collection.

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:37.430
Now what was happening in
the 1980s is, you know,

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:40.200
there's mainstream comics which
were really pretty miserable.

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:44.070
But 1981, Weirdo and Raw
started being published.

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:46.770
Art Spiegelman and Francoise Mouly
started publishing in New York

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:51.570
and Robert Crumb edited
Weirdo on the west coast

00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:53.250
and Last Gasp published it.

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:57.910
So you got these two really
vital magazines starting.

00:37:57.910 --> 00:38:02.490
Kitchen Sink was still
functioning out of Wisconsin.

00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:07.200
Now Kitchen was sort of the in the
middle of underground publishers.

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:11.160
He didn't publish work
quite as harsh as Print Mint

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.410
and Last Gasp and Rip Off.

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:17.590
But he was publishing underground
works, as well as reprinting work

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:19.490
like the spirit by Will Eisner.

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:23.590
New publishers were
starting to come up.

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:28.730
New competitors to Marvel and DC
knew basically midlevel publishers

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:32.530
who wanted to compete with
Marvel and DC on their terms.

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:34.600
On the left, you have Zot.

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:39.410
The right is Miracle
Man by Alan Moore.

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:41.400
These were published by Eclipse.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:45.960
We had a publisher by the name
of First Comics out of Chicago

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:49.740
and this was also in the 80s
when comics became decentralized.

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:52.970 position:56%
Comics started moving away from New
York and you could publish anywhere.

00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:57.440
First Comics wanted to compete
directly with Marvel and DC

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.690
with either superhero or
quasi-superhero comics.

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:05.140
1989, Drawn and Quarterly started

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:09.680
and left is Chester
Brown's Yummy Fur; right,

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.170
Julie Doucet's Dirty Plotte.

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:18.180
And then in 1997, I'm
skipping ahead a little bit,

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:22.410
but the next major publisher
was top shelf in 19 --

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:24.970 position:56%
I think 97, they started publishing.

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:31.250
Give me time to read
that for a second.

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:34.680
So in the 1980s, we sort
of established ourselves

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.580
as an alternative publisher.

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:44.540
The magazine was monumentally
contentious through the 1980s

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:47.790
and continuing into the 1990s.

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:52.860
What happened in the late 1980s
is Mutant Ninja Turtles --

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:57.870
Teenage Mutant Ninja turtles were
published around 1987 or 1988.

00:39:57.870 --> 00:40:00.210
Kevin Eastman and Peter
Laird published these --

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:01.510
self-published these.

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:03.370
They were black and white comics.

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:09.820
They became the first enormously
successful comic self-published

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.330
by anybody, made Peter Laird

00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:15.110
and Kevin Eastman millionaires
virtually overnight.

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:19.470
And that's -- and what that started
was what was called the Black

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:20.770
and White Boom.

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:22.620
Suddenly black and
white comics were hot,

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:24.900 position:56%
because the Ninja Turtles sold well.

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.340
Everyone wanted to publish
either black and white comics

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:30.830
or some rip-off of the Ninja
Turtles of which the comic

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:32.460
on the right is a prime example.

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:35.500
And believe it or not, crap
like this would sell, like,

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:40.230
you publish the Blackbelt Hamsters
and it would sell 40/50,000 copies.

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:44.560
So there were a lot of
these imitators out there.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:52.310
Now Kevin Eastman imprudently --
and Kevin is a very sweet guy.

00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:55.610
He's a very idealistic guy, but
he took his millions and he wanted

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:58.260
to start a publishing company.

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:02.770
Peter Laird actually started a
foundation, The Xeric Foundation,

00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:04.630
where he would finance
self-publishers

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:06.730
to publish their own comics.

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:08.730
Kevin wanted to start his
own publishing company

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:10.680
and I remember talking
to him one day.

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:14.470
It was probably 1990 or
so, and he said, "Yeah,

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:15.770
I'm going to start
a publishing company

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:17.350
and I was really inspired
by Fantagraphics.

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:19.190
I want to do, you know, the
kind of comics you're doing."

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:20.490
And I thought, Jesus,
you know, like,

00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:22.660
this the guy that is a millionaire
who wants to publish the kind

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:24.030
of comics I want to publish.

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:30.420
So in 1991, Kevin started
Tundra Publishing.

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:33.880
And these are two examples
of comics he published.

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:36.500
He published for a couple of years.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:48.000
And in I think it was 1993
or 94, he ran out of money.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.850
He literally spent 14
million dollars in two

00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:55.100
and half years of comic publishing.

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:57.960
It was -- It's one of
the most amazing stories

00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.260
in the history of publishing.

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:03.660
It was just a money trough.

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:10.900
And so I did a long interview
with him after Tundra expired.

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:12.850
What happened is Tundra
actually melded

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:17.630
with Kitchen Sink in I think 1994.

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:20.880
Kitchen more or less
took over Tundra,

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:24.310
and then Kitchen actually
expired I think in 1997.

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:26.720
Tundra sunk Kitchen as well.

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:30.510
So I did a long interview
with Kevin a couple of years

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:33.720
after Tundra went under, and
this is a like, you know,

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.180
an example of how the
interview went.

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:37.240
I mean, it's a -- it's
one of the funniest

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:39.620
and most astonishing interviews
I ever did, because we went

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:42.180
through the whole Tundra
experience and how he could go

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:45.150
through 14 million dollars
in two and a half years

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:47.990
by publishing alternative comics,

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:54.260
which I kind of knew theoretically
was possible, but didn't know --

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:55.560
So these are the kind

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:57.980
that we published interviews
like this in the 90s.

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:01.570
We were still publishing very
contentious interviews in the 90.

00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:04.800
Another huge factor in the 90s
was the beginning of Image Comics,

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:09.550
which was a so-called rebellion
from Marvel Comic artists,

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:12.180
who fled Marvel, started
their own publishing company

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:15.450
and essentially did
work that was even worse

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:17.450
than their comics at marvel.

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:22.390
So I always consider that
kind of a bogus revolution.

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:25.500
Todd McFarlane was the artist
who drew Spiderman who was sort

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:28.140
of the ringleader for the group
seven who started Image Comics.

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:31.600
And I did an interview with him

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:33.870
where I basically hammered
home my point

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:38.910
that this was not a genuine
revolution in the history of comics

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:41.190
but more of a, you
know, opportunistic way

00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:43.810
to exploit their success.

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:48.010
And marvel and -- produced
comics are even worse

00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:50.310
than what they were doing there.

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:56.460
We continue to publish
and the kind of cartoonist

00:43:56.460 --> 00:44:00.590
that we liked, admired
and respected.

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:03.250
These are comics that we
published in the 1990s.

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:07.960
We started publishing -- we
started collecting comics.

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:10.900
Previous comics we
published in serial form.

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:13.040
We started using a technique of
publishing then collecting them

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:15.220
into graphic albums, which
were eventually going

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:17.660
to be called graphic novels.

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:21.470
So for example, we collected Love
and Rockets into a series of books.

00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:22.770
This is the first volume called,

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:26.270
Music For Mechanics
published around 1990.

00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:29.330
Ghost World was serialized
in Dan Clowes' EightBall.

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:32.050
We eventually collected
that into a graphic novel.

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:36.010
We continued publishing artists

00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:41.800
like Peter Cooper,
Terry LaBan and Roger --

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:52.710
-- or it's like Roberta
Gregory, Renee French,

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:59.960
and Chris Ware and Joe Sacco.

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:06.060
Now Palestine is a kind
of a great success story.

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:10.350
When Joe approached us, and
Joe correct me if I'm wrong.

00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:13.460
In the early 90s, we
published a couple of things

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:15.620
that Joe did in the late 80s.

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:19.370
Joe actually started
working for us as a reporter

00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:22.900
for the Comic's Journal in
Los Angeles around 1987.

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:25.610
&gt;&gt; Joe Sacco: Six, seven.

00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:29.650
&gt;&gt; Gary Groth: And Joe
wanted to be a cartoonist.

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:31.510
So we -- we did indeed
publish a couple

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:33.720
of comics that he did in the 80s.

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:35.110
In the early 90s, he approached us

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:40.420 position:56%
about doing a comic called
Palestine, or was that the late 80s?

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:41.720
I'm sorry.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:43.020
&gt;&gt; Joe Sacco: Early 90s.

00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:44.320
&gt;&gt; Gary Groth: Yeah.

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:45.620
And he wanted to go over to Israel.

00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:50.120
He wanted to go over and do
some journalism on the ground

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:56.130
and come back and do a chronicle
of what was going on in Palestine.

00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:58.420
We naturally thought
that was a great idea.

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:02.200
So we started publishing Palestine
as a comic book, and at that time,

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.690
we only had distribution
in comic book stores,

00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:08.250
which were completely
indifferent to such comics.

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:15.500
We were probably lucky to sell
2,000 -- 2,500 comics Palestine.

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:17.810
And Joe continued to do it.

00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:19.950
We continued to publish.

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:21.620
Joe made no money doing it,

00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:25.630
because cartoonists do not make any
money selling 2,000 or 3,000 copies

00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:29.530
of a comic book --
credibly labor intensive.

00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:34.310
And I think we published 11
issues, something like that.

00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:35.610
&gt;&gt; Joe Sacco: Nine.

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:36.910
&gt;&gt; Gary Groth: Nine issues.

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:38.210
I knew it was an odd number.

00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:40.700
So we published nine issues
of Palestine over the course

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:45.960
of about five years or
something like that to complete

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.560
and absolute indifference.

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:51.020
We tried to do our best to promote
-- You promoted the hell out of it.

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:53.220
We explained to people this
was a new kind of comic.

00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.350
This was graphic journalism.

00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:57.270
Comic book stores and the patrons

00:46:57.270 --> 00:47:00.170
of comic book stores
couldn't care less.

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:03.300
It was only later when, you know,

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:06.470 position:56%
such a thing as graphic comic
novels became known and we were able

00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:10.890
to publish it, you know, in a
book when Palestine became one

00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:13.340
of our bestselling books.

00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:16.960
But back in the 90s, nobody
could do anything about it.

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:18.320
Nobody cared about it.

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:20.930
Everybody thought it was peculiar
that we would publish a book about,

00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:25.570
you know, journalistic comic book.

00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:28.140
In the 2000s, were going
through one of our many,

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:32.490
many periodic financial
crises which has, you know,

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:35.640
bedeviled the company for ages.

00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:41.070
And in 1997, I finally got around
to interviewing Charles Schultz

00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:43.430
for the Comics Journal.

00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:45.250
I decided, you know, it was time.

00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:49.020
I met Charles Schultz in 19 I
think -- or 1987, where I --

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:51.680
I was a junior partner
when in interview with him.

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:53.840
So I visited him in his studio,
but I'm sure I didn't make

00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:56.110
that much of an impression on him.

00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:59.670
So 1997, I called his office
and I asked him if he would sit

00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:02.120
down for an interview
and he said, yes.

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:06.010
I did an enormous of preparation
and flew down to Santa Rosa

00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:09.040
and spent a marvelous
day with Charles Schultz.

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:10.960
And we had a great time.

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.530
We did an interview in his studio.

00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:15.460 position:56%
Then we walked over to his ice rink
where we hung out for another couple

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:17.190
of hours and just chatted.

00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:22.150
And at that time, just casually,
and I think spontaneously,

00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:27.160
I approached the subject of
collecting all the peanuts

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:31.620 position:56%
and I'm not even sure I remember if
I wanted to do, but I just mentioned

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:33.290
to him that I thought
it would be a great idea

00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:35.840
if Peanuts were collected
systematically.

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:37.600
Because the collections
that I had read

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:40.170
to research the interview
were just all over the place.

00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:42.570
They were scattered
all over the place.

00:48:42.570 --> 00:48:45.320 position:56%
They were poorly edited as a design.

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:47.330
And I said, you know, it'd be great

00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:50.880
to have systematic collection
all uniformly designed of all

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:52.180
of your work, all of Peanuts.

00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:55.930
And he said, "Well, I don't think
anybody'd be interested in that."

00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:57.230
And said, "No, no.

00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:59.220 position:56%
People would be interested in that."

00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:05.430
And then later on, I spoke to him
on the phone, and I brought it

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:07.470
up again, and finally
gave me his blessing.

00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:10.680
He said, "Go ahead and
you know, try for it."

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:15.010
It was a few years later when
I actually managed to do this.

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:17.820
He unexpectedly died in 2000.

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:21.870
Not too long after that, I spoke
to his widow, Jeanie and told her

00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:24.680
that I had broached the
subject with Sparky,

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:26.050
and that he was in favor of it.

00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:27.680
And she was very much
in favor of it.

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:31.120
She was very enthusiastic
about the idea.

00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:39.130
So in 2004, we came out
with the first volume

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:41.090
of the complete Peanuts.

00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:45.450
And this was our most
successful book to date.

00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:48.770
It came a great time because we
were going through another one

00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:52.980
of our financial crises because
we did not have 14 million dollars

00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:54.280
to blow through.

00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:57.940
And publishing Peanuts
really, you know,

00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:00.600
was one of the many times
we were saved by coming

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:02.060
up with something like this.

00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:07.910
And we've been publishing
Peanuts over the last ten years.

00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:12.230
We're publishing the last
-- I'm sorry, last 12 years.

00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:15.860
We were publishing the
last volume this month.

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:19.450
No, sorry, next month,
the 26th volume.

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:23.270
We started publishing the
Sunday's in full color

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:28.670
because Sunday's appeared in black
and white regular complete Peanuts.

00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:32.580
And now what I want to -- I
just served our greatest hits,

00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:35.340
but I wanted to give
you a sense of the scope

00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:38.200
of what we publish currently
and what we've been publishing

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:45.790 position:56%
for the last decade and to give you
a sense of how broad we view the art

00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:52.240
of cartooning and what we're
doing to preserve the history

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:55.350
of cartooning and to publish
contemporary graphic novels.

00:50:55.350 --> 00:50:56.990
So I break this down
into categories.

00:50:56.990 --> 00:51:00.790
One thing we do is publish
newspaper strips like Crazy Kat,

00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:06.880
Floyd Gottfredson's Mickey
Mouse, Walt Kelly's Pogo,

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:08.640
Crockett Johnson's Barnaby.

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:11.250
And as I mentioned, we started
publishing newspaper strips, and,

00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:15.870
like, as early as 1981 with the
same philosophical disposition,

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:17.870
which is that we were
just interested

00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:19.480 position:56%
in what represented good cartooning.

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:26.140
Both of these we published in
the 1980s when we went back

00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:27.600
and decided to do it right.

00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:29.420
The printing quality
is so much better.

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:31.790
We're publishing the
Popeye strips in full color

00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:38.050
which we couldn't afford
to do in the 1980s.

00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:41.060
We're publishing the best of what
we can find from comic books.

00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:49.710 position:56%
And we're reprinting all of the EC
Comics from the 1950s, Uncle Scrooge

00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:55.740
and Donald Duck by Carl Barks,
collections of work by artists

00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:59.260
like Bernie Krigstein, Alex Toth.

00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:06.370
These would be from 1950s, a huge
coffee table book collecting all

00:52:06.370 --> 00:52:08.990
of Will Elder's best work.

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:17.090
Bill Mauldin is a great example of
a cartoonist who is not, you know,

00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:19.590
a newspaper strip artist,
not a comic book artist,

00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:23.770
not a narrative artist per
se, but a great cartoonist.

00:52:23.770 --> 00:52:25.570
His Willie and Joe cartoons

00:52:25.570 --> 00:52:29.080
from World War Two have
never been collected before.

00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:32.440
We decided to collect them in
a big two volume slip case set.

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:34.560
Gahan Wilson, another cartoonist

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:37.780
who I didn't think had
properly recognized.

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:41.150
We published a three-volume
set over a thousand pages long,

00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:48.270
collecting all the work he did
from Playboy from 1956 to present,

00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:53.260
collections work by artists like
Jules Feiffer, David Levine.

00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:59.140
This is a recent collection
publishing all

00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:01.400
of the great English
cartoonists, Ronald Searles work

00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:05.870
from the work he did in
America from 1956 to 1965.

00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:09.580
He was over here on assignment for
magazines throughout that period,

00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:12.560
working for magazines
like Pageant and Esquire

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:15.780
and basically observing
America during that period.

00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:18.960
And this collects all the work
he did during that period.

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:24.880
And, you know, resurrecting work
that many people either don't know

00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:28.850
or have completely forgotten
like Charles Rodrigues' work

00:53:28.850 --> 00:53:33.200
from the National Lampoon, which
is some of the most save work.

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:39.660
I mean, it's every bit as
harsh as S. Clay Wilson

00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:41.830
or underground work was being
published in the New Yorker

00:53:41.830 --> 00:53:47.040
at the time, and you know,
continuing to publish Dan Wilson.

00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:51.520
Humbug was a magazine,
a pioneering magazine

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:54.730
in the 19 -- started in 1956.

00:53:54.730 --> 00:53:56.620
It was a consortium of artists.

00:53:56.620 --> 00:54:01.410
It was the first magazine
that was started

00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:03.820
and owned by a group of artists.

00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:07.520
It was Harvey Kurtzman,
Al Jaffe, Arnold Roth,

00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.290
Jack Davis and Will Elder.

00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:11.420
They had just gotten
out of Mad magazine.

00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:14.610
They had just gotten out of
Trump which was an ill-fated work

00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:17.090
that Harvey Kurtzman
did for Hugh Heffner.

00:54:17.090 --> 00:54:19.400
And they decided to start
their own satirical magazine.

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:23.780
It ran for two years
and of course it bombed.

00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:25.860
They lost all of their money.

00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:30.760
But they did some of the best work
of their lives in this magazine.

00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:32.490
And then the previously
mentioned Witzend,

00:54:32.490 --> 00:54:35.390
we decided that this was another
magazine that the creator owned

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:39.770
and creator-operated magazine
that ought to be collected.

00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:42.940
And coming up next month is
a huge collection of cartoons

00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:48.170
from Paul Krasner's
legendary Realist magazine

00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:51.270
with a new cover by Jay Lynch.

00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:59.370
We made a big effort to collect,
you know, what I consider to be one

00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:01.680
of the most important
movements in the history

00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.900
of comics, the Underground Comics.

00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:08.540
So we started publishing work like
Robert Crumb, Spain Rodrigues,

00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:16.810
Jack Jackson, Robert
Williams, Victor Moscoso.

00:55:16.810 --> 00:55:19.110
We tried to pick what we consider

00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:22.970 position:56%
to be the most important underground
cartoonist and to create collections

00:55:22.970 --> 00:55:29.150
by them, Vaughn Bode,
Rory Hayes, Kim Deitch,

00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:34.280
S. Clay Wilson, Frank Stack.

00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:40.660
And last year, we published
the complete Zap Comix,

00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:44.560
which was every single issue
of Zap published from 1967

00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:50.180
in five-volume slipcase edition,
which we had to follow-up

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:52.970
by with the complete
Wimmens's comics.

00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:01.570
And in addition to
publishing comics,

00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:04.450
because we publish
a critical magazine.

00:56:04.450 --> 00:56:08.220
We were interested in,
you know, criticism

00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:11.560
and biographical information,
essays about comics.

00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:19.940
We published text books about
comics such as biographies

00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:23.850
of Milton Caniff, Harvey
Kurtzman and Bernard Krigstein,

00:56:23.850 --> 00:56:30.090
The Letters of R. Crumb, Rebel
Visions, which was the history

00:56:30.090 --> 00:56:37.110
of underground comix, Cartoons
for Victory which was a history

00:56:37.110 --> 00:56:43.520
of home front cartoons during
World War Two and Wallace, The Life

00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:45.300
and Legend of Wallace Wood.

00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:47.920
This was a collection of
essays and reminiscences

00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:50.650
and interviews with Wally Wood.

00:56:50.650 --> 00:56:54.320
And then one thing we did,

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:58.140
ongoing from the 1980s
is published translations

00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:00.240
from the best comics
throughout the world.

00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:02.880
So we published --
[inaudible] by Manuel Fior.

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:06.230
We're publishing the
complete Crepax by --

00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:11.950
It's Guido Crepax's entire ovra
[phonetic], the Italian cartoonist.

00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:17.000
We published Japanese Manga.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.110
This is Moto Hagio's work.

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:30.640
And Eternaut is a work started in
1956 which is legendary work done

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:36.670
in Argentina, which went on to
become kind of cultural touchstone,

00:57:36.670 --> 00:57:39.690
because it was a metaphor
for the political turmoil.

00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:41.800
It's a science-fiction story,
but turned into a metaphor

00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:44.180
for the political turmoil
that was occurring

00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:48.000
in Argentina then and
during the 1970s.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.430
And then I just wanted to give you
a brief rundown of the cartoonists

00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:54.600
that we're publishing today.

00:57:54.600 --> 00:58:00.460
You know, one of the most
exciting things about continuing

00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:04.570
to publish work is
discover new cartoonist.

00:58:04.570 --> 00:58:08.280
This is a work by Emil Ferris,
who's coming out next month.

00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:10.360
My Favorite Thing Is Monsters --

00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:12.860
it's actually a 650-page
graphic novel.

00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:15.630
It's being split into two.

00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:17.790
First volume comes out next month.

00:58:17.790 --> 00:58:21.660
Next volume will come
out the following month.

00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:26.470
This is work by Simon
Hanselmann, Australian cartoonist,

00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:28.770
now living in the states.

00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:33.540
Published work is varied.

00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:38.190
It's Weathercraft by Jim Woodring
and a brand new graphic novel

00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:43.420
by R.O. Blechman who's been
working since about 1945.

00:58:47.610 --> 00:58:53.640
Joe Sacco's, Palestine which we've
kept in print since about 1995

00:58:53.640 --> 00:59:03.600 position:56%
and Invisible Ink, Bill Griffith's
autobiographical memoir, Laid Waste,

00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:07.240
a graphic novel by Julia
Gfrorer and The Squirrel Mother,

00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:14.390
a collection of short stories
by Megan Kelso, Temperance,

00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:18.070
graphic novel by Cathy
Malkasean, Soldier's Heart,

00:59:18.070 --> 00:59:23.880
which is Carol Tyler's latest
long autobiographical memoir.

00:59:25.890 --> 00:59:29.860
And coming full circle, the Comics
Journal, because of the depth

00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:34.340
of the print medium, we turned
the Comics Journal into a kind

00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:37.690
of a bi-annual 650-page magazine.

00:59:37.690 --> 00:59:40.160
And this is the latest volume
of that, where I got --

00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:44.140
I had the privilege of
interviewing Maury Sendak.

00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:47.070
The next volume will be
coming out next year,

00:59:47.070 --> 00:59:52.100
which I hope will feature a
long interview with Tommy Unger.

00:59:54.930 --> 01:00:01.080
And then I wanted to mention at the
end when I refer to "we" and "us,"

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:05.120
I wanted to mention my partner,
Kim Thompson who died in 2013.

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:07.780
Kim came onboard a couple of years

01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:11.340
after I co-founded
the Comics Journal.

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:15.580
And so, he was my partner
for like 35 or 36 years,

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:17.920
and an important part
of the company.

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:20.140
He worked on the Comics
Journal initially.

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:22.360
He edited his own magazines.

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:27.400
He introduced translated books
to the company in the 1980s.

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:28.700
He continued translating books.

01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:31.430
He knew several languages, so
he could do all the translation.

01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:32.730
He chose them.

01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:34.030
He grew up in Europe.

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:37.450
You know, he edited
a lot of his books.

01:00:37.450 --> 01:00:43.640
And between the two of us,
Fantagraphics was a much more,

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.680
a much stronger company editorially

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.820
than it would've been
with either one of us.

01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:54.380
And then because we started
off as such a, you know,

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:57.530
an advocacy magazine,
a contentious magazine,

01:00:57.530 --> 01:00:59.630
this is the kind of
thing I, you know.

01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:04.240
And now that we have become
somewhat grudgingly, you know,

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.660
an establishment publisher,
this is the kind

01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:09.500
of thing I stay up
late and worry about.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:14.510
So thank you very much.

01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:26.180
[ Applause ]

01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:27.480
I don't know what I'm
supposed to do now.

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:30.930
&gt;&gt; Georgia: We have time
for a couple of questions.

01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:35.990
&gt;&gt; Gary Groth: Are there
a couple of questions?

01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:37.710
&gt;&gt; I was looking forward to a --

01:01:37.710 --> 01:01:41.440
seeing reference to a New
York issue of [inaudible].

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.730
Is that still [inaudible]?

01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:49.180
&gt;&gt; Gary Groth: Probably not.

01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:51.800
I mean I don't remember that.

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:55.060 position:56%
&gt;&gt; It was advertised [inaudible] one

01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:58.440
of your catalogues
years ago after --

01:01:58.440 --> 01:01:59.740
&gt;&gt; Gary Groth: Right, right, right.

01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:01.640
You know, we're big
dreams at Fantagraphics

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:05.240
because it's probably one of the
many projects that we had in mind

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:08.890
that probably just
didn't come to fruition.

01:02:08.890 --> 01:02:13.580 position:56%
Although, you know, it's possible
we can do that in the future though.

01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:17.940
Question over here?

01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:22.450
&gt;&gt; Could you [inaudible] you have
sort of a shortness if comics

01:02:22.450 --> 01:02:24.790
that are good [inaudible]
like a nuts

01:02:24.790 --> 01:02:28.150
and bold composition
perspective like the [inaudible]

01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:32.520
if you're really interested in
getting to like the structure

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:41.090
and like the story telling aspect.

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:45.800
&gt;&gt; Gary Groth: Well, I mean most
of our -- I mean, I don't know.

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:50.750
I mean, any good cartoonist is
probably going to embody, you know,

01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:58.280
a fundamentally adroit approach
in terms of the nuts and bolts.

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:01.120
I mean, you know, all
the cartoonists here,

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:06.560
I would probably recommend, I
mean, Charles Burnes, Jim Woodring,

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:12.550 position:56%
Joe Sacco, you know, Roger Langrick.

01:03:12.550 --> 01:03:15.740
I mean, you know, I mean, all
these cartoonists and they may have

01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:19.700
to be handy, you know,
would be, you know,

01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:22.630
I mean, know the craft so well.

01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:27.590
And I think most artists
[inaudible] Foster for example.

01:03:27.590 --> 01:03:29.610
I mean, you know, for
nuts and bolts,

01:03:29.610 --> 01:03:32.790
you probably can't get any better
than him, but there's so many --

01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:34.620
so many superlative artists.

01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:41.100 position:56%
And I think probably virtually every
great cartoonist knows those nuts

01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:43.390
and bolts and learns that.

01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:45.640
And that's one of the
reasons that he

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:48.780
or she can become a
great cartoonist.

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:53.710
So, I mean, I know that's a vague
and probably useless answer.

01:03:53.710 --> 01:04:00.140
&gt;&gt; Do you see on the
horizon any sort of relating

01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:03.780
to the quote another
trend, another revolution

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:05.590
in comics that are [inaudible]?

01:04:05.590 --> 01:04:06.950
&gt;&gt; Gary Groth: I, you
know, I don't know.

01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:09.350
I think, you know, I think
about that, because, you know,

01:04:09.350 --> 01:04:13.370
if there is one, I'd like
to, you know, be part of it.

01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:19.430
I mean right now, I just, I
see, you know, I mean, you know,

01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:21.550
there's just new generations
that keep coming up faster

01:04:21.550 --> 01:04:23.160
than I can keep track of them.

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:29.110
And, I mean, I remember, you
know, Gilbert and Jaime and Dan.

01:04:29.110 --> 01:04:31.490
I mean, we were all in our 20s.

01:04:31.490 --> 01:04:33.670
So we were the new generation.

01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:41.890 position:56%
And so -- but that really
represented a shift, and I don't see

01:04:41.890 --> 01:04:44.150
that kind of seismic
shift happening.

01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:45.570
I mean, you see over
the last ten years

01:04:45.570 --> 01:04:50.160
where small press conventions
have, you know, have come up

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:54.610 position:56%
and they're flourishing, you know,
conventions like SPX, and, you know,

01:04:54.610 --> 01:04:58.640
they're filled with artists, you
know, and some are good and a lot

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.140 position:56%
of them are not good, and, you
know, some of them are going to last

01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:03.810
and some of them are just,
you know, going to fade away.

01:05:03.810 --> 01:05:08.490 position:56%
But I mostly see this discontinuing.

01:05:08.490 --> 01:05:10.280
And I just see, you know --

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:13.600
you know, powerhouse artists
just suddenly emerging.

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:18.810
And it's a continual effort to
separate the wheat from the chaff,

01:05:18.810 --> 01:05:23.050
you know, trying to find, you know,
the best people doing the work.

01:05:23.050 --> 01:05:25.590
So I don't see any kind of
seismic shift like that happening.

01:05:25.590 --> 01:05:29.900
I mean, I can't -- I can't
foresee what that would be.

01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:32.360
We've reached some sort of
critical mass I think in terms

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:34.970
of the actual quality of the work.

01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:40.490
So I just see more good work
coming up, being inspired by all

01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:43.090
of the work that has
gone in the past.

01:05:43.090 --> 01:05:46.150
And I think we're in this kind of
Renaissance of cartooning, where,

01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:47.910
you know, I mean, we
have several generations

01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:51.940
of great cartoonists
working, I mean,

01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:54.800 position:56%
you know with new cartoonists coming
out, so we hardly have, like --

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:58.940
We probably have in terms of
sheer mass, the most number

01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:03.370
of great cartoonists
working today than ever.

01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:09.370 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Could you tell us briefly about
the sidelining erotic comics that --

01:06:09.370 --> 01:06:11.550
&gt;&gt; Gary Groth: Yeah, I actually
-- I originally had a chapter,

01:06:11.550 --> 01:06:13.860
but I figured it was
a little too long.

01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:18.500
So I did have, like, four or five
slides about our erotic comics.

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.780
In 19 -- Let me see when was it --

01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:25.970
In 1990, we hit one of our
periodic financial crunches.

01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:28.440
I think I mentioned that before.

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:31.880
You know, we were -- we
have always been precarious

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:37.020
because we did not have
14 million dollars,

01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:40.900
and so we would occasionally,
and again, we were always flying

01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:42.200
by the seat of our pants.

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.160
I mean, we never had
outside investors.

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:48.310
You know, we had no
government subsidy.

01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:51.110
We were always on our own.

01:06:51.110 --> 01:06:54.940
And do what we had to do was
just generate enough money

01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:57.060
to keep us going at all times.

01:06:57.060 --> 01:06:59.550
And you know, we would
do that sometimes

01:06:59.550 --> 01:07:02.700
by publishing some
comics we didn't like.

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:06.160
There was a period in the 1980s
where we bought some comics

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.030
from Charlton Publishing.

01:07:08.030 --> 01:07:11.550
Charlton Comics was a
second-rate publisher that was

01:07:11.550 --> 01:07:14.610
around the 1950s and 60s and 70s.

01:07:14.610 --> 01:07:16.820
They went out of business when
we bought some second-rate comics

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:19.790
from them and published
them and they did so well.

01:07:19.790 --> 01:07:21.690
They just kept us going
for a few years.

01:07:21.690 --> 01:07:27.190
In the 19 -- 1991, we hit one of
our periodic financial crunches.

01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:29.300
We were slowly going broke.

01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:32.720
I mean I could see every
month we were losing ground

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:34.750
and I didn't know what to do.

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:37.720
And so I came up with
the idea that sex sells.

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:41.040
A lightbulb went off and so I said,

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:44.500
well maybe we should
publish some sex comics.

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:47.170
Howard Chaykin's Black Kiss had
come out a year or two earlier

01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:50.430
than that, and it sold very well.

01:07:50.430 --> 01:07:52.110
And so I noticed that.

01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:56.920
And so Kim and I sat down and
discussed it, and I proposed it,

01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:00.020
and we struggled with it, like,
well, you know, should we do this?

01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:06.060 position:56%
I mean, is it going to, you know, is
it -- Does it compromise us unduly?

01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:07.560
You know, how do we feel about it?

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:10.230
So we kind of -- We
were agonizing over it.

01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:13.190
And I remember Robert Crumb was
visiting Seattle for some reason

01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:16.200
and he was over at the office,
and I was talking to him about it.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:18.060
And I said, oh, you know, we don't
know whether we should do this

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:19.360
or not, you know.

01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:20.660
We're not sure we can survive.

01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:22.750
We're talking about
doing, you know, porn.

01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:24.760
And he just looked at
me, and he said, do it.

01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:26.060
What are you talking about?

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:27.360
Why are you even like, you know --

01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:29.180
why are you even thinking
about this?

01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:31.020
Just go ahead and do it.

01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:32.770
And so -- so we did it.

01:08:32.770 --> 01:08:35.450
We started publishing a
line called Eros Comix.

01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:37.960
We sent out word among
the professional community

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:40.990
that we're looking for comics,
so, you know, about sex.

01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:44.890
And we started publishing
three comics the first month.

01:08:44.890 --> 01:08:47.510
And then we accelerated.

01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:53.260
And we were just -- we were
just cranking out smut.

01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:56.920
And within three --
within nine months,

01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:59.140
we had actually gotten
back to square one.

01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:02.350
We had actually become
solvent by nine months

01:09:02.350 --> 01:09:05.390
of publishing Eros Comix.

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:07.650
And we -- we continued publishing.

01:09:07.650 --> 01:09:11.670
We occasionally publishing an
Eros Graphic Novel even now,

01:09:11.670 --> 01:09:14.630
but we publishing it for about
ten years before it kind of faded.

01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:15.930
The internet came in.

01:09:15.930 --> 01:09:17.230
Sales started to drop.

01:09:17.230 --> 01:09:19.980
We published some great stuff.

01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:22.080
We actually published
good work in addition

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.290
to just, you know, raw smut.

01:09:24.290 --> 01:09:27.430
We published a book by
Frank Thorne for example,

01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:32.490
who was a journeyman cartoonist,
who probably did the best work

01:09:32.490 --> 01:09:35.360
of his career doing
work for Eros Comix.

01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:40.590
Francisco Solano Lopez who did the
Eternaut did an Eros Comix for us.

01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:44.610
So we actually did try to publish
as much good work in the Eros line

01:09:44.610 --> 01:09:48.310
as possible, but, you know.

01:09:48.310 --> 01:09:51.520
It did save us for about a decade.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:10:01.730
&gt;&gt; I enjoyed your story about
going into business as much

01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:03.030
as [inaudible] and you've --

01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:04.680
&gt;&gt; Gary Groth: That was the -- that
was the most dismal part for me.

01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:06.650
&gt;&gt; It's necessary --

01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:07.950
&gt;&gt; Gary Groth: Yeah.

01:10:07.950 --> 01:10:09.630
&gt;&gt; -- periodic financial
crisis number whatever,

01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:15.940
what was the most -- looking
back, what was the most satisfying

01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:20.000
or enjoyable part of
that journey [inaudible]?

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:24.760
&gt;&gt; Gary Groth: From a
business point of view?

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:30.780
Just surviving was the most -- Well
you know, we always saw, I mean,

01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:32.680
and I think Kim shared
this idea with me.

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:34.300
We weren't really good businessmen.

01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:36.030
We weren't born businessmen.

01:10:36.030 --> 01:10:38.550
We didn't really love being,
you know, businessmen.

01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:40.060
It was a means to an end.

01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:41.420
&gt;&gt; You started this
when you were 12.

01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:43.010
I mean.

01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:46.120
&gt;&gt; Gary Groth: Yeah, but it's --
yeah, but it's because all the,

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:48.450
you know, every other
alternative was worse.

01:10:48.450 --> 01:10:53.540
And it was the way of
taking control of your life,

01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:55.800
a way of taking control
of your destiny.

01:10:55.800 --> 01:11:00.630
I didn't want to be -- I wanted to
take responsibility for what I did.

01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:04.490
And back then, back in the 70s,
my options where I could work

01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:08.270
for somebody or I could
try to do this.

01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:11.350
And the prospect of
working for somebody,

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:12.650
which I was never very
good at, you know.

01:11:12.650 --> 01:11:15.180
I mean, I worked a lot of jobs and
I would either quit or get laid off

01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:17.300
or get fired because
I had a bad attitude.

01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:19.160
I mean, I just wasn't
a good employee.

01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:23.660
I'd be a terrible employee
at Fantagraphics, but --

01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:29.450 position:56%
So, you know, so I wanted to do
something that I could take pride in

01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:33.310
and take responsibility for
and that just seemed unlikely

01:11:33.310 --> 01:11:36.350
if you were a cog in the machine
working for some corporation

01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:38.950
or some company and the idea
of working for, I don't know,

01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:43.150
a small independent company just
seemed virtually impossible,

01:11:43.150 --> 01:11:44.450
so remote.

01:11:44.450 --> 01:11:49.250 position:56%
So I don't know if that answers
your question, but I mean, you know,

01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:53.560
just, you know, just getting
through it was, you know,

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:56.690
a huge fete because we were not --
we didn't have a five-year plan.

01:11:56.690 --> 01:11:57.990
We didn't have a ten-year plan.

01:11:57.990 --> 01:12:01.930 position:56%
We were just -- we were just -- we
were always, I mean, sort of do now.

01:12:01.930 --> 01:12:04.710
But we, you know, we
were just struggling

01:12:04.710 --> 01:12:07.310
to survive the whole time.

01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:10.300
And most of our energies
were devoted to the work,

01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:11.920
you know, to getting the work out.

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:15.370
And we didn't even -- we didn't
even truly market our books until,

01:12:15.370 --> 01:12:17.740
you know, really the 90s.

01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:21.150
And all of our efforts to
market our books, you know,

01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:24.190 position:56%
up until then were pretty half-assed

01:12:24.190 --> 01:12:27.230
because we really just didn't
quite know what we were doing.

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:33.380
&gt;&gt; Georgia: I think we have
just one last question.

01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:34.680
&gt;&gt; Gary Groth: Trina.

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:35.980
Uh-oh. Yeah.

01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:38.720 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Trina: You may not remember this,

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:42.240
it was a comic veen
[phonetic] called Mean Streets.

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:48.270
You have a whole issue of that Eros

01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:49.570
in that [inaudible]
totally trashed Eros.

01:12:49.570 --> 01:12:50.870
And you --

01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:52.990
&gt;&gt; Gary Groth: I do remember that.

01:12:52.990 --> 01:12:54.290
&gt;&gt; Trina: -- you wrote --

01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:55.590
&gt;&gt; Gary Groth: Didn't I write?

01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:56.890
&gt;&gt; Trina: -- You were
absolutely furious at me.

01:12:56.890 --> 01:12:58.190
Yes you did.

01:12:58.190 --> 01:13:00.300
You were so mad at me.

01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:03.880
Just bringing it up.

01:13:07.450 --> 01:13:10.320
&gt;&gt; Gary Groth: Yeah, I do --
I don't remember the content,

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:12.830
but I do remember writing
a long letter.

01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:15.840
Because you know, we did try.

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:17.800
We published Wimmen's cartoonist.

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:20.780
We published gay, you
know, gay porn.

01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:24.220
So we tried to publish
as wide an array

01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:27.440
of X-rated material as we could.

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:31.340
Yeah, we published Gilbert.

01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:35.380
Terry LaBan did one of the
best things he ever did for us.

01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:37.260
So yeah, I remember that Trina.

01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:40.290
Thanks for bringing that up.

01:13:40.290 --> 01:13:44.410
&gt;&gt; This conversation between
Eros and Fantagraphics

01:13:44.410 --> 01:13:46.800
or the main comics
in this one line --

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:48.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:51.020
&gt;&gt; -- does this spill over into
your Tommy Unger because it seems

01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:53.540
like his career had very similar --

01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:55.280
&gt;&gt; Gary Groth: Oh -- Well,
yeah, Tommy Unger was --

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:56.770
For those of you who don't know,

01:13:56.770 --> 01:14:00.460
Tommy Unger is a brilliant,
brilliant cartoonist.

01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:02.950
He was a very successful
children's artist here

01:14:02.950 --> 01:14:05.260
in the states in the 50s and 60s.

01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:08.190
And his career was
derailed primarily I think

01:14:08.190 --> 01:14:10.970
because of his really
brutal anti-war cartoons,

01:14:10.970 --> 01:14:14.470
his political cartoons, as
well as his sex cartoons.

01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:17.780
He would draw these
really wild, I mean,

01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:20.200
highly imagined vivid
inventive sex cartoons.

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:22.670
And I think it was either
the combination of the two

01:14:22.670 --> 01:14:26.290
or primarily his political
cartoons that derailed his career

01:14:26.290 --> 01:14:29.890
as a children's book artist.

01:14:29.890 --> 01:14:33.390
So if get the opportunity to
interview him later this year,

01:14:33.390 --> 01:14:35.670
we will certainly talk
about sex cartoons.

01:14:35.670 --> 01:14:38.510
Okay well thank you very much.

01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:41.500
