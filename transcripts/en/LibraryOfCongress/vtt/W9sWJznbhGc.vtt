&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.290
&gt;&gt; Now hold onto the hand
of the person you came

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.510
with because it's time to
welcome Ronald L. Smith.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.230
[ Applause ]

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.180
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith: Hi, everybody.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.500
Hi, guys. How are you?

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.910
She makes me sound really scary.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.160
I'm scared of myself
after that introduction.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.310
Well, you know what, this
is really quite fun for me.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.630
I'm from Baltimore so I didn't have

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.270
to travel very far
to get here today.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.360 position:56%
And I like to go to a lot of schools
and do school visits and talk

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.540
to kids about writing
and scary books.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.880
Well, they don't have
to be scary books.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.480
I just like talking about books.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.660
So this is a lot of fun for
me to see all you guys here.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.440
I write scary books.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.320
Who likes scary books?

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.730
Oh, my God.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.970 position:56%
Wow. I'm talking really scary books,

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.060
like you might want
to keep the lights on.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.110
[ Inaudible ]

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.550
Yeah. Now I write what's
called middle grade.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.390
So we know what middle
grade is, right.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.660
That's like nine to twelve.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.100
Nine to twelve year olds.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:28.560
But I like to think of my books
for anybody can read them,

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.610
whether you're a little
kid or an adult.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.900
The first book I wrote
was called, "Hoodoo",

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.380
and it's about this little boy
in Alabama a long, long time ago.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.080
And a threat comes to his town.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.150 position:56%
It's a really bad guy called the
Stranger and he wears a black cloak,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.780
and he has a black hat,
and he walks like this.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.950
But anyway, the little kid in the
book, his name if Hoodoo Hatcher

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.090 position:56%
and he's very special because he was
born into a family that uses magic

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.970
but he doesn't know how
to do any magic himself.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.010
So this Stranger is
looking for Hoodoo Hatcher.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.670
And Hoodoo has to find the magic

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.300
within himself to defeat
the Stranger.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.560
It's a lot of fun.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.250
So that book was my first book.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.550
It was very exciting.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.740
I was very happy to
see it published.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.680
And my new book is called "The
Mesmerist" which you see up there.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.300
And it's about a totally
different time and place.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.230
It's in England at the
turn of the century, right.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.840
So that's a long time ago,
over a hundred years ago.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.180
And it's about a young girl and her
mom and they read people's minds

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.370
and they do seances and
they have Ouija boards.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.670
But you know what?

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.980
It's all fake.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.280
They can't really do it.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.680
They're just taking
people's monies, money.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.580
But then one day my
character, Jessamine,

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.060
she really does get a
message from the other side.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.040
So even though she didn't
think that she could read minds

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.540
and do all this creepy stuff, she
actually can and something reaches

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.780
out to her and she finds
out that she's very special.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.820
But before I wrote all these
books I was a little kid

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.670
and I lived all over the place.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.000
My dad was in the Air Force.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.050
We moved. I lived in Japan,
North Carolina, South Carolina,

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.620
Michigan, Alabama, Delaware.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.010
But one thing that always kept me

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.890
from not losing my
mind was the library.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.190
I knew that I could find
a good book in a library.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.830
So libraries were really
what kept me feeling good.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.730
So even though there was
always weird stuff going on,

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.230
and moving every two years,

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.820
the libraries were the
thing that I really loved.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.640
And I started writing
books when I was young.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.620
They weren't very good, just
lots of words on a page.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.420
And then one day I grew up,
got a job, and I forgot all

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.410
about the magic of those
books I read when I was a kid.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.400
I read books like "The Lord of the
Rings", has anybody heard of those?

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.800
And the Narnia books.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.180
[Inaudible].

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.070
Actually, you know what,
I can speak Elvish.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.940
You know the elves in
"The Lord of the Rings"?

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.090
Do you want to hear it?

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.690
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith: Are you sure?

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.990
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.290
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith: Okay.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.090
Here goes.

[ Applause ]

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.840
Do you know what that means?

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.470
That means I got to
go to the bathroom.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.790
[ Laughter ]

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.570
No. It means "Three Rings for
the Elven-Kings under the sky,

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.190
Seven for the Dwarf-Lords
in their halls of stone."

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.450
You've heard it all before.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.720
But anyway, that's what
you call being a nerd

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.140
and I like being a nerd.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.820
I'm a grown up nerd.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.250
And I like writing kids'
books because it reminds me

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.550
of how much fun I had reading
those books when I was a kid,

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.270
and how much fun I had memorizing
those words or Elvish and Klingon

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.500
or whatever you want to call it.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.520
Now I get to do it for a living
and I really, really like it.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.640
It's a lot of fun.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.380
So I want to read just
a tiny bit of my book.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.420
It won't take very long but
it will give you a sense

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.310
of what it's about, okay.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.140
It will just be a page or two.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.500
And this is from "The Mesmerist".

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:47.430
"England, 1864, a thousand
shards of porcelain.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.150
Being stuffed into a wardrobe

with your hands tied is a
dreadful way to start your day.

the yellow glint of a candle flame

through a small crack in the door.

Dust tickles my nostrils.

Spiders are in the corners, too.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.600
I hate spiders.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.260
I breathe out through my nose and
try to think of something peaceful,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.590
something besides Dr.
Barnes, sitting with Mother,

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.010
nervously clutching a
handkerchief or glass of sherry,

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.770
hoping beyond hope
that somehow a message

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.270
from his dead daughter,
Lydia, will be revealed.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.190
That would be through me.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.650 position:56%
I am the vessel, you see, through
which the dead loved one will speak.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.260
Actually it is all a sham.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.100
This is how it works.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.060
We knew Dr. Barnes had
lost his daughter recently

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.840
and when he made the appointment
all it took was a few flowery words

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.480
to begin the ruse.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.050
"Dear Papa, dab your
eyes, dry your tears.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.490

found everlasting peace.

What Dr. Barnes doesn't know is

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.140
that an hour before his arrival
I wrote this very message

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.750
on a chalk slate and hid it in
the wardrobe's secret panel.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.560
From there it became a very
simple matter to step inside

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.090
with a blank one and make the swap.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:20.960
Also, and this is key, Mother is
very good at tying slip knots.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.000
Soft murmurs echo beyond the door.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.680
I picture Mother with closed
eyes, her thin nostrils flaring.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.530
On some days the flames from the
fireplace provide enough heat

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:39.350
for her face to flush, which makes
the act all the more authentic.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.100
I hear the scrape of a
chair and then footsteps.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.980
'Finally,' I sigh in relief.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.630
I want to get out of here.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.850
I pinch my cheeks for a rosy flush

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.440
and slip my hands back
into the knot.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.440
The iron lock of the
wardrobe clicks.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.510
The door squeaks open.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:03.460
I take a deep breath, force
my body to go limp, and then,

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.070
with an exaggerated gasp, fall
face forward onto the floor.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.370
[Inaudible].

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:11.890
Dr. Barnes leaps out of his chair.

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.620
I hear his teacup rattle
on the table

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.220
and then crash sending
a thousand shards

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.590
of porcelain across the hearth.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:21.320
'Oh, my God,' he cries.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.960
'Is she, is she dead?'

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.850
Mother, being a true professional,
plays her part with ease.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:29.150
'No. She is fine.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.920
She has been to the other side.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.180
Please give her a moment.'

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:38.560 position:56%
She kneels and leans in close and
brushes a lock of hair from my eyes.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.230
The fresh scent of her
perfume surrounds me.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.950
It is a lovely fragrance and one
I always associate with Mother

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:47.570
which lifts my spirits
whenever I am down,

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.050
something I feel at
this very moment.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:54.920
She helps me up, unties the
thin rope that binds my wrists,

00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:01.170
and leads me to a long chaise
covered in red and blue fabric.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.650
Mother picks up the wooden
slate from the floor.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:06.540
She gives Dr. Barnes a sharp look.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.280
'The dead do not always speak
what we wish to hear,' she says,

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:16.240 position:56%
'and sometimes their messages can be
confusing or even incomprehensible.'

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.360
Dr. Barnes exhales a shaky breath.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.440
Mother unclasps the slate.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.550
The blood drains from her face.

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:24.850
'What is it?'

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.410
Dr. Barnes asked, drawing closer.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.240
Mother is speechless.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.550
I sit up and read the words
written in a crooked script,

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:38.000
'Ring around the rosy, a pocket
full of posies, ashes, ashes,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.110
we all fall down.'" [Inaudible].

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:46.030
So that's just the
beginning of the story.

really evil threat that's in town

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:55.340
and it's reaching out to
my character, Jessamine.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.030
And she's going to
go on an adventure

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.390
and find out what it's all about.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.470
So she has this power that
she didn't know that she had.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:06.520
But like a lot of us,
we find that when we're

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:11.630
under pressure we can
sometimes rise to the occasion.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.760
Does anybody have any
questions about writing?

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:23.550
Or drawing?

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:27.040
Or any kind of creative pursuit?

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:33.760
&gt;&gt; How long does it
take you to write books?

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.100
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith: Well,
that's a good question.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:41.490
You know, sometimes you can write a
book in a year or maybe six months,

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:45.820 position:56%
but then you can continue to work
on it and it can a really long time.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.240
So I'd probably say a year.

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.350
But the most important
thing is finishing the book

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:57.090
so it doesn't matter
how long it takes.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:04.210
&gt;&gt; What made you want
to write scary books?

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:05.510
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith:
That's a good question.

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.810
You know, I didn't really start
out wanting to write scary books

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:11.840
but for some reason when I
sat down that's what happened.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.790
Maybe because I have
all this stuff hiding

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.580 position:56%
in my brain and it wants to get out.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.970
But I don't know for sure.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.270
But it's fun.

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:22.570
I like it.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:23.870
I like scaring people.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:25.170
But I'm actually nice.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:26.470
&gt;&gt; [Laughs].

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:28.900
Good to know.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:35.990
&gt;&gt; What makes you [inaudible]
ideas of the books.

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:38.640
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith:
Where do I get my ideas?

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.600
All around.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.670
Sometimes you walk by and you
hear somebody on the street

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:48.300
and they may say something like a
few sentences or a couple of words.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.950
Or sometimes you hear a song.

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:53.130
Or you might be on the train
and you hear something.

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.430
It's all around you.

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.640
All you have to do is
remember to look for it.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.850
&gt;&gt; Where do you get the names?

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:01.520
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith: How do
I get the name for my books?

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.840
Well, usually it has to
do with the characters

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.370
and what the story is about.

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.930
"Hoodoo" is called "Hoodoo"
because that's what it's

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:15.400
about which is hoodoo is a
sort of magic, a fold magic.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.800
And "The Mesmerist" is called
"The Mesmerist" because it's

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:22.300
about mesmerizing people,
like hypnosis [inaudible].

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.830
So that's why it's
called "The Mesmerist".

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:29.820
Anybody else?

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.600
&gt;&gt; Are you books in a series?

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.040
Or are they just like random books?

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.100
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith: Right now
they're just random books.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.330
But I might write another one

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:43.360
with the same characters
sometime in the future.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.870 position:56%
And I didn't, I should tell you guys
something else that's really cool.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:52.360
Next year in January there's
going to be a movie coming out.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.660
It's called "Black Panther".

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.270
You've heard of that, right?

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:57.870
Well, I'm writing a book about
Black Panther as a little kid.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:00.860
So that's going to
be really exciting.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.170
So look for that book next year.

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:08.070
It's called "Black
Panther, the Young Prince".

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:13.350
&gt;&gt; How fun is it to write books?

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:14.650
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith: Well, it's fun.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:18.720 position:56%
It's also hard and it's frustrating.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.020
But it's fun.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:25.200
You know why I say that is
because it's a great job to have

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.180
but you really, really have
to love it because it's hard.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.020 position:56%
You have to sit down and not get up.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:35.030
You have to sit down and not
turn on, you know, Netflix.

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:39.730
You can't turn on "The Big
Friendly Giant" or "A Series

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.720
of Unfortunate Events" on Netflix.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.400
You have to sit there and work.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.760
So I try to reward myself.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:49.280
If I work for two or three hours,
then I can watch something.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.580
But it's fun.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.950
I have to do it.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:14:00.020
&gt;&gt; Where did you come up
with the idea for your book?

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.110
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith: Well, these
two books are very different.

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:04.570
You know, I told you that
"Hoodoo" is about the deep South

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:08.470
in the 1930's, a long, long, long,
long, long, long, long time ago.

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:11.620
And that's where my
family's from, the South,

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.780
so I wanted to write
about the South.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.320
And I also like things
like, things in England.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:21.830
Like when I was a little kid the
fantasy books I read were all these

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:25.970
like British, English writers, so
I wanted to write a book like that.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:29.520
Kind of like to remember
my childhood.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.800
But that's where that came from.

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.980
&gt;&gt; How did you find your publisher?

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:42.730
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith: How
did I find my publisher?

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:46.620
Well, that's a really long
story and you can go online

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.860
and you can find lots
of success stories.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:52.320
But the short version is I
worked very hard for a number

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.740
of years on different stories.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.790
"Hoodoo" was my third
book but it's the one

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:00.840
that got me signed by an agent.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.420
So these days you can
publish books on your own

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.980
or you can find a traditional path.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.730 position:56%
I wanted to go the traditional route
so I kept working, and working,

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:12.270
and working until I wrote a book
that got an agent's attention.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:16.410
And once it did, she
signed me as a client.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:19.460
And then, you know, the
agents, they know editors.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.570
So they send your book
to publishers.

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:23.870
And I got really lucky.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:27.640
It was a dream come true because
"Hoodoo" as my first book went

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.490
to auction so several
people wanted to buy it.

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:33.190
So I was very lucky.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.480
&gt;&gt; Why did you like
drawing the pictures?

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.120
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith: What's that?

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.500
&gt;&gt; Why did you like
drawing the pictures?

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.800
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith:
Well, I didn't get

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.100
to draw the pictures in my books.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:50.060
The people who make the
book, the book company,

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:53.290
they choose people
to draw the pictures.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:54.760
So my books are mostly words.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.060
Sometimes at the beginning

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.940
of the chapter you might
see a little picture

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.770
or the cover, like, has a picture.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:05.050
But the writer usually
just writes the words.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:06.350
Okay.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:12.960
&gt;&gt; Hi. How and why did you decide
to pursue a career in writing?

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.610
And what kept you going?

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:17.910
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith: Well,
that's a very good question.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:22.470
Well, from the time I was
your age I liked to write.

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.710
I used to do the writing and my
brother used to do the drawings.

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:27.800
So I would write and he would draw.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.930
And we would stay up
late creating stories.

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:33.300
We stayed up so late my mom
and dad would bang on the door

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.030
and tell us to go to sleep.

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:37.500
So that's a pretty
good problem to have.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.970
But I like it so much
I just kept doing it.

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:42.640
And then when I grew
up, I looked for a job

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:46.490
where I could use my writing skills
and that job was advertising.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:50.350
So I used to write commercials that
you've probably seen on TV before

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:53.770
like McDonald's and a
bunch of other stuff.

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:58.250 position:56%
But I got tired of writing that kind
of stuff so I really kept working

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:02.360
on my books that whole time
and it finally paid off.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.690
But if you like to write,

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.930
find as many opportunities
as you can to write.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:10.080
Whether it's for your school paper,
or for yourself, or your friends,

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.860 position:56%
or whatever, just continue to do it.

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:13.160
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.460
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith: You're welcome.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:17.710
&gt;&gt; How do you choose
your characters?

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:19.010
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith: How do I what?

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:20.310
&gt;&gt; How do you choose
your characters?

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith: They choose you.

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.600
The character chooses you.

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.400
They come around and they
tap you on the shoulder.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.040
And then you turn around
and they're gone.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:34.580
But they whisper in your ear
what their name is sometimes.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:38.940
So that's a very kind of weird
way of saying you just make it up.

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:42.470 position:56%
You know? Sometimes you say, "I want
to write about this kind of person,"

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:44.660
or, "I want to write about
that kind of person."

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:48.400
And they just kind of begin
to take a picture in your mind

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.860
and you just put it all together
and then they become a real person,

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.920
at least in your head, sometimes.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:59.520
And then you can also talk to them
and people will think you're crazy

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:04.370
but I talk to my characters
all the time.

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:10.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; How tiring is it to write a book?

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:13.680
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith: It's
a lot of work, yeah.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.980
It's a lot of work.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:16.300
It's very tiring.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.670
But it's worth it if you finish it.

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:23.180
If you can get to the end,
then it's really worth it.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:30.170
&gt;&gt; How do you separate, how do
you know when to write dialog,

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:32.680
then when to write narrative?

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.980
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith: Wow.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:37.280
So you've got all the right
words, dialog, narrative, plot.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.250
Yeah. That's great.

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:41.830
Well, you know, when you look
at any book in the bookstore

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.770
or the library, you're
going to see dialog

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:45.320
and you're going to
see the narrative.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.650
And you'll see that it's broken up.

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:49.090
So you can't have a book
that's all dialog, right.

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:51.310
You can't have a book
that's all description.

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:54.360
So you have to find those places
where your characters talk.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.940
So you want to set the
scene and then you want

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:58.530
to say one person says one thing.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:00.470
Another person says another thing.

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:04.900
So it becomes natural because
you can't go on, and on,

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.840
and on describing a car, right?

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.000
You got to describe the
people in the car, too.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.250
And they're probably going to
talk so that's how you do it.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:18.070
&gt;&gt; Do you ever write
books for four year olds?

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:19.370
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith: Before?

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.110
Did I ever write books before?

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:23.440
&gt;&gt; For four year olds?

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.740
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith: Oh.

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.580
Maybe one day.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:27.880
Maybe one day.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.710
That's got, I think
that's really hard.

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:33.880
But there are lots of good
books for four year olds though.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:39.310
Okay. Any more?

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:41.860
&gt;&gt; How many books have you written?

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.160
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith:
I've written two books.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.990
Well, I've actually
written a lot of books

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:47.300
but I've only written two
books you can find in the store

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.220
because the other ones are under
my bed because they're really bad.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.520
&gt;&gt; [Laughs].

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.350
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith: And I don't
want anybody to read them.

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.820
&gt;&gt; Did you ever do any scary
thing when you were little?

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.120
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith:
Oh, my God, did I.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.420
&gt;&gt; [Laughs].

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:06.720
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith:
I can't tell you.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.020
They're really scary.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.320
&gt;&gt; Tell me, please.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.620
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith:
I was kind of bad.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.690
One time I rode my
bike down the hill

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:18.920
because somebody dared
me to and I broke my arm.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.220
So don't ever do that.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.910
Do what your mom and
dad tell you to do.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:23.210
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:24.710
I will.

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:26.520
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith: Last question.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.700
&gt;&gt; How much did your book cost?

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.000
&gt;&gt; Ronald L. Smith:
How much does it cost?

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.860
Well, if you go right over to -- .

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.190
I don't know actually.

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:36.890
Well, the "Hoodoo" just
came out in paperback

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:39.070
so it's not that expensive.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:42.840
And "The Mesmerist"
is still in hardback.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:46.260
So they're selling them over there
at the Politics and Prose booth.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.770
So thanks very much for
coming out, everybody,

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:50.940
and listening to me
ramble on, and on, and on.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.240
I really appreciate it.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.040
Thank you.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:59.470
[ Applause ]

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:03.170
