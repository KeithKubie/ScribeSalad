00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:32.990
[Music]

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.930
&gt;&gt; HELENA ZINKHAM: The
Library of Congress is home

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.180
to the Rosa Parks Collection,

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.020
on loan from the Howard G.
Buffett Foundation for 10 years.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.590
Mr. Buffett decided to purchase
this special material in 2014,

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.300 position:56%
when he learned that it was
languishing in an auction warehouse.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.770
He wanted to bring these rare
items back into public view

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.060
and ensure their preservation.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.040
Rosa Parks was a seminal figure
of the Civil Rights Movement.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.360
Her collection reveals how deeply
she believed in a moral imperative

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.020
to oppose discrimination and
the denial of individual rights.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.420
That belief most famously
resulted in her decision

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.340 position:56%
to challenge the bus segregation
laws in Montgomery, Alabama in 1955.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.620
But, her autobiographical
writings in this collection,

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.080
they reveal numerous
times in her life

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.680
when that conviction
motivated her to act.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.880
The collection documents many
aspects of her private life as well

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.840
as her public work on behalf of
civil rights for African Americans.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.370 position:56%
While the 7,500 manuscript documents

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:49.690
and the 2,500 photographs span
140 years, the content focuses

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.510
on the decades of the
1950s through the 1990s.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.360
This includes Mrs. Parks' own
writings, letters from presidents,

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.800
her Congressional Gold Medal, her
Presidential Medal of Freedom,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.320
and wonderful hand-drawn
cards of appreciation

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.490
from scores of school children.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.330
What follows now, are
highlights from the collection

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.850
and a look behind the scenes at how
our team of experts in cataloging,

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.920
preservation, digitization,
exhibition, and teacher training,

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.710
how they are all making this legacy

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.710
of Rosa Parks available
to the world.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.100
We are deeply honored to have
been selected as the steward

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.640
of the Rosa Parks Collection.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.510
&gt;&gt; HOWARD BUFFETT: I think
it's so important for us

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.720
to remember the iconic
figures that changed our lives

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.100
and that gave us what we have
and preserved what we have.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.570 position:56%
And so, an African-American woman in
the 1950s to do what Rosa Parks did,

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.720
showed how much difference
one person can make.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.230
It's important for our
children to see that

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.200
and to really embrace
it and understand it.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.450
Without getting this collection
out of the boxes and out

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.530 position:56%
of the warehouse and in front of
people, that wasn't going to happen.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.880
And so, I thought we should, make
sure that this was in a place

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.930
where millions of people can see it
and benefit from it and, obviously,

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.770
the Library of Congress, there's
no place better than this facility

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.240
and this team to do that.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.620
&gt;&gt; MARICIA BATTLE: We have a
very large collection that deals

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.840
with civil rights and so it was
sort of a fulfillment of a dream

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.500
to have the person who
they considered the mother

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.680
of the Civil Rights Movement,
come into the collections.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.620
&gt;&gt; ADRIENNE CANNON: The Rosa Parks
Collection will illuminate other

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.620
facets of her life, her family
life, her Christian faith

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.400
and spirituality, her activism
post Montgomery bus boycott,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.800
and it will also shed additional
light on some of the details

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.390
of the Montgomery bus boycott.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.110
&gt;&gt; MARICIA BATTLE: Most
people have the perception

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.560
that Rosa Parks was
the lady who wore pink,

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.380
the lady who always had a beautiful
purse, a beautiful hat on her head,

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.970
and she was this quiet voice
that sort of spoke to you.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.450
But, I think one of the things
they'll realize after looking at

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.790
and viewing this collection,

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.050
is that she was a lion
underneath all of that.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.970
She had a way of softly drawing
you in and then sort of hitting you

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.420
with the facts just
square between the eyes.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.400
And I think they'll be surprised.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.310
&gt;&gt; MEG MCALEER: Every
collection tells a story,

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.500
well actually many stories.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.810
And the first thing I do when I
approach a collection is to try

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.830
to discover what those stories are.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.820
And I do this by assessing
the scope of a collection

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.520
and the relationship
between the parts.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.660
The collection came to us
stored in these cartons.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.810 position:56%
And in the cartons, papers were
grouped together in large envelopes.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.790
I've completed my initial
survey and I came

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.770
up with broad categories
to arrange the papers.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.250
For instance, I have a category
of family correspondence.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.470 position:56%
This is the largest cache of letters
actually written by Rosa Parks

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.260
in the collection and
they're very revealing.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.540
One that moves me in
particular is a letter she wrote

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.490
to someone she addresses
as, Dear friend.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.670
I don't know who the person is.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.390
It's written on Montgomery
Fair stationary.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.530
She was employed at Montgomery Fair
at the time she refused to give

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.460
up her seat on the bus
on December 1, 1955.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.770 position:56%
In this letter, she tries to set
what happened to her on December 1st

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.140
in a broader context
of the Jim Crow South.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.560
She explains that segregation
is complete

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.870
and a solid pattern-
it is the way we live.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:03.080
And then she goes on to describe
the experiences of people on buses,

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.270 position:56%
having to go to segregated public
schools, churches, public libraries.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.250
And then also what it was like
to work at Montgomery Fair

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.760
where she could not use the
restrooms used by white employees

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.850
or the employee lounges and
she was not allowed to sit

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.460
at the counter and have her lunch.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.250
But, at the end of the letter,
she closes with something

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.420
that indicates the
gravity of the situation,

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:34.160
that goes beyond the indignities of
the daily slaps of discrimination.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.530
She ends the letter by asking
if this person had heard

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:42.640
about the lynch murder of Emmett
Till, the 14 year old teenager

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:48.390 position:56%
from Chicago who was visiting family
in Mississippi in August, 1955,

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.550
when he allegedly flirted
with a married white woman.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.910
And for this, he was
brutally murdered.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:59.040
She later tells Till's
mother that at that moment

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.640 position:56%
when she was deciding whether to get
up from her seat on that bus or not,

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.820
she thought about her son,
she thought about Emmett Till.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.930
&gt;&gt; ANITA PEEK: On the day that
she was arrested, she was sitting

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:15.750
where she was supposed to
sit in the colored section.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:21.150
But, at that time, they used to
move the sign if they chose to.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:27.310
And the back of the bus was already
crowded so she didn't have to get

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:34.330
up if there was no more seats
further back in the bus.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:39.260
And when the bus driver asked
for the four people to stand,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.780
none of them stood originally.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.280
But after he threatened jail,

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.730
the other three got up,
but she kept sitting.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.580
&gt;&gt; ADRIENNE CANNON:
Rosa Parks' arrest

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:54.520
for refusing a bus driver's
order to surrender her seat

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.060
to a white passenger, happened
on December the 1st, 1955.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.990
There was no media present.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.820
There were no reporters
or photographers

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.120 position:56%
to take photographs of the incident.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.160
The photograph that
is known worldwide

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.060
that shows Rosa Parks
sitting on the bus

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:20.660
with a white man sitting behind
her, was taken a year later

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:25.730
on December 21st, 1956, the
first day that the buses

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:29.250
in Montgomery, Alabama
were integrated.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:33.160
A month after the Montgomery
bus boycott began,

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:38.460
Rosa Parks lost her 25 dollar a
week job as an assistant tailor

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.820
at the Montgomery Fair
department store

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.830
when it closed its tailor shop.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:48.560
Her husband, Raymond was
forced to resign his job

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:54.950
at a private barber's concession
in Maxwell Field Air Force Base.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:09:01.440
In 1957, Rosa, Raymond, and her
mother, Leona, moved to Detroit

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.260
to join her brother, Sylvester.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.720
She worked for 8 years

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:12.180
as a seamstress before
becoming an office receptionist

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.240
and administrative assistant

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.910
for newly-elected Congressman,
John Conyers in 1965.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:26.780
And she served as his liaison with
the black community in Detroit.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:31.040
She kept abreast of all community
activities, attended rallies,

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:36.520
and she particularly dealt with his
constituents' needs with concerns

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:42.080
about welfare benefits, social
security, and job discrimination.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.440
&gt;&gt; MARICIA BATTLE: The
relationship that Mrs. Parks had

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:50.400
with John Conyers was a very close
and kind one, as you can tell

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.040
from this photo that
Conyers dedicated to her.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.660 position:56%
And it's signed, "to the mother of
the Civil Rights Movement, with love

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:05.080
and thanks, John Conyers,
July 22, 1985."

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:11.190 position:56%
One of the other pieces that we find
is this image of both Rosa Parks

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:13.520
and Conyers protesting in front

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.670
of the General Motors
warehouse or factory.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:20.970 position:56%
Protesting the closing, because so
many African Americans worked there,

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:25.350
they thought this was unfair for
this particular plant to close.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:30.960
&gt;&gt; JOHN CONYERS: One day she came
to me and said, "Congressman,

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.370
I'd like to ask for
a pay reduction."

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:38.670
I said, "I beg your pardon?"

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:42.960 position:56%
Nobody's ever asked for that before.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.810
Nobody's ever asked for
it since [laughter].

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:50.990
And she said, "Well, you know,
you let me go so many places here

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:53.530
in the country and even overseas."

00:10:53.530 --> 00:11:00.890
And I said, "Mrs. Parks, you
honor me by coming to my office

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:04.860
and having worked with
me for so long."

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:13.090
And it was no secret that more
people came to see Rosa Parks

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:16.510
in my office than came to see me!

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:24.070
[Music]

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:25.690
&gt;&gt; MARY MUNDY: Preparing
collections for scholars

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:28.800
to use involves a lot
of different activities.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.110
One of the first things I
do is survey the materials,

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:34.200
get familiar with the
subject content

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.200
and formats represented
in the collection.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.010
Then the next thing I
do is always look to see

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.040
if the collection is organized.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:47.670
If there's a logical organization,
I want to keep that organization.

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:50.520
If the collection lacks
any organization I'll need

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:54.240
to impose an order that's
conducive to research.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.460
Next, formats with special
storage requirements are separated

00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:59.760
from the rest of the material.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.970
For instance, photographic
negatives need to be stored

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:06.500
at cold temperatures for
preservation purposes.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.960
Large objects and fragile
items need to be stored flat

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.400
in special boxes fit to their size.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.500
Additional work involves
placing items

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.720
in containers, folders and sleeves.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.180
And every object has to be numbered

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.720
with the collection
storage information

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.070
so they can be easily
identified on the shelf.

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:34.450
And items pulled can
be refiled after use.

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:37.380
The final step involves describing
the collection in the form

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.190
of a catalog record with
subject headings and lots

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:43.690
of other access points so
scholars can find the material

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.470
in our online catalog.

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:49.510
All of these pictures really
reflect her lifelong commitment

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:54.600
to civil rights, her work with
youth and her dedication to family.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.990
This is a very early photograph

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:59.960
of her husband Raymond
Parks and his sister.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:04.260
This is unique in the sense that
it's mounted on a metal frame

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.100
that is decorated with
a landscape scene.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:12.700
Rosa Parks had a lifelong interest
in helping youth and educating them

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.520
about African American history.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:18.010
She started working with youth
actually in the late '40s

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:20.520
with the NAACP youth council.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.550
This piece represents the impact
that Rosa Parks had on children.

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:28.520
And it's a greeting card actually
from a group of school children

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.560 position:56%
that was sent to her in 1998 and one

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.560
of the largest greeting
cards we have

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.950
in the collection from
school children.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:42.670
&gt;&gt; ADRIENNE CANNON: In 1987 she
co-founded with Elaine Steele,

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:48.950 position:56%
the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute
for Self Development as a tribute

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:56.060
to her late husband, Raymond
who passed away in 1977.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:01.690
The purpose of the
institute was to motivate

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:08.420
and direct the average youth
not targeted by other programs,

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:12.670
towards achieving their
highest potential.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:16.450
&gt;&gt; MARICIA BATTLE: So, her
legacy is to instill in children,

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:19.250
no matter how small your beginning,

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:21.680
there's no end to what
you can achieve.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:26.040
So, here are photos of Rosa Parks

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:30.250
at the John Freeman Walls
historic site in Canada.

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.560
She's surrounded by children.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:37.340
One of the things that she
did with the institute,

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:41.530
is they have a Pathways to
Freedom, where they take children

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:45.480
onto different sites of
the Underground Railroad,

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.210
and the Walls site is thought
to be one of the last sites

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:51.890
on that Underground Railroad.

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:57.290
Here we have, in Detroit, in
the 90's, a camp, a day camp,

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:00.100
again, surrounded by children.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.340
She and Raymond did
not have any children,

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:06.460
but her brother, Sylvester, had 13.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.250
&gt;&gt; ELAINE STEELE: When
children came into her midst,

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:13.480
there was a wonderful smile
that came on her face.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:19.560
Didn't matter how young they were,
you know, up into their teen years.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.090
And if they were interested
in learning,

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:25.510
she was just endeared to them more.

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:31.180
[Music]

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.720
&gt;&gt; ANDREW ROBB: In the conservation
division, we treat a wide variety

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.110
of special collection items.

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:38.840
So, that might mean
mending tears or for books,

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.560
taking the binding
apart and rebinding it.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:45.540 position:56%
For photographs, it could be
removing tape or consolidating edges

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.410
where there's small parts of the
photograph that have flaked off.

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:49.710
So, what we're really
trying to focus

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:53.070
on with treatment is stabilizing
things so that future generations

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:56.340
of the public and readers
can use them.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:00.190
So, the Rosa Parks collection
requires some amount of treatment.

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:04.100 position:56%
These are mainly mid-century to late
century twentieth century materials.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.620
So we have photographs,
manuscript materials,

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.370
books, scrapbooks and albums.

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:10.750
And we think that Rosa
Parks or someone

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:14.770
in her family made this album.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:18.000
While we could just focus just on
the photographs, we work together

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.250
with our curators and our book
conservators to think carefully

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.610
about the object itself
and what we need to do

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:26.570
to preserve the whole thing.

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:28.970
A term we like to use is
the integrity of the object.

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:31.840
The album is an album
and we want to retain

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.270
that format as much as possible.

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; MARICIA BATTLE: One of the
things that impressed me is the fact

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:41.290
that she had managed to hold on
to all of the family photographs

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:44.800
and kept them in really
good condition.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.640
Here, for instance, is a
great image of her father.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:58.930
And an early and later photograph
of her mother Leona, with a cousin,

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:02.320
and Leona is the one
seated in the chair.

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:06.560
Another interesting fact
about the visual materials is

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.590
that we do finally
get to see the photos

00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:11.230
of her husband, Raymond Parks.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.570 position:56%
And what's interesting about that is

00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:18.240
because Rosa Parks was
basically the major person

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.150
that everyone concentrated on,

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:23.150
so Mr. Parks was always
in the background.

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:27.900
So, to know that she carried
a photo in her wallet of him,

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:32.380
and that he was always by her
side, just tells you the role

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.450
that he played for her, basically.

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:40.330
&gt;&gt; ADRIENNE CANNON: Rosa McCauley
met Raymond Parks in 1931.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:45.060
She was particularly impressed
with the fact that he was engaged

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.750
in what she called
the racial situation.

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:52.330
And she remarked that he was the
first person outside of her family

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:57.260
who she discussed racial
politics with and engaged Rosa

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:02.700
in the national campaign to
defend the Scottsboro Boys.

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.470
They married in 1932.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:12.270 position:56%
Raymond always wore a suit, and so
he is the man here in the dark suit.

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:17.840
And he's surrounded by
his friends and customers.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:22.320
Another item in the collection
that we have is a family bible

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:28.850
that records the records of several
generations of Rosa Parks' family,

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:34.830
the Edwards', the Percival's,
the McCauley's, the Nobel's.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:38.210
&gt;&gt; ALAN HALEY: The bible
came to us in pieces.

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:41.570
It showed evidence of
handling and tears.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:46.540
So we had to use Asian papers
to fill in those losses

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:48.140
and they're quite extensive.

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.840
We use Asian papers because they're
chemically stable, they're strong,

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.160
and yet they're very flexible.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.940
So, it will integrate with
the original materials

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.330
to make it very functional.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.880
The sewing was, for
the most part, gone.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.940 position:56%
So, we need to give it a new sewing
structure which will allow the Bible

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:10.330 position:56%
to be flexible enough to open safely
for researchers in the future.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:14.260
The spine was missing, so
we will need to dye clothe

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:17.670
in a sympathetic color to the
covers, which we still have,

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:19.800
to put a new spine on the book.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.530
And much of it seemed
to be out of order.

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:26.970
We know, of course, that the
core of the bible is from Genesis

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.170
to Revelation- that
part is easy to collate.

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:33.890
But, there are many, many
pages probably over 150 leaves

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:37.000
of supplemental materials,
not paginated.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.080
And we don't know how to put
this back together again.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.520 position:56%
I'm also working with bible scholars
at the American Bible Society.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.680
So we're trying to find out
which year it was published

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:53.530 position:56%
and that will give us a solid
record of the order of the materials

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:55.810
that are included within.

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:58.680
I think the part that
would be of most interest

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:03.980
to scholars would be the registry
in the middle where the births

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.680
and deaths of the Parks
family are recorded.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.510
It does go back to
the 1880's-1870's.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:16.290
[Music]

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:17.800
&gt;&gt; PHIL MICHEL: Because
the collections we have

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:22.550 position:56%
to scan are many sizes and varieties
and types- some is photography,

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:25.710
some manuscripts, some books,
we have digitization equipment

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:28.440
that can handle a wide
variety of materials.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:32.300
Some of them are flatbed type
scanners or digital cameras

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.610
on copy stands and the like.

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:37.300
Digitization is very
important for collections

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.940
because it really gives
us the opportunity

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.530
to share these collections
with the world.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:45.950 position:56%
Anybody who has access to a computer
can now see and view these items

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:47.290
without having to come
to Washington, DC.

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:51.790
It gives us a chance to provide
an image surrogate without having

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:55.020
to repeatedly handle the
collections over and over again.

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.110
So, they can be stored
in a proper environment

00:20:57.110 --> 00:21:00.230
and hopefully they'll last
a very long time this way.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:04.880
The scanning produces images of
such high quality that researchers,

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:08.560
they really can zoom in and see
all of the details of the original.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.990
Well, sometimes even more details

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:12.990
than what you could really see
viewing the image right onsite.

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:16.410
So we're really happy that
people can get into that depth

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:20.510
of research using these
high resolution images.

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:22.360
It's really gratifying
to work with a collection

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.700
like the Rosa Parks collection
because there's so much interest

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:27.600
in it and so much demand.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.750
And for a lot of people who
aren't aware of the Library

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:34.850
and the services we provide and
the richness of our collections,

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:38.190
it's a great opportunity to
show and share with the world,

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:41.390
help everyone be able
to access and see them,

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:43.510
and appreciate them
for what they are.

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:50.160
[Music]

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.690
&gt;&gt; JEFF FLANNERY: Anyone
over the age

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:54.520
of 16 can use the library's
collections as long

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.650
as they get a valid
reader registration card.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.210
However, some of the
reading rooms, for instance,

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:05.100
the Manuscript reading room,
require special conditions for use.

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.470
Most of the users in
our reading room are

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:08.990
from the academic community.

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:12.270
However, we've had a
children's author come

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:14.000
in and is using the papers.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.420
We've had congressional staff
come in and use the collections.

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:21.690
We have a wide variety of research
use using the Parks papers.

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:25.600
Her papers are here in the reading
room complimenting many other

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.340
collections that we have that
relate to the Civil Rights Movement

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.650
in the twentieth century
in the United States.

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:35.920
So, she sits next to the records of
the NAACP, the largest collection

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.750
that we have, the records of
the National Urban League,

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:42.310
the papers of Frederick
Douglas, and A. Philip Randolph,

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:45.990
and James Foreman and other leaders
in the Civil Rights Movement.

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:49.120
So, her papers compliment
the collections

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.850
and they will gain insight into
the struggles during the twentieth

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:56.510
century for the Civil
Rights Movement.

00:22:56.510 --> 00:23:03.560
[Music]

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:09.020
&gt;&gt; ADRIENNE CANNON: Because
of the breadth and richness

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.270
of our civil rights resources,

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:17.800
we were able to easily incorporate
items from the Rosa Parks papers

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:23.120
in our recent exhibit
commemorating the 50th anniversary

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:27.690
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
a Long Struggle for Freedom.

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:32.060
We looked specifically at items in
the Rosa Parks papers that related

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.230
to the Montgomery bus boycott.

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:38.750
&gt;&gt; CARROLL JOHNSON-WELSH: Rosa
Parks was a dispatcher at the time

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:40.800
in the Montgomery Improvement
Association.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:47.660 position:56%
Here, she gives instructions to
carpoolers and drivers participating

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:52.490
in the Montgomery bus boycott,
asking them to "do not call

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:54.510
for transportation if you are

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:57.920
in reasonable walking
distance to your job."

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:04.420
She also asked them to remember
"how long some of us had to wait

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:07.390
when the buses passed
us without stopping

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:08.960
in the morning and evening."

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:14.820
The second item is a
Hallmark calendar issued

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:20.920
by Montgomery Fair Department store
where Rosa Parks was a seamstress.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:25.810
On this particular page, it has
listed the drivers of the boycott.

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:31.890
And at the top, we have the
name, King listed along with some

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:34.690
of the other leaders in
the first group of drivers.

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:41.360
The last name is Nixon, who was
her mentor during the NAACP period

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.380
of her life.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:48.860
And then the 3rd item we have is
a flyer announcing her speaking

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:54.280
engagement at Sharp Street
Methodist Church in Baltimore, MD.

00:24:54.280 --> 00:25:16.830 position:56%
She was requested by many throughout
the United States to come and speak

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:23.140
on the behalf of the
NAACP, and so this is one

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:37.230
of her first speaking engagements.

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:43.140
The goal of the Interpretive
Programs Office is

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:47.770
to bring the Library's collections
to the public, nationally

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:51.920
and internationally through
our physical exhibitions,

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.940
our online exhibitions,
our traveling exhibitions,

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:57.260
our cultural partnerships, and
through our public programs.

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:58.560
I've personally have talked
to thousands of visitors

00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:59.860
that have come through
the exhibition.

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.160
I've talked to people from Europe.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.460
I've talked to people from
within the United States,

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:03.760
South America, and Canada.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.060 position:56%
They are finding out new information

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:06.360
about Rosa Parks beyond
her stance on the bus.

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.660 position:56%
&gt;&gt; PAUL BEVERLY: I always get chills
when I see the original materials.

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:08.960
There's just something
very authentic

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.260
about seeing an actual letter or
the actual flag that the NAACP flew

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:11.560
or the actual piece of music

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.860
that Charles Mingus
wrote, in his own hand.

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:14.160
Just seeing that just a few
inches in front of you and knowing

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.460
that a real person
was connected to that.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.260
So, it's a wonderful exhibit.

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:21.040
[Music]

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.690
&gt;&gt; LEE ANN POTTER: Educational
Outreach at the Library

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:26.320
of Congress is the unit that is
dedicated to serving teachers.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:30.160
We develop professional development
opportunities from workshops

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.460
to Summer Institutes to
sessions at conferences.

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:36.150
We also develop resources
that we make available

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:37.570
through the Library's website.

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:39.850
We write articles for
professional journals.

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:42.420
And in all of these
instances, what we are trying

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:46.400
to do is get primary source
documents- photographs, letters,

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.190
journal entries, drawings,
newspaper articles,

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:51.050
into the hands of classroom
teachers.

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:54.500
One of our Summer teacher
institutes focused specifically

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:58.950
on the Civil Rights movement and we
were able to include a wide variety

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:01.580
of materials from the
Rosa Parks collection

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:06.320
and we also hosted a very
special panel where individuals

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:10.930
who had known Rosa Parks, described
to our teachers their experiences

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:12.870
in the civil rights movement.

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:16.120
&gt;&gt; KAREN SHER: My students
are sort of numb

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.940
to the notion of the struggle.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:24.580
And I always talk about Mamie Till,
and I always talk about Rosa Parks,

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:28.890
and I always talk about Martin
Luther King and Malcolm X,

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:32.250
like they were so far
away, even from me.

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:36.800
And this week has really taught
me that it's not that far away.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.010
That you know, Rosa Parks' best
friends are here talking to us

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:42.630
about what it was like to be
in those moments with her.

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:47.930
And not because of fanfare or
celebrity, but because of love.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:52.450
And it's something I try really
hard to instill in my students.

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:56.330
&gt;&gt; LILA CABBIL: Her courage
and her strength had everything

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:58.720
to do with her spirituality.

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:03.640
So, her staying in her
seat was her own decision

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:07.250
and she knew who had her back.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:10.710
&gt;&gt; JOE MADISON: She was a
different kind of militant.

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:12.460 position:56%
You'd never see her raise her fists.

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.400
It wasn't the black
panther type of militant.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:20.260
It was a real militancy
that in essence says,

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:22.290
"I'm gonna stand my ground."

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:25.070
&gt;&gt; ROBERTA MCLEOD: She always
encouraged young people,

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:26.370
"do your best.

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:29.610
No matter what someone else
is doing, do your best."

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:33.870
And she believed as educators,
we had a responsibility

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:36.990
to encourage our young
people to do their best.

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:39.780
&gt;&gt; GEOFFREY MILLS: I think what
I'm getting from this week together

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.570
with the others, is that we should
allow students an opportunity

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:45.340
to explore what they're
seeing in a document.

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:48.410
Give them opportunity to
bring their own experiences,

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:49.710
their own lived experiences,

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:52.630
interpretations, to
what they're seeing.

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:54.970
And through collaboration,
come to some type

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:58.780
of understanding of
what it all means.

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:01.240 position:56%
&gt;&gt; KATIE FEENEY: Well, I learned
about like how she really like stood

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.080
up for herself and even
like how they all had

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.440
to go to the back of the bus.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:09.010
And it just like really makes
me like appreciate what she did.

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:12.530 position:56%
And I just think that like what
they had to do was completely unfair

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:15.650
and that it really makes
me like appreciate.

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:18.140
&gt;&gt; MACKENZIE LEE: I learned
that she got a lot of awards

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:21.000
for her bravery on
that bus that day.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.880
And that made me feel really,

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:27.430
really lucky that I'm
born in this time period.

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:29.050
That we're all the same and equal.

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:30.790
That's what I learned.

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:34.980
&gt;&gt; DILLON STONE: I think
Rosa Parks had a huge impact

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.280
on our community today.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:43.160
And that without her, people would
still be discriminated based off

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.960
of their race.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:48.060
[Music]

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:51.880
&gt;&gt; JOHN CONYERS: By refusing to
give up her seat and standing

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:58.280
for equal rights, Rosa
Parks inspired a nation

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:04.320
and became a legendary
example of the value

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:07.530
of a single courageous act.

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:12.320
At a time when our nation
faces challenges, both domestic

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:16.180
and global, I believe
that the example

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:21.700
of Rosa Parks remains
relevant to every citizen.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:26.300 position:56%
&gt;&gt; ANITA PEEK: She believed that all
human beings should have the right

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:30.690
to be educated, should
have the right to be free

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:34.910
and should have the right
to be treated justly.

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:37.060
She believed in justice.

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.660
&gt;&gt; ELAINE STEELE: That's
what she wanted in life.

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:43.950
You know, that people
understand one another

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:47.940
and have that human kindness.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:56.130 position:56%
And, as you learn more about
others, then it indeed inspires you.

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:58.090
&gt;&gt; ADRIENNE CANNON: We
were fortunate to receive

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:03.720
in the collection, both Rosa Parks'
Presidential Medal of Freedom

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.890
and the Congressional Gold Medal.

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:12.640
In 1996, President Bill Clinton
awarded Rosa Parks the Presidential

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:16.450
Medal of Freedom in recognition
of the role that she played

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:18.980
in sparking the Montgomery
bus boycott,

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:24.300
and the role the bus boycott, in
turn, played in evoking a new phase

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.120 position:56%
of the modern Civil Rights Movement.

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:32.050
The Presidential Medal of
Freedom is the highest honor

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:34.990 position:56%
in the nation awarded to a civilian.

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:42.680
In 1999, Congress awarded Rosa
Parks the Congressional Gold Medal,

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:47.680
the highest honor that
Congress bestows on a civilian.

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.540
&gt;&gt; ANITA PEEK: Congresswoman
Julia Carson who's deceased now,

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:57.520
she was very surprised that
Mrs. Parks had not received the

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:02.200
Congressional Gold Medal prior
to her entering Congress.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:06.010
And she worked very
hard with many others

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:08.050
to make sure that it happened.

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:13.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; ELLA MCCALL HAYGAN: Congresswomen
Carson, she was a dynamite person

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:15.840
and she would say, "Ms.
Parks you needed to have

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.140
that medal a long time ago!"

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:20.030
And she would just laugh at her,
she thought she was really funny.

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:21.670
Every time I look at
the medal and think

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:24.180
about the medal, I
think about that day.

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:28.430
&gt;&gt; ANITA PEEK: She always seemed
to be surprised that people thought

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:32.160
that what she did was so important.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:36.090
She felt that she made
a decision that day

00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:40.570
that no matter whether she lived
or died, that it was important

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:45.230
to stop giving in when you
were doing the right thing.

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:49.570
She really believed
in right and wrong.

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:53.070
&gt;&gt; HOWARD BUFFETT: Rosa
Parks was all about freedom

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:56.680
and you're sitting here in
Washington, DC and this is

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.050
where our freedom is preserved.

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:03.700
And so I think that to have
this collection sitting here

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:09.830
in our capital is exactly
where it should be.

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:15.170
This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
