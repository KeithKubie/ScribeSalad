of the library is a testimony of all
what happened if there's a cultural,

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:51.930
historical, and political changes.

00:15:51.930 --> 00:16:01.880 position:56%
It is de facto the biggest archives
of the change in the last centuries.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:09.470
We are, Mrs. Deeb especially, we
are proud of being your guests.

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:14.270
Of course, none of us will forget

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:21.120
that we are also sharing
contradictions of the actual world.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:29.180
This week, for example, we
still do not know what happens

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:33.320
to the [inaudible] of
the city of [inaudible].

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:39.130
Our commitment for Tyre makes
those cultures at the risk

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:41.660
of intellectual backlash.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:49.510
Of [inaudible], disintegration
of all traces of civilization.

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:55.990
But we must also strongly, and
I want to conclude with that.

00:16:55.990 --> 00:17:01.730
We want strongly remember
that if we are all here,

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:05.120
it's due to one person.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.320
And we all know her.

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:11.820
She is Maha El-Khalil Chalabi.

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:16.300
She is the symbol of the Tyre.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:23.630
But she is a symbol of a courageous
woman in a difficult time.

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:27.390
She is able to move mountains.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:34.720
Coming from a mostly [inaudible],
able to fight, and able to succeed

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.670
in the most dangerous surrounding.

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:44.180
And especially refusing
to let the world forget

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:47.780
about Tyre and the vengeance.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:55.510
Muslim world has always
generated strong woman.

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:59.070
[ Inaudible ]

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.810
Was one of them.

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:06.140
But Maha El-Khalil Chalabi
is for Tyre a modern model

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:10.240
of what we want for woman.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:16.060
And I want you as a conclusion to
really make a standing ovation,

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:19.060
we all stand for Maha [applause].

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:25.420
She has the way in
her fantastic way,

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:30.290
and we are on our way
to go further with her.

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:31.590
Thank you.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:32.890
&gt;&gt; Maha El-Khalil Chalabi:
Thank you.

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:37.750
I'm very thank you,
I am very confused.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.050
Many thanks.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:44.930
And now, perhaps, we should invite
you to the opening of the display

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:48.310
of the books in the
Library of Congress

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:51.110
about Tyre on the second floor.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:54.680 position:56%
And to have the dinner with us also.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.570
Thank you for everything.

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.220
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:01.560
