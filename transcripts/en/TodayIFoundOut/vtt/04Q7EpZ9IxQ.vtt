00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.211
Most couch-potatoes have probably at some
point in their lives said, “I can’t run

00:02:16.211 --> 00:02:19.430
a mile without feeling like I’m going to
die!”

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.010
They might also sarcastically proclaim they
must be allergic to exercise.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.400
And, amazingly enough, it turns out there
is a rare disorder in which someone can be

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.410
deathly allergic to exercise, a condition
known as Exercise Induced Anaphylaxis (EIA).

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:44.460
Allergies, in general, come with a wide range
of symptoms, and can range from mild to deadly.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.520
Fortunately for most, a deadly allergic reaction,
known as anaphylaxis, is rare.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.930
It’s generally accepted anaphylaxis affects
approximately 2% of the population and EIA

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.860
is thought to represent only about 5%-15%
of all of those anaphylactic cases.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.090
Interestingly, of those, women seem to be
twice as likely to suffer from it, than men.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.080
It’s important to note that although the
symptoms of anaphylaxis can be brought on

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.570
by exercise, exercise itself might not be
the only cause of the reaction; typical allergy

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.820
mediators like foods, pollens and medications
when combined with exercise may result in

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.260
such a reaction.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.920
Among these, food dependent exercise induced
anaphylaxis is the most common, accounting

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.430
for 1/3 to 1/2 of all EIA cases.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.450
In essence, your body can handle the offending
food, and it can handle exercise, but when

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.300
you combine them, you get an over-reaction
of your immune system.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.470
So what’s going on here?

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.440
Our immune system is extremely complex and
requires numerous types of cells and molecules

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.700
working together to fight off a foreign pathogen.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:04.390
Any reaction from your immune system is generally
divided into two different categories- innate

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:11.030
and adaptive, both of which have specific
types of cells working in response to an infection.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.280
All of these cells are broadly classified
as white blood cells.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.720
An innate immune system reaction uses cells
that can recognize several different types

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.490
of foreign invaders, pathogens like viruses,
bacteria, and fungi.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.680
It can be activated by some non-infectious
problems, like simply being exposed to cold

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.290
or hot temperatures, and even just pumping-some-iron!

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:40.120
The specific types of innate immune system
cells include basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils,

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.160
monocytes and mast cells.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.850
Adaptive immune cells, on the other hand,
react to specific pathogens.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.720
Usually produced by your lymphatic system,
they’re known as B and T cells.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.760
While they work differently, both B and T
cells have the same goal- defend the body

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.210
against specific types of invaders.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.160
Your immune system can make T and B cells
that match the surface molecules of invading

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.510
pathogens, with the T and B cells able to
quickly multiply, producing large numbers

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.900
of identical cells that can recognize and
destroy the foe.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.840
B cells do not directly attack infected cells,
rather they primarily produce antibodies-

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.220
unique protein molecules that attach to specific
harmful pathogens, called antigens.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:33.370
This antibody acts like a red-flag to T cells
(and other disease killers known as phagocytes)

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.530
to recognize the foreign body and destroy
it.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:42.000
Once the infection disappears, memory B cells
can stay around for years, sometimes throughout

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.390
your entire life.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:49.340
If the same invader appears, it will once
again mobilize and attack the pathogen.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.400
Produced by your Thymus (thus T cell), T cells
come in several different types, performing

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.400
different functions.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:01.150
Helper T cells produce chemicals triggering
B cells to develop into plasma cells.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.320
Killer T cells target and kill cells that
have become infected or are cancerous.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.600
Regulatory T cells help control your immune
systems reaction, preventing it from getting

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.900
out of hand.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.130
Memory T cells, like memory B cells, stick
around for a while, quickly reacting should

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.130
the same invader appear.

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.770
When your immune system reacts to an allergy,
it can present with symptoms ranging from

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.150
mild to life threatening.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.719
The more common, less problematic symptoms
are things like fever, cough, runny nose,

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:34.780
itchiness, hives and general body aches.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:40.420
These mild symptoms usually don’t require
a visit to the doctor, and if annoying enough,

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.810
you might treat with over the counter medications
like Benadryl, Tylenol or ibuprofen.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:50.230
Should your immune reaction continue, or become
out of control, it can progress to anaphylaxis.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:56.420
Generally accepted as life-threatening, this
reaction is more systemic and involves several

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.180
organs and body systems.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:03.460
It can produce more severe symptoms like nausea
and vomiting, abdominal pain and dizziness.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:09.159
It can also result in difficulty breathing
from swelling in the face, throat and lungs.

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:12.550
Your veins and arteries might begin dilating
to the point that your blood pressure becomes

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.900
extremely low and you pass out.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:22.730
All of this can progress to rapid heart rates,
cardiac dysrhythmias and even cardiac arrest.

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:26.979
Anaphylaxis (or any lesser immune response)
caused by exercise isn’t different from

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:29.169
any other anaphylactic reaction.

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:34.260
It was first reported in the Journal of Allergy
and Clinical Immunology in June of 1979.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:39.039
The authors described a case where a patient
had an anaphylactic reaction to shellfish,

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:43.210
but the reaction didn’t occur until the
patient went for a run.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.620
The authors further noted the allergic reaction
was only mild and well tolerated when the

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.040
patient ate shellfish without exercise.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.840
If he didn’t eat shellfish, he could run
without issue.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.750
When combined, however, the patient would
have an anaphylactic reaction.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:01.810
Since this 1979 report, there have been numerous
accounts of patients who have had anaphylactic

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:07.070
reactions from exercise, including recognizing
the link between food and other allergies

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:11.690
when combined with exercise- as previously
mentioned with food dependent seemingly the

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:12.789
most common.

00:08:12.789 --> 00:08:18.710
To be specifically diagnosed with EIA, you
need to have symptoms of anaphylaxis associated

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:20.160
with exercise.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.680
The cause must also be differentiated from
an anaphylactic reaction due to food dependent

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:29.130
anaphylaxis or being exposed to an allergen
before the workout.

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:33.870
It should also be noted that EIA can be brought
on by things some people might not consider

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:38.950
strenuous, like a mild stroll in the park,
though it’s much more commonly seen when

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.940
a more aggressive workout is attempted.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:46.170
Interestingly enough, the reaction is also
not always repeatable- the same exercise causing

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:49.380
it today, might not cause it tomorrow.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:55.200
This brings us back around to what exactly
is going on in the body to cause this.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:00.240
While the specific factor, or factors, producing
exercise induced anaphylaxis aren’t proven,

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.330
it’s generally agreed among researchers
that histamine release is the key component

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:06.950
in the reaction.

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:12.220
Histamine is known as an autacoid, which acts
like a hormone, only it has a more localized

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.220
reaction.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:17.600
It’s released from the innate immune system
cells, Basophils and mast cells.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.890
The process is called degranulation.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:25.500
Once secreted, histamine helps increase the
absorption of allergens to the body’s organs,

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.560
like the skin.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.130
Once there, other mast cells get stimulated
to degranulate by an antibody (immunoglobulin

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.310
isotope) known as IgE.

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:39.410
IgE attached to mast cells has long been known
to signify an acute allergic reaction.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:44.210
The acceptance of histamine being the mediator
in EIA, comes from the fact there is an increase

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:49.400
in plasma histamine, along with the IgE being
present on mast cells within the skin, in

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.260
patients experiencing EIA.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:57.810
These patients also tend to be more susceptible
to degranulation of their mast cells and basophils,

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.589
compared to people who don’t have EIA.

00:10:00.589 --> 00:10:06.510
The reason for this lowered threshold, and
the exercise-specific reason for degranulation

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:10.260
producing histamine, hasn’t been proven.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.080
There are some widely accepted theories, however.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:18.650
They include- increased gastrointestinal permeability
(absorption), blood flow redistribution, increased

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:23.800
osmolality, and increased endogenous endorphin
release.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:28.610
In slightly more layman’s terms- exercise
increases the absorption of nutrients and

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:31.060
other molecules from the GI tract.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:35.061
The speculation is then that allergens will
have greater contact with the parts of the

00:10:35.061 --> 00:10:40.149
immune system associated with the gut, which
happens to be a lymphoid organ.

00:10:40.149 --> 00:10:45.440
(Probably nature’s way of protecting us
from the many potential pathogens we put in

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.550
our mouths.)

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:51.860
As for blood-flow redistribution, this is
thought to contribute because, during exercise,

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:57.340
it’s redirected from inactive tissues like
those found in your digestive tract, to active

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:01.430
tissues like those found in your skeletal
and muscle tissues.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:05.550
Those tissues mast cells are different from
the ones found in your GI tract.

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:11.230
So the thinking is that as long as a food
allergen remains in the gut and only exposed

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:15.240
to those types of mast cells, it doesn’t
cause histamine release.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:20.260
But should it go to the skeletal muscles and
skin, those mast cells will degranulate and

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.550
cause a reaction.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:26.920
Exercise also causes the release of endorphins,
giving you the same type of feeling taking

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:27.940
morphine would.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:33.280
The release of these endorphins has been known
to enhance mast cell degranulation.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.600
It seems reasonable then that the aftermath
of this increased endorphin release would

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:45.070
escalate the degranulation of mast cells,
resulting in a histamine response that causes

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:48.740
the cascading effects of anaphylaxis.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:53.770
This brings us to the final, forerunner in
the theories of why certain people get EIA,

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:58.770
involving increased osmolality in your intestines-
meaning there is more allergen getting to

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:04.300
certain areas of your intestines, specifically
the worm-like processes called villi, in your

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.300
small intestines.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:09.500
It’s thought, when you exercise, the mast
cells at the bases of your villi get exposed

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.320
to more of an allergen.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:16.340
This exposure then secretes histamine, which
in turn results in an increased distribution

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:21.930
of allergen to many of the body’s organs,
such as skin, and the cascading effects of

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:25.020
histamine then produce anaphylaxis.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:31.310
No matter the exact cause, the treatment for
EIA is the same as any other anaphylaxis-

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:36.080
avoid repeating the same behaviors causing
a reaction in the first place.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.970
As any good doctor would say, “If it hurts
to do that, stop doing that”.

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:43.620
For those who want to “do that” anyway,
recent evidence has suggested that pre-treating

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:49.440
people with agents that inhibit cell degranulation
may prevent food dependent EIA.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.510
Should you unsuccessfully avoid experiencing
anaphylaxis, I’d recommend calling 911.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:13:00.390
The doctor, or paramedic, will treat the life-threatening
symptoms, like the swelling in your respiratory

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:02.440
tract and extreme low blood pressure, first,
usually using medications like epinephrine,

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.440
albuterol and atrovent.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.590
They will then attempt to stop histamines
cascade of death, with antihistamines like

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:09.860
Benadryl, and corticosteroids like Prednisone
or Solu-Medrol.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:13.550
In the end, yes, a person can be allergic
to exercise.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:17.980
But as it’s an exceptionally rare condition,
should your body mass index be higher than

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:23.410
your age, you probably aren’t one of those
who can use it as an excuse not to hit the

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:37.590
gym.
