doesn't make sense if you can borrow at

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630
doesn't make sense if you can borrow at
 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.169
doesn't make sense if you can borrow at
low interest rates and during the recent

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179
low interest rates and during the recent
 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.820

some of the lowest interest rates in its
 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.799
some of the lowest interest rates in its
history and that's why our debt problem

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809
history and that's why our debt problem
 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.959
history and that's why our debt problem
is not as urgent as a lot of people may

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969
is not as urgent as a lot of people may

is not as urgent as a lot of people may
say right now the debt service that we

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820
say right now the debt service that we
 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.400
say right now the debt service that we
pay that's the interest payments that we

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410
pay that's the interest payments that we
 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.560
pay that's the interest payments that we
pay all the time are at a very low rate

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570
pay all the time are at a very low rate

this may not last forever because

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079
this may not last forever because
 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.410
this may not last forever because
interest rates can rise just as they can

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420
interest rates can rise just as they can
 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.779
interest rates can rise just as they can
fall and if interest rates do rise which

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789
fall and if interest rates do rise which
 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.459
fall and if interest rates do rise which
typically happens when the economy

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469
typically happens when the economy
 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.959
typically happens when the economy
recovers and there's more demand for

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969
recovers and there's more demand for
 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.630
recovers and there's more demand for
credit then we will have to start paying

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640
credit then we will have to start paying
 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.100
credit then we will have to start paying
a little bit more and we'll have to

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110
a little bit more and we'll have to
 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.600
a little bit more and we'll have to
start thinking more about how we're

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610
start thinking more about how we're
 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.969
start thinking more about how we're
going to close that big debt gap we have

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979
going to close that big debt gap we have
 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.560
going to close that big debt gap we have
several years before that happens though

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570
several years before that happens though
 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.719
several years before that happens though
so we can phase in a nice gradual

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729
so we can phase in a nice gradual
 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.149
so we can phase in a nice gradual
solution without making any sharp cuts

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159
solution without making any sharp cuts
 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.820
solution without making any sharp cuts
to spending and without making any sharp

to spending and without making any sharp

increases in tax rates but over the long

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320
increases in tax rates but over the long
 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.200
increases in tax rates but over the long
term there's no doubt we need to cut

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210
term there's no doubt we need to cut
 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.820
term there's no doubt we need to cut
spending a little bit and we need to

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830
spending a little bit and we need to
 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.350
spending a little bit and we need to
have higher tax rates because right now

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360
have higher tax rates because right now
 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.210
have higher tax rates because right now
we have some of the lowest effective tax

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220
we have some of the lowest effective tax
 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.999
we have some of the lowest effective tax
rates since the 1940s and at a time when

government will have to deal with Social

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060
government will have to deal with Social
 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.760
government will have to deal with Social
Security and Medicare to but we

Security and Medicare to but we
 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.649
Security and Medicare to but we
typically do that by extending the

typically do that by extending the
 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.420
typically do that by extending the
retirement age a little bit cutting

retirement age a little bit cutting
 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.310
retirement age a little bit cutting
benefits a little bit and maybe we'll

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320
benefits a little bit and maybe we'll
 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.140
benefits a little bit and maybe we'll
even remove benefits from some higher

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150
even remove benefits from some higher
 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.850
even remove benefits from some higher
earners all of these things together

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860
earners all of these things together
 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.069
earners all of these things together
will help us to close our debt gap but

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079
will help us to close our debt gap but
 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.569
will help us to close our debt gap but
we don't have to do it in a sharp

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579
we don't have to do it in a sharp
 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.789
we don't have to do it in a sharp
shocking way today we have a few years

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799
shocking way today we have a few years

good idea just to kick the can down the

good idea just to kick the can down the
 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.190
good idea just to kick the can down the
road and let the next government deal

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
road and let the next government deal
 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.719
road and let the next government deal
with it it's tempting to do that because

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729
with it it's tempting to do that because
 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.399
with it it's tempting to do that because
people in this government are more

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409
people in this government are more
 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.690
people in this government are more
concerned about re-election than what

might happen 10 or 20 years from now but
we can use the time that we have to

we can use the time that we have to
 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.990
we can use the time that we have to
phase in these changes so that there

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000
phase in these changes so that there
 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.760
phase in these changes so that there
aren't abrupt dislocations in our
