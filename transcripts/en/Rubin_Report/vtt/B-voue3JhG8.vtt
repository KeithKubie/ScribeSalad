1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.570
You know,
they say that we are more divided than ever.
Right?
That's what they say.

2
00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:08.650
Whoever the hell they are.
They keep saying it.
And A,
I don't know that,

3
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.290
that I believe it,
but I thought the best way I can start this,

4
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.110
and it's sort of why I knew the show is to bring people together,

5
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.320
but they keep telling us that,
you know,
we hate each other.
We're more divided.

6
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.140
So I thought maybe you guys should look around the room and just kind of look

7
00:00:20.141 --> 00:00:22.050
and realize how much you hate everybody.

8
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.413
<v 1>Hello.</v>

9
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.430
<v 0>I've been really taken a look at another table and just really everyone to</v>

10
00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:30.910
please don't,
I'm not just doing this for what really look at each other.

11
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.890
I mean you see,
yeah,

12
00:00:32.891 --> 00:00:37.891
you hate them and they hate you and the white people and everybody else and it's

13
00:00:38.381 --> 00:00:41.140
all so stupid.
Uh,
all right.

14
00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:44.140
But I thought what I should do actually is take a little poll cause I want to

15
00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:47.830
read the room.
How many of you would say that you're conservative?

16
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.840
It's by a round of applause.
How many conservatives

17
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.960
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

18
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.880
<v 0>conservatives?
Always very respectfully.
You first raise your hand.</v>

19
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.580
<v 1>We don't make a lot of noise.
Conservative.
We're conserving the applause.</v>

20
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.310
<v 0>Conservatives.
That's good.
Look.
And that's great.</v>

21
00:01:10.311 --> 00:01:12.410
You know people with jobs and families.

22
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.530
I know you're dressed right.
I saw you.
I could've picked you all out.

23
00:01:18.531 --> 00:01:19.311
It's very easy.

24
00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:22.310
Oh well there's someone who's wearing clothes that fit probably a conservative.

25
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.240
How many,
how many of you are Libertarians?
Liberty

26
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.290
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

27
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.020
Very special libertarian.

28
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.490
<v 0>Libertarians.
Yes.</v>

29
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.130
Anyone that just supported those are the people you can get pot from.

30
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.120
<v 1>Libertarian love hot.</v>

31
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.090
<v 0>Just a quick sidebar.
I went to one of these,
you know,</v>

32
00:01:51.091 --> 00:01:55.930
I was getting medicinal marijuana for my [inaudible] black Oma.
But then,
uh,

33
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.400
but now it's legal I guess that you just can show up when your id or whatever.

34
00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:04.520
So I went just a couple of days ago,
uh,
to the pot shop.

35
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.930
And do you think it is impossible to get weed at a hot shot?

36
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.560
Have you been at we got oil,
we got rocks,
we got edibles.
I was like,

37
00:02:12.561 --> 00:02:16.490
do you have a bleed?
And we've formed that even a thing.
I mean,

38
00:02:16.491 --> 00:02:19.520
I wasn't in college not long ago.
Like of Schwag.
That'll be fine.

39
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.210
<v 1>Schwag,
is that a word?</v>

40
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.690
<v 0>All right.
Live.
We didn't conservatives,
we did a libertarian.
How many of you,</v>

41
00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:31.400
how many progressive's how many

42
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.093
<v 1>rested?</v>

43
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.020
<v 0>I'm guessing there are,
but I know because of the soil and stuff,</v>

44
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.470
<v 1>I'm
a little different in comedy.</v>

45
00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:52.330
For me,
I'm going

46
00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.260
<v 0>back.
I mean,
I used to do this.
This is what I did.
Okay.</v>

47
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.940
I forgot that I'm good at this.
All right,
so we,
uh,

48
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.800
not one and no one will say it.
I mean,
we're not going to take,
shoot you.
Oh,

49
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.760
we have one.
We have one.
Typically take.

50
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.793
<v 1>Okay.</v>

51
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.850
<v 0>It's all right.
It's all right.
You're wrong.</v>

52
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.070
I think it's great.
It's great.
Uh,
that I'll let it be.
Okay.

53
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.040
So we did a conservatives,
we did libertarian,
classical,
liberal

54
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.420
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

55
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.710
<v 0>of course would be my people otherwise known by the,
uh,
the media as much.</v>

56
00:03:33.711 --> 00:03:37.640
You're racist,
bigoted.
Homophobes uh,
no,
just kidding.

57
00:03:37.641 --> 00:03:40.520
Those are good people who believe in the individual,
which is what I believe in.

58
00:03:40.521 --> 00:03:42.860
All the things that I'm,
that I'm constantly talking about.

59
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.040
And how many of course to to cap this off.
How many all bright,

60
00:03:46.041 --> 00:03:47.420
and you can just do it by a show of hands.

61
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.310
<v 1>That is a great lab.
Do you have right there?</v>
