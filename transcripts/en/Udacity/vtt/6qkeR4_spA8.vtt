00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.600
But wait, I don't understand. Let's take the

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.220
girl with the heart condition. Neither one of her

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.680
parents have the same condition. So how can they

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.680
be responsible if they don't share the same trait?

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.050
&gt;&gt; Well, one of the big discoveries that I picked up on is that

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.200
living organisms have 2 copies of every

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.470
gene. And though these copies can be different

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.860
from each other. Only one manifests itself as a trait in a certain generation.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.130
Let's use our deck of playing cards as an example. Let's imagine that each pair

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.730
has 2 playing cards each. A six of

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.970
hearts which correlates with a normal functioning heart, and

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.940
an ace which can cause the abnormal heart condition.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.930
Even though one of the copies in the pair

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.370
causes the heart condition It's hidden, as long

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.030
as the other copy has normal function. So the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.070
parent appears to have normal heart function, even though

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.730
they have one normal copy, and one abnormal copy.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.390
When the parents have a child, each parent randomly

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.640
passes on one of the cards. As long as

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.050
the child ends up with at least one number

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.550
card She'll have normal heart function, but if she

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.880
ends up with two aces she'll suffer from that

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.710
abnormal heart condition. So see if you can figure

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.150
out how many total possible combinations there are if

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.100
these two parents have a child. And how many combinations

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.720
would result in the heart condition.
