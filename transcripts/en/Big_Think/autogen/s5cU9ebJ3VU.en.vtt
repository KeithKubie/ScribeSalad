that it used to look like before and so

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460
that it used to look like before and so
 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.130

that's not that surprising but also
 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.540
that's not that surprising but also
really important is how little we in the

and that's fine sure I mean that's I

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900
and that's fine sure I mean that's I
 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.680

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560
doesn't look anything like European
 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.620
doesn't look anything like European
history and if we want to understand

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630
history and if we want to understand
 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.080
history and if we want to understand
that reason it might help to actually
