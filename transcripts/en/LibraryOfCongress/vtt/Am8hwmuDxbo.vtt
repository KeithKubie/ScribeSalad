&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.490
&gt;&gt; Anne Cecelia Holmes:
It is an honor

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.100
to introduce this evening's
reader, Sandra Beasley.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.180
Sandra is the author of
three poetry collections,

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.710
most recently Count the Waves,
along with I was a Jukebox,

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.460
winner of the Barnard Women Poet's
prize, and Theories of falling,

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.570
winner of the New Issues
Poetry Prize.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.850
Honors for her work include a
2015 NEA Literature Fellowship,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.300
the Center for Book
Arts Chapbook Prize,

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.320
and two DCCAH Artist Fellowships.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.970 position:56%
She lives right here, in Washington,
D.C. and is on the faculty

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.210
of the Low-Residency MFA program
at the University of Tampa.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.450
I want to talk just a bit

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.050
about Sandra Beasley's most recent
collection, Count the Waves.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.600
In it, poems create and examine
correspondence over distances,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.570
how the weariness of
travel can code and twist

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.640
and pull at our relationships.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.730
It's like participating in a game
of telephone, but often lonelier.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.670
The end of the receiving line never
gets to meet the original voice,

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.870
or the connection is lost,

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.230
or the preceding participants
have all simply left,

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.590 position:56%
leaving reliability up for question.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.810
This is when Beasley's poems wildly

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.630
and inventively re-imagine
and retell history.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.640
They look around and take inventory

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.610
of what deserves consideration
and what doesn't.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.680
She uses humor in tandem with
vulnerability to play out the ways

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.790
in which intimacy can be
both elevated and flattened,

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.780
as in when I say I wish
to correspond with you,

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.330
what I mean is I want to bite your
tongue across these many miles.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.950
Lines like this startle
us, make us laugh,

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.430
and ultimately reshape
our sense of the truth.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.510
Please join me in welcoming
Sandra Beasley.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:19.380
[ Applause ]

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.880
&gt;&gt; Sandra Beasley:
Good early evening.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.140
At the end of the festivities
last night, there was a reception

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.080
at the Library of Congress, and
my husband said it's really fun

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.840
to see you in your element.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.410
And I said, well what
does that mean?

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.870
And he said, you know,
you went whoo a lot.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.170
And I did.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.690
This is an occasion for going whoo.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.250
We're celebrating such a great time
for literature in this country.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.400
We're celebrating the
leadership of Carla Hayden,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.260
we're celebrating a whole bunch
of people being in the house today

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.510
and just giving fantastic
presentations.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.650
And I personally am celebrating
the gratitude I have for those

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.390
in the room right this moment.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.380
I see friends, I see
students, I see fellow writers.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.770
And in particular, this opportunity
that was given to me by the Library

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:16.860
of Congress and the NEA, so Amy,
Amy's incredible staff, Rob, Karen,

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:23.000
my handler for the day, who
made sure no one stole my purse.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.590
The staff at today's signing,
and great people in the house,

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.480
and my husband, Chance,
he's hiding out there.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.790
All right.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.480
I really appreciated that
introduction to Count the Waves,

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.110
and so I'm going to jump right
into reading from this series,

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.260
and then we'll actually
hear a few new poems,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.110
and then we'll open
it up for questions.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.570
I went through a period of
my life of about five years

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.710
when I was traveling relentlessly.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.410
I put about 50,000
plus miles on my car.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.530
And so in some ways, Count
the Waves is about the way

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.620
that intimacy is both lost and,

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.140
in some ways gained,
over long distances.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.010 position:56%
We allow ourselves to say things
that perhaps we would not otherwise.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.900
And when I was going through
that period of my life,

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.500
many people mentioned that the
practical thing would be for me

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.860
to move my things into
a storage unit,

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.310
accept this nomadic time,
and I couldn't do it.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.130
I could not give up the foot that
was keeping me in Washington,

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.200
D.C. So when I read this
opening poem from the collection,

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.060
which is called Inner Flamingo,
I want you to understand

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.440
that while birds are often
appearing in metaphors in my work,

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.300
these are literal flamingos,
these are National Zoo flamingos,

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.480
these are me getting home maybe
once a month, twice a month,

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.030
and the first thing I did
on a pretty day was walking

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.540
down to the National Zoo,
taking in the open air aviary,

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.250 position:56%
having quality peacock time,
checking on those teenager cheetahs,

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.640
right, and looking at those
flamingos and thinking,

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:18.660 position:56%
what love can I find that anchors me
here the way I want to be anchored?

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.290
And I did.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.710
Inner Flamingo.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:32.110
At night my body discovers
her secret geometries,

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:38.110
inner-flamingo knee hitch,
inner-flamenco arm arch,

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.320
Hermes' diagonal of
flight across the mattress.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.000
The sleeping body is selfish.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.430
The sleeping body cannot lie.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.670
Once there was the man from
whom I always woke huddled

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.050
at the bed's edge.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.800
Then there was a man
who laid his lust

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.200
as a doorknocker at
the small of my back.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.920
The first time I laid down
with you, sweat-stuck,

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.270
each onion-ed in the
skin of the other,

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:24.130
I assumed the unconscious
hours would peel us free.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:30.900
Yet when sun cracked its eye over
the horizon, we were as we'd been.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.970
And the pink of me cocked
her head, listening.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.520
As you might imagine in a
collection that chooses to start

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.600
out with a poem of lasting love,

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.650
if I tell you that I traveled
relentlessly for 5 years

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.660
and 50,000 miles, you might guess

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.900
that there was some non
lasting love prior to that.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.850
And so I'm going to read a
trio of poems that describe

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:06.380
that through line that you
can locate in this book.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.120
Fidelity II.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.230
[ Laughter ]

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:19.560 position:56%
In some version, his pericardium was
pierced, the body bleeding water.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.870
Some say only the usual red.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:31.450
In one story, a full moon,
in another, hours of eclipse.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:36.510
Where gospels agree is
at the door of the cave

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:43.030
when a boulder rolls back and
some woman, one Mary or another,

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:47.500
names that first essential absence.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:54.470
It is April and he raises
his fears every three days.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:58.740
He brings home a bouquet
of muscular lilies.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.330
He waits for the miracle.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:10.730
She calls her name into a cave and
the cave answers with her name.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:17.810
In the conversation in
the signing line earlier,

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.840 position:56%
a young gentleman was kind enough to
come up and ask how a poem worked,

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.990
something about my process.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:29.240
And I talked about oysters
and how, if you know anything

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.040
about the actual anatomy of
real oysters, this little bit

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.990
of irritant grit gets
into the creature.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:39.830
And for me, that might be an
image, or a phrase, or a question.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:43.880 position:56%
And what natural oyster will do is
it'll try to protect itself from it,

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:48.110
so it coats itself, coats that
grit in juice and coats again,

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.750
each layer hardening,
each time, realizing oh,

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:54.040
I still have not gotten that thing
out of my body, coating it again,

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.670
coating it again, until
the pearl is formed.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.310
And what I was trying to
communicate is that a lot of times,

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:03.030
by the time I sit down
to draft the poem,

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.840
I've been working on
the poem for days.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:09.320
And if I'm lucky, it's one of those
perfect pearls, but usually it's

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.120
like a freshwater pearl, kind of
murky and misshapen, and, you know.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:21.440
But that metaphor of an
oyster, that one stays with me.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:28.240
Parable. Worries come
to a man and a woman,

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.760
small ones, light in the hand.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:36.470
The man decides to
swallow his worries,

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.880 position:56%
hiding them deep and within himself.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:45.330
The woman throws hers as far
as she can from the porch.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.180
They touch each other, relieved.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:53.170
They make coffee and make
plans for the seaside in May,

00:09:53.170 --> 00:10:00.540 position:56%
all the while the worries of the man
take his insides as their oyster,

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:05.440
coating themselves in juice,
first gastric, then nacreous,

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.280
growing layer upon layer.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.610
And in the fields beyond
the wash line,

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.690
the worries of the woman take root,

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:19.190
stretching tendrils
through the rich soil.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:23.460
The parable tells us,
consider the ravens.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:28.650
But the ravens caw useless
from the gutters of this house.

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:33.980
The parable tells us consider
the lilies, but they shiver

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.360
in the side yard, silent.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.400
What the parable does
not tell you is

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:45.230
that this woman collects
porcelain cats.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:50.930
Some big, some small,
some gilded, some plain.

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:57.230
One cat stops doors, another
cups cream, another sugar.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:01.360
This man knows they are tacky.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:07.130 position:56%
Still when the one that had belonged
to her great aunt fell and broke,

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:10.840
he held her as she
wept, held her even

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.940
after her breath had
lengthened to sleep.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:19.530
The parable does not
care about such things.

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:24.310
Worry has come to the
house of a man and a woman.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:30.430
Their garden yields, greens
gone, corn cowering in its husk,

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:34.010
he asks himself what will we eat?

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:38.170
They sit at the table and
open the mail, a bill,

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:42.490
a bill, a bill, an invitation.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:46.780
She turns a salt shaker
cat between her palms

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:50.410
and asks, but what will we wear?

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:57.000
He rubs her wrist with his thumb,
he wonders how to offer the string

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.970 position:56%
of pearls now writhing in his belly.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.650
Fidelity I.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:16.480
She did not mean to keep the
whisk when she packed the kitchen

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.330 position:56%
of the apartment they once lived in.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:27.030 position:56%
Night after night, he tried to
emulsify soy sauce and peanut butter

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:32.810
with a fork, before dumping
the tan brown mess on lettuce

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:39.350
and chicken breast boiled to lumps,
good fat bubbling off to pool

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:41.940
in the hollow of the burner.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:49.250
The whisk was an honest gift,
curly cued and white ridged ribbon

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:54.380
from a woman who trusted
overpriced solutions,

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.960
to a man who thought
anything could blend

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.860
if he worked his hand hard enough.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:09.520
So in addition to that
narrative, there's another sequence

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.150
that threads through
Count the Waves.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.380
And I wanted to read poems
from it, because I think

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:17.720
that this was the work
that the National Endowment

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.760
for the Arts was kind
enough to reward,

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.750
to recognize with a
fellowship, which really,

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:26.080
quite literally, shored up my life.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.970
It came at a moment when
I needed the support,

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:30.710
I needed the encouragement.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:33.650
And I continued on this
strange path of trying

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:35.750
to make a living as a writer.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:40.150
In 1853, now this is real,

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:45.350
a write named A.C. Baldwin
published a compendium of phrases,

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:47.930
and he referenced them by number.

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:52.420
It was this code for
conversations over long distances.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:58.360
He called this, this collection,
The Traveler's Vade Mecum.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:04.290
Or, instantaneous letter
writer by mail or telegraph

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.120
for the convenience of
persons traveling on business

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.520
or for pleasure and for others
whereby a vast amount of time,

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.930
labor and trouble is saved.

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:20.850 position:56%
So in a collection that was already
destined to be about long distances,

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:25.380
I combed through this
manuscript, in part inspired

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:26.950
by an outside solicitation.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:28.680
There will be a whole anthology

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.720
of Traveler's Vade Mecum
poems out later this fall.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.780
And I picked the ones
that resonated for me.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.850
So you'll hear, for each
title, an actual line

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:41.110 position:56%
from the 1853 Traveler's Vade Mecum.

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:46.400
And then under that, thinking
about this idea of space,

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.970
of intimacy lost and gained.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:59.320
The Traveler's Vade
Mecum line 7,671.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.600
It is no secret here.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:07.990
Dirt, wrote a British
anthropologist,

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:11.160
is matter out of place.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:17.170
Drop a grape from bowl to
table and we call it dirty.

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:22.220
Drop a grape to the
floor and it is trash.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:26.500
Bowl, table, these
are ordering agents,

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.590
ways to tell the functional
from fallen.

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:36.720
Skin, tendon, thee
are ordering agents.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:42.560
You want to kiss my mouth, but
not the teeth inside my mouth.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:48.730
You want to hold my hand, but
not the blood within that hand.

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:52.850
There is a truth in you, but
it won't be the dirty truth

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:57.190
until it tumbles into
the air between us.

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:04.240
In this city, there is always
a long walk home at 7 AM light,

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.770
high heels stabbing
the subway grates,

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:12.780
a walk home past gutters
littered with the non sequitur

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:19.330
of chicken bones, wings that
once held a dream of flight.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:28.920
Anybody ever had a person in
your life, and this happens to be

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:33.230
about a he, but it's not
gendered, who just consumed,

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:36.530
like kind of locust like, whether
it be emotionally or in terms

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:39.400
of the cupboard, or just
kind of never kept track

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.410
of the available resources
and just assumed

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:46.630
that something would always
come up to fill the pot?

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:50.510
If you've ever encountered
someone like this on your travels,

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:54.520
you usually end up
writing a poem about them.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:00.740
The Traveler's Vade
Mecum line 1,181.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:04.530
The calamity is not serious.

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:11.020
He catches the rain
in his cooking pot.

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:14.110
There's nothing to put
in his cooking pot.

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:17.540
He places a stone in
the cooking pot.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:21.580
He dances by the fire
as the water boils.

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:27.010
Stone soup, stone soup, he
sings, lend a little garnish,

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:31.590
he tells our village, soon
you'll each have a bowl.

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:35.590 position:56%
In go the carrot tops, the rosemary,

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:38.590
in goes the ham bone
with lard at lips.

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:42.130
The children gather,
the strays mewls.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:49.500
Sometimes it has to be button soup,
sometimes ax soup, sometimes nail.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.300
In France, he is a soldier.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:56.900
In Portugal, he is a monk
stirring sopa de pedra.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:01.800
Wherever he goes he
is the clever man.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:06.010
Folktale 1548 in the
Aarne-Thompson index.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:12.190
Not to be confused with his
brothers, Eulenspiegel 1635,

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:20.260
Master Thief 1525, or 1574,
the flattering foreman.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:25.880
He'll never have a turn as the
stupid man, the man looking

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:31.790
for a wife, or the man who
kills slash injures ogre.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:40.680 position:56%
His is not the cat as helper 545 B.
He will never be the lucky accident.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.990
He wakes each day with an empty pot

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:46.530
and the spoon his grandmother
gave him.

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:50.460
Stone soup, stone soup, he sings.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:55.700
The heel on his left boot
loosens, so he dances harder.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.290
Our village is his pantry.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:02.740
His is the recipe that
needs no knife.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:09.390
I'll just read one
more from this series.

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:13.510
So I had to really think
through the reality of 1853,

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:17.740
because some phrases you might
take on one surface level meaning

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.320
for the contemporary day,
only to think it through

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:25.130 position:56%
and realize people were
approaching these words differently.

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:33.490
In The Traveler's Vade Mecum, line
4,234 declares, flour is firm,

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.360
which is thinking in
terms of stocks,

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:40.500
of commodities, but
I thought, flour?

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:45.540
And I returned myself to thinking
what was being eaten in those days,

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:49.120
what was being carried
by those, perhaps,

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.300
readying for service
on the battlefield.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:56.580
Flour is firm.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:03.980
Baking two parts flour to one
part water could stop a bullet.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:10.350
So good soldiers carries their
hard tack over their hearts.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:14.030
Break it down with a
rifle butt, flood it,

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:18.030
fry it in pig fat to
make hell fire stew.

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:22.100
Gnaw it raw and praise the juice.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:25.810
Does wheat prepare
for this as it grows,

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:29.360
seeking the light in
a half thawed field?

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:34.420
Do stalks know their strength
is merely in their number?

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:42.480 position:56%
What is ground down we name flour in
promise that it will be made useful,

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:46.170
otherwise, it's just dust.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:52.350 position:56%
Sheet iron crackers, teeth
dullers, would you call it starving,

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:57.290
if a man dies with hard tack
still tucked in his vest?

00:20:57.290 --> 00:21:01.280
Can you call it food,
if the bullet comes only

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:05.750
at the moment he gives
in and swallows?

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.970
I thought I wanted to
read some new poems.

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:19.350
I might never get to read at the
National Book Festival again.

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:21.770
I should go ahead and break it out.

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:24.650
And I know that, as
well as this being a day

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:27.170 position:56%
for readers, it's a day for writers.

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:29.990
And I'm just not talking
about the people on stage.

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:32.340
I know there's a lot of
people in this room right now

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:35.490
who are drafting, who are
working, who are revising,

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:38.630
and you're up here with me.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.620
How many people here actually
live in the D.C. area?

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:50.590 position:56%
Sweet. That's going to be my
official Tweet for my presentations,

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:51.890
sweet, that's Sandra Beasley.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:56.160
I want to read a sestina.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.180
You don't have to know that form.

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:01.100
I mention it so that if you
hear a repetition of words,

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.880
it's not your imagination.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:08.210 position:56%
The acrobatics of a sestina are that
you commit to a set of six end words

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:12.040
and then you have to use
them in a particular pattern.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.470
And this is a D.C. sestina.

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:19.360
It's called, American Rome.

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:27.830
The dedication line recognizes
Marion Shepilov Barry,

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:33.700
JR, 1936 to 2014.

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:43.940
Marion Barry, jams
of Washington state,

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:47.630
I thought they were
mocking our city.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:54.560
Take a mayor and boil his sugar
down, spoon spreadable, sweet.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:23:00.750
We take presidents and run them
in a game's fourth inning stretch.

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:04.420
We bullets and turn
them to sea dogs.

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:07.260
Do you remember that ballot?

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:12.820
Sea dogs, dragons,
stallions, express?

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:17.860
The Washington Wizards was
no more or less of a stretch.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:21.680
We waved gavels like
wands in this city.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:27.280
We're the small town in which the
president can plant some roses.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:35.480 position:56%
Each time I sit down to say goodbye,
all I ever write down is Dear City.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:38.750
My neighbor walks his
dogs past a monument

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:42.440
to a president's terrier,
forever bronzed.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:48.630
Washington has no J Street,
no Z, yet the city maps attend

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:52.610
to fifty states and a
stretch of five blocks.

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:58.230
Northeast Metro track, a
stretch named Puerto Rico Avenue.

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:04.810
Bow down to the un-mapped
names, Chocolate City, Simple,

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:08.210
Ben Ali served up, chili dogs
served up through a riot,

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:11.260
and Walter Washington was the first

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:15.230
and last time a president
picked our mayor.

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:18.090
The truth is, presidents
come and go,

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:21.380
four or eight years at a stretch.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:25.530
Barry said, I'm yours
for life, Washington.

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:30.040
Emperor Marion, who could
get down with Chuck Brown.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:35.330
Later, reporters will dog, his
bitch set me up, his graft.

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:39.540
Dear City, will you let
me claim you as my city?

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:43.680
To love you is to defy precedent.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:49.510
Your quadrants hustle like a pack
of dogs around the hydrant capitol.

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:54.580
They stretch and paw, they
yap and will not settle down.

00:24:54.580 --> 00:25:00.120
Traffic, the berry
to Washington's jam.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:04.200
For city miles, Barry's
motorcade stretched.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:09.210
We laid him among vice
presidents, down where dogs play,

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:11.970
by the banks of Washington.

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:17.510
I want to thank the folks, thanks.

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:20.320
[ Applause ]

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:24.020 position:56%
I just want to acknowledge and thank
the fact that we have translators

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.250
and cued speech professionals
up here.

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:30.750
It's, I imagine to do that
on the fly is difficult

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:32.700
for anyone, but poets are crazy.

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.860
You never know what word's
going to come out of our mouth.

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.080
So I really appreciate
the initiative

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:42.510
to make this event inclusive
for everyone, and your work.

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:49.630
[ Applause ]

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:54.670
Sestinas are, I can give
myself over to a sestina

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:56.540
and kind of make it work.

00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:01.230
Sonnets very rarely happen for me
unless I literally happen to notice

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:03.910
that the poem is already
taking the form of a sonnet.

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:07.890
I promised that I would read
the poem that I just wrote,

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:11.180
which is a sonnet that, well,
I didn't know it was a sonnet.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:12.480
It was something that I started

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.730
to draft two days ago
and wrote yesterday.

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:18.820
This is inspired by childhood
memories of buying what,

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:23.910
at the time, seemed like really fun
toys, and in hindsight were kind

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:27.870
of peculiar creatures help captive.

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:32.910
I'm referred to what you sometimes
see labeled Mexican jumping beans.

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:43.410
North of the border, we're
labeled Papa Pedro's Jumping Beans.

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:48.080
Past the magnets, next
to the fat fried snacks,

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.950
in plastic boxes of
red, white or green.

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:57.600
Each bean 1.99 plus tax.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:02.290
We jump against light
and jump against heat,

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:06.740
inner larva wrenching
toward cooler places,

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:10.500
thinking we're on a Sinaloa peak.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:16.160
Still in the Sebastiana's
embraces, our cocoon dies,

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.800
know nothing of this land.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.760
We are no one's toy.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.920
We ready to fly.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:28.080
Perhaps these are the
pods Jack took in hand

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:32.850
so his beanstalk could
breach the gold coined sky.

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:37.590
A child can dream, but
child you are lying.

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:41.970
We're bought and sold
for our style of dying.

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:52.830
I'm going to finish
with a couple of poems.

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:57.650
One is from an anthology that
is called Still Life with Poem.

00:27:57.650 --> 00:27:59.590
I think a lot of people
don't realize,

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:02.220
the editors that put their
time and their effort,

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.830
nobody's getting paid for these.

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:06.880
We do these for the love of
coming together in collaboration.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:09.960
I think the economy of
poetry is a gift economy.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.410
This is a beautiful collection
of poems that were written to,

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:18.590
in response to or to create
still lives on the page.

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:23.420
I live with a painter, so I
often think of still lives

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.080
or figurative landscapes
exactly of the kind

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:30.170
that he assures me are
not present in his work.

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:34.920
You'll notice with the title,
I'm claiming that, well,

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.850
title's Still Life with Sex.

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:40.690
Truth is, almost all still
lives have sex in them.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:46.240
Anytime you see fruit, any time you
see a fly, all the Flemish masters,

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:51.190
they're all talking about death.

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:58.500
Still life with sex, July 2015,

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:03.960
but first a skull grinning
amongst the grapes.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:10.800
But first, hydrangea moons
barely risen, cratering.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:15.600
But first milky balls
congregating in the sink.

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:20.400
But first, sticky spoons
congregating in the bowls.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.580
But first that vegetal smell.

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:28.490
But first that clank of
pipes filling with air again.

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:32.530
But first dirt spilling
on your side of the couch.

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:36.180
But first dirt spilling
from your Monday shoes.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.410
But first a canteen of water.

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:41.830
But first five loggers.

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:43.930
But first, Magnum P.I.

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:48.020 position:56%
is on. But first, Tom Selleck is on.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:53.730
But first, kiss me because
you clutter the pewter.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:58.690
But first, kiss me because you
track in the necessary dirt.

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:03.710 position:56%
You see a violin, an ad, prosciutto.

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:07.790
The cat's back is bleeding, again.

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:12.370
We are trying to make
a space a hold it open.

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:17.140
The skull, grinning
amongst grapes grins at us.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:21.510
Those globes of hydrangea
were once bright as June.

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:31.040
[ Applause ]

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.600
Yay for new work.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.940
Even though it scares
the bejesus out of me

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:38.430
to read it in front of you all.

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:42.500
I'll just finish with a
poem from Count the Waves.

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:45.880
One of my favorite things

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:49.660
about poetry is the conversation
it creates, often with people

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.410
who sometimes the first
thing they say is, you know,

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:53.050
I'm not really sure I love poetry.

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:57.430
But, I've had conversations
about capybara's,

00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:59.840
conversations about the
obscure language of [inaudible],

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:05.430
and thanks to this poem, a lot
of conversations about ukulele's.

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:16.800
Ukulele. The vessel is
simple, a rowboat among yachts.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:21.120
No one hides a Tommy
gun in its case.

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:26.610
No blues man runs over
his uke in a whiskey rage.

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:32.240
The last of the Hawaiian
queens translated the name gift

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:39.220
that came here, while Portuguese
historians translate jumping flea

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:44.050
the way a player's
fingers pick and fly.

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:48.130
If you have a cigar box, it'll do.

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:51.960
If you have fishing
line, it'll sing.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:57.760
If there is to be one instrument
of love, not love vanished

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:03.410
or imagined, but love,
it's this one.

00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:08.580
Fit a melody in the crook
of your arm and strum.

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:11.510
Thank you.

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:20.060
[ Applause ]

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:23.470
So I was asked to leave a
few moments for questions

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:27.230
if anybody wants to inquire.

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:32.620
We have two microphones
that you can queue up to.

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:34.590
And if nobody has any questions,

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:36.970
I'll just read a couple
of more poems, so.

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:45.130
I know, poetry, usually
poetry both begins and ends

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:46.970
with a strange moment
of questioning,

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:50.610
often when you get a moment like
so what do you write poems about?

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:52.950
And I always find myself
wanting to say, ukulele's

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:55.630
and prosciutto and skulls.

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:57.040
Hello.

00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:01.020
&gt;&gt; Hello. You mentioned living with
a painter, I'm wondering, I write

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:04.090
and my father painted,
and I've always felt

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:07.200
like there's a relationship
between poetry and painting,

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.440
so I'm curious how that
manifests itself in your house.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.620
&gt;&gt; Sandra Beasley: Well, my
mother is also a visual artist,

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:19.040 position:56%
so I truly grew up surrounded by the
modes and the active work process.

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:23.470
You know, my husband and I can
go to an art museum and walk

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:28.040
through a gallery, and we can
love the exact same six paintings

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.880
and we can love them for
totally different reasons, right?

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.550
I find myself reaching for
narrative, and he is able

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:39.170
to sometimes recognize what to me
is a very subtle level of craft.

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:42.540
And similarly, when he's
commenting on a poem

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:46.680
or a literature it's probably more
easily, it's probably more easy

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:49.230
for him to respond to
the theme or the subject,

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:52.960
where as I might be saying
goodness, that's a sestina, right?

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:58.360
So I think that they are,
they're dove tailing disciplines

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:04.840
that allow us to each enrich and
illuminate the others process.

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.720
People sometimes ask
if we collaborate.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.630
We collaborate on cooking,
we do that really well.

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:12.590
I stay out of his studio.

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:16.830
But one thing I will just
finish by saying is I love being

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:20.250
around artists because they're
messy, so even when I'm complaining

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:21.940
about it, I kind of admire it.

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:23.930
When you go to an art colony,

00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:27.790
you can always tell the artists
who've put in a firm day's work

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:30.660
because they are just,
they're just dirty.

00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:35.410
Writers might, I've been known
to wear my skirts, my nice shoes,

00:34:35.410 --> 00:34:44.130
you know, I admire that giving
oneself over to the process.

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:45.430
Yeah. Hello.

00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:46.730
&gt;&gt; Hey, I know you.

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:48.030
&gt;&gt; Sandra Beasley: You do.

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:50.350
&gt;&gt; I was wondering what
sparks you poetry, usually,

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:51.670
if there's a pattern with that?

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:54.750
If it comes about with a feeling
or if it comes about with an image

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:58.800
that you see, or with something
that you see in a literary work?

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.100
&gt;&gt; Sandra Beasley: Yeah.

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:02.420
Yeah. I absolutely, it changes.

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:03.960
I go through different periods.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.810
So for example, when I found
the Traveler's Vade Mecum,

00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:11.730
that allowed me to really sink in
and kind of work through a project

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:14.910
where I was thinking
about this particular time

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:17.540
and these spaces, this
mode of traveling.

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:20.050
In I Was the Jukebox,
I have a whole series

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:22.190
of poems that are speaks poems.

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:25.340
I wanted to inhabit
bodies outside my own.

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:28.230
And usually my access point for
getting the poems started was

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:33.330
to really research the anatomy
of a platypus, or a capybara,

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:36.250
or the nature of orcas,
which are really curious.

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:38.910
And then that would give
me the grist I needed

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:40.830
to step into that life.

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:44.540
So I do, I get, I get, I get
attached, I never thought of myself

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:47.330
as a project person
and I absolutely am.

00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:51.290
I will, I'm noticing some folks
slipping in, and I always,

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:54.820
as a matter of good forum, want
to make sure they hear a poem

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:56.510
when they show up to
a poetry reading,

00:35:56.510 --> 00:36:00.840
so I'll just read one other
poem that is, answers,

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.060
speaks to that question because
it is the series that I'm working

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:08.890
through now, which, among other
things, I'm situating the speaker

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:11.660
at memorials and monuments.

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:17.780 position:56%
And I'm having the speaker speak to
their understanding of those people.

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:19.430 position:56%
Siri wants in on the poetry reading.

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:25.440
I'm having people speak
to the larger context

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.510
of knowledge that we have.

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:30.860
[ Laughter ]

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:33.260
Seriously, Siri like
spontaneously started up.

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.310
I've been using it as my clock.

00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:41.110
So the idea is, what would a D.C.
person or someone really couched

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:46.710
in American history and the
ambiguities and the complexities

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:48.010
that surround these figures

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:50.420
who inspire memorials,
what would they think?

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:54.390
And I'm working on a whole
series of poems this way.

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:58.980
So this one is titled,
Jefferson, Midnight.

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:03.290
One of my favorite things about
the memorials is that you can go

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:05.970
at any time of day, so
you can go at midnight.

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:10.630
And for some years now, I've
been finding ways to do that.

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:13.450
Jefferson, midnight.

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:16.770
In another version of this story,

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:21.080
he's a naturalist who
dabbled in politics.

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:26.600 position:56%
He reinvented the plow, he joined
the American Philosophical Society's

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.100
bone committee.

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:32.510
And while trying to prove
the great western lion,

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:35.670
gave us our first giant sloth.

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:39.080 position:56%
He shipped a rotting moose to France

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:42.900
to demonstrate the
greatness of our mammals.

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:45.770
He is a father of paleontology

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:49.770
who didn't believe extinction
was part of God's plan.

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:51.780
He asked Louis and Clark,

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:56.190
should they encounter the
mammoth, to capture one for him.

00:37:56.190 --> 00:38:00.040
For months, his sea
wall has been sinking,

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:04.700
the Potomac's mud flaps
sucking at the support timbers.

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:10.270
In 1918 and then for
six months after,

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:12.700
the tidal basin was chlorinated

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:19.660
so that this bank could
become a beach, white's only.

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:25.390
Those drawn to rising heat
heavily populate the ceiling

00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:28.080
of Jefferson's Memorial.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:34.250
Once the sun sets, the temperature
drops, they lose their grip

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:41.810
and fall, bodies bounce off my
shoulders, bodies land in my hair,

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:45.290
guards call this the spider rain.

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:47.510
Thank you.

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:57.040
[ Applause ]

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.530
I no longer have track of
the time because Siri can,

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:02.030
is not, oh, 5 minutes left.

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:04.090
And thank you to the woman
keeping us all on time.

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:06.970
Are there any other questions?

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:13.140
Anybody? Yes?

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:14.630
&gt;&gt; What do you read in your?

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:16.020
&gt;&gt; Sandra Beasley: I'll
repeat the question.

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.320
&gt;&gt; Spare time?

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.620
&gt;&gt; Sandra Beasley: What do
I read in my spare time?

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:23.330 position:56%
So I actually, you might have sensed
from some of the poems I have read,

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:27.400
I also work in non fiction, and,
in fact, right now I'm working

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.060
on a collection of
creative non fiction.

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:32.760
So I don't know if I would
characterize it as spare time,

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:37.820
but the other part of my
attention is to seek out memoirs,

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:42.290
to seek out kind of
experimental or essay collections.

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:44.310
I love reading non fiction.

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:47.420
I love reading about the
science and the texture

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:49.650
of the world around us, right?

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:51.130
So that's it.

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:56.160
And plus, I, sometimes when
people act as if arts and stem,

00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:00.010
so to speak, have to be on opposite
sides, I try to remind them I went

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:02.180
to a high school for
science and technology.

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:03.520
Like, they trusted me with the key

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:06.610
to a helium neon laser
at some point.

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:10.890
So, you know, I think that
anything that feeds that part

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:15.730
of my intellect, I'm thrilled
to kind of nourish it.

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:19.360
Yeah. There's another, we
have two more questions,

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.840
and I think I'll be able
to get to them both.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:22.180
Yeah.

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:24.210
[ Inaudible ]

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:26.820
&gt;&gt; Sandra Beasley: Do I still
have my extreme food allergies?

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:30.630
So, both in my first
collection, Theories of Falling,

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:33.670
and in a memoir I published called,
Don't Kill the Birthday Girl,

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:36.210
Tales From an Allergic
Life, I deal with the fact

00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:40.380
that I have an incredible and
aggressive and severe range

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:45.610
of allergies, including milk, eggs,
beef, shrimp, cucumbers, cashews,

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:49.710
macadamia, yeah, they're
all at work.

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:51.490
I still write about food allergies.

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:55.310
It's an important part, when I
see the opportunity to advocate

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:58.510
for more sensitivity and
more awareness, I do.

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:01.280
[ Inaudible ]

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:03.690
The odds of, the question
is, could I outgrow them?

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:06.600
The odds of me outgrowing
them at this point in my life,

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:10.780
there are several critical
moments where bodies change,

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:13.210
and we associate that
with changes in allergies.

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:15.020
It can happen during pregnancy.

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:18.710
It can happen as a normal
growth phase at 5, at 13,

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:21.750
at 20, I'm past all of those.

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:25.250
So, you know, I'm okay with that.

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:29.070
I think that having the
allergies that I do has had costs,

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:33.300
but it's also made me an incredibly
aware presence in the world.

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:36.080
And for all I know, I
wouldn't be the poet

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.540
that I am if I didn't have it.

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:39.230
So, you know, you take
the whole package.

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:41.810
And the whole package includes
the Epi Pen that I've got

00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:43.860
in my purse at all times.

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:45.160
We have one more question?

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:49.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah, who are some
of your favorite poets

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.410
and influences [inaudible]?

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:56.250
&gt;&gt; Sandra Beasley: Yeah, so when
there, if you, I'm hesitating

00:41:56.250 --> 00:42:01.230 position:56%
because what I try to be honest
about is that there was a time when,

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:04.910
if you asked me that, I felt
like I had to answer people

00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:08.280
who were just canonically
appreciated,

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:11.720
and I'll tell you the
four poets, the five poets

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:14.200
who really made me love to
write when I was younger.

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:19.370
And that would be Langston Hughes,
Gwendolyn Brooks, E.E. Cummings,

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:25.310
Sylvia Plath, Sandra Cisneros.

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:32.760
Yeah. And they are, they are great,
great authors who I continue to,

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:35.790
if you love an author and you're
in the option to either mentor

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:37.880
or to teach, teach their work.

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:40.820 position:56%
Don't teach who the canon is
telling you you need to be teaching.

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.150
Teach the people who you
feel passionate about,

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:44.590
who maybe you want to write.

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:46.510
That's how we change the canon.

Yeah. We have two minutes left.

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:07.970
Yeah. Okay, there's a request to
come to the microphone if possible?

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:21.660
&gt;&gt; What do you want your
legacy to be as a poet?

&gt;&gt; Sandra Beasley: What do I
want my legacy to be as a poet?

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:33.770
I think that there is an
unfortunate and false dichotomy

00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:37.320
that has been created where people
feel like oh, I'm a formal poet,

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.980
or oh, I don't write with
form, I don't do that.

00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:43.370
I don't know how that came about.

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:45.510
Every poem has form.

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:47.700
Every poem has rigor.

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:50.750
Every poem is making
decisions on the page.

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:54.450
Otherwise, you're talking about
some strange word splooge thing

00:43:54.450 --> 00:43:57.450
that I'm not, probably,
going to be drawn into.

00:43:57.450 --> 00:44:01.510 position:56%
Yeah. I don't know how you signified
that word, but that's okay.

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:04.050
[ Laughter ]

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:08.380
What I'd like to be know as is
a poet who can have a collection

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:11.920
where a sestina and a
sonnet and a free verse poem

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:15.480
and a prose poem sit side by
side, and what you're thinking

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:18.620
about is the themes and the
concerns and the poetry.

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:21.990
And you're not thinking about
which camp I align with,

00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:25.990 position:56%
which conference I go to, which
buddies helped me get in what place.

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:27.670
I want to be known for the work.

00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:31.890
And that, to me, involves a
kind of relentless formal,

00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:37.100 position:56%
because rigorous curiosity, not only
about what I choose to write about,

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:39.050
but how I shape it on the page.
