00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.420
What I want to do
now is figure out,

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.320
what's the minimum
speed that the car has

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.200
to be at the top of this
loop de loop in order

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.540
to stay on the track?

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.160
In order to stay in
a circular motion.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.625
In order to not
fall down like this.

00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:15.000
And I think we
can all appreciate

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.320
that is the most difficult part
of the loop de loop, at least

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.240
in the bottom half
right over here.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.970
The track itself
is actually what's

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.960
providing the centripetal force
to keep it going in a circle.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.910
But when you get
to the top, you now

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.880
have gravity that is
pulling down on the car,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.240
almost completely.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.710
And the car will have to
maintain some minimum speed

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.970
in order to stay in
this circular path.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.300
So let's figure out what
that minimum speed is.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.830
And to help figure
that out, we have

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.354
to figure out what the radius of
this loop de loop actually is.

00:00:50.354 --> 00:00:52.520
And it actually does not
look like a perfect circle,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.850
based on this little screen
shot that I got here.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.090
It looks a little
bit elliptical.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.790
But it looks like the radius
of curvature right over here

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.520
is actually smaller
than the radius

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.760
of the curvature of the
entire loop de loop.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.300
That if you made
this into a circle,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.250
it would actually be maybe
even a slightly smaller circle.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.770
But let's just assume, for
the sake of our arguments

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.330
right over here, that this
thing is a perfect circle.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.510
And it was a perfect
circle, let's think

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.460
about what that
minimum velocity would

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.680
have to be up here at the
top of the loop de loop.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.250
So we know that the magnitude
of your centripetal acceleration

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.220
is going to be equal
to your speed squared

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.910
divided by the
radius of the circle

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.080
that you are going around.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.160
Now at this point
right over here,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.160
at the top, which is
going to be the hardest

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.940
point, the magnitude
of our acceleration,

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.550
this is going to be 9.81
meters per second squared.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.590
And the radius,
we can estimate--

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.450
I copied and pasted
the car, and it

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.770
looks like I can get it to stack
on itself four times to get

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.740
the radius of this
circle right over here.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.639
And I looked it up on the
web, and a car about this size

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.710
is going to be about
1.5 meters high

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.660
from the bottom of the
tires to the top of the car.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.110
And so it looks like--
just eyeballing it

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.930
based on these copying
and pasting of the cars,

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.580
that the radius of this
loop de loop right over here

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.220
is 6 meters.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.960
So this right over
here is 6 meters.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.864
So you multiply both
sides by 6 meters.

00:02:29.864 --> 00:02:32.030
Or actually, we could keep
it just in the variables.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.071
So let me just rewrite
it-- just to manipulate it

00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:39.310
so we can solve for v. We have
v squared over r is equal to a.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.300
And then you multiply
both sides by r.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.894
You get v squared is
equal to a times r.

00:02:44.894 --> 00:02:47.310
And then you take the principal
square root of both sides.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.750
You get v is equal to
the principal square root

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.690
of a times r.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.770
And then if we plug
in these numbers,

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.890
this velocity that we
have to have in order

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.390
to stay in the circle is going
to be the square root of 9.81

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:09.266
meters per second
squared, times 6 meters.

00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:11.140
And you can verify that
these units work out.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.276
Meters times meters is meter
squared, per second squared.

00:03:14.276 --> 00:03:15.650
You take the square
root of that,

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.233
you're going to get
meters per second.

00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:20.160
But let's get our calculator
out to actually calculate this.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.560
So we are going to get
the principal square root

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.200
of 9.81 times 6 meters.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.260
It gives us-- now here's
our drum roll-- 7.67.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.950
I'll just round to three
significant digits,

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.682
7.67 meters per second squared.

00:03:41.682 --> 00:03:43.640
And significant digits
is a whole conversation,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.540
because this is just a very,
very rough approximation.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.540
I'm not able to measure
this that accurately at all.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.410
But I get roughly 7
point-- I'll just round,

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.560
7.7 meters per second.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.582
So this is approximately
7.7 meters per second.

00:03:59.582 --> 00:04:01.540
And just to give a sense
of how that translates

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.850
into units that we're used
to when we're driving cars,

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.635
we can convert 7.7
meters per second.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.610
If we want to say how many
meters we go to an hour,

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.769
well, there's 3,600
seconds in an hour.

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.490
And then if you want to
convert that into kilometers--

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.390
this will be in meters--
you divide by 1,000.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.860
One kilometer is
equal to 1,000 meters.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.940
And you see here,
the units cancel out.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.270
You have meters, meters,
seconds, seconds.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.780
You're left with
kilometers per hour.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.730
So let's actually
calculate this.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.320
And so we get our
previous answer.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.480
We want to multiply
it times 3,600

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.090
to figure out how many
meters in an hour.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.145
And then you divide
by 1,000 to convert it

00:04:47.145 --> 00:04:49.000
to kilometers per hour.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.240
So you divide by 1,000.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.380
And we get 27.6
kilometers per hour.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.270
So this is equal
to 27.6 kilometers

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.264
per hour, which is
surprisingly slow.

00:05:03.264 --> 00:05:04.680
I would have thought
it would have

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.220
to be much, much, much faster.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.120
But it turns out, it does not
have to be much, much faster.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.970
Only 27.6 kilometers per hour.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.640
Now the important
thing to keep in mind

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.550
is this is just fast
enough, at this point,

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.700
to maintain the circular motion.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.290
But if this were a perfect
circle right over here,

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.730
and you were going at exactly
27.6 kilometers per hour,

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.297
you would not have much
traction with the road.

00:05:27.297 --> 00:05:29.380
And if you don't have much
traction with the road,

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.390
the car might slip
and might not be

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.320
able to actually
maintain its speed.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.060
So you definitely
want your speed

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.200
to be a good bit larger
than this in order

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.190
to keep a nice
margin of safety--

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.110
in order to especially
have traction

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.430
with the actual loop
de loop, and to be

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.466
able to maintain your speed.

00:05:47.466 --> 00:05:49.090
Now what I want to
do in the next video

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.480
is actually time the car to
figure out how long does it

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.525
take it to do this loop de loop.

00:05:54.525 --> 00:05:56.400
And we're going to assume
that it's a circle.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.640
And we're going
to figure it out.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.223
And we're going to
figure out how fast

00:05:59.223 --> 00:06:03.390
it's actual average velocity
was over the course of this loop

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.950
de loop.
