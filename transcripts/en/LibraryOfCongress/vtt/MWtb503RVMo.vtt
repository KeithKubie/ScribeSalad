00:01:17.136 --> 00:01:19.136

own LC glow.
If you have looked around we are

00:01:42.092 --> 00:01:43.523
surrounded by a lot of young 
people.

00:01:43.524 --> 00:01:44.348
The conversation tonight is 
about LGBTQ issues for young 

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:46.349
adults.

00:01:48.762 --> 00:01:51.466
We are welcoming all the youth 
groups in the Washington D.C. 

00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:53.326

[applause] Raise of hands, which
one of you, this is your first 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.134
time to the Library of Congress?
That's pretty good, usually have

00:02:14.135 --> 00:02:16.135
two thirds of the audience raise
her hand.

00:02:16.773 --> 00:02:18.773
Her most of you you've been here
before 

00:02:19.822 --> 00:02:20.264
and hoping you've seen a 
beautiful building of what this 

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:22.265
is.

00:02:23.902 --> 00:02:26.591
There's more to this building 
and that main meeting room.

00:02:27.617 --> 00:02:29.283
We are whole lot more than 
books.

00:02:29.284 --> 00:02:30.301
We are trying to do the library 
now is bus the treasure chest 

00:02:30.302 --> 00:02:32.302
open so you only what the 
library has.

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:35.597
We are more than that feeling, 
we are more than books.

00:02:36.598 --> 00:02:38.598
We have the collection of 23 
presidents 

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:41.723
which includes the contents of 
Abraham Lincoln's caucus during 

00:02:41.724 --> 00:02:43.724
his 

00:02:45.336 --> 00:02:47.336
assassination, George 

00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:52.041
Washington's handwriting, 
Abraham Lincoln's address.

00:02:52.353 --> 00:02:54.353
There's a lot of treasures but 
there's 

00:02:55.768 --> 00:02:57.768
more than historical Documents.

00:03:01.092 --> 00:03:03.092
We have Roger and 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:06.609
Hammerstein.

00:03:08.637 --> 00:03:10.637
Someday you may feel future 

00:03:12.154 --> 00:03:14.154
Leonard Bernstein.

00:03:15.586 --> 00:03:17.915
Please welcome from Netflix the 
director of North American 

00:03:21.323 --> 00:03:23.323
public policy Miss Corey 

00:03:27.723 --> 00:03:29.723
Wright.

00:03:30.982 --> 00:03:32.008
&gt;&gt; Hi everybody good night.
Thank you for being here this 

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:36.296
evening.
I am Corey Wright I work on 

00:03:36.297 --> 00:03:39.664
North America public policy on 
behalf of Netflix and my team 

00:03:39.665 --> 00:03:41.665
here we appreciate you coming 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:43.953
out this evening.
I have if you think use of my 

00:03:43.954 --> 00:03:45.954
own to make.

00:03:47.976 --> 00:03:50.899
I hope you will bear with me.
Thank you to Roswell and his 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.900
team at the Library of Congress 
to host is here.

00:03:52.936 --> 00:03:55.392
If you have a chance yet to 
check out the amazing artifacts 

00:03:55.393 --> 00:03:56.407
in library collection they are 
right outside of the theater 

00:03:56.408 --> 00:03:58.408
when this is through.

00:03:59.894 --> 00:04:01.112
Thinking of course to the LGBTQ 
low class for partnering with 

00:04:01.113 --> 00:04:03.756
us.
We are really happy for such an 

00:04:03.757 --> 00:04:05.757
amazing turnout tonight.

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.887
Of course the amazing a cappella
performance was gorgeous.

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.789
[applause] Last, but never least
the number of Congress were able

00:04:21.522 --> 00:04:23.132
to join us here this evening we 
really appreciate your presence 

00:04:23.133 --> 00:04:25.787
and your dedication to these 
important issues.

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:29.399
At Netflix we work really hard 
provide a 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:32.757
stage for the world's most 
compelling stories and 

00:04:32.758 --> 00:04:34.758
storytellers.

00:04:36.205 --> 00:04:36.610
See can find something that 
engages you and speaks to you.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.230
You'll have that moment where we
find that movie or that T.V.

00:04:44.753 --> 00:04:46.753
show that is just what you need,
just when you need it.

00:04:47.952 --> 00:04:51.866
For me, Queer Eye is that show.
It's so easy when you turn on 

00:04:51.867 --> 00:04:56.529
your T.V. or you look at your 
phone to be overwhelmed by the 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.530
negativity, but just 

00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:03.887
when you need it the Fab five 
remind you that a little 

00:05:03.888 --> 00:05:05.526
understanding, a little 
compassion in the French talk 

00:05:05.527 --> 00:05:07.527
can 

00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:13.239
really help the world feel a 
whole lot better.

00:05:14.664 --> 00:05:16.664
[applause] I work for Netflix 
are not 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.290
supposed to have favorites, but 
if I 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:22.785
did, Queer Eye would be one of 
them and judging by the turnout 

00:05:22.786 --> 00:05:24.786
tonight I suspect a few of you 
feel the same way.

00:05:27.051 --> 00:05:28.676
We really appreciate you having 
you here tonight.

00:05:28.677 --> 00:05:30.677
We hope you enjoy the panel and 
thanks again.

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:36.076
[applause] 
&gt;&gt; All right, I know you getting

00:05:36.077 --> 00:05:38.077
sick of 

00:05:39.496 --> 00:05:41.369
me so it's time.
Monitoring tonight's discussion 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.370
is 

00:05:44.794 --> 00:05:47.308
Pulitzer prize-winning 
journalist Jonathan Capehart at 

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:49.309
the Washington Post.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.385
You also see him at MSNBC.
It's hard to believe it's been a

00:05:51.386 --> 00:05:53.386
year since we been introduced to
the Fab five.

00:05:55.451 --> 00:05:56.451
Since then we have learned to 
French Tucker shirts, remind 

00:05:56.452 --> 00:06:00.391
yourselves too much stress every
day but most importantly to love

00:06:00.392 --> 00:06:01.410
ourselves more.
We met every day Americans 

00:06:01.411 --> 00:06:03.411
become 

00:06:04.473 --> 00:06:07.343
inspirations and heroes like 
Palm of Georgia, mama Tammy of 

00:06:07.344 --> 00:06:09.344
gay Georgia, Jess 

00:06:10.603 --> 00:06:12.603
of Kansas and the Jones sisters 
of Missouri.

00:06:20.211 --> 00:06:21.023
[applause] You have to admit 
this one, through three seasons 

00:06:21.024 --> 00:06:23.024
we have all laughed and all 
cried.

00:06:23.056 --> 00:06:24.082
Please welcome to Washington and
to the Library of Congress the 

00:06:24.083 --> 00:06:26.083
cast of Netflix 

00:06:29.128 --> 00:06:31.609
Queer Eye Bobby Burke, Jonathan 
brightness and Jonathan 

00:06:34.627 --> 00:06:36.627
K 

00:06:55.535 --> 00:06:57.535
Capehart.

00:07:14.518 --> 00:07:16.518
[music] [crosstalk] 

00:07:20.902 --> 00:07:22.902
&gt;&gt; That was good content.

00:07:24.517 --> 00:07:26.249
&gt;&gt; I was too late.
You've all been introduced, I 

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.250
assume you have been introduced.

00:07:32.912 --> 00:07:34.912
I'm Jonathan 

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:41.105
Capehart from MSNBC.
Thank you to the library of 

00:07:41.106 --> 00:07:43.546
Congress were holding his 
incredible gathering of these 

00:07:43.547 --> 00:07:45.547
incredible men who have given us
an incredible show.

00:07:46.204 --> 00:07:48.204
As you can see here I have 
questions.

00:07:50.224 --> 00:07:52.224
You know what, I will put this 
aside 

00:07:55.188 --> 00:07:56.213
because I don't know if you know
this, but we asked the audience 

00:07:56.214 --> 00:07:58.214
to submit 

00:07:59.683 --> 00:08:01.683
questions and so, I have them 
right here.

00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:04.148
I'm going to ask the questions 
that have come from the 

00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:06.149
audience.

00:08:07.559 --> 00:08:09.627
The first one â€“ if you hear 
your name it's almost like the 

00:08:09.628 --> 00:08:11.628
price is right.

00:08:13.047 --> 00:08:15.047
If you hear your 

00:08:16.317 --> 00:08:18.611
name no coming on down.
I hate to be the buzz kill, but 

00:08:18.612 --> 00:08:20.612
scream 

00:08:22.443 --> 00:08:26.416
so we know where you are.
Thank you!

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.400
Sally Morgan.

00:08:35.744 --> 00:08:38.250
[applause] Sally Morgan is 12 
years old.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.250
&gt;&gt; Hi Sally Morgan!

00:08:45.524 --> 00:08:47.524
June 

00:08:55.167 --> 00:08:56.791
[crosstalk] Sally Morgan 12 
years old, how can kids be more 

00:08:56.792 --> 00:08:58.792
confident in themselves?

00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:02.399
PS it's pronounced 

00:09:05.637 --> 00:09:07.637
squirrel!

00:09:14.467 --> 00:09:16.467
[applause] 

00:09:18.336 --> 00:09:20.336
&gt;&gt; That's why I didn't strike 
you.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:22.590
[laughter] 
&gt;&gt; That's a gorgeous question.

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:30.189
I think confidence is so easily 
swayed 

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.640
by comparing your experience of 
other 

00:09:37.265 --> 00:09:38.946
people in comparison in general.
What is the most sure thing you 

00:09:38.947 --> 00:09:41.590
will ever have is your 
relationship with yourself.

00:09:42.607 --> 00:09:44.607
As you proceed in your education
in your 

00:09:47.154 --> 00:09:48.156
life the more you can love and 
accept yourself the more other 

00:09:48.157 --> 00:09:50.157
people's opinions and goings-on 
of the world 

00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:54.634
won't rock your opinion of 
yourself so much.

00:09:56.458 --> 00:09:58.458
And then honey you are confident
you 

00:10:03.755 --> 00:10:04.738
know?
&gt;&gt; I just want to add to that I 

00:10:04.739 --> 00:10:07.225
think in education helps as 
well, not only the education you

00:10:07.226 --> 00:10:09.226
get in school but also leaning 
into things that you are 

00:10:11.258 --> 00:10:13.758
passionate about and where your 
interests are and just learning 

00:10:13.759 --> 00:10:14.792
how to nurture those.
The more you know about 

00:10:14.793 --> 00:10:16.793
something the 

00:10:18.108 --> 00:10:18.699
less fearful you are in the more
confident you will be in 

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.167
yourself.
Whatever that is for you whether

00:10:20.168 --> 00:10:22.440
it's music, art, history.
Whatever it is.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.117
Find people of similar passions.
&gt;&gt; What about math?

00:10:29.724 --> 00:10:31.206
Don't forget about math.
&gt;&gt; The jury is still out on 

00:10:31.207 --> 00:10:32.211
math.
All the other things I think 

00:10:32.212 --> 00:10:34.212
have pretty much been proven.

00:10:39.163 --> 00:10:40.777
[laughter] 
&gt;&gt; Can I ask something about the

00:10:40.778 --> 00:10:42.778
show before I go to the next 
audience question?

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.640
It seems as though y'all have 
been 

00:10:47.667 --> 00:10:49.667
friends forever.

00:10:52.126 --> 00:10:54.126
The chemistry between all of 

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:58.230
you, all five of 

00:10:59.508 --> 00:11:01.508
you feel 

00:11:03.061 --> 00:11:04.497
like, binging on the show it 
feels like a been dropped into 

00:11:04.498 --> 00:11:05.512
these well-formed relationships.
How long did it take to get to 

00:11:05.513 --> 00:11:07.513
know each other?

00:11:09.366 --> 00:11:11.428
&gt;&gt; During casting there was 
about 40 when we finally came in

00:11:11.429 --> 00:11:14.142
together.
The five of us within the first 

00:11:14.143 --> 00:11:16.143
day, day and a half all found 
each other.

00:11:18.757 --> 00:11:20.757
Even before your cast we 
instantly felt a connection to 

00:11:21.256 --> 00:11:23.256
each other and I think the 
producer saw that.

00:11:24.875 --> 00:11:26.875
It was very natural for 

00:11:28.395 --> 00:11:29.802
us to be inquisitive about each 
other and learn more into like 

00:11:29.803 --> 00:11:30.862
each other because we 
automatically liked each other.

00:11:30.863 --> 00:11:32.863
When you're catapulted into 
filming a 

00:11:35.349 --> 00:11:36.789
show together we are together 24
77 days a week you spend more 

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:38.790
time with each 

00:11:40.088 --> 00:11:42.088
other and some people spend an 
entire lifetime.

00:11:44.127 --> 00:11:46.127
We have learned so much about 
each 

00:11:48.034 --> 00:11:49.063
other.
The good, the bad, the pretty 

00:11:49.064 --> 00:11:51.064
and the ugly.
The everything.

00:11:51.118 --> 00:11:51.524
It's made us have the type of 
chemistry that you can't 

00:11:51.525 --> 00:11:53.525
manufacture.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.560
&gt;&gt; Do you have a pet peeve about
the other?

00:11:59.334 --> 00:12:01.966
&gt;&gt; Jonathan was asking about a 
pet peeve and this is where you 

00:12:01.967 --> 00:12:03.967
let him know about 

00:12:04.985 --> 00:12:06.985
the temperature.

00:12:11.497 --> 00:12:15.068
&gt;&gt; Stay on your side.
&gt;&gt; The only pet peeve we have 

00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:17.069
onset 

00:12:18.775 --> 00:12:21.768
really, the only time we argue 
is with the 

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.370
temperature.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.098
&gt;&gt; Bobby runs very hot.
[laughter] 

00:12:34.128 --> 00:12:36.128
&gt;&gt; Put the mic down.

00:12:38.348 --> 00:12:40.348
Take his 

00:12:46.814 --> 00:12:47.825
Mike!
Jonathan always wants to wear 

00:12:47.826 --> 00:12:49.826
something 

00:12:51.882 --> 00:12:54.182
that may not be always 
seasonably appropriate.

00:12:57.809 --> 00:12:59.809
Those three are a 

00:13:04.864 --> 00:13:05.891
nightmare.
&gt;&gt; We are the easy-going ones.

00:13:09.901 --> 00:13:11.901
&gt;&gt; Or any of my long hair people
out there?

00:13:12.864 --> 00:13:13.883
You get very sweaty in your hair
is freshly blown dry in here six

00:13:13.884 --> 00:13:15.884
together and you get the dreaded
Bermuda triangle.

00:13:16.329 --> 00:13:18.329
Which is like this triangle of 
skin that 

00:13:19.338 --> 00:13:21.019
flashes out.
You have your hair parted in the

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:23.460
middle on the side in your scalp
sticks out and this is my 

00:13:23.461 --> 00:13:25.519
nightmare because the writings 
on the wall.

00:13:28.396 --> 00:13:30.396
My mom graduated high school 
with no hair.

00:13:30.488 --> 00:13:32.488
I'm living on borrowed time.

00:13:34.091 --> 00:13:36.609
That's why get worried.
It's not the temperature is 

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.610
sweating in the hair sticking 
together.

00:13:40.954 --> 00:13:41.978
If I had to volume it and I had 
a gorgeous cough like you I 

00:13:41.979 --> 00:13:44.277
would not worry about my sweaty 
forehead.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.280
You don't know what it's 

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.233
like.
Rebecca York we just work 

00:13:54.234 --> 00:13:56.234
through it.
Hi Rebecca.

00:13:57.871 --> 00:14:01.167
Rebecca asked, Queer Eye 
highlights the positive in our 

00:14:01.168 --> 00:14:03.168
society and how we can build 
bridges across difference.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.840
While that is important it 
brings up 

00:14:10.179 --> 00:14:12.179
some real issues that actively 
affect LGBTQ.

00:14:13.614 --> 00:14:15.753
In your opinion, what are the 
most pressing issues for youth 

00:14:15.754 --> 00:14:17.754
in our community and 

00:14:18.812 --> 00:14:20.812
what best can we, especially the
members 

00:14:22.408 --> 00:14:24.408
of Congress in the room, and 
pointing at you Sean Maloney 

00:14:27.766 --> 00:14:29.766
of New York, what can they take 
to do better for our youth?

00:14:33.435 --> 00:14:35.435
&gt;&gt; I think that there is a 
laundry list, 

00:14:36.464 --> 00:14:39.362
but to get started I think to 
started off, if you 

00:14:42.367 --> 00:14:45.148
look at LGBTQ youth growing up 
today it's 

00:14:48.564 --> 00:14:51.351
based on the assurance and 
confidence that their 

00:14:51.352 --> 00:14:53.352
heterosexual or 

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.760
gendered counterparts 

00:14:59.093 --> 00:15:00.119
felt basic civil rights.
That affects you on a macro 

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.372
level of how you are perceived 
by society and also on a 

00:15:03.373 --> 00:15:05.373
personal level of what your 
self-worth 

00:15:08.904 --> 00:15:09.920
is.
&gt;&gt; The equality act is what he 

00:15:09.921 --> 00:15:12.919
is talking 

00:15:19.679 --> 00:15:21.114
about.
&gt;&gt; In making sure this country 

00:15:21.115 --> 00:15:23.115
has a system in place.

00:15:26.823 --> 00:15:27.857
You can have demonstration in 
schools but also guns are huge 

00:15:27.858 --> 00:15:29.858
issue for people 

00:15:31.103 --> 00:15:33.103
in high school in this country.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.988
[cheering] The targeted 
discrimination that the 

00:15:42.989 --> 00:15:44.599
transgender community continues 
to face and how that affects 

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.600
people's education is also 
relevant.

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:51.771
Let's get out there!
Sorry, I love you guys so much.

00:15:51.772 --> 00:15:53.772
You may disagree but you don't 
have to leave.

00:15:55.689 --> 00:15:56.694
Give us an hour!
I think one of the most 

00:15:56.695 --> 00:16:00.818
important things, a lot of times
people say you're going into 

00:16:00.819 --> 00:16:02.819
these very conservative homes 

00:16:04.459 --> 00:16:06.459
and you're just ignoring the 

00:16:08.986 --> 00:16:10.013
fact that they have very 
different political views and 

00:16:10.014 --> 00:16:11.014
they may have voted in a way 
that really does affect our 

00:16:11.015 --> 00:16:13.705
civil rights.
If we are not visible, it will 

00:16:13.706 --> 00:16:16.144
never change.
If we are not out there showing 

00:16:16.145 --> 00:16:18.145
those 

00:16:19.403 --> 00:16:22.088
people who may have voted in a 
way that is very judgmental 

00:16:22.089 --> 00:16:24.089
towards our civil rights, if we 
are not showing them we 

00:16:26.515 --> 00:16:28.817
are people just like they are, 
and they aren't thinking about 

00:16:28.818 --> 00:16:30.226
us when they vote.
And they are thinking about 

00:16:30.227 --> 00:16:31.852
people that are different than 
them in the way their votes 

00:16:31.853 --> 00:16:33.853
affect us.

00:16:36.708 --> 00:16:38.708
I think our biggest 

00:16:40.238 --> 00:16:41.255
ally is visibility and making 
sure we are setting a great 

00:16:41.256 --> 00:16:43.256
example in making 

00:16:44.613 --> 00:16:45.017
sure we are out there and proud 
and showing everyone out there 

00:16:45.018 --> 00:16:47.073
that we are just like everyone 
else and we deserve 

00:16:50.115 --> 00:16:52.115
the same rights as they do.

00:16:54.217 --> 00:16:56.217
[applause] 

00:16:57.655 --> 00:16:59.655
&gt;&gt;

00:17:00.985 --> 00:17:02.200
I'm going to be really honest 
I'm not as informed on American 

00:17:02.201 --> 00:17:04.441
politics is my counterparts.
&gt;&gt; He's British.

00:17:08.255 --> 00:17:12.164
[laughter] However the thing I 
see that's very problematic is 

00:17:12.165 --> 00:17:14.165
we seem to have a government 
that does not speak out when 

00:17:15.623 --> 00:17:17.623
injustices committed against our

00:17:19.041 --> 00:17:21.041
community and even if 

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:25.619
the laws take a long time to 
change I don't agree with why it

00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:27.620
takes so long to change, but 
even if it does take a long 

00:17:29.441 --> 00:17:32.528
time to change I wish the 
current administration was speak

00:17:32.529 --> 00:17:34.529
out against the hate that is 
delivered to our people.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.076
&gt;&gt; The problem is our current 
administration is speaking the 

00:17:39.077 --> 00:17:40.113
hate.
[applause] 

00:17:40.114 --> 00:17:42.114
&gt;&gt; I do know.

00:17:47.648 --> 00:17:49.648
&gt;&gt; I can understand why you're 
so concerned.

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.710
Rebecca I see where you are 
concerned 

00:17:55.357 --> 00:17:57.247
and I'm sure you feel a lot more
confident in this country felt 

00:17:57.248 --> 00:17:59.248
the leadership supported your 
basic human rights.

00:18:05.795 --> 00:18:08.545
As long as the people that are 
in power â€“ I worry will never 

00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:09.763
get the security we should 
expect.

00:18:09.764 --> 00:18:11.764
Not just hope for but expect.

00:18:12.776 --> 00:18:14.776
&gt;&gt; And deserve!
[applause] 

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.860
&gt;&gt; With this incarnation of 
Queer Eye 

00:18:23.126 --> 00:18:25.561
you are not in the bubble of 
L.A. or the bubble of New York.

00:18:29.176 --> 00:18:31.176
The first two seasons were in 
Atlanta.

00:18:32.911 --> 00:18:35.559
This current season â€“.
[laughter] 

00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:39.856
&gt;&gt; Which is great!
This current season season three

00:18:39.857 --> 00:18:44.971
is in Kansas City.
Kansas City, Atlanta of the 

00:18:44.972 --> 00:18:46.972
South, we 

00:18:48.608 --> 00:18:49.530
talked about the current 
administration and what it is or

00:18:49.531 --> 00:18:51.531
isn't doing.

00:18:53.146 --> 00:18:55.146
There are voters in these places
to support the president.

00:18:56.956 --> 00:18:58.956
I'm just curious what was it 
like being 

00:19:03.619 --> 00:19:05.619
Queer Eye, the Fab Five in red 
states?

00:19:06.324 --> 00:19:08.324
&gt;&gt; I felt really powerful going 
to those places.

00:19:10.345 --> 00:19:12.345
I don't want 

00:19:13.705 --> 00:19:14.522
a Queer Eye that stays in New 
York and LA.

00:19:14.523 --> 00:19:16.523
That's a low hanging fruit as 
far as I'm concerned.

00:19:19.846 --> 00:19:21.846
The gaze already hopefully don't
hate us 

00:19:22.871 --> 00:19:28.040
for being gay.
It's good for us to be around 

00:19:28.041 --> 00:19:30.041
people who 

00:19:31.688 --> 00:19:33.802
have not had the exposure to us.
I going to those kind of states 

00:19:33.803 --> 00:19:35.893
and having real conversations 
with them to say forget what 

00:19:35.894 --> 00:19:37.894
party you follow.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:41.395
Forget what your opinions on the
president.

00:19:41.396 --> 00:19:43.616
One on one conversation with one
of us for a week and then at the

00:19:43.617 --> 00:19:45.617
end of the week tell us that you
hate us.

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:50.196
That's not possible.
You can't hate us for who we are

00:19:50.197 --> 00:19:52.197
because we are showing our 
humanity.

00:19:54.232 --> 00:19:56.232
&gt;&gt; What I 

00:19:59.194 --> 00:20:00.000
loved, I grew up in Missouri I 
spent 17 years of my life try to

00:20:00.001 --> 00:20:03.672
get the hell out of there.
Going back actually felt really 

00:20:03.673 --> 00:20:05.673
good because I saw how much it 
has changed 

00:20:08.751 --> 00:20:10.751
since I was 17-year-old kid 
trying to 

00:20:13.093 --> 00:20:14.099
get the hell out of there 
because I was being persecuted 

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.728
and it was not accepted.
To go back now and see how 

00:20:15.729 --> 00:20:17.158
accepted we were granted it was 
a little different.

00:20:17.159 --> 00:20:19.159
We are coming back on a T.V.

00:20:20.815 --> 00:20:22.815
show, but you could see that 
things 

00:20:25.254 --> 00:20:27.254
have changed and it really gave 
me 

00:20:30.794 --> 00:20:31.822
hope in this really drove home 
the point of the more we are 

00:20:31.823 --> 00:20:33.823
visible, the more people will 
accept us.

00:20:33.842 --> 00:20:35.842
The more people realize, 
people's 

00:20:37.274 --> 00:20:39.274
biggest fears about things they 
don't know.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:43.240
When they see us more they 
accept us more.

00:20:43.241 --> 00:20:45.241
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:20:46.253 --> 00:20:50.376
And also what I really learned 
in the last two years is the 

00:20:50.377 --> 00:20:52.377
importance of state legislature.

00:20:54.902 --> 00:20:56.902
[applause] One thing that I 
experienced 

00:20:58.563 --> 00:21:00.563
when we got to Atlanta the 
election was 

00:21:01.579 --> 00:21:03.579
going 

00:21:05.074 --> 00:21:05.496
on and it's all that I could 
talk about first three weeks I 

00:21:05.497 --> 00:21:07.514
was there.
That was the timing of what went

00:21:07.515 --> 00:21:08.373
on.
I remember talking to an uber 

00:21:08.374 --> 00:21:12.078
driver on the way to the airport
to go shoot Game of Thrones on a

00:21:12.079 --> 00:21:16.369
weekend and nobody knew who I 
was.

00:21:17.371 --> 00:21:18.853
I was not trying to name drop 
that but nobody knew who I was 

00:21:18.854 --> 00:21:20.854
then and nobody 

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:24.114
knew that I was talking to them 
about anything.

00:21:24.786 --> 00:21:26.786
And they said who are you voting
for?

00:21:29.069 --> 00:21:31.069
And I said if I voted it would 
change.

00:21:32.481 --> 00:21:33.642
What will it matter to me?
As a 21-year-old kid who lives 

00:21:33.643 --> 00:21:35.643
in 

00:21:36.713 --> 00:21:38.134
downtown Atlanta it matters a 
lot.

00:21:38.135 --> 00:21:40.573
So complacency and knowing who 
your representatives are, 

00:21:40.574 --> 00:21:42.574
obviously this is a 

00:21:44.199 --> 00:21:48.139
federal election.
Stacy Abrams honey came so 

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.140
close.

00:21:53.465 --> 00:21:55.465
[applause] The state legislature
we may 

00:21:57.496 --> 00:21:59.496
change in Georgia we made gains 
in 

00:22:00.972 --> 00:22:02.972
Missouri.
I think what we have classically

00:22:03.424 --> 00:22:09.151
considered to be more red states
are changing and.

00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:11.599
I think some people are going 
back into the middle of America 

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.600
and migrating out of L.A. to New
York and going back to the 

00:22:15.612 --> 00:22:19.148
cities that maybe the hope is 
not lost on people Missouri and 

00:22:19.149 --> 00:22:20.151
Georgia.
We have to talk to people and 

00:22:20.152 --> 00:22:22.152
engage with people.

00:22:23.994 --> 00:22:26.483
Like Kim was saying it's hard to
hit people up close.

00:22:27.515 --> 00:22:29.515
I think people that don't know 
it's 

00:22:31.532 --> 00:22:32.589
because they just not have been 
exposed.

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:34.237
We have to work really hard to 
get in those uncomfortable 

00:22:34.238 --> 00:22:36.055
places and have those 
uncomfortable conversations with

00:22:36.056 --> 00:22:38.056
people because I think 2020 it's
on the 

00:22:39.056 --> 00:22:40.321
table y'all.
We can do this in the Senate 

00:22:40.322 --> 00:22:42.322
it's not that hard!

00:22:43.821 --> 00:22:45.821
You got to be talking to uber 
drivers 

00:22:46.833 --> 00:22:48.833
and talk to people.

00:22:50.575 --> 00:22:52.575
You to chat about it it's not 
that far away.

00:22:57.853 --> 00:22:59.853
[laughter] I made a mistake and 
I said 

00:23:01.386 --> 00:23:02.840
Kansas and you're in Missouri.
Jonathan I will pick up on 

00:23:02.841 --> 00:23:04.861
something you just said.
Having those uncomfortable 

00:23:05.892 --> 00:23:07.719
conversations, have you had an 
uncomfortable conversation that 

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.720
did not 

00:23:10.732 --> 00:23:12.732
make it on their?

00:23:14.673 --> 00:23:17.968
&gt;&gt; Me and Joey had a great one 
about minimum sentencing in 

00:23:17.969 --> 00:23:19.969
Missouri.

00:23:21.006 --> 00:23:23.006
We were in the salon for a solid
eight 

00:23:25.341 --> 00:23:27.341
hours we talked a lot about the 
injustices.

00:23:29.626 --> 00:23:31.626
[crosstalk] 

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:36.070
&gt;&gt; That was a fantastic 
transformation, 

00:23:37.823 --> 00:23:38.827
wow!
&gt;&gt; That someone who I would not 

00:23:38.828 --> 00:23:42.307
think was a corrections officer 
would have the same feelings I 

00:23:42.308 --> 00:23:43.918
have about the militarization of
the police force or the failed 

00:23:43.919 --> 00:23:45.919
war on drugs.

00:23:47.732 --> 00:23:49.732
This was actually someone 

00:23:52.111 --> 00:23:53.769
who when I was wheeling and 
dealing all the things you know 

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:55.598
I wheel and deal about on my 
twitter honey, she actually we 

00:23:55.599 --> 00:23:57.599
went that far apart and I was 
very 

00:23:58.599 --> 00:24:01.740
surprised by that.
That's why it wasn't on the T.V.

00:24:04.179 --> 00:24:06.179
show.

00:24:08.195 --> 00:24:09.868
&gt;&gt; Re-surprise your points if 
you were similar?

00:24:09.869 --> 00:24:10.480
&gt;&gt; Yes because she was an 
officer in a corrections 

00:24:10.481 --> 00:24:12.481
facility.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.120
At that it would be looking out 

00:24:19.453 --> 00:24:21.453
of there looking like Angelica 
from Rugrats.

00:24:26.518 --> 00:24:28.396
&gt;&gt; We filmed 40-60 hours per 
week and the show gets down to 

00:24:28.397 --> 00:24:30.397
45 minutes.

00:24:31.813 --> 00:24:33.813
Episode two of season 

00:24:35.356 --> 00:24:37.356
one, the police officer has a 
sign in 

00:24:39.377 --> 00:24:41.377
his yard make America great 
again in his bedroom.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.750
That episode ended up being more
about 

00:24:45.188 --> 00:24:47.188
the relationship between him and
Cromwell.

00:24:47.914 --> 00:24:48.319
Corey and I had a two hour car 
ride for the week and talk about

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.947
the election.
We talked about why he voted for

00:24:49.948 --> 00:24:51.948
Trump in his reasoning in all 
his reasoning 

00:24:53.968 --> 00:24:55.968
was incorrect.

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:00.910
[laughter] He was talking about 
how he 

00:25:02.928 --> 00:25:04.603
just really does not like how 
Obama never ever talked about 

00:25:04.604 --> 00:25:06.031
blue lives and it was always 
black lives.

00:25:06.032 --> 00:25:08.032
Where did you get that info?
Yes he does.

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.746
He absolutely supported everyone
who was in the right.

00:25:14.232 --> 00:25:15.261
Where you getting this info?
And I said you only watch Fox 

00:25:15.262 --> 00:25:17.262
news?

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.900
He said I don't 

00:25:22.015 --> 00:25:24.015
watch Fox news at 

00:25:25.119 --> 00:25:26.131
all.
I got them to think about where 

00:25:26.132 --> 00:25:27.576
he was getting his info and 
started to educate himself more.

00:25:27.577 --> 00:25:29.577
Corey has now gotten into local 
politics 

00:25:31.872 --> 00:25:33.700
.
It goes back to having the 

00:25:33.701 --> 00:25:35.701
uncomfortable 

00:25:39.201 --> 00:25:42.100
conversations we have to listen 
to people though.

00:25:43.318 --> 00:25:44.740
How I got him to opened up was I
listened.

00:25:44.741 --> 00:25:46.741
Don't go in there telling people
your 

00:25:48.558 --> 00:25:51.508
point of view, listen to them 
first.

00:25:55.525 --> 00:25:57.525
&gt;&gt; I'm typically likeliest to 
the hair.

00:26:00.932 --> 00:26:02.932
Sometimes were not scary just to
look at 

00:26:03.973 --> 00:26:05.973
my twitter.

00:26:08.233 --> 00:26:10.233
&gt;&gt; He's very good at listening 
intently.

00:26:11.537 --> 00:26:14.380
&gt;&gt; I want to listen over here.
[laughter] 

00:26:17.034 --> 00:26:20.033
&gt;&gt; Anthony did you have a 
conversation that was 

00:26:23.131 --> 00:26:24.359
uncomfortable in any of the 
seasons?

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.360
&gt;&gt; Uncomfortable conversations 
with me?

00:26:27.376 --> 00:26:29.376
I tend to â€“ I don't know if 
it's the fact 

00:26:31.315 --> 00:26:33.315
that I'm 

00:26:35.606 --> 00:26:38.341
Canadian and I feel like even 
though have been in this country

00:26:38.342 --> 00:26:40.342
on and off for over 13 years, I 

00:26:41.761 --> 00:26:42.996
still feel like I'm a guest here
and I don't feel like my spot 

00:26:42.997 --> 00:26:45.851
here is very safe.
I've heard stories about 

00:26:45.852 --> 00:26:47.852
Canadians who cross the border 
and come back and 

00:26:50.545 --> 00:26:51.546
aren't able to come back because
of basically being asked to the 

00:26:51.547 --> 00:26:53.547
support and 

00:26:55.184 --> 00:26:57.184
having what's it called?

00:26:59.494 --> 00:27:02.251
Having border patrol.

00:27:07.737 --> 00:27:09.737
[laughter] I've heard those 
horror 

00:27:10.748 --> 00:27:12.748
stories and I tend to trade a 
little more carefully.

00:27:13.928 --> 00:27:15.928
The conversation personally that
would 

00:27:17.337 --> 00:27:18.648
make me a little more 
uncomfortable for the main 

00:27:18.649 --> 00:27:20.665
reason why I'm so comfortable 
being on the show talking about 

00:27:20.666 --> 00:27:22.666
my sexuality which is 

00:27:24.089 --> 00:27:26.089
something I've always kept very 
close to my heart.

00:27:27.476 --> 00:27:28.522
Something that I have shared 
with loved ones and friends and 

00:27:28.523 --> 00:27:29.949
family but not anything I've 
ever really spoken about in the 

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:30.965
public space.
I look back at her time with 

00:27:30.966 --> 00:27:32.966
A.J.

00:27:34.377 --> 00:27:36.377
for example in season 

00:27:38.166 --> 00:27:40.166
one, that was an opportunity 
where he 

00:27:41.786 --> 00:27:42.911
was sharing so much about his 
experience in the type of man he

00:27:42.912 --> 00:27:44.912
wanted to be or that he thought 
he should be.

00:27:47.003 --> 00:27:49.241
The fact that he did not want to
be too feminine in his clothing 

00:27:49.242 --> 00:27:51.242
choices I 

00:27:52.273 --> 00:27:54.273
realized 

00:27:55.367 --> 00:27:56.383
holy ship if he's willing to 
share so much with me I have to 

00:27:56.384 --> 00:27:58.384
be able to do the 

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:05.790
same.

00:28:07.804 --> 00:28:09.294
I'm sure there's some interviews
somewhere but I've never 

00:28:09.295 --> 00:28:11.295
referred to myself as gay.

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:14.530
I've always felt more 
comfortable fluid.

00:28:16.566 --> 00:28:18.566
I've been in love with 

00:28:19.919 --> 00:28:20.933
women and for me personally it 
feels like in some way 

00:28:20.934 --> 00:28:22.176
disrespectful to them hi, it's 
okay because it means something 

00:28:22.177 --> 00:28:23.597
to those relationships.
It's not a judgment against 

00:28:23.598 --> 00:28:25.598
people who have a label because 
if it's something 

00:28:28.239 --> 00:28:30.239
that is important to 

00:28:32.176 --> 00:28:33.612
you power to you absolutely.
For me personally I've always 

00:28:33.613 --> 00:28:35.706
felt more comfortable not having
one in just considering myself 

00:28:35.707 --> 00:28:37.707
fluid is the word of the day for
me.

00:28:37.762 --> 00:28:39.762
I may change my mind tomorrow 
but that's how I feel today.

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:46.450
The point is I don't feel like I
have 

00:28:48.391 --> 00:28:50.391
to decide I want to continue to 
be myself.

00:28:53.853 --> 00:28:55.853
My father says be humble and 
don't be a dick.

00:29:07.021 --> 00:29:07.834
[laughter] 
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry I actually swear 

00:29:07.835 --> 00:29:09.835
the least out of all of us.
I apologize.

00:29:10.086 --> 00:29:12.086
But yeah.

00:29:13.134 --> 00:29:15.134
[laughter] 

00:29:16.582 --> 00:29:18.582
&gt;&gt; Addison more.
Where is Addison more?

00:29:20.632 --> 00:29:22.632
There's a whole section over 
there.

00:29:26.652 --> 00:29:28.286
[cheering] Addison more what is 
the best way for someone who is 

00:29:28.287 --> 00:29:30.287
LGBTQ to use the 

00:29:31.706 --> 00:29:33.706
platform for queer, trans and 
non-binary?

00:29:35.381 --> 00:29:39.925
&gt;&gt; I will take that one.
I didn't want to talk too much.

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:48.270
[laughter] I think visibility 
for me, 

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:53.930
being visible and being in my 
community no matter what the 

00:29:58.116 --> 00:29:59.115
comments will say whether three 
people watching the 3 million 

00:29:59.116 --> 00:30:00.352
your voice matters.
It does not matter how many eyes

00:30:00.353 --> 00:30:02.353
look at 

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:08.070
it, it's how true â€“ you asked 
the question?

00:30:08.308 --> 00:30:09.406
It matters how authentic you 
were to the passionate you're 

00:30:09.407 --> 00:30:11.407
bringing to your 

00:30:12.688 --> 00:30:14.688
platform because I think that 
brings her 

00:30:16.098 --> 00:30:19.642
humanity to your voice.
You can't be afraid of people up

00:30:19.643 --> 00:30:20.657
close.
You are a celebrity and 

00:30:20.658 --> 00:30:22.658
everybody so lovely.

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:26.270
Most people are so 

00:30:28.136 --> 00:30:29.969
lovely.
I think it's really staying true

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:31.970
to what moves you makes you feel
passionate.

00:30:31.998 --> 00:30:33.998
When someone is coming for your 
people 

00:30:35.305 --> 00:30:37.305
get all up on that twitter.
[laughter] 

00:30:42.026 --> 00:30:44.193
&gt;&gt; Actually sometimes twitter 
yes, but maybe call you up and 

00:30:47.212 --> 00:30:49.940
get on the center for 
transgender equality and get on 

00:30:50.556 --> 00:30:52.556
their twitter make a little 
donation honey.

00:30:53.973 --> 00:30:55.973
Also money moves things â€“ no 
it does.

00:31:00.735 --> 00:31:02.735
We have to raise money for 

00:31:05.152 --> 00:31:07.152
candidates for non-binary and 

00:31:08.192 --> 00:31:10.192
transgender and where people are
protected.

00:31:11.619 --> 00:31:16.191
With the equality act.
[applause] 

00:31:22.543 --> 00:31:24.543
&gt;&gt; I will ask a question about 
Jeff, Skyler.

00:31:25.388 --> 00:31:27.388
I will come back to Jeff.

00:31:29.006 --> 00:31:31.006
Talk about pull my heart out.

00:31:33.787 --> 00:31:35.787
Based on your experiences with 
your 

00:31:38.098 --> 00:31:40.098
heroes, what help can be 
provided for 

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.120
this 

00:31:44.675 --> 00:31:46.675
aced LGBTQ?

00:31:48.711 --> 00:31:51.426
Just was kicked out of her home 
when she was 19 because she came

00:31:51.427 --> 00:31:52.252
out.
Skyler was a transgender man 

00:31:52.253 --> 00:31:54.253
also kicked 

00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:58.770
out.

00:32:03.052 --> 00:32:05.052
&gt;&gt; I live in Salt Lake City Utah
and we 

00:32:09.593 --> 00:32:11.593
have a system for people who 
need 

00:32:14.905 --> 00:32:16.905
support and most importantly 
LGBTQ youth.

00:32:18.917 --> 00:32:20.917
They can put you in touch with 

00:32:24.317 --> 00:32:25.345
resources and if they have a in 
Utah of all places, there is 

00:32:25.346 --> 00:32:27.346
bound to be something similar in
every state.

00:32:27.393 --> 00:32:28.408
I would suggest you find your 
organization in your state that 

00:32:28.409 --> 00:32:30.223
can offer you support.
Also, the younger generation, 

00:32:30.224 --> 00:32:32.224
you guys 

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.080
have access 

00:32:41.247 --> 00:32:43.247
â€“ news Instagram and Twitter a
lot.

00:32:44.652 --> 00:32:50.213
The use Insta handles.
You love some social and that's 

00:32:50.214 --> 00:32:52.214
a good thing.

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:57.290
&gt;&gt; I watched seven hours of 
gymnastics videos alone today.

00:33:03.843 --> 00:33:05.465
[laughter] 
&gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with 

00:33:05.466 --> 00:33:07.303
living social and it can be a 
great tool.

00:33:07.304 --> 00:33:08.332
There hashtags you can find 
local support systems in local 

00:33:08.333 --> 00:33:10.556
communities that can truly offer
support you need.

00:33:15.599 --> 00:33:17.881
Yes, social can be a great 
resource if you're struggling to

00:33:17.882 --> 00:33:21.765
find something locally to you it
can be hashtag away.

00:33:23.794 --> 00:33:25.794
&gt;&gt; There hotlines available as 
well.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.954
To hear a human voice, somebody 
speaking so you don't feel like 

00:33:29.955 --> 00:33:31.955
you're having this 

00:33:33.013 --> 00:33:35.478
conversation on your own.
&gt;&gt; National suicide hotline that

00:33:37.135 --> 00:33:38.147
something that could apply to 
somebody which is on my 

00:33:38.148 --> 00:33:40.148
instagram account.

00:33:42.934 --> 00:33:44.934
&gt;&gt; If you are one of those youth
who are 

00:33:46.229 --> 00:33:47.240
lucky enough to have parents who
are amazing and love you no 

00:33:47.241 --> 00:33:50.727
matter what and accepting no 
matter what, find those local 

00:33:50.728 --> 00:33:55.604
LGBTQ places where kids who 
aren't as lucky as you have to 

00:33:55.605 --> 00:33:57.220
go.
Go there, volunteer, donate 

00:33:57.221 --> 00:33:59.701
close you have grown out of.
Give back to them because you 

00:33:59.702 --> 00:34:01.702
were lucky enough to have 
parents that love you.

00:34:04.376 --> 00:34:06.376
Help 

00:34:10.333 --> 00:34:12.333
them.

00:34:14.844 --> 00:34:16.844
&gt;&gt; The main theme of Queer Eye 
is love yourself.

00:34:17.532 --> 00:34:19.532
How do you then say two teens 
were going 

00:34:22.185 --> 00:34:23.448
through it, emotionally.
How do you connect them to let 

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:25.449
them know 

00:34:28.287 --> 00:34:31.260
not only it gets better which is
a future message, but that they 

00:34:31.261 --> 00:34:33.261
can get through this which is a 
here and now message?

00:34:36.116 --> 00:34:40.668
&gt;&gt; For me having gone through 
those type of situations, it 

00:34:40.669 --> 00:34:42.669
does get better in the 

00:34:44.096 --> 00:34:46.096
way I show them and tell 

00:34:47.111 --> 00:34:48.721
them is I went through a lot.
I did things I'm not proud of 

00:34:48.722 --> 00:34:50.754
just to survive, to make it 
through.

00:34:53.002 --> 00:34:55.002
Every single thing I went 
through has 

00:34:56.606 --> 00:34:57.870
made me the person I am today.
I did not kill me, it made me 

00:34:57.871 --> 00:34:59.737
stronger and it will make you 
stronger.

00:34:59.738 --> 00:35:02.384
You will get through it.
It will get better.

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:06.452
[applause] Everything that you 
go through in life is what makes

00:35:06.453 --> 00:35:08.453
you the person that you are.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.760
None of it is bad.

00:35:14.767 --> 00:35:17.470
Hang in there, stay strong.
The more you go through the 

00:35:17.471 --> 00:35:19.515
stronger you will be in more 
successful you will be.

00:35:24.772 --> 00:35:26.772
&gt;&gt; I used to see this positive 
as 

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.903
affirmations is a very American 
thing.

00:35:29.904 --> 00:35:31.904
The bricks are very cynical.

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:38.630
[laughter] I have been in 
America a few 

00:35:40.911 --> 00:35:42.953
years now and and I started 
practicing positive affirmations

00:35:42.954 --> 00:35:45.422
for myself years ago and it 
really does help.

00:35:51.534 --> 00:35:52.970
[laughter] 
&gt;&gt; What is your positive 

00:35:52.971 --> 00:35:55.215
affirmation?
&gt;&gt; I will share them with you.

00:35:55.216 --> 00:36:00.087
Let me tell you why.
&gt;&gt; How do you not sure your 

00:36:00.088 --> 00:36:02.088
positive affirmation!
&gt;&gt; It's a personal thing.

00:36:07.413 --> 00:36:08.836
Private.
&gt;&gt; He tells himself he loves 

00:36:08.837 --> 00:36:10.837
himself in the mirror as he's 
brushing his hair.

00:36:11.682 --> 00:36:13.942
&gt;&gt; I will segue into letting you
continue to finish a thought.

00:36:17.371 --> 00:36:19.371
Out of all of 

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:22.526
us he has the ability to show 
one set with a smile on his 

00:36:22.527 --> 00:36:24.527
face.

00:36:25.542 --> 00:36:28.233
&gt;&gt; A professional.
[cheering] 

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:33.908
&gt;&gt; Can I tell you what it is?
You might make fun of me!

00:36:36.358 --> 00:36:38.358
&gt;&gt; No we won't.

00:36:39.781 --> 00:36:41.898
&gt;&gt; Sit here while I tell it.

00:36:50.616 --> 00:36:52.616
&gt;&gt; Repeat yourself 

00:36:54.355 --> 00:36:56.355
affirmation.

00:36:57.964 --> 00:37:00.892
&gt;&gt; There are so many people 
saying something negative 

00:37:01.289 --> 00:37:02.925
especially in social media.
The amount of times or the 

00:37:02.926 --> 00:37:04.926
something on 

00:37:05.968 --> 00:37:07.031
social media that's negative, 
the clause are always out and 

00:37:07.032 --> 00:37:08.443
people are fighting the fight.
I thought I want to something 

00:37:08.444 --> 00:37:10.444
where I feel better about 
myself.

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:15.167
Every day you mentioned when I 
brush my hair that's not my do 

00:37:15.168 --> 00:37:16.182
it.
When I brush my teeth it takes 

00:37:16.183 --> 00:37:18.183
me about 

00:37:19.189 --> 00:37:21.189
two 

00:37:23.526 --> 00:37:25.526
minutes.

00:37:27.052 --> 00:37:28.470
&gt;&gt; Some brushes have timers.
&gt;&gt; While I brush my teeth I do 

00:37:28.471 --> 00:37:31.140
in my underwear.
I do my underwear for a reason.

00:37:35.172 --> 00:37:38.082
&gt;&gt; He doesn't want to get to 
preach on thpaste on his shirt.

00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:43.371
&gt;&gt; Let me finish!
It gives me time to look at 

00:37:43.372 --> 00:37:45.417
myself and really say these are 
the things I love about myself 

00:37:45.418 --> 00:37:47.418
physically in these of them 

00:37:49.027 --> 00:37:51.498
as I love about myself 
emotionally.

00:37:52.529 --> 00:37:53.950
Then assessment for the day no 
matter what happens in the day, 

00:37:53.951 --> 00:37:56.817
no matter what somebody says to 
me, if they say something vulgar

00:37:56.818 --> 00:37:58.818
or say something racist 

00:38:00.447 --> 00:38:02.447
or say something 

00:38:05.995 --> 00:38:07.015
homophobic I think at least 
there are three things a little 

00:38:07.016 --> 00:38:08.034
about myself.
At least I'm finding every 

00:38:08.035 --> 00:38:10.501
opportunity to make myself happy
as opposed to just accepting the

00:38:10.502 --> 00:38:11.511
hate that is thrown my way.
&gt;&gt; I would never make fun of 

00:38:11.512 --> 00:38:13.512
that.
I love that!

00:38:15.995 --> 00:38:17.995
[applause] 

00:38:20.438 --> 00:38:22.438
&gt;&gt; At first you think I feel 
cheesy

00:38:28.877 --> 00:38:30.877
AF but I don't want to be the 
reason I 

00:38:31.902 --> 00:38:35.614
am not happy.
&gt;&gt; I won't be the reason I'm 

00:38:35.615 --> 00:38:37.615
unhappy.

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:43.161
Wow!
&gt;&gt; That's so get out of your own

00:38:43.162 --> 00:38:45.162
way sort of thing.
I love that.

00:38:47.463 --> 00:38:49.463
I can't believe he never told me
did 

00:38:50.467 --> 00:38:52.826
positive affirmations.

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:00.172
[laughter] 
&gt;&gt; You literally in a room of 

00:39:00.173 --> 00:39:01.785
all Americans.
&gt;&gt; I married an American I can 

00:39:01.786 --> 00:39:04.480
say that.
&gt;&gt; That's not how it works but 

00:39:04.481 --> 00:39:06.481
okay.

00:39:07.488 --> 00:39:09.488
&gt;&gt; That is true.

00:39:14.859 --> 00:39:17.138
&gt;&gt; I don't have a last name.

00:39:21.167 --> 00:39:23.167
Jackie 

00:39:25.371 --> 00:39:26.372
24?
Thanks Jackie 24 when you felt 

00:39:26.373 --> 00:39:29.234
lost or stuck in life what 
helped you move forward?

00:39:32.234 --> 00:39:36.457
&gt;&gt; Celine Dion.
[laughter] 

00:39:39.338 --> 00:39:40.359
&gt;&gt; There goes my answer.
When I was most lost in my life 

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.360
was 

00:39:43.455 --> 00:39:45.455
probably when I was in a 
pre-college.

00:39:46.093 --> 00:39:48.093
My early 20s, I was back in 
MontrÃ©al, I 

00:39:49.699 --> 00:39:51.699
was studying commerce.

00:39:53.465 --> 00:39:54.490
No shame to anybody who loves 
commerce and I still can't fully

00:39:54.491 --> 00:39:56.491
explain what the major was.

00:39:58.746 --> 00:40:00.746
And I 

00:40:02.087 --> 00:40:03.087
was very unhappy and had no 
direction and no idea what it 

00:40:03.088 --> 00:40:05.088
was I wanted to pursue in my 
life.

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.854
And there was a teacher, his 
name is Victor giveaway and he 

00:40:09.855 --> 00:40:15.598
was my English teacher and he 
called me into his office one 

00:40:15.599 --> 00:40:16.613
day and he basically looked over
my grades and basically told me,

00:40:16.614 --> 00:40:18.614
we started chatting about what I
wanted to do with 

00:40:21.338 --> 00:40:23.338
my life and he became a mentor.

00:40:24.736 --> 00:40:26.827
I used to go see him sometimes 
unannounced once or twice a week

00:40:26.828 --> 00:40:28.828
just to check in.
Sometimes just to hang out.

00:40:30.931 --> 00:40:32.931
Other times to just silently 
read a book 

00:40:34.957 --> 00:40:35.892
for 20 or 30 minutes and just be
around him.

00:40:35.893 --> 00:40:37.503
Ended up actually getting me in 
touch with the social worker who

00:40:37.504 --> 00:40:40.388
got me in touch with a 
psychologist.

00:40:42.857 --> 00:40:44.857
Most the question?

00:40:47.334 --> 00:40:48.753
[laughter] 
&gt;&gt; I was thinking I think he got

00:40:48.754 --> 00:40:50.754
off track.
&gt;&gt; What was the question?

00:40:52.058 --> 00:40:54.058
[laughter] 
&gt;&gt; I have a point.

00:40:58.793 --> 00:41:01.452
&gt;&gt; I wasn't ready to admit to 
myself that I needed help.

00:41:04.307 --> 00:41:05.120
My parents were not available 
for that hill.

00:41:05.121 --> 00:41:07.778
I went to a teacher and I 
realized throughout my life 

00:41:07.779 --> 00:41:09.810
whether I was in high school or 
the University I have always 

00:41:13.331 --> 00:41:15.331
sought out mentors through 
teachers that 

00:41:17.578 --> 00:41:19.578
would actually listen to me that
I 

00:41:24.553 --> 00:41:25.572
respected.
I think during all the darkest.

00:41:25.573 --> 00:41:28.024
Because of my time I did a lot 
of things wrong, but one thing I

00:41:28.025 --> 00:41:31.889
did write is that I did not keep
it for myself too long and it 

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:33.717
comes back to what I was saying 
previously about when you have a

00:41:33.718 --> 00:41:35.718
conversation in your own head 
starts become a problem.

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:38.647
Actually reaching out to 
somebody and getting some 

00:41:38.648 --> 00:41:40.279
professional help in the end was
the best thing I could've ever 

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:42.280
done for myself.

00:41:43.552 --> 00:41:45.552
Something I continue to do to 
this day.

00:41:46.521 --> 00:41:48.521
&gt;&gt; I came back!
I got ADD but it comes back.

00:41:50.813 --> 00:41:53.302
It comes back.
It's how we get through hard 

00:41:53.303 --> 00:41:55.303
times and what helped you move 
forward.

00:41:57.379 --> 00:42:02.255
&gt;&gt; Mine is more sinister.
Yours is beautiful.

00:42:03.278 --> 00:42:04.712
A true reflection of your 
personality.

00:42:04.713 --> 00:42:06.713
This is a true reflection of 
mine.

00:42:15.688 --> 00:42:17.394
[laughter] You know me too well.
I was not meant to have the life

00:42:17.395 --> 00:42:19.395
I have now I was raised in a 
very strict 

00:42:21.618 --> 00:42:22.893
community and household.
I was told this was not a life 

00:42:22.894 --> 00:42:24.894
that was 

00:42:28.156 --> 00:42:29.609
okay for me and every day I 
encourage myself to prove my 

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:31.610
worth and show that I 

00:42:37.347 --> 00:42:37.973
can have the life I want to have
and be incredibly successful.

00:42:37.974 --> 00:42:39.974
One of the most successful 
people in my community.

00:42:40.457 --> 00:42:41.498
And will prove it one day.
That drive got me through every 

00:42:41.499 --> 00:42:43.499
day, 

00:42:44.908 --> 00:42:46.908
every time I was 

00:42:48.047 --> 00:42:49.047
feeling shit about myself that's
motivation that got me through 

00:42:49.048 --> 00:42:51.048
thinking 

00:42:52.052 --> 00:42:54.385
I would prove my worth.

00:43:03.144 --> 00:43:06.669
&gt;&gt; You know that all too well!
&gt;&gt; If you find yourself in a 

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:08.670
dark 

00:43:11.785 --> 00:43:13.785
prolonged dark rut, as I have 
often, 

00:43:16.067 --> 00:43:17.474
doing something that I was 
passionate about has always 

00:43:17.475 --> 00:43:19.475
created a thread that 

00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:23.852
has created every success in 
every moment of happiness that I

00:43:23.853 --> 00:43:26.714
have ever had.
Whether that passion was helping

00:43:26.715 --> 00:43:28.715
people 

00:43:30.535 --> 00:43:33.026
or learning to figure skate or 
whatever, it has been.

00:43:34.025 --> 00:43:36.025
[INDISCERNABLE] For a long time.

00:43:38.288 --> 00:43:39.362
It was honestly growing up in a 
rural town being mercilessly 

00:43:39.363 --> 00:43:41.363
bullied.
It was cheerleading.

00:43:43.391 --> 00:43:45.391
That was a group of people only 
codify her only myself 

00:43:48.892 --> 00:43:50.892
backwards those girls would 
protect 

00:43:53.434 --> 00:43:55.062
me.
I was passionate about learning 

00:43:55.063 --> 00:43:56.078
how to cheer.
Whatever your passionate about 

00:43:56.079 --> 00:43:58.519
learning to do that will put one
foot in front of the other to 

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:00.391
get you out of that dark rut.
&gt;&gt; Jonathan since you brought it

00:44:00.392 --> 00:44:01.829
up, my next question was going 
to come to you about bullying.

00:44:08.138 --> 00:44:09.175
Since you brought it up, you 
have long talked before about 

00:44:09.176 --> 00:44:10.600
the fact that you never fully 
experience being in the closet.

00:44:13.996 --> 00:44:15.508
You have been bullied as a 
result of it.

00:44:15.509 --> 00:44:17.509
How did you cope with it?

00:44:19.951 --> 00:44:22.858
For the LGBTQ plus kids and 
maybe some adults, how do you 

00:44:23.459 --> 00:44:25.317
deal with the bullying?
How do you cope with it?

00:44:25.318 --> 00:44:27.318
&gt;&gt; Great question.

00:44:28.326 --> 00:44:30.326
I think 

00:44:31.443 --> 00:44:33.443
that when I was young growing 
up, it was 

00:44:34.457 --> 00:44:37.155
a lot of watching figure 
skating, watching gymnastics and

00:44:37.156 --> 00:44:39.156
eating pop tarts and praying for
it to be over.

00:44:40.408 --> 00:44:42.408
Honestly.

00:44:44.292 --> 00:44:45.310
I think what I have realized as 
an adult because having the 

00:44:45.311 --> 00:44:47.564
success in the public eye has 
also brought a fair amount of 

00:44:51.188 --> 00:44:53.188
criticism and bullying 

00:44:55.133 --> 00:44:57.133
and kind of like they were again
put it 

00:44:58.158 --> 00:45:00.267
so much more intense than it was
in junior high.

00:45:01.677 --> 00:45:02.911
The feeling of bullying is awful
whether it's on that the scale 

00:45:02.912 --> 00:45:04.912
or whether I was 

00:45:06.168 --> 00:45:07.586
14 I think what really has got 
me through is the relationship 

00:45:07.587 --> 00:45:09.587
with myself.

00:45:11.004 --> 00:45:13.078
That is the only thing we come 
into this world with an is the 

00:45:13.079 --> 00:45:15.079
only thing you live with.

00:45:16.507 --> 00:45:19.416
Everything else â€“ not that 
it's not important, but you have

00:45:19.417 --> 00:45:20.429
to have a really strong 
relationship with yourself and 

00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:22.430
know that 

00:45:23.835 --> 00:45:25.348
none of this is permanent.
Success is not permanent, the 

00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:28.023
not success is not permanent.
Your love is not.

00:45:28.635 --> 00:45:30.473
Nothing is permanent.
Hate to break it to you but it's

00:45:30.474 --> 00:45:31.496
true.
&gt;&gt; Can I ask you also Jonathan.

00:45:31.497 --> 00:45:34.366
I don't think we fully answered 
your 

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:39.535
question earlier.
I think we fully answered your 

00:45:39.536 --> 00:45:41.536
question earlier.

00:45:42.963 --> 00:45:45.729
We concentrate please?
[laughter] You asked me about 

00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:47.730
loving yourself and I think we 
need to add in 

00:45:50.146 --> 00:45:52.895
one more thing about that.
So many times we see in her show

00:45:52.896 --> 00:45:54.935
that people don't take care of 
themselves because they think 

00:45:54.936 --> 00:45:56.936
there is some shame 

00:45:58.372 --> 00:46:00.295
and loving yourself or that they
feel like it's selfish.

00:46:00.296 --> 00:46:02.296
I think it's important what you 
say, but 

00:46:05.799 --> 00:46:07.284
also add in there is no shame in
accepting that you love facets 

00:46:07.285 --> 00:46:09.285
of 

00:46:11.521 --> 00:46:13.521
yourself and parts of yourself 

00:46:14.631 --> 00:46:15.630
and allow them to flourish.
So many times we see on are 

00:46:15.631 --> 00:46:17.869
shown people just feel like they
can't show themselves love.

00:46:19.291 --> 00:46:21.291
They can't practice self-care 
because it is selfish.

00:46:22.358 --> 00:46:24.358
There's nothing selfish about 
that.

00:46:25.361 --> 00:46:27.361
&gt;&gt; That it's vanity.

00:46:29.292 --> 00:46:32.348
&gt;&gt; Yes!
&gt;&gt; Knowing that is not permanent

00:46:32.349 --> 00:46:34.349
in the relationship itself is so
important.

00:46:36.216 --> 00:46:37.251
As I've experienced this success
of met some people I looked up 

00:46:37.252 --> 00:46:39.252
to my entire life and what I 
have realized is you are 

00:46:42.141 --> 00:46:43.553
no different than you and you 
are no different than me.

00:46:43.554 --> 00:46:45.393
The people we looked up to and 
read about, the president Obama!

00:46:50.269 --> 00:46:51.094
Everyone that we really look up 
to the have insecurities, they 

00:46:51.095 --> 00:46:53.785
have all sorts of stuff.
I think it's really helpful to 

00:46:53.786 --> 00:46:55.786
know that 

00:46:56.809 --> 00:46:58.884
Jonathan and 32 is insecure and 
worried about things just the 

00:46:58.885 --> 00:47:00.885
way was when I was 14.

00:47:06.637 --> 00:47:07.046
Everyone is going through the 
same thing it's really not 

00:47:07.047 --> 00:47:08.673
permanent.
If you are being bullied and 

00:47:08.674 --> 00:47:10.674
you're in a bad situation now, 
it will not last forever.

00:47:11.112 --> 00:47:12.750
Find your obsession with guinea 
pigs or figure skating or 

00:47:12.751 --> 00:47:15.423
whatever it is for you and just 
taste that down as much as you 

00:47:15.424 --> 00:47:16.441
can.
Until you can leave the bad 

00:47:16.442 --> 00:47:21.966
situation you're in.
&gt;&gt; Bobby?

00:47:25.987 --> 00:47:28.269
What is your fascination and 
your obsession?

00:47:31.675 --> 00:47:33.675
&gt;&gt; His is figure skating, what 
is yours?

00:47:35.393 --> 00:47:38.223
&gt;&gt; Ranch dressing.
[laughter] 

00:47:40.874 --> 00:47:43.141
&gt;&gt; We had the most beautiful 
pizza today, wood-burning oven, 

00:47:43.142 --> 00:47:45.142
real Barada, 

00:47:46.564 --> 00:47:48.564
tomatoes the 

00:47:49.659 --> 00:47:50.501
most airy, fluffy leaves of 
basil and this one's like I want

00:47:50.502 --> 00:47:52.502
a bowl of ranch.

00:48:01.351 --> 00:48:03.351
[laughter] 

00:48:04.396 --> 00:48:06.396
&gt;&gt; Now were growing up?

00:48:07.407 --> 00:48:09.407
Growing up honestly I put my 
passion in music.

00:48:13.322 --> 00:48:15.322
I love to sing, I love being in 
bands.

00:48:16.042 --> 00:48:17.668
It's a lot of times were queer 
kids end up.

00:48:17.669 --> 00:48:18.469
Everybody is so accepting and 
loving the matter who you are 

00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:20.470
what you are.

00:48:21.932 --> 00:48:23.932
Now my passion is really the 
environment.

00:48:25.597 --> 00:48:26.626
I'm the one going around onset 
making sure things are recycled 

00:48:26.627 --> 00:48:28.627
and vacation were not wasting 
electricity.

00:48:30.083 --> 00:48:32.083
If we don't stop what we're 
doing to our 

00:48:35.318 --> 00:48:37.318
planet literally nothing helps.
For me it's the environment.

00:48:40.589 --> 00:48:42.589
That's my 

00:48:45.309 --> 00:48:47.309
passion.
[cheering] 

00:48:47.354 --> 00:48:49.354
&gt;&gt; Ali Steinberg American 
University pride.

00:48:51.231 --> 00:48:53.231
&gt;&gt; That's a fantastic name.

00:48:54.243 --> 00:48:57.138
&gt;&gt; Age 20.

00:49:00.143 --> 00:49:02.143
&gt;&gt; 

00:49:06.528 --> 00:49:08.528
When doing so much emotional â€“
pay attention!

00:49:12.481 --> 00:49:14.481
[crosstalk] 
&gt;&gt; I'm getting a workout appear.

00:49:21.048 --> 00:49:22.478
&gt;&gt; Ali Steinberg American 
University.

00:49:22.479 --> 00:49:23.505
When doing so much emotional 
labor for people on the show how

00:49:23.506 --> 00:49:25.506
do you leave 

00:49:26.545 --> 00:49:27.165
enough time and emotional energy
for yourself and your family?

00:49:27.166 --> 00:49:30.030
The question I wonder after 
every 

00:49:35.261 --> 00:49:38.172
episode I watched, when I figure
it â€“.

00:49:40.017 --> 00:49:42.017
&gt;&gt; When I figured out I'll let 
you know.

00:49:42.872 --> 00:49:44.111
We are exhausted.
For me it's like a pocket of 

00:49:44.112 --> 00:49:45.748
joy.
It used to be that my old 

00:49:45.749 --> 00:49:50.450
minimum of recouping after doing
12 people here in the salon that

00:49:51.471 --> 00:49:54.317
day, 40s and I was go home, 
order something gorgeous and 

00:49:54.318 --> 00:49:56.318
don't leave until 

00:49:57.557 --> 00:49:58.372
Monday.
Saturday, Sunday, Monday just 

00:49:58.373 --> 00:50:00.373
wrecked.

00:50:03.267 --> 00:50:05.267
Now that pocket of alone time is
from 

00:50:07.141 --> 00:50:09.141
three hours instead of the 
weekend.

00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:14.210
It shorter I have to condense it
honey.

00:50:15.227 --> 00:50:17.227
You 

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.020
tube figure skating live with 
cats go to sleep.

00:50:20.021 --> 00:50:22.021
Yoga!

00:50:23.021 --> 00:50:25.021
What about 

00:50:26.324 --> 00:50:27.336
you?
&gt;&gt; It's easier to answer the 

00:50:27.337 --> 00:50:29.788
things that bring me joy before 
that I long for now 

00:50:33.399 --> 00:50:35.399
that I fantasize while I'm 
filming.

00:50:37.107 --> 00:50:39.107
&gt;&gt; I did not realize are going 
in this direction.

00:50:39.748 --> 00:50:41.748
[laughter] 

00:50:43.803 --> 00:50:45.803
&gt;&gt; It doesn't have to be sexual

00:50:47.143 --> 00:50:47.970
!
Self-care for me is actually 

00:50:47.971 --> 00:50:49.971
sitting 

00:50:50.989 --> 00:50:52.989
down and reading a 

00:50:55.706 --> 00:50:57.706
book or just sitting 

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.800
down.

00:51:02.205 --> 00:51:04.205
&gt;&gt; I'm a Pisces and a level 
bath.

00:51:06.345 --> 00:51:07.776
&gt;&gt; Please try to take only one 
once a week it wastes a lot of 

00:51:07.777 --> 00:51:10.619
water.
[laughter] 

00:51:12.083 --> 00:51:14.745
&gt;&gt; Isn't the bath better than 
the shower?

00:51:15.765 --> 00:51:17.765
That whole plastic thing the 
whole straw 

00:51:21.301 --> 00:51:24.702
thing honey, I was so scared.
The bathroom is very important 

00:51:24.703 --> 00:51:27.941
to have my float in my soul to 
my records and that's another 

00:51:27.942 --> 00:51:29.942
big one.
&gt;&gt; How long do so?

00:51:34.633 --> 00:51:35.570
&gt;&gt; I get super pretty nice day 
for an hour.

00:51:35.571 --> 00:51:36.977
When it starts to get really 
cold that's when it's time to 

00:51:36.978 --> 00:51:38.978
get out.
&gt;&gt; You don't add water?

00:51:42.691 --> 00:51:44.691
&gt;&gt; In Japan our bathtub self 
regulated 

00:51:45.742 --> 00:51:47.742
its 

00:51:49.426 --> 00:51:51.426
heat.

00:51:53.301 --> 00:51:54.118
&gt;&gt; I just for myself so badly 
and that.

00:51:54.119 --> 00:51:56.119
My Google translate would not 
work on the button.

00:51:59.021 --> 00:52:01.513
Honey I was scorched.
Wow!

00:52:02.528 --> 00:52:04.528
But they were electric honey!

00:52:06.602 --> 00:52:08.602
[laughter] 

00:52:10.058 --> 00:52:12.058
&gt;&gt; Not necessarily from ending 
episode but 

00:52:14.571 --> 00:52:16.611
just my life has come to we get 
to experience incredible nights 

00:52:16.612 --> 00:52:18.612
like this 

00:52:20.637 --> 00:52:22.637
where we get to share our 
stories and everything.

00:52:22.956 --> 00:52:23.756
The time spent with family, my 
family have neglected so much 

00:52:23.757 --> 00:52:25.757
since the show 

00:52:26.767 --> 00:52:28.767
came 

00:52:35.909 --> 00:52:36.930
out and that's one of the 
sacrifices about having a life 

00:52:36.931 --> 00:52:38.775
like this is that when I have 
five minutes to just even check 

00:52:38.776 --> 00:52:39.796
in with my sister needs to feel 
guilty I stop calling her for a 

00:52:39.797 --> 00:52:40.848
while.
What I realize now is even if I 

00:52:40.849 --> 00:52:43.322
called her and I literally have 
two minutes in a car about to 

00:52:43.323 --> 00:52:45.323
get out what is going to call 
you tell you I love you.

00:52:45.385 --> 00:52:46.805
Now tell me about all the 
medical issues that your cats 

00:52:46.806 --> 00:52:48.806
having endeavor issues with the 
kid or whatever.

00:52:50.478 --> 00:52:51.498
Tell me normal things.
Little pocket like that to 

00:52:51.499 --> 00:52:53.499
connect with 

00:52:54.501 --> 00:52:56.501
loved 

00:52:57.627 --> 00:52:58.656
ones.
&gt;&gt; We have a common theme we 

00:52:58.657 --> 00:53:02.969
only have very little time, but 
we are usually away from her 

00:53:02.970 --> 00:53:04.970
loved ones animal with my 
husband a lot.

00:53:06.864 --> 00:53:08.864
But what brings me so much joy 
is being 

00:53:09.871 --> 00:53:12.968
at home.
If I had three days off I will 

00:53:12.969 --> 00:53:14.969
sit on 

00:53:17.211 --> 00:53:19.987
myself will with my husband and 
â€“.

00:53:22.448 --> 00:53:24.448
&gt;&gt; You always Insta story when 
you do.

00:53:24.873 --> 00:53:27.531
&gt;&gt; I love to cook and bake so 
spend the majority of my day in 

00:53:27.532 --> 00:53:29.591
the kitchen and sat on the couch
and set my husband and I don't 

00:53:29.592 --> 00:53:31.592
want to talk to anyone else.

00:53:33.421 --> 00:53:35.421
I just want to watch â€“.
&gt;&gt; You love nature.

00:53:37.771 --> 00:53:39.771
&gt;&gt; He wears TiVos willingly.

00:53:42.503 --> 00:53:44.503
&gt;&gt; I'm so granola when I'm in 
Utah you 

00:53:45.505 --> 00:53:47.505
have no idea.

00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:52.919
&gt;&gt; Granola!
&gt;&gt; Bobby a way to get in on the 

00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:54.920
question 

00:53:56.783 --> 00:53:57.817
and I have five minutes of 
lightning round.

00:53:57.818 --> 00:53:59.035
&gt;&gt; Season one and season two 
there were many nights where I 

00:53:59.036 --> 00:54:01.036
would come home and 

00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:04.975
cry because it was so 
emotionally overwhelming and the

00:54:04.976 --> 00:54:07.029
connection to see us make with 
our heroes are real.

00:54:08.845 --> 00:54:10.845
And again they are 40-6 years of

00:54:12.887 --> 00:54:14.887
connections that are condensed 
down to you 45 minutes.

00:54:15.394 --> 00:54:16.624
There's a lot had to work out 
myself and my own feelings on 

00:54:16.625 --> 00:54:18.625
how to deal with 

00:54:19.899 --> 00:54:20.943
that, motions I tucked away for 
so many years.

00:54:20.944 --> 00:54:23.840
I find that keeping myself 
tethered to the things that I 

00:54:23.841 --> 00:54:25.841
did before, making sure I'm 
spending time with my husband, 

00:54:27.864 --> 00:54:31.028
the hikes, spending time with 
friends that have been there for

00:54:31.029 --> 00:54:33.029
me and family.

00:54:34.514 --> 00:54:34.924
If your family is not there, 
your friends that are your 

00:54:34.925 --> 00:54:36.390
family.
Spending time in making sure 

00:54:36.391 --> 00:54:40.528
that you're making those moments
with people you love the most, 

00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:43.750
that's how you keep grounded.

00:54:45.881 --> 00:54:47.881
I also love orange theory.

00:54:49.501 --> 00:54:52.219
&gt;&gt; You love to do physical 
activity.

00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:57.220
He does!
[laughter] 

00:54:57.925 --> 00:54:59.925
&gt;&gt; What I want from each of you 
and I 

00:55:01.332 --> 00:55:05.022
say this now so that you can 
think of your answer, but at the

00:55:05.023 --> 00:55:07.023
end of the show there is always 

00:55:08.036 --> 00:55:10.036
the Q 

00:55:12.403 --> 00:55:14.403
eer Eye hip tip.

00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:18.930
Maybe give one that has been on 
the show preferably one that has

00:55:18.931 --> 00:55:20.931
not been on the show and I will 
start with you Jonathan.

00:55:23.643 --> 00:55:25.643
&gt;&gt; You just want hip tip?

00:55:27.049 --> 00:55:29.049
Just explained to you what this 
is?

00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:33.960
I'm sorry I was zoning out.

00:55:37.312 --> 00:55:39.312
&gt;&gt; On the fly hip tip.

00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:43.045
&gt;&gt; If you need a minute I have 
got it.

00:55:43.046 --> 00:55:45.046
&gt;&gt; The items in your closet or 
saving 

00:55:46.868 --> 00:55:47.512
for a special occasion, why 
saving that special occasion?

00:55:47.513 --> 00:55:49.767
Don't want to feel special every
day?

00:55:53.634 --> 00:55:55.274
[applause] 
&gt;&gt; Where that ball gown to work!

00:55:58.281 --> 00:56:00.585
&gt;&gt; My issue is when is the Queen
actually inviting her over for 

00:56:00.586 --> 00:56:02.414
tea?
Probably never so use that 

00:56:02.415 --> 00:56:04.415
tedious for 

00:56:05.416 --> 00:56:07.416
another occasion.

00:56:09.699 --> 00:56:11.699
&gt;&gt; I figured mine 

00:56:13.621 --> 00:56:15.621
out.

00:56:17.651 --> 00:56:21.527
&gt;&gt; Where prom down to Class.
&gt;&gt; If it makes you happy it 

00:56:21.528 --> 00:56:23.528
can't be that bad.
Cheryl Crow!

00:56:24.802 --> 00:56:27.261
[laughter] 
&gt;&gt; I will do my hip tip but 

00:56:27.262 --> 00:56:29.262
pretend this 

00:56:30.871 --> 00:56:34.008
is a haircolor box.
Thinking about doing a box of 

00:56:34.009 --> 00:56:36.009
color at home.

00:56:37.025 --> 00:56:39.025
No you're 

00:56:42.405 --> 00:56:43.428
not.
And then those who spend now is 

00:56:43.429 --> 00:56:45.429
going to staying here for the 
four years we grew out.

00:56:46.296 --> 00:56:48.962
Your wallet and everyone around 
you will say thank you so much 

00:56:48.963 --> 00:56:50.963
put it down away 

00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:54.380
from the haircolor isle.

00:56:58.345 --> 00:57:00.345
[applause] 

00:57:01.776 --> 00:57:03.776
&gt;&gt;

00:57:05.082 --> 00:57:06.099
This is literally not a wives 
tale in nice had so many ugly 

00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:09.595
headlights because people live.
Once your hair has had haircolor

00:57:09.596 --> 00:57:11.596
on it 

00:57:12.603 --> 00:57:14.276
in their it's not though, it was
four months ago it's gone.

00:57:14.277 --> 00:57:16.277
No it's not.

00:57:17.908 --> 00:57:20.391
Four months is up.
My hair, my link right here that

00:57:20.392 --> 00:57:22.392
is three years of hair.

00:57:24.432 --> 00:57:26.432
You need to think about that.

00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:30.380
If you do not have money for 
your 

00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:34.600
whatever you want to have that 
ruin the permanent line.

00:57:34.601 --> 00:57:36.601
It's a nightmare and expensive 
to get 

00:57:37.610 --> 00:57:39.610
rid of it.

00:57:41.524 --> 00:57:43.524
Are you still watching?

00:57:45.313 --> 00:57:47.313
[laughter] 
&gt;&gt; Bobby?

00:57:49.357 --> 00:57:51.967
&gt;&gt; My hip tip is passionate is 
in my home?

00:57:54.982 --> 00:57:57.279
What are the trends?
Screw trends.

00:57:58.296 --> 00:58:00.296
Find the one item you love if 
that item 

00:58:01.908 --> 00:58:04.597
really brings you joy as Marie 
conduit says it's a big 

00:58:05.611 --> 00:58:06.227
inclination that it's a design 
direction and you should do it.

00:58:06.228 --> 00:58:08.228
Find the item you love and go 
from there.

00:58:12.671 --> 00:58:14.671
&gt;&gt; It's Bobby's one it 

00:58:16.545 --> 00:58:19.100
m policy honey.

00:58:22.374 --> 00:58:23.402
&gt;&gt; His one item was cat stuff.
&gt;&gt; I'm kind of thinking a 

00:58:23.403 --> 00:58:25.403
special 

00:58:27.015 --> 00:58:29.015
12-year-old girl who is 

00:58:32.159 --> 00:58:34.159
here.
&gt;&gt; Sally.

00:58:36.437 --> 00:58:38.437
Where is 

00:58:39.576 --> 00:58:41.576
Sally?

00:58:44.263 --> 00:58:46.263
[applause] 

00:58:49.321 --> 00:58:50.583
&gt;&gt; Thinking about what it was 
like when I was 12 years old I 

00:58:50.584 --> 00:58:54.040
was living in West Virginia and 
I used to bring these lunches to

00:58:54.041 --> 00:58:56.041
school my mother would take 
great pride and care in 

00:58:58.068 --> 00:59:00.068
making lunch.

00:59:03.878 --> 00:59:05.878
[crosstalk] 
&gt;&gt; Come here Sally!

00:59:09.191 --> 00:59:11.191
&gt;&gt; It's happening, it's 
happening!

00:59:16.526 --> 00:59:18.149
[applause] 
&gt;&gt; You could have tripped you 

00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:20.150
ran there!

00:59:26.777 --> 00:59:29.860
&gt;&gt; I apologize for my breath.
I think back about what it was 

00:59:29.861 --> 00:59:31.886
like being 12 in West Virginia 
and I would see the difference 

00:59:31.887 --> 00:59:34.598
between the kids who have 
lunches in the kids who did not.

00:59:34.599 --> 00:59:36.599
I remember how much it affected 
me and 

00:59:38.832 --> 00:59:41.839
it was only 10-15 years later 
that I started thinking about it

00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:43.840
and thinking I had the 

00:59:45.052 --> 00:59:47.052
opportunity to 

00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:50.833
actually give weather was have 
my sandwich or half of my meal 

00:59:50.834 --> 00:59:52.834
and I did not do that.
I thought about it but I was too

00:59:53.492 --> 00:59:55.492
embarrassed to do it when I was 
12 years old.

00:59:55.972 --> 00:59:56.981
And these kids often the didn't 
have lunch at school I can only 

00:59:56.982 --> 00:59:58.425
imagine what they had or didn't 
have for breakfast or dinner.

00:59:58.426 --> 01:00:02.287
If you're in a position where 
you can share your food with 

01:00:02.288 --> 01:00:07.209
somebody, you may never know 
what effect will have on their 

01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:09.210
lives, but I think it's a really

01:00:10.217 --> 01:00:12.217
important thing to 

01:00:13.535 --> 01:00:14.548
do.
[laughter] 

01:00:14.549 --> 01:00:16.549
&gt;&gt; Sure your food!

01:00:19.045 --> 01:00:21.045
Enke for coming to say hi to us.

01:00:32.715 --> 01:00:33.333
us.
[cheering] 

01:00:33.334 --> 01:00:34.380
&gt;&gt; Thanks Sally.
That's a great way to end this.

01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:41.630
Jonathan, Bobby, 

01:00:43.734 --> 01:00:46.027
Antoni Kaz.
Thank you so much for putting up

01:00:46.028 --> 01:00:48.028
with us.

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:54.041
[applause] 
&gt;&gt; I think we are going back 

01:00:54.042 --> 01:00:56.042
through the doors.

01:01:01.111 --> 01:01:03.111
&gt;&gt; Thank
