00:00:03.152 --> 00:00:04.360
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi, everyone.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.300
Welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.360
Today it is my pleasure
to welcome Jim Butcher

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.827
for "The Aeronaut's Windlass."

00:00:09.827 --> 00:00:11.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.730
Jim, welcome to Google.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:13.180
JIM BUTCHER: Thank
you very much.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.429
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you
for us being your first tech

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.720
stop ever, not bookstore.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.760
Can you tell us about the book?

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.314
JIM BUTCHER: It's
a steampunk novel.

00:00:24.314 --> 00:00:25.730
When I first started
pitching it I

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.467
tried to tell people that it's
sort of X-Men meets Hornblower.

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:33.050
But then I decided that wasn't
steampunky enough, so from then

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.133
on I said it's "League of
Extraordinary Gentlemen"

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.780
meets Hornblower.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.030
It's set in a world where
the surface of the world

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.738
is very dangerous,
and so everybody lives

00:00:40.738 --> 00:00:43.410
in these enormous
black obsidian spires

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.540
that were built many,
many, many moons ago.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.260
And all contact between the
spires is done by airship.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.930
All diplomacy, all
trade, all everything

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.590
is done by airship
from spire to spire.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.360
Two of the more powerful
spires in this world

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.820
are in the opening stages of
going to war with one another,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.670
and the monarch of
a local spire has

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.510
decided that he needs
an action team to help

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.760
better position his spire
before the war gets started.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.740
So he goes out and
recruits a pirate

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.640
and a princess and a wizard.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.390
There's a checklist.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.660
[LAUGH] I don't
make up these rules.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.790
And a warrior and a girl
who can talk to cats.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:25.900
Plus her cat.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.442
Although it's not really as much
her cat is as she's his human.

00:01:31.442 --> 00:01:33.900
He gets this group together
and sends them off on a mission

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.620
to find a traitor
within their own midst

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.020
before something totally
horrible happens.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.920
And then totally horrible things
happen, and adventure ensues.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.560
That's the first book as
we get to meet these people

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.170
and see the kind
of world they're in

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.000
and then throw them
into hideous danger

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.280
against horrible monsters
and evil opponents

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.750
and not-so-evil opponents.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.580
I had a whole lot
of fun writing it.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.270
It's one of the things
I've had a better

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.634
time writing than many
other projects I've done.

00:02:06.634 --> 00:02:08.550
Also, it's the longest
book I've ever written.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.310
It checked in at
over 200,000 words.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.570
It's a falling hazard to
children and small animals.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.516
If you get the book,
be careful with that.

00:02:17.516 --> 00:02:20.140
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'd love to know
what some of your inspirations

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.180
were for it.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.790
It felt like this
hybrid between a world

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.970
where there's magic,
much like Dresden Files,

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.320
but it's also this sort of
nobility-based oligarchy

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.912
situation.

00:02:30.912 --> 00:02:32.120
JIM BUTCHER: Not "Star Wars."

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.761
Definitely not "Star Wars."

00:02:33.761 --> 00:02:34.677
FEMALE SPEAKER: Never.

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.420
JIM BUTCHER: Really,
the heaviest influence

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.710
probably came from the
nautical hero novel.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.540
You start with Hornblower--
that was Forester,

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.711
I believe-- and then
the Jack Aubrey books

00:02:53.711 --> 00:02:56.210
that were the ones that were
published in the '90s, the ones

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.074
they made "Master and
Commander" off of.

00:02:58.074 --> 00:02:59.990
"Master and Commander"
was my background movie

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.490
for while I was
writing this series.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.150
Those and then David Weber's
Honor Harrington books,

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.320
which also came from
that same source,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.470
was also partially
an inspiration.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.860
And, because my brain is
not working right now,

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.220
"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea."

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.315
That's my strongest direct
steampunk influence,

00:03:25.315 --> 00:03:27.440
although that was just
science fiction at the time.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.720
They didn't know to
call it steampunk.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.030
I actually don't think
it's a steampunk novel.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.607
I wanted to call
it a steam opera,

00:03:34.607 --> 00:03:36.440
because it's like space
opera, but it's not.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.100
It's airships.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.035
And so I wanted to
call it steam opera.

00:03:39.035 --> 00:03:40.660
My editor was like
"Jim, you can't just

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.910
go inventing genres like that."

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.950
And I was like "Oh."

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.610
But maybe if the series
gets enough oomph,

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.860
maybe there'll be a new genre.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:52.590
That would be cool.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.370
FEMALE SPEAKER: You
can be a pioneer.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.120
JIM BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.700
Yeah.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.650
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's interesting
that you mentioned nautical.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.320
They're in the air,
but it felt very naval.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.477
Did you do a lot of
research into that?

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:06.560
Having read the "Master
and Commander" and Horatio

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.601
Hornblower books, I felt
like I was reading that,

00:04:08.601 --> 00:04:11.419
but at the same time, they're
soaring through the air.

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:13.460
JIM BUTCHER: I was doing
a whole lot of research,

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.760
and then I finally realized
that I was researching

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.649
the wrong place,
because I really

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:22.280
need to be researching
ballooning and blimp

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.280
stuff, the blimp stuff from
World War I especially,

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.230
to find out more things
about was going on.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.447
I did get into
nautical research.

00:04:33.447 --> 00:04:35.280
And let me tell you--
this is what I learned

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.910
about nautical research.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.590
There is a name for everything,
and it makes no sense at all.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.340
But you had to have a specific
name for every little rope

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.400
and every little stay
where the rope was tied off

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.320
and anything the
rope was attached to.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.740
They all had to have these
very specific names so that

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.350
in the middle of a
crisis situation,

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.600
somebody who was an officer
could look at you and say,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.690
"You!

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.630
Something something
the mizzen bowsprit!"

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.620
And you would know
exactly what had

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.760
to be done, because
otherwise you might all die.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.950
It was a very, technical,
very focused language

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.600
for when you were working
on one of these ships.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.129
And if you didn't know
it, you were a threat

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:14.670
to everybody else,
because you needed

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.270
to be able to do everything.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:19.390
Yes.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.180
There was so much research.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.129
And I still need to
do more, because it's

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:25.170
going to get more involved
as the series goes on,

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.190
because that's what series
do, from everything I've seen.

00:05:31.026 --> 00:05:33.150
I'm actually going to have
to get down to San Diego

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.700
and go hang out on the tall
ships that are in the harbor

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.490
there and ask a lot of questions
and write a lot of things down.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.980
FEMALE SPEAKER: Sounds like
a terrible, terrible research

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:40.220
experience.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.053
JIM BUTCHER: I know!

00:05:41.053 --> 00:05:42.287
It'll be so awful!

00:05:42.287 --> 00:05:44.370
FEMALE SPEAKER: Is it
easier, in a case like that,

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.340
to then just use our real-world
terminology for that,

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.850
or would you rather create
your own in this scenario?

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.020
JIM BUTCHER: I like to use
real-world terminology whenever

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.770
I can, because when
I'm writing, I'm

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.930
doing the absolute best I
can to make the language as

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.610
transparent as possible, so
that when you're reading,

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.280
you forget that
you're reading words,

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.363
and you're just watching
the movie that is playing

00:06:07.363 --> 00:06:09.090
on the screen in your head.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.050
I try and do everything I can to
keep my language from intruding

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.720
on the story that's happening,
which is why, I think,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.810
I write at about an eighth-grade
reading level, on average--

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.870
because I don't want
the words to get

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.320
in the way of the
experience for the reader.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.520
Books, I think, are the
first virtual reality.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.480
And I invest very heavily
in that idea in the way

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.141
I've put together
my writing style.

00:06:34.141 --> 00:06:36.140
FEMALE SPEAKER: What's
something about this book

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.420
that you learned from
your previous series

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.850
that you enjoy being able
to explore in this series?

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.605
What limitations
were removed for you

00:06:43.605 --> 00:06:44.813
from getting to start afresh?

00:06:48.609 --> 00:06:50.650
JIM BUTCHER: The Alera
books were the other books

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.840
that I wrote before this,
and they were, similarly,

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.460
third-person, multiple
viewpoint characters.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.800
And the pace for those
books was a little bit slow,

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.140
because they happened over
a broader span of time,

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:06.466
for the most part, then when
compared to the Dresden Files.

00:07:06.466 --> 00:07:08.340
When I write the Dresden
Files, basically I'm

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.586
writing about Harry Dresden's
worst weekend of the year.

00:07:12.586 --> 00:07:13.960
And so all the
story that happens

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.090
has to happen in this very
little compressed space.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.256
I decided I wanted to try
and do that with this book

00:07:18.256 --> 00:07:21.970
as well, only from multiple
character viewpoints.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.690
The events of the story happen
in that same compressed space,

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.856
but we see it from several
different points of view.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.930
When you've got that,
then the question

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.150
becomes where do
I put the camera

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:36.520
for this particular scene?

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.490
Which character is
best going to show you

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.352
know the events of this action?

00:07:40.352 --> 00:07:42.560
Which character is best
going to be involved in them?

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.966
Which is the one that's
going to help the reader best

00:07:44.966 --> 00:07:46.090
understand what's going on?

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.465
Because I'll know what's going
on in this airship battle,

00:07:48.465 --> 00:07:51.390
but if I just write paragraphs
and paragraphs of airship

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:53.770
battle, the reader
isn't necessarily

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.020
going to know what's going on.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.400
So it's like OK, for
this fight, we're

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.566
going to go over to this
character, who's never been

00:07:58.566 --> 00:08:00.240
on an airship
before, and yet who

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.072
is bossy enough
to demand answers

00:08:03.072 --> 00:08:05.030
to questions from people
who have better things

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:09.060
to be doing so that the reader
will get what's going on,

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.930
because the characters who
know will be explaining it

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.920
to this dummy.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.640
It's a concept called the joy
of idiocy in writing craft.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.050
You always keep an idiot
around to ask questions

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:23.790
as a surrogate for the reader,
so that-- hopefully-- the idiot

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.990
asks the questions that
the reader wants answered,

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.400
and then the reader gets to know
the answers without ever having

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.691
to admit that they didn't know.

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:33.998
That's one of the
fun things you get

00:08:33.998 --> 00:08:36.039
to play with when you've
got multiple viewpoints.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.300
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank
you for providing us all

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.535
with very interesting idiots.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.860
As you said, it was a
great, awesome experience

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:44.960
to have these
multiple viewpoints.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.680
And one thing I loved
about this particular book

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.890
is that you have a bunch
of wonderful women in it.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.880
It's, I think, at least
an even match-up of female

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.480
protagonists to male, and
there's this whole range

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.804
on both genders.

00:08:56.804 --> 00:08:58.220
Where were some
of the inspiration

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.580
for those characters?

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.010
JIM BUTCHER: Some of them?

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:06.390
I was writing, and
there they were.

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:10.540
Bridget certainly
emerged that way.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.300
Gwen was a character
who actually

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.590
emerged from a roleplaying
game that I was

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:15.780
running in this story world.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.145
That's how I do my research
for my story worlds.

00:09:18.145 --> 00:09:19.770
I'll get something
built, and then I'll

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:23.090
run a roleplaying
game in the world.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.670
That's always wonderful,
because when I do that,

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:29.006
the players can never
do anything right.

00:09:29.006 --> 00:09:30.380
You can write any
script you want

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.870
for the players-- they aren't
going to follow that script.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.840
They're going to
break it somehow.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.120
And then you find you
find yourself frantically

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.820
building the world six
inches in front of their feet

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:43.240
as they are stopping off in
the completely wrong direction.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.760
It's a good exercise
in creativity,

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:49.910
and it really helps me flesh
out things as I'm going along.

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:51.580
She came from one
of the players.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:59.900
I knew what I wanted
my villain to be like.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.135
I knew I wanted my villain
to be evil Mary Poppins.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.530
And she kind of is.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.490
She's this very proper
person, and she can't kill you

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:12.379
as long as you're being polite.

00:10:12.379 --> 00:10:14.670
But she just waits for you
to make a slip in etiquette,

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.754
and then she can
tear your eyes out.

00:10:17.754 --> 00:10:18.795
A little bit of pressure.

00:10:18.795 --> 00:10:21.000
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's every
Catholic schoolchild's worst

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:21.499
nightmare.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.860
There's one very unique
character who I very much

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.535
enjoyed, and that is Rowl.

00:10:28.535 --> 00:10:30.730
You wrote a cat who talks.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:33.620
You wrote people
who talk to cats.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.445
What up with that?

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.990
JIM BUTCHER: I wanted cats,
and I wanted talking cats.

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:43.080
And I was thinking I
wanted to establish

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.660
this race of
intelligent cats that

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.300
live alongside humanity,
not with humanity

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.240
in a pet situation, because
that wouldn't really

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.280
happen very well.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.090
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's sort of a
pet situation in the other way.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:54.180
JIM BUTCHER: Yes.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.740
More it works the
other way around.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.730
These cats live alongside the
societies in these spires,

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:01.490
and they live in the
vents and air tunnels

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:05.217
and kill things that come in
there from the surface that

00:11:05.217 --> 00:11:05.800
are cat-sized.

00:11:09.954 --> 00:11:12.120
Humans don't really like
them, but they can't really

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.661
get rid of them,
because they perform

00:11:13.661 --> 00:11:14.990
a really useful service.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:16.540
And they can't
really ignore them,

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:20.960
because the cats have
opposable thumbs and matches.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.920
So in a lot of
ways, for the cats,

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.600
it's like oh, I notice your
warehouse is rodent-free.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.100
Perhaps you would like it to
continue to be rodent-free.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.920
Perhaps there will be cream
waiting for us every Thursday

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.480
at 3:00.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.800
Really the cats are
this little fuzzy mafia

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:47.360
that exists in an underworld
alongside humanity.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.490
But the cats also can go
everywhere and hear everything

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:52.770
and learn everything,
because they're quiet,

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:56.350
and they're smart, and
they have excellent senses.

00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:00.600
And the lord of the
spire, the spirarch,

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.170
figures out that wait-- these
cats are really, really useful.

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:06.396
We probably shouldn't just
treat them like vermin.

00:12:06.396 --> 00:12:07.770
I need every
advantage I can get.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:11.980
And so he recruits somebody
who's friends with a cat.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.620
Her father runs a vattery,
which is where they grow meat

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.806
in vats inside these spires.

00:12:18.806 --> 00:12:20.430
Basically, she works
in a butcher shop.

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:22.160
They have a deal
with the local cats.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.243
She made friends with one
when she was very small.

00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:26.330
The cat named her Little Mouse.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.577
She's about six-two.

00:12:28.577 --> 00:12:30.410
The cat named her Little
Mouse, and then she

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:33.380
grew up much larger than she
had been when he first met her,

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:36.244
which offended him greatly.

00:12:36.244 --> 00:12:37.160
He hangs out with her.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.190
So Rowl and Bridget are a team.

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:42.060
Rowl taught Bridget
how to speak cat,

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.350
and so Bridget can
talk to the cats.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:47.775
The cats understand English,
except when they don't.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.070
They're the most obnoxious
little characters.

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:54.990
Oh, my gosh!

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.600
Honestly, I would like to
think these books will succeed

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.680
because it's got
a cool story world

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.430
or it's got really
identifiable characters

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:02.920
or it's got great action
or because there's

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.960
good plots in them,
but they're going

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.626
to succeed because
there's talking cats.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.739
And I've made peace with that.

00:13:10.739 --> 00:13:13.030
FEMALE SPEAKER: Opposable
thumbs means signable checks.

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:14.410
JIM BUTCHER: Yes, exactly.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:16.785
The hard part is not letting
them steal the show from all

00:13:16.785 --> 00:13:18.144
the plain old boring humans.

00:13:18.144 --> 00:13:19.560
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
was so surprised

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.965
to learn that you were not
necessarily a cat person

00:13:21.965 --> 00:13:22.465
beforehand.

00:13:25.579 --> 00:13:27.120
I'm not a cat person,
but that's what

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.850
I imagine cats would sound
like in terms of [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:32.600
JIM BUTCHER: I wasn't
a cat person myself.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.980
But I knew cat people and
how they think and talk

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.070
about their cats.

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:39.280
I've been introduced
to cats for a long time

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.160
from the point of view of
those who love them very much.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.832
Now I have cats.

00:13:43.832 --> 00:13:44.540
They're not mine.

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.450
I got them for my fiancee, and
she named them after the cats

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:50.535
in the books.

00:13:50.535 --> 00:13:53.160
They're Maine coons, and they're
kittens, and they're enormous,

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.930
and they're adorable.

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:56.000
I'm like go away, cat.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.964
I don't need to like you.

00:13:57.964 --> 00:13:58.630
Get out of here.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:13:59.963
We have a business relationship.

00:13:59.963 --> 00:14:00.880
Go.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.690
And it's like why are you
sitting on my lap and purring?

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:04.482
It's so adorable.

00:14:04.482 --> 00:14:04.982
Damn.

00:14:09.239 --> 00:14:11.280
FEMALE SPEAKER: You've
sort of touched upon this,

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.670
but you said you very much
enjoyed writing these books.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:17.680
What's something that was
different about writing them

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.490
from writing your other ones,
aside from talking cats?

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:23.323
JIM BUTCHER: Right,
aside from talking cats.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.010
I was really working
on trying to make sure

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:30.240
that I had down a
dialogue that didn't quite

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.670
sound like regular everyday--
the way people use their speech

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:34.170
patterns.

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.336
I was trying for something
a little bit more formal,

00:14:36.336 --> 00:14:38.670
a little bit more
archaic-sounding.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:42.110
I wanted it to feel a little
bit more like "Downton Abby"

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:44.120
without it actually
being that way.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:51.260
They use the word
"quite" a lot, and so on.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.290
There's a lot of these
conversations that

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:55.650
are very painfully
precise, and nobody

00:14:55.650 --> 00:15:00.970
wants to talk about their
actual feelings, and so on.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:02.540
That was the idea.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:07.110
There's a scene where everybody
is having tea and maybe getting

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:09.380
ready to murder each
other, and we don't really

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.680
know until the tea's done.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.076
That was fun to write.

00:15:14.076 --> 00:15:15.200
Now I'm learning about tea.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.033
Now I've been approached
by all these people

00:15:17.033 --> 00:15:20.270
who know about tea, so now
I'm learning about tea things.

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.775
Apparently you can
have tea duels now.

00:15:22.775 --> 00:15:24.900
I don't know how that works,
but they make holsters

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.730
with teacups and
saucers on them.

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:28.980
Apparently it's a whole thing.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:30.110
FEMALE SPEAKER: Like
one, two, three, brew!

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:31.500
JIM BUTCHER: I don't know.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.250
FEMALE SPEAKER: Maybe
you should find out!

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:34.458
JIM BUTCHER: Are you kidding?

00:15:34.458 --> 00:15:36.670
I'm not even sure I would
survive the situation.

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.170
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
curious if there

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.670
were any lessons
you learned writing

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:44.629
your previous books that you
were excited to apply to these?

00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:45.420
JIM BUTCHER: Maybe.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.628
FEMALE SPEAKER: Don't commit
to a twenty-book series?

00:15:47.628 --> 00:15:49.170
JIM BUTCHER: Yeah,
that might be one.

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:50.086
FEMALE SPEAKER: Three.

00:15:50.086 --> 00:15:50.800
Three is safe.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.592
JIM BUTCHER: I did.

00:15:52.592 --> 00:15:54.550
I've got three books
contracted in this series,

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:57.430
and I've set it up so I can add
it after three or six or nine.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:59.590
I hope I get to do
the whole thing,

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:01.190
because it's got a
pretty big story,

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:03.030
and I want to tell
the whole thing.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:04.250
I think it'd be a lot of fun.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:06.500
I don't know if it will
actually get there.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.520
We'll see how the market
does and how receptive

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.760
the audience is and so on.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.120
I'm pretty sure that
people, when they read it,

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:14.900
they're going to
start liking it,

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.180
and they'll go
along for the ride,

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.138
and they'll want to get
all the way to the end.

00:16:18.138 --> 00:16:21.090
But I can't predict that.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.054
You've got to make plans.

00:16:23.054 --> 00:16:24.470
So I made plans
on this one rather

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:27.810
than just saying this is
going to be 20 books long.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:30.375
That was a terrible plan.

00:16:30.375 --> 00:16:31.750
There was no way
I was ever going

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:34.020
to be able to sell that
series at 20 books,

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:36.270
but I was too dumb to know
that, so I went and did it.

00:16:37.985 --> 00:16:39.860
FEMALE SPEAKER: You do
something interesting.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.460
I'm not sure if you still do
it, but you use beta readers.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:43.210
JIM BUTCHER: I do.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:44.670
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Did you use those?

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.060
JIM BUTCHER: Oh, absolutely.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.010
In fact, in picking
the project, I

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:52.490
wrote the first 20%, 25%
of four different novels

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.170
and presented them
to the beta readers

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:55.885
on at a time to
get their responses

00:16:55.885 --> 00:16:57.260
and say here--
what do you think?

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:57.830
Here-- what do you think?

00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:59.070
Here-- what do you think?

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:00.530
There was a science
fiction novel,

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:01.890
which was basically
"Men in Black"

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:04.030
on the moon, a couple
hundred years in the future.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:09.510
There was my Black
Company-esque fantasy novel.

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:11.555
There was a third fantasy novel.

00:17:11.555 --> 00:17:12.930
I forget the
details of that one.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:14.785
It was kind of awful.

00:17:14.785 --> 00:17:16.460
And then there was
this steampunk.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.490
The steampunk was the one that
everybody was like oh, my gosh!

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:19.510
I had a stronger
reaction to that

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:21.400
than I've had to anything,
including the Dresden Files,

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.316
from the beta readers.

00:17:22.316 --> 00:17:25.329
So I'm like, OK-- it looks
I'm writing steampunk now.

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:26.970
I seem to have a
handle on this one.

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:27.974
Let's go.

00:17:27.974 --> 00:17:29.640
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
think the beta process

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.764
is something we at Google
are pretty familiar with.

00:17:31.764 --> 00:17:35.189
Where do you get your
beta readers from?

00:17:35.189 --> 00:17:36.230
Are there tiers of betas?

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.060
Is it you have a
trusted circle of here's

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.476
where you want
your feedback from?

00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:42.250
Or is it just you want
a general populace

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:43.675
of people who enjoy your work?

00:17:43.675 --> 00:17:46.050
JIM BUTCHER: I've got about
15 people on the beta reading

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:47.750
list.

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:49.430
I've got a waiting
list of beta readers.

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:54.440
But there are times
when I meet somebody

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.740
where somebody comes up with
a very incisive question

00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:00.190
or makes an observation
that is really sharp

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:03.580
or picks up on a plot point
that I've dropped hints for

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:06.010
but haven't really unveiled
or brought out into the open,

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:08.330
and I'll be like would you
like to be a beta reader?

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:12.180
And you would be surprised--
only about one person in three

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:16.190
who I ask to be a beta reader
actually does it and replies

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:17.540
to things on time and so on.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.169
Most of them just wander off.

00:18:20.169 --> 00:18:21.210
I don't know why that is.

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.230
It's a creative crowd.

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:25.726
FEMALE SPEAKER: We know
nothing about beta feedback.

00:18:25.726 --> 00:18:29.240
[LAUGHTER] I'd love to
know-- in general, who

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.860
are some of your influences?

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:32.860
JIM BUTCHER: In general?

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:35.522
FEMALE SPEAKER: In
general-- life, literary.

00:18:35.522 --> 00:18:36.730
JIM BUTCHER: Not "Star Wars."

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:40.980
FEMALE SPEAKER: Not "Star Wars."

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:44.260
JIM BUTCHER: The big ones are
probably my dad and my dad

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:45.350
and my mom and my sisters.

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:47.058
My family have been
my biggest influence.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.380
In my first book,
I write a thank-you

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:52.500
to my writing
teacher, who taught

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.800
me everything I need
to know about writing

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.633
and then to my dad, who
taught me everything

00:18:55.633 --> 00:18:57.760
I need to know about living.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:01.802
My sisters, they took
me to see "Star Wars"

00:19:01.802 --> 00:19:02.760
when it first came out.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.160
It's the first movie I
actually remember going to see.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.130
When "Empire Strikes Back" came
out, they came to the school

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:10.060
and lied to my
principal and told him

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.730
that I had a dentist
appointment and checked me out

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:15.680
of school and then blindfolded
me and took me down

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.910
to the very first premier
of "Empire" in Kansas

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:20.360
City at the big old
grand opry theater

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:24.550
with the big swooping curtains
in front of the screen.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:27.590
Because they were
cool like that.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:30.195
And the same for "Return
of the Jedi" and so on.

00:19:30.195 --> 00:19:32.070
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think
you owe them forever.

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.530
JIM BUTCHER: Yeah, it's true.

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:34.740
I try to pay them back.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.890
When "Return of
the King" came out,

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:39.300
I went and checked my son
out of school-- same thing.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.550
Took him to see the
first showing of "Return

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:42.716
of the King," because there
are some traditions that

00:19:42.716 --> 00:19:43.870
are worth preserving.

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:48.060
And all the kids and my
nieces and nephews and my son,

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.730
we're all planning on going and
getting my other sister's two

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:51.370
little girls.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:53.120
She's got twin 8-year-old
girls, and we're

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.869
going to go check them
out of school to go

00:19:54.869 --> 00:19:56.970
see "Star Wars" in December.

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:59.310
FEMALE SPEAKER: Who will
you be dressing as for that?

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:02.000
JIM BUTCHER: Oh, I've
got a Jedi robe at home.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.332
I'll wear that.

00:20:04.332 --> 00:20:06.290
FEMALE SPEAKER: What are
you reading right now?

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:07.248
JIM BUTCHER: Right now?

00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:10.290
I just got finished reading
"Tribal Bigfoot," by David

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:16.740
Paulides, for my nonfiction,
which is a book that compiles

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.880
Bigfoot sightings and
encounters in connection

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.990
with Native Americans.

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:24.220
And then I'm reading the
first Powdermage book,

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.239
by Brian McClellan right now.

00:20:26.239 --> 00:20:28.530
FEMALE SPEAKER: Does that
nonfiction book have anything

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:29.630
to do with Dresden?

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:30.830
I notice everyone asks.

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:31.690
JIM BUTCHER: No.

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.335
I've been fascinated
with Bigfoot

00:20:33.335 --> 00:20:34.710
since I was a
small child and had

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:35.730
recurring nightmares about him.

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:37.650
So I've dealt with them
by learning everything

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:38.890
I could about Bigfoot.

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:41.223
FEMALE SPEAKER: Just wondering
about the Native American

00:20:41.223 --> 00:20:43.050
spirituality thing.

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:47.210
What books might we be surprised
to find on your shelves?

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:47.960
JIM BUTCHER: Gosh.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.488
I guess I wouldn't be surprised
at anything, because they're

00:20:51.488 --> 00:20:51.988
mine.

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:56.830
There would be the old
spread of romance novels

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.120
that I read when I was
first getting started

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.220
learning writing theory.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.220
I went out and bought a
bunch of different books

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:06.179
by bestselling authors from
a number of different genres

00:21:06.179 --> 00:21:07.720
and read them and
tried to identify--

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.000
what are the common
factors in these books?

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.050
What are the things that
they all have in common?

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:15.100
So there's a bunch of romance
novels and standard mystery

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:15.870
novels.

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:17.639
One of my favourite
is Robert B. Parker,

00:21:17.639 --> 00:21:19.930
so there's a ton of Spenser
novels all over my shelves.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.540
A lot of Piers Anthony.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:26.170
Bad pun novels.

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:28.290
I've loved those.

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:29.840
I don't know who
you'd be surprised

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.800
by anything that was there.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.660
If it's science
fiction and there's

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.820
a good story or a
cool world or somebody

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.850
who writes really fast plots
or really good characters,

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:42.350
then I've got them
up there, and I

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:43.936
am studying them
and trying to steal

00:21:43.936 --> 00:21:45.060
everything I can from them.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:49.690
I mean trying to better
myself as a writer.

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:51.190
FEMALE SPEAKER: Do
you find yourself

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.845
able to enjoy science
fiction books?

00:21:53.845 --> 00:21:55.220
Or does it hit
too close to home?

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.560
Or is it always like a
research project for you?

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.590
Or if it's well
written and engaging,

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:01.840
are you just a regular reader?

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.890
JIM BUTCHER: It's very
hard to get into that space

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:08.780
where I can disengage my
professional brain from it

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:11.266
and go oh, OK-- where
I'm not breaking down

00:22:11.266 --> 00:22:12.890
oh, I can see why
this is so effective.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:15.720
It's because he did
this here and that here.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.100
When I do get a book
that I can turn it off

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.965
and I'm reading along and
going oh, that was awesome--

00:22:20.965 --> 00:22:22.590
then I'll be like
wait a minute; you're

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:23.470
too professional to do that.

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:23.970
Shut up!

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:27.560
You can talk to me
later, professional guy.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.310
Those are much rarer--
to find a good book

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:34.045
that I can really enjoy purely
for the sake of enjoying.

00:22:34.045 --> 00:22:35.920
There's only a few
writers who do that for me

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:36.714
on a regular basis.

00:22:36.714 --> 00:22:38.130
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Can you name them,

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:39.546
or is this a don't
let them know--

00:22:39.546 --> 00:22:40.910
don't inflate their egos.

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:43.076
JIM BUTCHER: Oh, no--
Sanderson doesn't have an ego,

00:22:43.076 --> 00:22:44.420
I don't think.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.070
He's, like, this
genuinely nice guy.

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.736
It's disgusting.

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.674
Really.

00:22:50.674 --> 00:22:52.840
There's a new Sanderson
book came out here recently,

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.952
and I got on the
plane in Chicago

00:22:54.952 --> 00:22:56.660
and flew out to San
Francisco and landed,

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.826
and he'd written another
book in that time-- I mean,

00:22:58.826 --> 00:23:01.810
there it was!

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:03.740
I swear-- he's a
clone or a robot

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.090
or has an army of clone robots.

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:05.631
I don't know.

00:23:05.631 --> 00:23:09.030
Something like that--
it's impressive.

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:12.230
FEMALE SPEAKER: What type of
readers were you as a child?

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:13.230
What was your favorite?

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:15.850
JIM BUTCHER: "Voracious"
and "indiscriminate"

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:19.590
would be the words I would
say would apply to that.

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:22.060
I started off with the
Chronicles of Narnia

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:26.470
and then Prydain
Chronicles, which are

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:28.130
books that are still excellent.

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:30.380
I still go back and reread
them every couple of years.

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:33.230
They're books by
Lloyd Alexander.

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:38.107
And then after that it was
everything I could find.

00:23:38.107 --> 00:23:40.190
One sister got me "The
Lord of the Rings" one year

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:42.260
when I was sick in
first grade, and I

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.630
read through "The
Lord of the Rings."

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:46.490
And the other sister
got me the Han Solo

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:48.920
trilogy by Brian Dailey,
that they put out,

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.774
and I read through that
one-- just devoured that.

00:23:52.774 --> 00:23:54.440
I read every science
fiction and fantasy

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.820
book they had in
the school library,

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.750
and then I went over to
the nonfiction section,

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:00.125
to mythology, and started
reading all the mythology stuff

00:24:00.125 --> 00:24:03.557
and everything they had about
UFOs and Bigfoot-- which

00:24:03.557 --> 00:24:04.765
in the '70s was considerable.

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:11.250
From there, it was everything.

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:13.602
I would read adventure
novels, mystery novels--

00:24:13.602 --> 00:24:15.060
everything I could
get my hands on.

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:20.230
You know where they
would have the posters,

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:22.170
and they'd put a little
star next your name

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:25.100
for every time you read a book?

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.680
My name had stars and then
an attached piece of paper

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.760
with more stars, and then
another piece of paper

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.190
attached to that
with more stars,

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:36.480
longer than the posterboard was.

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:39.080
In fourth grade, I had a
teacher who made it a policy

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:42.870
to take books away from me
whenever I was reading them

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:45.000
at inappropriate times in class.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.070
And then she had to bring
in and assemble a bookshelf

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:50.440
in her classroom, because
she kept taking books,

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.770
and I kept going to get more.

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:55.180
At the end of the
year, we had to have

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:56.884
a hand truck and
a bunch of crates

00:24:56.884 --> 00:24:58.550
to bring home all the
books that she had

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:00.362
confiscated from me that year.

00:25:00.362 --> 00:25:02.820
The teachers the next year were
going to do the same thing,

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.170
and they got to look
at that on the way out,

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:05.890
and they just said
you know what-- he

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:07.200
seems to be getting the lesson.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.250
Maybe we should
just let him read.

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:12.960
They just sat me at the back
so I could read quietly and not

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.304
disturb the other children.

00:25:15.304 --> 00:25:19.800
FEMALE SPEAKER: You were
educating in a different way.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.516
If you could go back
in time 15 years

00:25:21.516 --> 00:25:23.390
and tell yourself
anything, what would it be?

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:24.265
JIM BUTCHER: Oh, god.

00:25:24.265 --> 00:25:25.850
What kind of madman are you?

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:27.990
The Temporal Police will get us.

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:29.281
FEMALE SPEAKER: Sports Almanac.

00:25:32.572 --> 00:25:34.280
JIM BUTCHER: One, I
don't want to disturb

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.113
the time-space continuum,
because that seems

00:25:36.113 --> 00:25:37.570
like an unwise thing to do.

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:39.620
Two, it seems like
an unwise thing

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:41.730
to do because I
don't really have

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:44.150
any complaints about the
way the past 15 years

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:46.420
have gone-- at least not
as far as the writing

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:49.537
thing has proceeded.

00:25:49.537 --> 00:25:51.620
Sure, there are parts that
could have gone better,

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.970
but overall, looking
where I am now,

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:57.310
I'd be crazy to go back
and try to rock the boat.

00:25:57.310 --> 00:26:01.090
That seems like quite
a terrible idea to me.

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:03.659
I'm at a point in my career now
where I can write what I want

00:26:03.659 --> 00:26:05.450
and have a reasonably
good chance of having

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:08.300
somebody publish it for me.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.370
I've got to turn down work.

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:12.310
I've got a bunch of
problems with my career,

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:14.200
but they're really
awesome problems,

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.120
like my hand hurts from
signing too many books.

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.200
That is great.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.177
It's also terrible, because
my freaking arm hurts.

00:26:22.177 --> 00:26:24.510
But at the same time, if
you're going to have a problem,

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:27.170
that is a pretty cool problem.

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.367
I kind of dig that.

00:26:29.367 --> 00:26:30.950
Yeah, I don't want
to change anything.

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:33.040
I'm pleased with how it's gone.

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.849
FEMALE SPEAKER:
That's wonderful.

00:26:34.849 --> 00:26:37.390
Are there any genres you'd like
to dive into that you haven't

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:38.460
explored yet?

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:40.680
JIM BUTCHER: I still want
to do science fiction.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.140
The answer is yes-- all of them.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.500
I still want to do science
fiction I haven't gotten to.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.830
I'm going to write an epic,
epic, epic fantasy epic one

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:51.010
day, and it will be epic.

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:54.879
Be a big old honking doorstop--
elves, dwarves, and hobbits.

00:26:54.879 --> 00:26:56.920
They won't look like elves,
dwarves, and hobbits,

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.210
because I'll have painted
them and filed off

00:26:58.210 --> 00:26:58.870
the serial numbers.

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:00.578
But it'll be elves,
dwarves, and hobbits.

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:04.390
But yeah.

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:07.660
I want to do my big old doorstop
fantasy one of these days.

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.770
The Dresden Files started
off as this side thing

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:13.270
that I was doing as a project
to prove to my writing teacher

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:16.180
how wrong she was.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.030
But I wanted to write
swords and horses.

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:19.270
Fantasy's what I wanted.

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:20.820
FEMALE SPEAKER: Have you spoken
to that writing teacher since?

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:21.945
JIM BUTCHER: Yes, actually.

00:27:21.945 --> 00:27:24.010
Many times.

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:27.894
Actually, she wrote
me a couple years ago

00:27:27.894 --> 00:27:29.310
and said, "Hey,
do you think I can

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:32.906
pay you to write a foreword
to my story craft book

00:27:32.906 --> 00:27:34.780
that I'm going to be
sending out to publish?"

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.920
And I was like no, you can't
pay me to write that foreword.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.670
So I wrote up wrote
up a foreword for her,

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:42.350
because she wound up
teaching me a whole lot,

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:46.290
and I knew a whole lot
less than I thought I did.

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:49.020
She was a wonderful teacher.

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.660
FEMALE SPEAKER: You have
some pretty engaged fans.

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:56.150
What's one of your most
interesting fan interactions?

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:59.030
JIM BUTCHER: Interesting
fan interactions.

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:01.269
FEMALE SPEAKER: Unique
fan interactions?

00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:02.935
JIM BUTCHER: Well, I
got engaged to one.

00:28:04.892 --> 00:28:06.600
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
that was a unique one.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.308
JIM BUTCHER: Yeah, it
was kind of unique.

00:28:08.308 --> 00:28:10.930
I met her in an autograph
line a couple years ago

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:13.590
and worked up the courage
to speak to her on Facebook

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:17.070
about six months later, because
she's pretty and a girl,

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:20.230
and I can't just go talk to her.

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.730
Yeah.

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:23.330
It doesn't change.

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:25.210
You can take the nerd
out of the school,

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:27.700
but it doesn't come out.

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:28.660
It doesn't wash clear.

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:34.260
I've had fans who showed up at
my house to get an autograph,

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:36.499
who road tripped to my
house from Norman, Oklahoma,

00:28:36.499 --> 00:28:38.540
in Independence, Missouri,
and knocked on my door

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:39.790
and asked for an autograph.

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:41.415
That was a little
disturbing, actually.

00:28:41.415 --> 00:28:43.810
FEMALE SPEAKER: We're
not encouraging that.

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:46.340
JIM BUTCHER: The ironic
thing was I wasn't at home.

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:50.120
I was out of town
in Norman, Oklahoma,

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.224
attending a friend's wedding.

00:28:52.224 --> 00:28:54.140
And so they'd driven all
that way for nothing.

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:57.280
I felt kind of bad for them.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.110
There's been all
kinds of things.

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:01.810
If you're worried about
talking to me or seeming weird

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:03.530
or something like
that, the bar you

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:08.300
have to clear to not be
all that weird is very low.

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:09.490
So don't worry about it.

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:11.244
It's cool.

00:29:11.244 --> 00:29:13.160
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is
unrelated to anything,

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:16.130
but I said I said I'd ask you--
what's your favorite cosplay?

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:17.505
JIM BUTCHER: My
favorite cosplay?

00:29:17.505 --> 00:29:19.300
The favorite one I've
done lately is me

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.490
and Katie have done
Gomez and Morticia.

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:23.260
And that's been a
whole lot of fun,

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:25.180
because you're cosplaying Gomez.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.230
The way you sell that
is with the crazy eyes.

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:29.850
You have to have the
smile and the crazy eyes,

00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:34.040
like maybe about to come
knife you-- hahahahaha!

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:36.220
And then it works out.

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:40.750
And at Dragoncon-- this was
well before the steampunk book

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:44.060
came out-- a bunch of my friends
wanted to cosplay the steampunk

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:44.580
characters.

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:47.250
I'm like you bunch of hipsters.

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:50.260
One did, "I'm dressed as
a character from a book.

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:51.617
You probably haven't read it."

00:29:51.617 --> 00:29:52.200
Of course not!

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.741
Because it hasn't
been published yet.

00:29:53.741 --> 00:29:54.489
Aw, you guys.

00:29:54.489 --> 00:29:55.988
You're horrible
with your privilege.

00:29:57.765 --> 00:30:00.140
FEMALE SPEAKER: We'll take
audience questions in a moment

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.280
if anyone wants to line up.

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.530
He said you can ask
questions, guys.

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:07.321
What's one technology or power
from this book, "The Aeronaut's

00:30:07.321 --> 00:30:08.695
Windlass," that
you wish you had?

00:30:12.427 --> 00:30:15.010
JIM BUTCHER: They have guns, but
guns are really risky to use,

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:17.360
so they use gauntlets--
which are basically

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:21.750
Tony Stark Iron Man gauntlets,
only way steampunkier.

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:23.660
There's a crystal up
against your palm,

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:28.052
and it's connected by wires
to a cage of copper wire

00:30:28.052 --> 00:30:29.760
that goes around your
forearm, and you've

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.176
got to wear leather
underneath it,

00:30:31.176 --> 00:30:34.480
because the wire heats up
after you use it for a while.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.980
You get a blast away
like this at people,

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:38.680
and that would be awesome.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.300
Not like I want
to murder people.

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:43.715
I just want to be able to have
that option available to me.

00:30:43.715 --> 00:30:44.840
That would be totally cool.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.686
FEMALE SPEAKER: There's other
uses-- demolition, you know.

00:30:47.686 --> 00:30:49.060
And then my last
question for you

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:50.980
is if you could live in
one of the worlds in any

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:52.620
of your series that you've
written so far, which would it

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:53.260
be?

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:54.530
JIM BUTCHER: If I could
live in one of the worlds--

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:56.170
I wouldn't want to live
in any of those places!

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:56.845
Oh my gosh!

00:30:56.845 --> 00:30:59.178
FEMALE SPEAKER: If you had
to live in one of the worlds?

00:30:59.178 --> 00:31:01.410
JIM BUTCHER: OK, if
I had to live in one.

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:04.060
Dresden Files Chicago, I guess.

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.400
I would go there.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.660
I would go there, and I
would buy some apartment

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:13.140
to live in that Harry never
goes near, hardly ever sees.

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:16.013
And I would stay real
low the entire time.

00:31:18.924 --> 00:31:19.465
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:19.465 --> 00:31:20.692
JIM BUTCHER: Hi!

00:31:20.692 --> 00:31:22.650
AUDIENCE: You've talked
about the Dresden Files

00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:24.010
and getting started with that.

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:26.410
I think I've read what you
just said about how it started

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:29.030
as a prove-your-point-type
piece.

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:32.510
I've read through them all and
recommended them to friends,

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:34.240
and they say, "OK,
but the first two,

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:38.020
they seem a little like you're
not knowing where you're going,

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:41.020
and "Summer Knight"
happens, about book 3 or 4,

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.040
and it seems to gel,
and all of a sudden

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.290
there's this major arc.

00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:45.940
Is that a correct assessment?

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:47.550
Or is that incorrect?

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:49.380
At what point did
you have that big arc

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:50.919
that you're building now?

00:31:50.919 --> 00:31:52.960
And I hope I'm not offending
you by that comment.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:56.080
JIM BUTCHER: No, not at all.

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.942
When I first wrote the
first Dresden Files book,

00:31:59.942 --> 00:32:01.650
I turned in the first
couple of chapters,

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:04.024
and my teacher looked at it
and looked up at me and said,

00:32:04.024 --> 00:32:04.739
"You did it."

00:32:04.739 --> 00:32:05.530
And I said, "What?"

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:07.130
She says, "You did it.

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:08.690
This is of professional quality.

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:10.220
I don't know if this will
be the first thing you sell,

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:11.930
but you'll be able
to sell this."

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:13.097
And I was just like-- uhhhh.

00:32:13.097 --> 00:32:15.055
And she said, "You're
going to need to plan out

00:32:15.055 --> 00:32:16.130
the rest of it, OK?"

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:20.343
And she was talking about
the rest of the novel.

00:32:20.343 --> 00:32:22.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:26.100
But I came running back into
conference the next week

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:28.540
and was like OK, here--
I've got this planned out.

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:29.290
I've got this whole
thing planned out.

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:31.090
It's going to be about 20
books, maybe 21-- I'm not sure

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:32.070
if I get them all
in in that time--

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:33.490
and then there's going to be
a big old three-book trilogy

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:35.020
at the end that kind of
capstones the entire thing.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.200
What do you think?

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.010
And she just kind of
looks at me the way

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:40.790
the Road Runner looks
at Wile E Coyote

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:44.047
as he's charging off a cliff.

00:32:44.047 --> 00:32:46.380
I can still see the expression
on her face in my memory,

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.800
because I can tell that
she had finally got me

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:52.050
on board with what she
was trying to teach me,

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:55.220
so she didn't want to
quash my enthusiasm.

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:57.532
But at the same time,
there was no way

00:32:57.532 --> 00:32:59.740
I was going to sell a 20-book
series to any publisher

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:01.270
anywhere.

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:04.990
So she had to give me an
answer that would not dissuade

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:07.050
me and not crush my enthusiasm.

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:09.270
And so she just looks
at me and says, "Well, I

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:11.790
think if you sell
a 20-book series,

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:14.100
yeah-- you should
be doing fine."

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:16.510
You know-- like that.

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:19.290
So I had an idea
what I wanted to do,

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:21.970
but I wasn't very good at
putting the story together

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:24.560
and dropping things
out ahead of time.

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:27.690
As I have continued
writing, I've

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:29.640
learned to trust the
readers a whole lot more.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:30.709
Readers are smart.

00:33:30.709 --> 00:33:32.750
And so when I first started
setting up the story,

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.610
I was only dropping one
or two little things

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:37.320
in that were going to
come into in the long haul

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:41.090
and otherwise trying to focus on
Harry's immediate surroundings,

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:42.977
basically.

00:33:42.977 --> 00:33:44.310
Then I realized-- wait a minute.

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:46.310
Readers are much better
at putting this together

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:47.920
than I ever thought they were.

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:50.130
So I started incorporating
more and more

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:52.990
and being able to bring in more
subplots and more characters--

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:57.100
more plans for the future,
more payoff from the past.

00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:00.900
Because I'm writing
for people like me.

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:02.180
I'm writing for nerds.

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:02.870
Nerds are smart.

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:04.419
They can work this stuff out.

00:34:04.419 --> 00:34:05.960
So I sat down and
started doing that.

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.120
And as I learned to
trust the audience more,

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.646
I think the books got better,
because the audience was

00:34:10.646 --> 00:34:12.770
able to grab them grab onto
them and enjoy it more.

00:34:16.297 --> 00:34:16.838
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:16.838 --> 00:34:18.670
JIM BUTCHER: Hi!

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:21.187
AUDIENCE: Love the
Dresden Files, the arc,

00:34:21.187 --> 00:34:23.020
the little bits that
you drop here and there

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:25.750
and the payoffs later on
and those sorts of things.

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:29.315
I normally wouldn't ask this,
but it's driving me nuts.

00:34:29.315 --> 00:34:30.690
Every time a new
one comes out, I

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:32.981
find myself rereading the
whole Dresden Files up to it.

00:34:32.981 --> 00:34:35.880
I take notes in
the side and all.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.420
In "Proven Guilty," when
Harry is driving back,

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:41.469
he gets hit by a drive-by,
and there's some hints,

00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:43.710
and that never gets
resolved in that book,

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:45.290
and I haven't seen
a resolution soon.

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:46.550
Is that at all going
to be resolved?

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.840
JIM BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:47.339
Yeah, yeah.

00:34:47.339 --> 00:34:48.031
Weird, right?

00:34:48.031 --> 00:34:48.530
Cool.

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:51.250
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:55.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:56.719
JIM BUTCHER: Like I
said, the audience

00:34:56.719 --> 00:35:00.370
can pick these things up.

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:02.490
There's a lot of little
stuff like that that's

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:06.210
been seeded through, actually,
and that will get answered

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:07.800
eventually and hasn't been yet.

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:08.510
And that's cool.

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:09.509
It'll be more fun later.

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:15.230
AUDIENCE: What roleplaying
system are you using?

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:19.520
How do your roleplaying
games differ

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.380
from how your plots
ensue in a novel?

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:25.688
And can I buy the Evil
Hat version of "Windlass"?

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:31.400
JIM BUTCHER: We don't have
a deal with Evil Hat yet.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.774
I think they're trying to do
the Dresden collectible card

00:35:33.774 --> 00:35:36.280
game first.

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.430
So there's that question.

00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:39.820
I'm answering in
reverse order here.

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:44.540
How does my roleplaying
differ from my book writing?

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:45.780
Not significantly.

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:48.880
I tend to cliffhang
every play session, just

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.750
like I do chapters, to
where the players are going,

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:53.850
"We're going to stop there?"

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:56.490
I like doing that.

00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:58.529
I like to torture the
players and to bring up

00:35:58.529 --> 00:36:00.820
the things that are just the
absolute wrong worst thing

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:03.220
for them at the time.

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:06.042
They like it.

00:36:06.042 --> 00:36:09.780
As far as game systems, I
ran the Cinder Spire stuff

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.530
with Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay.

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:15.110
Right now, I'm
playing Pathfinder,

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:18.830
because I realized that my son
had reached 21 years of age

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:20.789
and had never played
Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:36:20.789 --> 00:36:22.580
Every other roleplaying
game under the sun,

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:25.390
but never D&amp;D. Except
I went out and got D&amp;D,

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:28.000
and D&amp;D was fourth edition,
so it wasn't D&amp;D any more,

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.364
so I went got Pathfinder.

00:36:29.364 --> 00:36:31.530
And then I went and got the
Keep on the Borderlands,

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:34.340
because that's where
you start playing D&amp;D.

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:36.520
Only I set it during
a zombie apocalypse,

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:40.049
so the keep on the borderlands
was the only human stronghold

00:36:40.049 --> 00:36:42.090
that was left, but in
order to be allowed inside,

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:44.215
they had to agree to be on
the expeditionary force.

00:36:44.215 --> 00:36:46.920
And the expeditionary force got
sent off to the Caves of Chaos

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:50.010
to see if they could make an
alliance with the greenskins

00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:51.220
against the zombies.

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:53.930
So the Caves of Chaos as
a diplomatic mission--

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:55.500
that was awesome.

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:58.609
We had so much fun playing that.

00:36:58.609 --> 00:36:59.650
Whatever system comes by.

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:01.710
I want to run something in fifth
edition now that it's come out.

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:03.090
That looks pretty cool.

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:04.080
You're very welcome.

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:04.620
FEMALE SPEAKER:
When you play D&amp;D,

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:06.610
do you DM, or do you
play as one of players?

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:08.560
JIM BUTCHER: I mostly DM.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.200
When I play, I get so
bored with my character

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:15.050
that I will either get heroic
or stupid about every two weeks

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:17.680
so I can get a new character.

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:20.150
And at some point,
my GMs have just

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:22.570
gone "Jim, just switch
to a different character,

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:25.370
and we'll just pretend that this
guy hopped out of a backpack.

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:25.870
OK?"

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:27.320
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's magic!

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.180
JIM BUTCHER: "That's
how it's going to be.

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:32.570
Because you're really
stretching far to get

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:41.480
killed at dinner in
the friendly convent."

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:44.540
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much
for coming and speaking.

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:48.300
One of Harry's caches, I guess,
in the beginning of the series

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:51.734
is because of his magic, he
can't be anywhere near tech.

00:37:51.734 --> 00:37:52.900
He has to take cold showers.

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:57.320
He basically lives this
aesthete life in a basement.

00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:00.950
As a writer, how does your
relationship with technology

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:02.250
change the way that you write?

00:38:05.512 --> 00:38:07.720
JIM BUTCHER: How does my
relationship with technology

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:10.150
change the way that I write?

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:12.900
The biggest influence
that it's had on it

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:16.800
is when I first started
writing the Dresden Files,

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:20.320
I was a college student with no
money, so research for Chicago

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.860
was basically me buying a
couple of Chicago guidebooks

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.680
and learning what I could
about Chicago from that.

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:28.330
I didn't know anybody
who lived there.

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:30.954
I didn't have enough
money to go there.

00:38:30.954 --> 00:38:32.620
So my research had
to come from whatever

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:33.986
I could find in a book.

00:38:33.986 --> 00:38:35.860
Fast-forward a couple
years, and the Internet

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:37.710
is up and running
on a regular basis

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:39.780
that everybody can
get to, and people

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:41.480
are able to take
digital pictures

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:48.190
on their digital camera and then
upload them to the Internet.

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:49.320
That was new.

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:51.394
And so I would be
able to say to people

00:38:51.394 --> 00:38:53.060
who had read a couple
of my books, "Hey,

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:55.070
I need to know what the east
wall of Graceland Cemetery

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:55.760
looks like."

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.000
And I would send that
out to this list of folks

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.410
who lived in Chicago,
and I would get a reply--

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:01.180
"I drive by there on the
way to work every morning.

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:02.638
I'll take a picture
of it for you."

00:39:02.638 --> 00:39:05.835
And lo and behold-- by noon
I'd know what it looked like,

00:39:05.835 --> 00:39:06.710
and I could write it.

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:07.860
That was amazing.

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:12.840
And then later came you
guys-- came Google and Google

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:15.260
Maps and Google Street View.

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:18.130
So then I would go Google
Street View everything.

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:21.100
I would use it and
set up my scenes

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:24.650
by standing on the street
and looking around and being

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:27.520
able to visually see everything
in the relationship of where

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.770
all the objects were to
one another-- to the point

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:33.830
that a couple years ago, I had
a Chicago SWAT captain come up

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:36.490
to me and say, "You know
that scene you set up

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:38.070
where you had the
shooter on the roof

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:41.100
and he took out a
number of street lights

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:46.190
so there was only one approach,
so that he could control

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:47.220
this hostage situation?"

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:47.803
I'm like yeah.

00:39:47.803 --> 00:39:49.870
He's like, "I
really need to know

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:51.720
who you talked to
get that information,

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.590
because we like to
keep track of people

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:56.206
who know that kind of thing."

00:39:56.206 --> 00:39:57.580
And I had to look
at him and say,

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:03.170
"I just used what I knew from
Call of Duty and Google Street

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:04.220
View."

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:08.290
And he just looks at me.

00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:11.582
I swear he aged five years,
just right during the time

00:40:11.582 --> 00:40:12.290
of that sentence.

00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:14.373
Then he shakes his head
and he's like, "Oh, man, I

00:40:14.373 --> 00:40:17.462
hate the Internet."

00:40:17.462 --> 00:40:19.670
But then there's all the
marketing aspects and so on,

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.960
too.

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.079
Because I can communicate
with my fans and readers

00:40:22.079 --> 00:40:22.620
all the time.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:24.340
I can get feedback
directly from them.

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:28.150
All my beta reading
is on an email list

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:29.860
that I sign people up for.

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.480
I couldn't do it
without the Internet.

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:35.520
And when I don't have the
Internet, I get twitchy.

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:39.130
That happens,
occasionally, and I scream.

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:39.680
I run around.

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.054
I don't know what
to do any more.

00:40:41.054 --> 00:40:42.192
I need my Internet.

00:40:42.192 --> 00:40:42.900
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:44.710
JIM BUTCHER: You're
very welcome.

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:46.580
Hello!

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:49.050
AUDIENCE: Generally, when
authors have their books turned

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:51.580
into TV or movies, they're
given complete control

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:55.200
over how to cash the
check, and that's it.

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:58.530
I thought the Dresden
TV was done fairly well,

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:00.084
given your restrictions.

00:41:00.084 --> 00:41:01.250
What did you think about it?

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:02.416
What would you have changed?

00:41:02.416 --> 00:41:05.081
What might you do
differently if you could?

00:41:05.081 --> 00:41:07.580
JIM BUTCHER: I've always been
a glass-half-full kind of guy,

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:13.440
so I like to think that the
TV series died before it could

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:15.210
mess anything up too horribly.

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:16.357
And so that's good.

00:41:16.357 --> 00:41:17.940
And it also introduced
a lot of people

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:19.650
to the books, which
is also very good.

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:26.049
Now, I think, if I
wanted to do it again--

00:41:26.049 --> 00:41:28.090
and it's a possibility
that it will happen again,

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:32.000
because the rights are
out with a major company--

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.420
if it does happen
again, this time,

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:37.540
I've attached myself to
the property in terms

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:39.660
of I want to be a consultant.

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:41.740
Not so that I can make it
exactly like my books--

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:43.110
because I know it has
to change a bit when

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:45.180
it goes to a different
medium-- but so that we

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:49.616
can keep the same spirit of
awesome, the flavor of awesome

00:41:49.616 --> 00:41:50.990
that I like, in
the Dresden Files

00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:53.150
and to continue
using it elsewhere.

00:41:56.320 --> 00:42:00.850
All in all, I had no contractual
authority on my stuff, at all,

00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:01.720
when it went there.

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:05.450
But I had friends on
the Internet and readers

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:06.900
on the Internet
who worked out who

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:08.830
was going to be in
charge of the project

00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:11.414
by putting together rumors and
then talked to me and said,

00:42:11.414 --> 00:42:13.580
"We think it's going to be
this guy-- Robert Wolfe."

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:14.746
And I'm like, "Robert Wolfe?

00:42:14.746 --> 00:42:17.810
I loved the first couple seasons
of 'Andromeda.'" And so I

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:21.010
contacted Robert Wolfe and said
I suspect because of this fact

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:22.490
and this fact that you're the
one who's going to be in charge

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:22.700
of this.

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:23.640
He's like, "That's amazing!

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:25.098
You're like a
real-life detective!"

00:42:25.098 --> 00:42:28.192
And I'm like yes, I am.

00:42:28.192 --> 00:42:30.080
AUDIENCE: With magical powers!

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.680
JIM BUTCHER: It turns
out that he's a D&amp;D nerd,

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:35.090
and we're both
Roman Empire buffs,

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:37.730
so we sat down and
talked about it.

00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:40.030
And we got along really well.

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:41.792
So I actually had a
lot more influence

00:42:41.792 --> 00:42:43.250
than you would
think over the show,

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:45.910
because I got on so
well with Robert.

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:47.390
I was very fortunate in that.

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:50.710
But that was purely an
interpersonal thing.

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:51.790
But he did a great job.

00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:52.340
I think you're right.

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.298
I think he did a great
job with the limitations

00:42:54.298 --> 00:42:55.094
they were handed.

00:42:55.094 --> 00:42:55.760
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:56.260
Thanks.

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:58.630
JIM BUTCHER: Thank you.

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:00.200
AUDIENCE: Sorry to
come back again.

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:04.040
This is about Codex Alera.

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.940
Those were a great
escape hatch for me

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:07.550
one year, when it
was a bad year.

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:09.290
JIM BUTCHER: Good.

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:12.470
AUDIENCE: In those books, there
are two things that I noticed.

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:14.260
The fight scenes
were incredible.

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:18.870
I burned the edges of the pages
as I flipped them too quickly.

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:21.200
I don't know if that
was part of what

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.300
you wanted to do in
those books, to explore

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:25.940
how to write a battle scene
in an engaging and really

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:27.170
compelling way-- one.

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:30.010
And, two, in Harry
Dresden and Codex Alera,

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:33.700
you build these worlds and then,
to some extent-- no spoilers--

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:34.610
you destroy them.

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:36.460
And what's that
like for a writer?

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:36.780
JIM BUTCHER: I'm sorry.

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:37.270
What was that?

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:38.360
AUDIENCE: What's
that like for you?

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:39.052
Is that funny?

00:43:41.314 --> 00:43:42.730
JIM BUTCHER: It's
like the guy who

00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:45.440
spends six months
building a model of Tokyo

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:48.520
and then finally gets to
strap on a Godzilla suit.

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.469
That's what it's like.

00:43:50.469 --> 00:43:52.760
You spend all this time
working and getting it perfect,

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:57.470
and then you get to look at it
and go, "And now-- mwahahahaha!

00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:59.840
I'm going to wipe out
everything in Dresden's life.

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:01.535
I'm going to blow up his office.

00:44:01.535 --> 00:44:02.804
Kadoom!

00:44:02.804 --> 00:44:03.970
Going to burn down his home!

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:04.690
Pew!

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:05.715
Smash his car!

00:44:05.715 --> 00:44:07.920
Kkkh!"

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:10.564
It is so much fun to do that.

00:44:10.564 --> 00:44:11.980
AUDIENCE: I get
that sense that it

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:13.910
would be fun to knock
over the sandcastle.

00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:15.170
JIM BUTCHER: It is!

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:16.422
Oh, my god, it's awesome!

00:44:16.422 --> 00:44:17.630
AUDIENCE: I'm attached to it.

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:19.745
I enjoy the destroy,
but I'm attached to it

00:44:19.745 --> 00:44:21.420
and now things are changing,
which is kind of the fun part.

00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:23.370
JIM BUTCHER: We can build
new stuff, you know?

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:24.828
The great part
about being a writer

00:44:24.828 --> 00:44:27.990
is that it doesn't cost me any
more to destroy Chicago that it

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:30.397
does to not destroy Chicago.

00:44:30.397 --> 00:44:32.730
I've got no budget that I
have to worry about with that.

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:33.835
I just get words.

00:44:33.835 --> 00:44:36.460
I've got the ultimate freedom of
how I get to present the story

00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:39.461
or what I want to do.

00:44:39.461 --> 00:44:39.960
Yeah.

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.560
It is tremendous fun, after you
spent all this time building

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.830
things up, to go now I'm going
to turn everything on its side.

00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:47.730
It's like aha!

00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:49.780
I sometimes feel like one
of those painters that

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:51.850
paints the giant
incomprehensible thing

00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:53.940
and then goes aha and
turns it upside-down,

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:56.260
and it's a portrait of
one of the judges in the

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:59.394
"Who's Got Talent" contest.

00:44:59.394 --> 00:45:00.560
Whose brain works like that?

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:00.920
I don't know.

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:01.545
That's amazing.

00:45:01.545 --> 00:45:03.910
But I sometimes get
to feel like that,

00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:05.930
where I get to
say now I've built

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:08.880
all your expectations in this
one direction-- surprise.

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:12.357
That's a ton of
fun-- totally worth

00:45:12.357 --> 00:45:13.440
the effort it takes to do.

00:45:15.939 --> 00:45:16.480
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:17.188
JIM BUTCHER: Hey.

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.040
AUDIENCE: Back to the
roleplaying thing,

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.800
as readers we love to see
our characters level up.

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:32.840
But I've seen many authors
that level up too much.

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:38.510
The campaign goes Monty Haul,
and it ceases to become fun,

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:41.090
almost.

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:43.670
In your books,
thankfully, you don't seem

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:44.960
to have an issue with that.

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:49.480
Is it hard not to write yourself
in a corner that way, though?

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.400
JIM BUTCHER: No.

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:54.631
Because I know what the end is.

00:45:54.631 --> 00:45:56.630
The reason that some of
the series go Monty Haul

00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:58.510
and go too long
and people just get

00:45:58.510 --> 00:46:01.852
too powerful-- they get
handed the dagger of Cain,

00:46:01.852 --> 00:46:04.060
or whatever, and it keeps
going and going and going--

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:07.280
is that the story was
supposed to end before that,

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:09.390
and they did they
didn't end the story.

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:11.954
Stories aren't stories unless
they have an ending to them.

00:46:11.954 --> 00:46:13.620
I'm one of the people
who believes that.

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:17.460
I don't believe in a
never-ending story.

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:21.380
For me, it's easy to keep
to keep Harry in check

00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:24.520
in terms of where he's getting
as he's getting more buff

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:27.130
and getting more
contacts and so on,

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:30.649
because I know what he's going
to be fighting in the next book

00:46:30.649 --> 00:46:32.440
and what's going to be
coming down the line

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.800
and where he's going to wind up.

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.460
Because I know all that
stuff, I can gauge-- OK, he

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:38.600
needs to be about this far.

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.016
Now he needs to
be about this far.

00:46:40.016 --> 00:46:42.000
No he needs to be
about this far.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.980
So that he is never the
super-overpowered guy

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:46.950
who just smashes
everything all around him.

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:50.190
He still remains the guy who is
not the big fish in the pond.

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:51.740
He's the medium-sized
fish who needs

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:57.860
to be smart and fast if he
wants to stay alive another day.

00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:00.290
Really, it's all about
pacing and knowing

00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:01.606
where you're going to wind up.

00:47:01.606 --> 00:47:02.980
I know where I'm
going to wind up

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:05.800
and what he's going to be
doing when we get there,

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:08.067
so it's easy to
keep him on track.

00:47:08.067 --> 00:47:09.400
AUDIENCE: Looking forward to it.

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:09.900
Thanks.

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:12.180
JIM BUTCHER: Thank you.

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:13.210
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:13.210 --> 00:47:14.702
You do action
really, really well.

00:47:14.702 --> 00:47:15.660
JIM BUTCHER: Thank you.

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:16.060
AUDIENCE: I've always
wanted to know--

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:17.850
have you studied martial arts?

00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:20.810
Do you have any black belts?

00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:22.922
How did you do the
research for that?

00:47:22.922 --> 00:47:25.880
Some of those moves
and some of what

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:29.024
happens in combat you only
know if you've sparred before.

00:47:29.024 --> 00:47:31.190
JIM BUTCHER: I've got about
20 years of martial arts

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:32.580
experience.

00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:34.290
I've studied a bunch
of different arts.

00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:36.120
I don't have black
belts in anything,

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:38.980
because I don't think
they're very important.

00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:41.430
But I like to go to new
schools, and when I come in,

00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:42.420
they're like well, do
you have any experience?

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:44.560
And I'm like teach me like
I don't know anything,

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:48.176
because I want to learn
what you have to teach me.

00:47:48.176 --> 00:47:50.550
Usually it doesn't take folks
very long to figure out oh,

00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:51.590
you've done some of this before.

00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:53.290
It's like well,
yeah, a little, but I

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:54.540
want to learn what you've got.

00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:59.887
I started off in shorin
ryu at the local Y.

00:47:59.887 --> 00:48:01.470
And then I was very
fortunate to study

00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:02.940
ryukyu kempo for a long time.

00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:05.350
I actually got to spend
about three months

00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:08.500
in 90-minute one-on-one
lessons every day,

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:12.090
because I was the only one who
ever came to the noon lesson.

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:16.680
So I got noon lessons
with Mr. Shintaku, who

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:20.010
was a 6-dan in
ryukyu kempo and was

00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:23.910
a Japanese collegiate
aikido champion

00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:26.420
and was a really good
teacher-- who would hurt you

00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:29.440
if you did it wrong.

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.690
When you're in that one-on-one
circumstance like that,

00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:32.760
you learn very rapidly.

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:35.020
You learn a lot very fast.

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:37.180
He was the reason I've
got one good martial arts

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:40.480
story-- that's my own, I mean.

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:46.090
After that, in college, it was
goja shoryu, aikido, kung-fu,

00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:48.805
some jiu jitsu, some wing chun.

00:48:48.805 --> 00:48:51.180
I wasn't very good at aikido,
but it was a beautiful art.

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:53.725
I'm too impatient to
be good at aikido.

00:48:53.725 --> 00:48:55.170
Aikido is one of
those arts that's

00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:57.530
basically like how foolish
would you like to look?

00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:58.630
Come at me that hard.

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:05.670
I've done some kung-fu, some
taekwondo, some wing chun.

00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:09.150
Epee, foil, saber.

00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:10.570
I've got some weapon forms in.

00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:15.000
But I'm kind of a dilettante.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.370
I can handle myself reasonably
well against somebody

00:49:17.370 --> 00:49:18.932
who is not a professional.

00:49:18.932 --> 00:49:21.140
A professional would eat me
up, because professionals

00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:23.014
are completely different
than everybody else.

00:49:25.489 --> 00:49:26.530
But I have learned a lot.

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:28.140
And I've got to
talk to people a lot

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:32.260
and borrow stories from them.

00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:36.990
Just generally, I've had
a lot of fun doing it.

00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:39.280
What I realized at some
point-- I don't know,

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.100
maybe 10 years in--
I looked around

00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:43.220
and I realized wait
a minute, the ability

00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:45.980
to disassemble another human
being with your bare hands

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:48.970
is not really useful
on a day-to-day basis.

00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:50.500
It doesn't really
help you out when

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:53.107
you're in the grocery store.

00:49:53.107 --> 00:49:55.690
But other lessons from martial
arts, especially about balance,

00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:57.064
teach you a whole
lot that's very

00:49:57.064 --> 00:49:58.634
good for the rest of your life.

00:49:58.634 --> 00:49:59.565
AUDIENCE: That's true.

00:49:59.565 --> 00:50:00.065
Cool.

00:50:04.471 --> 00:50:06.220
AUDIENCE: Maybe this
is an unfair question

00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:09.200
but if you weren't a writer--
if it didn't take off the way

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:12.760
it did-- where do you think
your life would have gone?

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:17.140
My last real paying job, I
was working technical support

00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:19.100
at a local Internet provider.

00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:20.790
I was the guy who
came in at 10:00

00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:24.740
and was responsible for the
entire place until 6:00 AM.

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:27.560
And it was the largest
provider in Oklahoma.

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:31.120
It provided for
everybody at that time.

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:35.060
They even had more customers
than AOL did in Oklahoma.

00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:35.879
It was a great job.

00:50:35.879 --> 00:50:36.670
I had a great boss.

00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:38.860
It was my Fezziwig job.

00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:40.190
My boss was former military.

00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:43.020
He offered to fight a guy for
me once-- that's how good a boss

00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:43.780
he was.

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:46.970
I had a guy who was on the phone
when my boss came in at 6:00,

00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:50.910
and he had messed up his
computer by around 8:00

00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:52.640
the previous night,
and then he'd

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:55.100
to fix it until 4:00 in the
morning, when he finally called

00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:57.540
me-- at which point there
wasn't a whole lot I could do,

00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:00.570
because he had
mangled it so badly.

00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:03.457
He was screaming at me on the
phone when the boss walks in.

00:51:03.457 --> 00:51:05.040
My boss actually
offered to fight him.

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:05.930
He was ex-military.

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:08.090
He was about
six-two, about 245--

00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:10.810
played basketball with all
the college intern guys.

00:51:10.810 --> 00:51:12.720
Had this buzz cut,
blue eyes-- looked

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:15.545
like the reincarnation of Thor.

00:51:15.545 --> 00:51:17.170
He was like yeah,
I'll be happy to talk

00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:19.702
to you about my employee.

00:51:19.702 --> 00:51:21.160
If you're that
upset, come on down,

00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:22.909
and I'll be the one
that you'll deal with.

00:51:22.909 --> 00:51:25.650
I was like OK, man, when you
call me in on a Saturday,

00:51:25.650 --> 00:51:27.590
I'm coming in after this.

00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:31.110
They liked me because I had
just enough ability at code

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:34.131
that I could kludge something
together until morning

00:51:34.131 --> 00:51:36.130
so that I didn't have to
go get a programmer out

00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:36.985
of bed at 3:00.

00:51:39.314 --> 00:51:41.730
I would wait until 6:00, and
then when I was off my shift,

00:51:41.730 --> 00:51:43.660
I would give him a call,
because that was when, I knew,

00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:44.590
his alarm went off.

00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:45.810
He's like is there a problem?

00:51:45.810 --> 00:51:46.860
Yeah there's a problem.

00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:49.720
There's a patch program
that's kind of running,

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:51.220
and it's sort of
making things work,

00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:53.366
but maybe you should get
in as quick as you can.

00:51:53.366 --> 00:51:55.240
He's like OK, thank you
for not waking me up.

00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:56.540
And I loved that
job, because I liked

00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:57.789
helping people over the phone.

00:51:57.789 --> 00:52:00.410
I liked getting them back
onto their video games.

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:02.870
I liked solving problems.

00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:03.835
That was fun.

00:52:03.835 --> 00:52:05.710
Plus, there was a lot
of "EverQuest" going on

00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:08.166
at that job.

00:52:08.166 --> 00:52:10.540
Come to think of it, I actually
wrote the first two books

00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:12.780
of the Dresden Files and
the first Codex Alera book

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:15.529
on that job.

00:52:15.529 --> 00:52:16.070
There you go.

00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:18.110
I would probably be doing
something in that area

00:52:18.110 --> 00:52:21.630
still, because I love my tech.

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:23.850
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Last two questions.

00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:26.160
AUDIENCE: Silly
Dresden Files question.

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:31.150
Remember from "Cold Days"
the shenanigans regarding

00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:32.355
the origin of the keep?

00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:40.220
Can we expect more time
shenanigans in future books?

00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:41.890
JIM BUTCHER: More
time shenanigans?

00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:42.390
Sir?

00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:46.220
One of the laws of magic states
that you cannot mess with time

00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:46.950
like that!

00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:50.870
Of course there will be
more time shenanigans!

00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:53.190
I only established the
seven laws of magic

00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:55.180
so that I could have
Dresden methodically break

00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:56.171
them one by one!

00:52:58.710 --> 00:53:01.710
AUDIENCE: All right, speaking of
silly questions-- after the way

00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:04.770
you dealt with Cat Sith
in the Dresden books

00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:08.030
and having a whole
race of talking cats,

00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:09.130
I'm kind of scared.

00:53:09.130 --> 00:53:09.810
Should I be?

00:53:12.202 --> 00:53:13.410
JIM BUTCHER: It's not so bad.

00:53:13.410 --> 00:53:19.910
They're like fuzzy, really,
really, really egotistical

00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:21.290
little libertarians.

00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:23.840
They're rolling all
over everywhere.

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.340
They're completely independent.

00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:27.380
They don't want to pitch
in to anybody's help.

00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:28.320
They're arrogant.

00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:29.690
They're egotistical.

00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:30.710
They're close-minded.

00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:32.090
They're adorable.

00:53:32.090 --> 00:53:33.150
They get away with it.

00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:35.990
And they're almost as good
as they think they are,

00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:40.220
which makes them very
useful to the team.

00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:43.270
At the same time, the
cats in these stories,

00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:45.754
they have created
weapons for themselves.

00:53:45.754 --> 00:53:47.170
They wear fighting
spurs that they

00:53:47.170 --> 00:53:49.970
strap onto their rear legs.

00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:53.380
They are not to
be taken lightly.

00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:59.430
They're not quite Cat
Sith, but they're close.

00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:00.370
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:01.120
JIM BUTCHER: You're
very welcome.

00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:02.760
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you so
much for joining us today.

00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:03.280
JIM BUTCHER: Thanks, guys.

00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:05.488
FEMALE SPEAKER: And "Aeronaut's
Windlass" is out now.

00:54:05.488 --> 00:54:06.300
[APPLAUSE]
