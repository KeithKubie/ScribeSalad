problematic when they get jailed because

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869
problematic when they get jailed because
 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.590

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.210
that sends a really chilling message to
anyone else who would engage in

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220
anyone else who would engage in
 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.240
