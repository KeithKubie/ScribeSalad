00:00:02.772 --> 00:00:04.230
CHRIS: Hi everyone.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.780
My name is Chris.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.370
I'm a friend of science.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.861
And I usually start by saying,
welcome to the NASA, da da da

00:00:12.861 --> 00:00:13.360
da.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.720
But it's not NASA
this time, it's ESA.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.884
He's from Europe.

00:00:18.884 --> 00:00:20.550
MARK MCCAUGHREAN: No,
I'm from an island

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.440
just off the coast of Europe.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.945
CHRIS: He's from an island
off the coast of Europe.

00:00:25.945 --> 00:00:27.320
But he is with
the European Space

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.060
Agency, who notably landed on
a comet, just a little thing.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.530
We talk about moonshots here
at Google from time to time.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.280
And I always think
the same thing.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.890
I'm like, OK, so you
have a real thing

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.460
like this, where
you started it--

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.920
you launched it 10 years ago.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.360
And you were working on
for many years before that.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.160
And it's an
astonishing commitment

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.200
of time and resources,
energy, and science.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.256
And to have it all work
is incredibly satisfying.

00:00:58.256 --> 00:00:59.630
And I saw on your
bio that you're

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.550
working on the James Webb,
which, when I look at that

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.830
I think, how can
this possibly work?

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.420
MARK MCCAUGHREAN: We
think that every day.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.290
CHRIS: Because it's such
a complicated device,

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.040
and the things we
wanted to do in space

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.520
with its reconfigurability
and the thing that

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.097
goes over here and the
thing that goes over there--

00:01:20.097 --> 00:01:22.180
and I know I'm using lots
of scientific terms here

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.940
and I apologize for that.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.965
But is it any less possible
than what you did with Rosetta?

00:01:30.965 --> 00:01:32.340
Anyways, the long
and short of it

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.955
is, you're not going
to see me talk.

00:01:33.955 --> 00:01:35.340
You're here to see Mark talk.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.502
So Dr. McCaughrean, do you want
to come and take to the stage?

00:01:38.502 --> 00:01:39.960
MARK MCCAUGHREAN:
Thanks very much.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.670
Thank you.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.080
We probably don't need this one.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.470
So thank you, Chris, and thanks
everybody for being here today.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.480
I understand the audience
may be somewhat larger

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.480
in the [INAUDIBLE] in the
world beyond this room

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.652
as well, which is good to know.

00:01:56.652 --> 00:01:58.460
And it's a privilege,
actually, to be

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.600
able to come and stand here
after actually 30 years of work

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.020
by thousands of people
to get to this point.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.070
Last year was an absolute
blast, an amazing thing

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.490
to be involved with.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.829
And I specifically asked
if I could come here.

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:15.120
I'm in the neighborhood,
talking at NASA Ames tomorrow.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.640
And I thought I'd come here
because actually, Google played

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.544
a role, as you'll see later on.

00:02:19.544 --> 00:02:21.710
It plays such a role in all
of our lives, of course,

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.260
but it played a specific role
for us at the end of last year,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.587
which I'll come to later on.

00:02:26.587 --> 00:02:27.920
So what I'm going to talk about?

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.646
I'm going to talk about the
Rosetta mission in its journey

00:02:31.646 --> 00:02:34.020
to this amazing object, which
you see in the bottom here.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.275
You see much more of it called
67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

00:02:39.275 --> 00:02:41.400
Comets are named for the
people that discover them,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.420
so it's unfortunate that Bob
Smith didn't discover this one.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.560
It's just a long name, but
these two Ukrainian astronomers

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.280
discovered it in 1969.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.780
Of course, comets are objects
which are fascinating and have

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.910
been fascinating for millennia.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.970
Throughout humankind, people
have looked up in the sky

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.470
and seen these
strange visitors that

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.490
would come seemingly
out of nowhere,

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.860
blaze across the
sky for maybe days,

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.366
weeks, in some cases months.

00:03:07.366 --> 00:03:08.990
And nobody had any
idea what they were,

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.910
where they came from.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.590
They were always thought to be
these messengers from the gods,

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.430
perhaps.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.570
This idea that these
things came out of nowhere

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.420
unpredictably might be
portents of something bad that

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.370
was about to happen.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.000
We see them as
beautiful objects today.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.920
This is actually taken from
the platform of the Very Large

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.000
Telescope, which is an array
of four eight meter diameter

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.704
telescopes in Chile,
where my colleague here

00:03:34.704 --> 00:03:36.120
in the front row,
Hunt [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.900
and I have spent many years
using these telescopes to do

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.990
astronomy.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.545
This is astronomy
with the naked eye.

00:03:41.545 --> 00:03:43.170
You don't need an
eight meter telescope

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.700
to see this particular
comet, Comet McNaught.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.690
But as I said, it goes
back thousands of years.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.460
And this is actually from
1066 or just after 1066.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.120
This is the famous
Bayeaux Tapestry,

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.490
which was created by the Normans
to commemorate the invasion

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.564
of England in 1066.

00:04:01.564 --> 00:04:03.730
This is the usually the
point where I point out this

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.020
is the last time it happened.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.410
But other people have tried.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.820
And what you see at the top
here is a comet, emblazoned

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.290
across the Bayeaux Tapestry.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.329
And in Latin, it says "these
men wonder at the star."

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.120
People here are looking
up and they thought

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.620
this was a portent of doom.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.560
And of course, for
the English it was.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.590
For King Harold here, it
was a bit of a problem.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.964
For the Normans, it was portent
of good, you could argue.

00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:28.170
So, silver linings and all that.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.410
But what we now know
from subsequent analyses

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.140
of this particular object and
the fact that in the record

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.460
over 1,000 years,
this object appears

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.560
to have come back
every 76 years.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.580
So Edmund Halley--
and you'll guess

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.380
what the name of
this comet is now--

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.780
found that there
was an apparition

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.489
on a regular basis of a comet.

00:04:50.489 --> 00:04:52.280
And he said, well,
maybe it's the same one.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.955
And it was.

00:04:52.955 --> 00:04:54.010
It's Halley's Comet.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.080
It's what we know
as Halley's comet.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.820
And this was actually seen many,
many times throughout history.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.980
This is just one
of the occasions.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.250
The last time that it
came past was 1986.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.120
And of course 1986, we were
deep into the space age.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.382
And it was possible to actually
go there for the first time.

00:05:09.382 --> 00:05:11.090
And so the European
Space Agency launched

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.980
a mission called Giotto as
part of an international fleet

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.510
to go and encounter Halley.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.550
Now Halley lives out
deep in the solar system,

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.410
way out beyond
the giant planets.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.890
And it comes in every
76 years, accelerates

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.275
towards the inner solar
system, goes extremely fast

00:05:26.275 --> 00:05:28.440
through the middle,
and back out again.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.710
And so what we could do, what we
were capable of doing in 1986,

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.177
was effectively do what
anybody in this room--

00:05:34.177 --> 00:05:36.010
and I can say that with
absolute certainty--

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.801
anybody in this room
would have to do this.

00:05:37.801 --> 00:05:42.260
If you wanted to have a
conversation with Usain Bolt

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.009
when he was running
the 100 meters,

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:46.550
none of you in this room would
be able to run as fast as him,

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.869
right?

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:49.660
So the only way you
could do it is actually

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.020
stand out in front of
him as he sprinted past.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.940
And you'd have maybe a couple
of milliseconds of conversation.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:56.820
You could do that.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.819
You could just direct
yourself to be in his path

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:01.130
as long as you
avoid hitting him.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.650
And that's what we did
with Giotto in 1986.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.640
As Halley swung through
the inner solar system,

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.430
we were able to get Giotto
to fly by at 68 kilometers

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.355
a second.

00:06:10.355 --> 00:06:12.730
And we had just minutes
of that encounter,

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.380
the first time that a
comet was seen close up,

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.630
the comet nucleus.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:17.750
And unfortunately, it's
a bit light in the room

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.624
so you can't quite see
very well what's here.

00:06:19.624 --> 00:06:21.430
But this is the nucleus
of comet Halley,

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.989
about 15 kilometers across.

00:06:22.989 --> 00:06:25.280
And what you see, and what
was an interesting discovery

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.090
at that point is that comets
are actually very dark objects.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.870
We think of comets as being
composed of ice and dust

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.502
and therefore the phrase is
often used "dirty snowballs."

00:06:34.502 --> 00:06:36.460
And so you'd expect it
to be highly reflective.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.385
Turns out they're not.

00:06:37.385 --> 00:06:38.990
They're incredibly dark.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.960
And the surface
here is a mixture

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.380
of dust, which has been
lifted up from the comet

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.000
as the comet heats up when
it gets close to the sun.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.370
Some of that dust falls
back down onto the surface

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.980
and slowly, you get
snowdrifts, if you like,

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.690
of dust on the surface.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.690
And also, there's organic
material in comets.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.951
So there's actually complex
carbon-bearing molecules

00:06:57.951 --> 00:06:58.450
in comets.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.810
And that makes it dark as well.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.060
Now, we're had a series
of comet missions.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.680
NASA has been to several comets
and one of the most famous

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.140
encounters actually did
do what you shouldn't

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:13.240
do, which is it did stand right
in front of Usain Bolt in 2005,

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.690
the so-called Deep
Impact Mission.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.720
You can tell what's
coming next, where

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.520
it was two spacecraft together.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.190
And the front
spacecraft was actually

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:25.190
set on a direct collision course
with the comet Tempel, Tempel 1

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:25.690
here.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.600
And then the second spacecraft
took pictures of that

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.410
as the first one impacted.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.022
And that's the outcome.

00:07:32.022 --> 00:07:33.980
Turns out, that's actually
a very small crater.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.800
Another mission has
going back to Tempel 1

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.120
since and seen the crater
left in a brief flyby.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.520
It's a pretty small crater,
but a lot of material

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.340
was lifted up.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.080
But why would you
want to do this?

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.260
What's the point?

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.950
It's not just fireworks.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:48.816
It's cool, but
what's the reason?

00:07:48.816 --> 00:07:51.800
The reason is that
the surface of comets

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.390
is because of
these dust covering

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.050
and these carbon-bearing
molecules is not really

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:57.415
the primordial material anymore.

00:07:57.415 --> 00:07:58.290
It's being processed.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.810
Every time a comet's come
through the inner solar system,

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.200
it's being frazzled, fried.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.570
Think of it as a baked Alaska.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:05.680
The outer surface is not
representative of what's

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.220
on the inside.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.540
And by excavating
material from underneath

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.810
and analyzing that
brief flash of light

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:14.844
from the material as it's
thrown up, not only locally,

00:08:14.844 --> 00:08:16.260
but the Hubble
Space Telescope was

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:21.000
used to take data on this
comet during this impact.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.270
You can try to understand
what the comet's made

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.749
of on the inside.

00:08:24.749 --> 00:08:25.790
And why is that relevant?

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.820
Well, it's because comets
are leftover material

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.120
from the birth of our solar
system 4.6 billion years ago.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.320
We have this kind
of overview here

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.460
of the cycle of life
of stars and planets,

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:40.250
which starts with very
high mass stars generating

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.730
the heavy elements in their
course through nuclear fusion,

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.060
through supernovae returning on
winds, returning that material

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:47.550
to the interstellar medium.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:51.290
That kind of mills around in a
galaxy for millions or hundreds

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:52.910
of millions of years
but then slowly

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:56.710
gets reincorporated into dust
clouds, which can then collapse

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.730
down to form new stars.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.990
Those stars form
in swirling disks.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.080
And around those stars
you have protoplanets.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.530
They form as well.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:06.680
You get planets like us.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.020
But you still get lot
of leftover material--

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.125
the asteroids and the comets
and lots of small dust particles

00:09:12.125 --> 00:09:14.720
as well, leftover stuff.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.110
And that's important, because
some of that leftover stuff

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:22.154
may have played a key role
in us on this planet today.

00:09:22.154 --> 00:09:24.070
One of the models for
the way the Earth formed

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:27.510
is that it was extremely hot
when it was young, and so hot

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:29.864
on the surface it
couldn't retain any water.

00:09:29.864 --> 00:09:31.405
So one of the big
questions is, where

00:09:31.405 --> 00:09:33.487
does the water come
from that we drink

00:09:33.487 --> 00:09:35.820
and that we're made of, and
all the water on the planet?

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.120
If it wasn't on the surface
shortly after the birth

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.190
of the solar system,
was it delivered

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.330
from somewhere else later on?

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.750
And comets could be a very
important vector for that,

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:48.590
because they lock up ice and
dust in the outer solar system.

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.520
And those objects and then come
into the inner solar system

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.170
through perturbations and
impact on the planets.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.057
You need about
100 million comets

00:09:57.057 --> 00:09:58.640
to get the water we
have on the Earth.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.380
That sounds like
a lot of impacts.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.670
But over half a billion years
in the early solar system,

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.080
that's not so often.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.020
There were lots
of comets around.

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.340
So investigating comets
to try to understand

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:13.430
whether the water in comets
is the same as the water we

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:17.870
have on the Earth is a
clue to our own origins

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.540
in terms of water.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.810
But more than that,
the complex molecules

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.110
which are in comets
also, we know

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.110
that comets contain
amino acids, for example.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.370
Interstellar space is rich
in carbon-bearing molecules.

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:33.350
And maybe-- again, because it
was hot when it was young--

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:36.345
maybe the comets brought that
organic material to the Earth.

00:10:36.345 --> 00:10:39.080
Not life, but organic
material, which could then

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.490
be the building blocks of life.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.650
So we could, in some ways,
literally be comet stuff.

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.440
You've heard from Carl Sagan
that we're star stuff, yes.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.280
But later in the circuit,
we could actually

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.960
be comet stuff as well.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.360
And so by going to a comet and
investigating it in detail, not

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.890
just a brief flyby,
we may learn much more

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.580
about our own origins.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.430
So I'm going to stop briefly
here and show you a five minute

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:05.060
film which we put together
last year from a completely

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.840
different perspective,
to try to open up

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:11.220
this story about our own
origins, where we came from,

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.960
the role that comets
might have played.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.050
And we did it-- we wanted
to reach the general public,

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.216
so we did it through the
medium of a science fiction

00:11:17.216 --> 00:11:19.480
film, which was novel.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.670
NASA called us up afterwards
and said, how the hell

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:22.660
did you do that?

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.075
We want to do that too.

00:11:25.075 --> 00:11:26.450
Which doesn't
often happen to us.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.222
It usually goes the
other way around.

00:11:29.222 --> 00:11:30.180
So I'll show it to you.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.420
And it's something
which is a word which

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.670
I'm sure this company and
many other people I speak to

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.390
are well aware of.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.465
The film is called "Ambition."

00:11:38.465 --> 00:11:42.425

[EXPLOSION]

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.940
-Enough.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:31.740
Walk with me.

00:12:34.361 --> 00:12:35.860
Perhaps we should
find you something

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.910
a little last challenging.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:39.490
-I don't understand.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.379
I've planned everything.

00:12:41.379 --> 00:12:42.170
Let me do it again.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:55.450
-Once upon a time--

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.010
-Really.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.020
-This is a good one, I promise.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.126
What is the key
to life on Earth?

00:13:05.126 --> 00:13:07.116
-Water.

00:13:07.116 --> 00:13:07.616
-Water.

00:13:23.054 --> 00:13:25.544
For a long time,
the origins of water

00:13:25.544 --> 00:13:28.034
and indeed life
on our home planet

00:13:28.034 --> 00:13:31.520
remained an absolute mystery.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:35.430
So we began searching
for answers beyond Earth.

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.186
Where could all this
water have come from?

00:13:38.186 --> 00:13:41.890
In time, we turned to comets.

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:47.340
One trillion celestial balls of
ice, dust, complex molecules,

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.170
left over from the birth
of our solar system,

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:54.440
once thought of as messengers
of doom and destruction,

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.940
and yet so
enchanting, if we were

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:01.280
to catch one, a
staggeringly ambitious plan.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.477
-Are you talking about
the Rosetta mission?

00:14:04.477 --> 00:14:05.310
-Throw me the probe.

00:14:14.961 --> 00:14:17.873
We harnessed whole
planets and their gravity

00:14:17.873 --> 00:14:18.873
to chase down the comet.

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:29.610
So many things could have gone
wrong-- the failure at launch,

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:35.480
an error in the calculations,
collisions-- so many unknowns.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.050
With the technology
we had back then, we

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:43.010
may as well have been shooting
from a slingshot And tell me,

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:43.950
what was it all for?

00:14:46.525 --> 00:14:48.840
-Knowledge.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:52.830
-Yes, but we also wanted
to show what was possible.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:15.366
-I know all this
from the archives.

00:15:15.366 --> 00:15:16.740
There were bigger
missions after.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:17.490
-Yes.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:20.810
It was the first one
to catch a comet.

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:27.930
Ambition, stubbornness--
nothing has changed, We fall.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.180
We pick ourselves up again.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.120
And we adapt.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.062
I was watching you earlier.

00:15:34.062 --> 00:15:36.630
You actually did
everything right.

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:39.915
I destroyed your rock.

00:15:39.915 --> 00:15:42.704
I needed to see how
you would react.

00:15:42.704 --> 00:15:43.245
You're ready.

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:47.470
Reset.

00:16:05.782 --> 00:16:08.764
Nicely done.

00:16:08.764 --> 00:16:09.758
Let's begin.

00:16:36.099 --> 00:16:37.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:40.556
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:40.556 --> 00:16:41.930
So I'm sure many
of you recognize

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:43.920
Littlefinger from "Game
of Thrones" there,

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.380
Aidan Gillen, out there
somewhere a million years

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.860
from now, looking back
at our amazing mission.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.620
But of course we had to turn
the science fiction-- which

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.180
we made last year--
we had to turn it

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.600
30 years ago into science fact.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.520
So at the time of Halley, when
we encountered with Giotto,

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.130
we knew that we wanted to do
more than just a brief flyby.

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:05.210
We wanted to get close to a
comet, rendezvous with one,

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:07.730
and land on one
and follow it as it

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:09.770
went around the inner
part of the solar system

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:13.339
to see it evolve, to see how the
material flows from the surface

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:16.640
and get exposure to the
material from underneath.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.579
So in 1985, this mission was
actually started to be planned.

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:22.730
And by 1994, we got to the
point where we're building it.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:24.490
It took about 10
years to build it.

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:26.280
And just give you
a sense of scale,

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.790
Rosetta, its wingspan from
tip to tip, is 32 meters.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.600
That's the size
of an Airbus A320.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.530
It's got the biggest
solar panels ever used

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:36.654
on a spacecraft, because
as you'll see in a moment,

00:17:36.654 --> 00:17:38.980
it had to go all the way
out to the orbit of Jupiter.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.440
And out there, the sun
is not very bright.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.350
More importantly, it's cold.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:46.320
And having big solar panels
to generate enough power

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.140
for the spacecraft
to operate, we

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:51.340
had these huge arrays which
you see here folded up.

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.130
What you see alongside
in the middle

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:54.700
is the spacecraft itself.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.960
It's about a three
by three meter cube.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.390
It weighs about three tons.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:00.650
Half of that is propellant.

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:03.222
The rest is all the spacecraft
bus and the electronics

00:18:03.222 --> 00:18:05.680
and the instruments, which I'll
talk a little bit later on.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.540
And that's the famous Philae
on the side, Philae the lander.

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:11.614
It's about one
meter by one meter.

00:18:11.614 --> 00:18:13.530
People say it's the size
of a washing machine.

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.696
I don't have a washing
machine that big in my house.

00:18:15.696 --> 00:18:20.569
My boxer shorts would be
clean much quicker if I did.

00:18:20.569 --> 00:18:22.360
Just give you a sense
of the scale of this.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:27.180
And it took from 1994 or
so to be built until 2003.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.300
And we were ready
to launch in 2003.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.240
It was prepared for
an Ariane 5 launch

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.750
in Kuru, in French Guiana.

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:35.800
But unfortunately, we
had a failure of one

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.010
of the Ariane 5's
just beforehand, not

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.319
the Rosetta launch.

00:18:39.319 --> 00:18:41.360
And then we had to have
an accident investigation

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.480
board, all the usual
stuff that you do.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.960
By the time we were ready to
go a year later, the comet we

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.690
we're going to had gone.

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:50.870
We couldn't catch up with it.

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.290
So within that one year, we
had to pick a whole new comet

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:54.210
to go to.

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:56.910
And in 2004 in March,
we are ready to go.

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:58.580
And since I work in
the space business,

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.950
you can't have a talk
without showing a launch.

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:03.135
So this is the launch
from French Guiana.

00:19:03.135 --> 00:19:06.925
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:25.735 --> 00:19:26.740
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.531
So that's what we do
in the space business.

00:19:28.531 --> 00:19:30.740
We build incredibly
delicate scientific machines

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.470
and then shake the
crap out of them

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:35.870
for eight minutes, which is
why it takes a long time to get

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:36.990
these things fully tested.

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:38.470
There's no going
after them afterwards.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:39.428
So where were we going?

00:19:39.428 --> 00:19:43.040
We were going to this comet,
67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko,

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.254
as I said.

00:19:44.254 --> 00:19:46.420
Most comets, many comets
are in an elliptical orbit.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.290
67P goes out beyond
the orbit of Jupiter.

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:51.850
It doesn't get super close to
the sun at its closest point.

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:54.510
It gets between the
orbits of Earth and Mars.

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.500
But the amount of
solar flux that it

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.299
gets by being that
close is hugely more

00:19:58.299 --> 00:20:00.090
than it gets out in
the outer solar system.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:04.000
So it changes its state an
awful lot as it comes in.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.940
But as I said, in 1986 all
we could do with our rockets

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.670
was just fly past a comet.

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:11.000
Even now, we don't have
big enough rockets to go

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.490
to comets like this directly.

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:15.240
We don't have enough power
to get to one and rendezvous

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.057
on this big elliptical orbit.

00:20:17.057 --> 00:20:17.890
So we have to cheat.

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:20.514
And the way we do that-- and you
heard it in the Ambition film,

00:20:20.514 --> 00:20:22.510
is we harness the
gravity of the planets.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:26.717
We actually use flybys-- sorry.

00:20:26.717 --> 00:20:29.050
What we did was actually come
back to the Earth one year

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:34.270
later and use the Earth's
gravitational energy, its force

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:37.560
to slingshot us faster and
onto a more elliptical orbit.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.870
We flew by Earth three times.

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:41.850
And we actually
encountered Mars once.

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:43.730
This actually slowed
us down a bit,

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:47.550
but we used that to get us
onto a more eccentric orbit.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.670
And since we were
doing all of this,

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:51.520
we flew through the
asteroid belt twice.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.040
And while you're passing, you
might as well make a visit.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.950
And we visited two asteroids
on the way through as well.

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.400
So this asteroid Steins in 2008.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.060
And you'll see when
we get further out,

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.249
we go to asteroid Lutetia.

00:21:02.249 --> 00:21:03.540
That's the comet going through.

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.331
The comet's on a six
and a half year orbit.

00:21:05.331 --> 00:21:06.210
We didn't miss it.

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:10.127
We just knew we had to
wait for next time around.

00:21:10.127 --> 00:21:12.460
So it was probably a bit
galling to be on the spacecraft

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:15.360
going, next time, next time.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.710
And so you see that we'll
encounter Lutetia here

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:19.556
in 20-- a little
bit before that.

00:21:19.556 --> 00:21:22.180
And then we went into this thing
called deep space hibernation.

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.190
Even though we have
these huge solar panels,

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:26.290
we had enough power
to run the spacecraft,

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:28.930
but not if we had a problem.

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:30.430
When we have problems
on spacecraft,

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:33.710
there's a lot of power used in
what's called safe mode to boot

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:35.220
everything back up again.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:38.680
And so what we actually
did was go into hibernation

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.060
for 2 and 1/2 years.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:43.510
We shut the whole system
down apart from some heaters

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:46.590
to keep the fuel lines
from freezing over.

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:48.662
We turned off all the
stabilization systems.

00:21:48.662 --> 00:21:50.120
And the only way
then we could keep

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.070
the spacecraft pointed at
the sun in a stable way

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:54.930
was by spinning it.

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:57.955
So we spun it up
into a lazy spin.

00:21:57.955 --> 00:21:59.580
But the high gain
antenna at that point

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:00.760
was no longer pointing at Earth.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.926
It's pointing all over the
place as it spins around.

00:22:02.926 --> 00:22:05.271
So we had no way of directly
talking to the spacecraft

00:22:05.271 --> 00:22:05.770
anymore.

00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:09.130
The engineers hated this,
as you can imagine--

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:13.400
turning your billion euro
asset off out in space

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.620
and waiting for-- the one
thing that was powered up

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.880
was an alarm clock.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.480
And that alarm
clock was powered up

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:23.977
for 2 and 1/2 years later for
January, 2014 January the 20th.

00:22:23.977 --> 00:22:25.560
And we had to hope
that that was going

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:29.840
to go off so that we could
get to where we are here

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.892
at the end of last
year for rendezvous.

00:22:31.892 --> 00:22:34.100
And you can see, we're trying
to rendezvous quite far

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.100
out in the solar system.

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.190
We want to rendezvous while
the comet's not active,

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:39.410
far from the sun.

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:41.745
We want to get down to
landing before it gets active.

00:22:41.745 --> 00:22:44.120
But we can't do it too soon,
because we need enough power

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.690
to power the spacecraft up.

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:47.620
So we had this three
month window or so

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:50.900
where we arrived and then had
to do the landing-- incredibly,

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:51.700
incredibly fast.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.192
Normally, you prepare for
landings years in advance.

00:22:54.192 --> 00:22:55.150
You send another probe.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:56.130
You take pictures.

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:57.370
You do analyses.

00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:58.510
We had none of that luxury.

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:00.554
We had to do it in
three months flat.

00:23:00.554 --> 00:23:02.470
On the way past, one of
my favorite pictures--

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:05.220
this is Antarctica
on a flyby, skimming

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:08.470
across the Earth's surface
or the above the atmosphere.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.080
We flew past Mars.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.140
And even though it wasn't yet
probably in the Oxford English

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:16.199
Dictionary, we took a
selfie, because you do.

00:23:16.199 --> 00:23:17.990
I'm not really sure
this is quite a selfie,

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:21.090
because this is actually
Philae has an array of seven

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:22.400
cameras around the outside.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.270
And it took a picture of
Rosetta, the spacecraft here

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:26.140
and the solar panel.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.970
And I suppose you
call this photobombing

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:31.860
by Mars in the background.

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:35.430
So it was a very savvy mission
even before we launched it.

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:39.640
And here's our encounter
with Lutetia in 2010.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.954
And it's kind of a
bit jerky because we

00:23:41.954 --> 00:23:42.870
took lots of pictures.

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:45.210
And then we take fewer
pictures until we encounter.

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:49.080
And it looks like
we got pretty close.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.360
Actually, we were 3,000
kilometers away at the time.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.640
So we have a good telephoto
lens, let's put it that way.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.480
So this was a big object more
than 100 kilometers in size.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.640
So we get to-- after that, we
turn this the spacecraft off,

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.660
spin it up, and pray.

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:06.950
And here we are
January the 20th.

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:10.040
We had a sweepstakes this day
in the control room in Germany,

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:10.840
in Darmstadt.

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.540
And these are the
guys, flight directors,

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:16.245
who know this system
inside out, completely.

00:24:16.245 --> 00:24:18.780
And they had a sweepstakes and
it was 20 people in the room,

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:19.540
20 times.

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:21.520
What minute is it
going to wake up on?

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.510
So when we got past
the first minute,

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:25.590
people went, yay, you lost.

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:27.090
Never mind, I get the money.

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:28.465
And you go for
the second person.

00:24:28.465 --> 00:24:29.420
Hey, you lost.

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:33.080
Person number 20, oh dear.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.040
It hadn't woken up.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.474
We were 18 minutes late.

00:24:37.474 --> 00:24:38.890
And we know why
now in retrospect.

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:42.440
There was a reboot on board.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:45.466
Perfectly feasible after that
length of time, but unsuspected

00:24:45.466 --> 00:24:46.340
that it would happen.

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:49.970
And we finally got the
signals through both Goldstone

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:51.870
and through camera.

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:55.480
And we get the signals
here, which you can see.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.360
That says we have
a carrier signal.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.395
And predictably, we had
some great enthusiasm.

00:25:00.395 --> 00:25:02.020
Because of course,
without this moment,

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:03.394
without the
spacecraft waking up,

00:25:03.394 --> 00:25:06.180
we had nothing, after
10 years of flight.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.540
There was no mission at all.

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.307
So this was an enormous
moment for these guys

00:25:10.307 --> 00:25:11.390
who worked for many years.

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:13.060
I'll let you a little
secret as well.

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:16.690
On the day, we immediately
had the spacecraft tweet.

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:18.580
And for all the geeks
in the audience, hello,

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:22.100
world-- of course, exactly
what you would tweet, right?

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.820
So we built Twitter
into Rosetta years

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.420
before Twitter even existed.

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.500
Actually, this is Emily.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.630
She's our social media guru
sitting in the front row here.

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:32.482
And she tweeted.

00:25:32.482 --> 00:25:34.690
So social media's actually
been a very important part

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:35.610
of the mission for us.

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:38.580
And we've had a lot of feedback.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:43.340
So it was hello, world on
that day, in 20 languages.

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.992
We soon knew after that that we
were heading towards a comet.

00:25:45.992 --> 00:25:47.950
You can see pictures
taken from the spacecraft.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:50.033
You can see the tail
developing of the comet here.

00:25:50.033 --> 00:25:52.934
This is actually bit of a worry,
because this phase, as I said,

00:25:52.934 --> 00:25:54.600
we were further out
in the solar system.

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.280
We didn't expect
activity at this point.

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.010
We don't want activity
at this point,

00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:59.740
because we don't want to
be next to an active comet

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:01.740
when we're trying to
learn how to land on it.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.212
Fortunately, this activity
died away shortly afterwards.

00:26:04.212 --> 00:26:05.670
But that's the
problem with comets.

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:07.360
They're dynamic, living objects.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.880
It's not a dead body.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.270
And so learning to actually
fly up next to this object

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:14.840
and maneuver around it
whilst it's changing

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.600
has been a huge challenge.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.390
But beyond that, it
was even challenging

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:19.390
when we first got there.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:21.490
Because if I remind
you, this is Tempel 1.

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:24.250
This is the object-- this is
a kind of prototypical comet

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:26.860
that we thought we were flying
to-- potato-shaped, fairly

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:30.592
smooth, lots of smooth
places to land on.

00:26:30.592 --> 00:26:33.050
And this is what the scientists
were actually planning for.

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:36.350
Now, when we started to get
just barely resolved images

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:38.780
of the comet, we began to
see a jittering around.

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:42.120
And you could decode little
bit about the shape from this.

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:45.160
But of course, rapidly we
got closer and we saw this.

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:48.090
And this was something
which led to the moniker

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:51.100
"the rubber duck,"
which everybody said.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:54.746
It was at this point-- as
you can see a rotating image

00:26:54.746 --> 00:27:00.012
of this thing, that the
engineers were just "Oh,God."

00:27:00.012 --> 00:27:02.470
Because we actually have to
fly next to this thing and land

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.570
on it?

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:04.660
The scientists thought this
was fantastic, of course,

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.201
because we may actually have
two comets for the price of one.

00:27:07.201 --> 00:27:08.840
How do you get
this binary object?

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:12.170
Is it two comets, different
origins, different compositions

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:14.280
which may have fused by a
collision at some point?

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.130
We still don't know that.

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:16.838
We don't believe that's
the case anymore,

00:27:16.838 --> 00:27:22.830
but again engineers,
scientists, the usual tension.

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:25.520
And when we got close up on
August 6th in rendezvous,

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.390
it got even more, well,
engineers and scientists.

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:30.970
Because this is the object
we rendezvoused with.

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:33.840
And it's just an astonishingly
complicated object.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.100
It's four kilometers across.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.600
We now know the
mass of this object.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.717
It's 10 billion tons.

00:27:39.717 --> 00:27:41.300
And you can quickly
do the math there.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:45.190
You realize this object actually
has density half that of water.

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:47.682
It's much, much less dense
than a regular iceberg.

00:27:47.682 --> 00:27:49.390
It would sit half the
way up in the water

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:51.840
if you could sit it in a lake.

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.510
But it's the surface structures
which have everybody amazed,

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:56.980
because this comet
actually has not

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.440
been in the inner solar
system for very many years.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.280
It was discovered in 1969.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.120
But we can track
back its trajectory.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:07.180
We knew that in 1959, it had
an encounter with Jupiter,

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.234
which moved it closer in.

00:28:08.234 --> 00:28:09.900
Before that, it used
to live further out

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.100
in the solar system.

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:15.100
So how come it's so eroded,
so completely covered in all

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.589
these craters and boulders?

00:28:16.589 --> 00:28:18.880
And one thing you need to
know about the craters, these

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.300
are not impact craters.

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.369
This object's barely being
hit by anything else.

00:28:22.369 --> 00:28:23.910
Those kind of
collisions don't happen

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:25.951
like they do in the asteroid
belt in "Star Wars,"

00:28:25.951 --> 00:28:27.510
I'm afraid.

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:28.800
Things are far apart.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.800
Collisions don't really happen
like that between small bodies.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.730
These craters here
are actually--

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:37.780
the water and the CO2,
as it gets heated up

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:40.460
from the ice phase, it
sublimes into the gas phase

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:43.322
from underneath and blows
craters out from underneath.

00:28:43.322 --> 00:28:44.780
These are the kinds
of things we're

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.490
going to be seeing in
the next few months

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:47.884
as these craters start erupting.

00:28:47.884 --> 00:28:50.050
This only happens when
you're close to the sun, when

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:52.980
there's enough energy and you
get above the phase transition.

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:56.050
So again, scientists
absolutely thrilled by this.

00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:58.480
And the engineers looked
and thought, well,

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.710
the precision of our
lander, the ability

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:03.990
to deposit our object on
the surface-- it's not

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.970
guided to the surface.

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:06.840
It's thrown like a dart.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.630
We going to land within
a one kilometer circle.

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:12.879
Show me somewhere flat over
a one kilometer circle.

00:29:12.879 --> 00:29:14.420
And just to give
you a sense of scale

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:16.970
and just to illustrate the
glory that Google has brought

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:19.440
to all of us in the world
is, you want anything

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.730
on the internet now,
you Google something.

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:24.711
I wanted a four
kilometer tall object.

00:29:24.711 --> 00:29:25.210
This is Mt.

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:26.800
Blanc, just over
four kilometers,

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.100
as seen from 100 kilometers,
which is the distance

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.290
we rendezvoused at.

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:33.050
This lady is sitting here in
the Swiss Jura exactly 100

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:35.800
kilometers away, looking at Mt.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:36.620
Blanc.

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:38.740
And just for scale,
that's what it

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:41.120
would look like if we put
the comet into the picture.

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:43.960
So it was called the
Klingon ship at some point.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.016
You can kind of see
bird of prey look here.

00:29:47.016 --> 00:29:48.550
And as we got
closer, of course, we

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:52.210
began to see these
astonishing structures here--

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:56.480
cliff faces, areas that look
like dunes, big boulders.

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.120
But remember, none
of this is rock.

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:01.250
None of this is
classical geology at all.

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:02.360
It's much lighter.

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.607
There's dust there.

00:30:03.607 --> 00:30:04.690
There are small particles.

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:07.230
But these boulders are
not great big rocks.

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:09.922
They're matrix material
of ice and dust.

00:30:09.922 --> 00:30:11.380
And the other thing
to keep in mind

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.130
is all the other
physical effects

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:15.390
on the Earth doesn't
really make a lot of sense.

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:16.434
There's no atmosphere.

00:30:16.434 --> 00:30:17.350
There's no weathering.

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:19.467
There's no rivers in that way.

00:30:19.467 --> 00:30:21.050
And one of the most
fundamental things

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:25.380
is when you look at an object
like this, where is down?

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:31.210
That boulder there-- where's the
down vector for that boulder?

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:32.790
And of course, it's local.

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:34.340
The down vector is
local everywhere

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:35.840
you are in an irregular object.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.690
You can try to pick
out the area which

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:40.465
has the biggest mass underneath
you and say that's down,

00:30:40.465 --> 00:30:42.590
but you don't know the
density profile well enough.

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:45.261
This object is actually
very porous on the inside.

00:30:45.261 --> 00:30:47.260
Not porous in the sense
that there's huge caves,

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:48.300
we don't think.

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.040
But to get to the
density we measure,

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.700
it's a very loose structure.

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.560
Gravity is not
really acting on it

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.750
in the way you would think of
making a compactified object.

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:58.390
So when you look
around and you try

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:01.870
to work out how things
eroded to get where they are,

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:03.515
to be very careful.

00:31:03.515 --> 00:31:05.640
You also have to remember
that the comet's rotating

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.420
every 12 and 1/2 hours.

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:10.350
And that centrifugal
force changes things

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:11.530
completely as well.

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:12.988
And I'll show you
that in a moment.

00:31:12.988 --> 00:31:15.620
Where you think the gravity
would be highest, it isn't.

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:17.880
And so there are areas
like this as well,

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:22.630
these sort of planes of material
with kind of scalloping here.

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:25.487
How did these boulders,
for example, get there?

00:31:25.487 --> 00:31:27.820
You could think the other
boulders might have fallen off

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:30.650
cliffs and somehow slowly
rolled down cliffs and landed

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:32.300
in the valley.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.510
But how did these get here?

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:35.170
Did they actually
fall from somewhere,

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:37.890
or they actually
material underneath,

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:41.030
which have been eroded out as
the comet's being eroded away

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:43.980
over these thousands of years
that it's been relatively

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:48.080
close to the sun, are you
exposing pieces of the matrix

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:49.740
underneath?

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:52.610
This one is christened Cheops
for its pyramid-type structure.

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:54.160
It's about 20 meters high.

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.720
And I thought, well, you want
to put this to scale, right?

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.820
Everybody wants it to scale.

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:01.570
So I made this image
and instantly realized

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:04.230
that we couldn't release it
from the European Space Agency,

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:06.021
because you could
imagine what would happen

00:32:06.021 --> 00:32:08.980
if we did, thanks to you guys.

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:12.480
Every lunatic in the world--
sorry, but anybody watching--

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.740
would say hey, look.

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:15.730
Told you, told you.

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:18.810
Conspiracy Face on Mars.

00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:20.959
So this was released
through a back door.

00:32:20.959 --> 00:32:22.250
It didn't have ESA's tag on it.

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:25.232
I can now say that
I did make it,

00:32:25.232 --> 00:32:26.690
but it's also
illustrating the fact

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:29.190
that we have this
Egyptian naming theme.

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:30.850
Rosetta, the mission,
of course refers

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:33.610
to the Rosetta Stone, which
is the way of decoding

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:35.780
Egyptian hieroglyphics.

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:38.700
And the naming scheme for
the geological areas all

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.725
actually have the names
of Egyptian deities here.

00:32:41.725 --> 00:32:44.100
And this is what the scientists,
of course, are doing now

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:46.530
is trying to characterize
the various areas,

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:49.100
try to understand how
they would have evolved.

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:52.290
Because not all these areas
see the same amount of sunlight

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:53.250
all the time.

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:58.150
Going to hand around a
model of the comet here.

00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:00.320
This side area really
hasn't seen much sunlight

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.939
at all in the last
six years or so.

00:33:01.939 --> 00:33:03.480
But as it moves
towards the sun, it's

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:04.972
going to be seeing
more sunlight.

00:33:04.972 --> 00:33:06.930
So the place where you
actually get more light,

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:09.439
you get more activity,
you get more sculpting.

00:33:09.439 --> 00:33:11.230
So we're trying to
actually try to work out

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:13.805
how these areas correspond
to solar illumination,

00:33:13.805 --> 00:33:14.876
and other things.

00:33:14.876 --> 00:33:15.876
This is an honesty test.

00:33:15.876 --> 00:33:17.292
If I don't get it
back at the end,

00:33:17.292 --> 00:33:19.320
I'll be able to
dine out on saying

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:22.964
that it got lost at Google.

00:33:22.964 --> 00:33:24.630
And of course, one
of the other pictures

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:27.060
which is being shown
many times-- again,

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:29.714
to give a sense of scale, which
we like a lot, is this one.

00:33:29.714 --> 00:33:31.630
But I'll leave that one
best unspoken perhaps.

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.290
It's not snow, unfortunately.

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:38.680
And we've put a lot of our
pictures in the public domain.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.180
We release our images from
our navigation cameras

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.280
are released through
Creative Commons.

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:45.800
We encourage people to go
and do things with them.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:48.460
And in fact, there's
many, many creative people

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.750
out there in the world,
many in this room as well.

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:51.670
And this is just
one thing that's

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:53.711
being done by one of our
friends, Matthias Malmo,

00:33:53.711 --> 00:33:55.660
making 3D models, actually.

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:58.430
He works in the video industry,
knows how to do this stuff.

00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:00.570
Took the images and
created shape models.

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:02.290
We're doing this
scientifically as well.

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:03.970
But I have to say,
sometimes these guys

00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:05.928
are better than we are
at it, for good reasons.

00:34:05.928 --> 00:34:09.267
They do this as
their daily life.

00:34:09.267 --> 00:34:11.850
But we didn't just go there, of
course, just to take pictures.

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:13.698
We went there to do science.

00:34:13.698 --> 00:34:15.239
So I'll just give
you a brief rundown

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:17.940
of the kinds of
scientific instruments

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:19.870
we have on Rosetta
itself, which carries

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:21.940
most of the scientific
instrumentation.

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:24.864
We have cameras which span
from the millimeter end,

00:34:24.864 --> 00:34:26.780
where you can actually
see beneath the surface

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:28.790
of the comet, all
the way out to the UV

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:32.800
through the infrared and the
optical, taking lots of images.

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:36.310
We measure-- as the
material flows past Rosetta,

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:40.019
we measure the gas and the
dust through mass spectroscopy,

00:34:40.019 --> 00:34:41.310
see what it's actually made of.

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:44.400
We know, for example,
that the comet stinks.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.989
It's got a lot of
organic molecules.

00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:48.989
It's got hydrogen
sulfide, hydrogen cyanide.

00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:50.489
It's characterized
as being a horse

00:34:50.489 --> 00:34:53.739
barn with the lovely
addition of cyanide.

00:34:53.739 --> 00:34:56.280
So we've been thinking of making
a perfume, bottle of perfume

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.406
actually.

00:34:57.406 --> 00:34:59.280
I just don't think it
will go down very well,

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:03.120
but-- smelling like
a comet, it stinks.

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.340
It's not nice.

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:07.970
We also capture individual
particles of dust.

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:10.630
We measure them with atomic
force microscopes on board

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:16.670
and then we zap them with little
high powered LED or ion guns,

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:19.060
rather, and then see what
material comes off it

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:22.657
so we can analyze
what it's made of.

00:35:22.657 --> 00:35:24.490
There's a plasma
associated with this comet.

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:29.540
Even though it's very cold, well
below freezing point of water,

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:31.160
there is a plasma
wrapped around it.

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:34.000
Mostly it's the solar wind
which is wrapped around it.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.110
And Philae, the lander
itself, is much smaller,

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:39.970
has quite a complement of
scientific instruments as well.

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:42.180
So lots of images-- you'll
see some of those as we

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:46.370
go down to the surface and
also microscopy of the surface.

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:48.150
We analyze the
material in situ now.

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:50.620
We try to tie together in
the one location-- or is

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:52.180
it turns out, the
multiple locations

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:55.345
we landed-- the
material we see there

00:35:55.345 --> 00:35:58.144
with what we can see from
orbit around the comet.

00:35:58.144 --> 00:35:59.810
So we can try to tie
that together so we

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:02.290
can get a more global picture.

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:06.337
And we had a drill on board to
actually go down 25 centimeters

00:36:06.337 --> 00:36:08.420
below the surface and pull
material out and put it

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:10.894
into a laboratory on board.

00:36:10.894 --> 00:36:12.310
Interesting
experiment is actually

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:15.850
linking the two spacecraft
together through, effectively,

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:19.220
FM frequency radio
waves and doing

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.820
tomography of the interior
of the comet, which

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:23.880
is kind of cool.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:26.520
And then the last thing we
do is beam data back home--

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.079
sensible thing to do.

00:36:28.079 --> 00:36:30.370
But we can actually measure
the speed of the spacecraft

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:32.730
to precision of roughly
a tenth of a millimeter

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:36.560
per second at that distance,
which allows us then to measure

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:39.090
the gravity and the higher
order moments of gravity,

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:41.150
what the internal
density structure is.

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:43.330
One of the most basic things
about the comet people

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:46.320
always ask, why is it you
show all these pictures which

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:49.184
are snowy white, when
you tell us it's dark,

00:36:49.184 --> 00:36:50.850
and the one I'm
carrying around is dark?

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:52.725
Well of course, we just
crank the contrast up

00:36:52.725 --> 00:36:53.740
so you can see anything.

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:55.900
But to give you a
sense, Enceladus

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:57.670
is one of the moons of Saturn.

00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:00.250
It's coated in fresh
ice from the water

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:02.897
which comes out through the
stripes of the bottom there.

00:37:02.897 --> 00:37:05.230
Effectively reflects 100% of
the light that falls on it.

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:08.410
The Earth is relatively
dark, only reflects about 30%

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:09.679
of the light that falls on.

00:37:09.679 --> 00:37:11.470
The moon, which we
think of as being white,

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:14.372
only reflect 12% of
sunlight that falls on it.

00:37:14.372 --> 00:37:16.620
It's a very dark
object in reality.

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:19.770
67P, I promise you, is there.

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:21.970
Reflects about 6% of the
light that falls on it.

00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:24.010
It's just being a cold cellar.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:26.360
It's incredibly dark.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.170
People also ask,
why is that you only

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:29.510
show black and white pictures?

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:30.801
Why won't you show a color one?

00:37:30.801 --> 00:37:33.050
Well, this is the
right brightness

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:35.340
and I'm going to turn the
brightness up and turn

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:39.590
the color up, because
it is that color.

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:41.840
It is just incredibly
dark and dusty.

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:44.430
There's very little color
differentiation there,

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:45.660
as the human eye would see.

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:47.290
But we have filters
on our cameras

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:49.270
which can enhance
the colors a bit.

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:51.830
And in fact, you do see
some color differences.

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:55.140
And you can see here the
head part of the comet here

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:58.830
compared to the neck,
you'll see as I scroll down,

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:00.270
a bluer color in the neck.

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:02.910
And we believe that that's
because the dust coating there

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:04.590
in that neck region's
actually thinner

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:06.980
and we're seeing the
ice coming through.

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:08.280
It's more exposed there.

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.490
Because ice, of course,
we do expect to see ice.

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:12.530
At the moment, we're
seeing a very dusty object,

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:15.595
but that dust will be blown
away in the next few months,

00:38:15.595 --> 00:38:19.330
because we have the whole
fresh phase of heating.

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:21.320
And then as we move
back away from the sun,

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:22.500
some of the dust
in the atmosphere

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.583
will fall back onto the
surface and coat it again.

00:38:24.583 --> 00:38:26.545
Actually, that's what
kills comets in the end.

00:38:26.545 --> 00:38:28.170
After thousands and
thousands of years,

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:30.307
you build up enough
dust on the surface.

00:38:30.307 --> 00:38:32.140
You don't blow it away
each time, all of it.

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:33.620
You get an insulating layer.

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:35.560
You can't even heat
the ice anymore.

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.060
So we know that in
our solar system,

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.670
there are many dormant
comets, former comets.

00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:42.530
Comets don't live forever.

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:44.890
So I talked to you about
the surface gravity

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:46.140
and about centrifugal force.

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.160
We've measured that.

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.275
Here's the effective
gravitational potential.

00:38:49.275 --> 00:38:51.150
You would think the
gravitational force would

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:52.710
be strongest when
you're standing

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:54.731
over the biggest piece of mass.

00:38:54.731 --> 00:38:56.730
But what we see here is
because of the spinning,

00:38:56.730 --> 00:39:00.020
the gravitational potential
is actually lowest

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:02.760
on the two ends of the comet.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:07.150
And you can also see that the
local slope of the surface--

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:11.039
let me finish this thought--
the local slope changes a lot

00:39:11.039 --> 00:39:12.705
relative to the
gravitational potential.

00:39:12.705 --> 00:39:14.754
You can see, it can be
up to 60 degrees off.

00:39:14.754 --> 00:39:16.920
So sort of metaphorically,
if you're walking around,

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:19.780
suddenly gravity moves
off by 30 degrees.

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:21.280
Depends on what's
under the surface.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.440
It depends where you are.

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.730
AUDIENCE: Where's the
rotation axis here?

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:24.810
MARK MCCAUGHREAN:
The rotation axis

00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:26.450
is more or less
through the neck.

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:27.830
So if you were to
take the comet,

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:30.200
stick a pin through
the neck, it's

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.650
the two ends are spinning
up at the highest speed.

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:33.990
Question?

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:37.680
AUDIENCE: So the dust, it seems
like if it was getting dormant,

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:41.696
wouldn't you still have some
of the dust blowing off?

00:39:41.696 --> 00:39:44.242
I'm surprised that you
would have more and more

00:39:44.242 --> 00:39:45.790
accumulate over time.

00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:46.460
MARK MCCAUGHREAN:
The question was,

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:48.710
why is it that we don't blow
the dust away every time?

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:50.580
Why do we get an
accumulating layer?

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:52.730
Well, it's just the physics
of the gas and the dust

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:53.563
and how they couple.

00:39:53.563 --> 00:39:55.510
The gas can flow
away very readily.

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:57.050
It flows away at high speed.

00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:59.050
The dust is coupled to
the gas at the beginning,

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:02.477
but drag forces act on it and
it gets slowed down and forced

00:40:02.477 --> 00:40:03.310
back to the surface.

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:05.518
So a fraction of the dust
ends up back on the surface

00:40:05.518 --> 00:40:06.400
every time.

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:09.509
And that is particularly bad
when the velocities of the gas

00:40:09.509 --> 00:40:11.800
escaping a low, which happens
when you're furthest away

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:12.980
from the sun.

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:14.030
So we get that coating.

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:16.029
We know that we're actually
the comet dust we're

00:40:16.029 --> 00:40:19.750
measuring today is old dust
from last time around the sun,

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:20.282
we believe.

00:40:20.282 --> 00:40:22.240
We're going to be seeing
different kind of dust

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.740
coming fresh from
the surface now.

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:27.075
So just to give you a sense
of scale about the gravity,

00:40:27.075 --> 00:40:28.680
this is one of my
favorite pictures,

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:33.860
just showing kind of the
sweeping vista on the comet.

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:37.300
This cliff here, this cliff
face is 100 meters high from top

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:37.810
to bottom.

00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:40.184
So I'm sure half of you in
the room immediately thinking,

00:40:40.184 --> 00:40:42.390
base jumping, right?

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:45.499
It would be the most boring
base jump in the world.

00:40:45.499 --> 00:40:47.790
Parachute wouldn't work,
because there's no atmosphere.

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:49.540
But you wouldn't
need one, because it

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:52.350
would take you 20 minutes to
get from the top to the bottom.

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:53.850
And you would arrive
at the velocity

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:56.840
of 0.2 meters per second at
the bottom, 20 centimeters

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:57.560
a second.

00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:59.380
You'd just walk off the bottom.

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:00.790
But actually, you'd have
to be careful, because you

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:01.710
know base jumping is?

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:04.010
To clear any obstructions,
you stand at the top--

00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:07.760
as if I've done it--
and you jump up and out.

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:10.110
But if you jumped too
high, for too hard,

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:12.767
you will go to escape velocity.

00:41:12.767 --> 00:41:14.850
So I'm going to get you
to demonstrate what escape

00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:15.960
velocity of the comet is.

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.460
If you all stand up, you're all
going to jump off the comet.

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:22.340
So if you all stand up,
you have to jump that high.

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:25.230
And if you can jump that
high, 4 centimeters,

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:28.390
you will have reached
0.9 meters a second.

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:30.290
That's escape velocity for 67P.

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:33.676
So, three, two, one, jump.

00:41:33.676 --> 00:41:34.176
Good.

00:41:37.407 --> 00:41:39.240
Now of course, I've
talked about this comet,

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:40.510
its gravity, its structures.

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:41.570
And people are
interested in that.

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:43.945
But of course, one of the
great things is, it's changing.

00:41:43.945 --> 00:41:45.144
We seeing activity.

00:41:45.144 --> 00:41:47.060
We're seeing material
begin to flow away as we

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:48.669
come in closer to the sun.

00:41:48.669 --> 00:41:50.710
And in fact, we look in
some of these sublimation

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:51.790
pits, these craters.

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:55.430
If we crank up the contrast, we
see stuff beginning to come out

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:59.052
of the craters themselves,
the material flowing away.

00:41:59.052 --> 00:42:00.260
This is what we would expect.

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.009
And as we're getting
close to the sun now,

00:42:02.009 --> 00:42:03.932
we're seeing more and
more of this activity.

00:42:03.932 --> 00:42:05.390
Here are some of
the dust particles

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:06.510
which we're gathering.

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:09.350
They tend to be very clumpy,
fractal structures which

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:12.630
as soon as we catch
them, they fall apart.

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:14.545
They're not strong
at all, structurally.

00:42:14.545 --> 00:42:15.711
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:42:15.711 --> 00:42:18.420
With central low gravity,
how do you [INAUDIBLE]?

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:23.890
MARK MCCAUGHREAN:
It can be in orbit.

00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:25.730
When we arrived
at 100 kilometers,

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:27.042
we actually got to the point.

00:42:27.042 --> 00:42:29.250
We don't know how massive
the comet is at that point.

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:30.600
So we don't know how
to go into orbit.

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:31.808
You need to know that, right?

00:42:31.808 --> 00:42:32.910
That's a starting point.

00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:36.600
So we flew in triangles
in front, power triangles.

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:40.110
We would cruise, then power,
go this way, go that way,

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:41.940
and move closer until
we started seeing

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:43.780
bending in the trajectories.

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:46.290
And that would tell
us what the mass was.

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:49.990
So when we get down to
30 kilometers or so,

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:52.720
this is a several week orbit.

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:55.250
But it's an orbit, so we were
actually in orbit for a while.

00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:57.870
We're standing back now, because
the comet's getting active.

00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:59.620
So we're back out at
100 kilometers again.

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:00.661
We're not in orbit there.

00:43:00.661 --> 00:43:02.310
We're flying trajectories.

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:03.900
But down at 30
kilometers and below,

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:05.441
we consider ourselves
to be in orbit.

00:43:05.441 --> 00:43:09.510
So its weak, but gravity
still works on those scales.

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:13.929
We've told you that the
plasma, the interaction

00:43:13.929 --> 00:43:15.720
between the comet and
the solar wind-- this

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.750
is a very technical graph,
but it's much easier

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:18.710
if you listen to it.

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:22.690
[RATTLING SOUND]

00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:25.214
So this is speeded up, to put
it into audible frequencies.

00:43:25.214 --> 00:43:27.630
What you're actually hearing
is the rotation of the comet,

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:30.870
modulating the interaction
of the solar wind

00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:33.652
as it flows past.

00:43:33.652 --> 00:43:36.060
So, the sound of a
comet spinning in space.

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:38.630
Cool, right?

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:40.219
Now, here's the kicker.

00:43:40.219 --> 00:43:42.260
I showed you the film
"Ambition" at the beginning

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:44.593
and I talked about the fact
we were trying to go and see

00:43:44.593 --> 00:43:47.800
whether the water on this comet
was the same as the water we're

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:48.640
made of.

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:51.270
The way you would do
that is to measure

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:54.700
the deuterium to hydrogen
ratio, the isotope of hydrogen.

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:56.580
Because on Earth,
it's one number.

00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:59.460
It's always the same,
everywhere-- the amount

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:01.480
of deuterium in water.

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:03.130
What we know from
other comets is

00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:05.050
it tends to be
high on the comets,

00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:06.490
whereas asteroids
are pretty good.

00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:08.540
Asteroids are quite Earthlike.

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:12.940
A comet was seen and
measured in 2012,

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:16.250
which would seem to have exactly
the same ratio as the Earth.

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:19.070
And it's from the
same family as 67P.

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:20.920
So we thought, well,
maybe these families

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:23.230
of comets at this
distance from the sun,

00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:25.280
maybe they have the
right kind of water.

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:29.320
Unfortunately, 67P has the
worst ratio ever mentioned--

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:30.730
very high.

00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:34.490
And so of course we already
know that this comet

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:38.740
didn't bring the Earth's
water, by definition, right?

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:40.770
But what it opens up
now is this question

00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:46.020
of trying to create a
recipe for making the cake.

00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:47.800
We know the Earth is
being hit by comets.

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.600
We know the Earth
gets hit by asteroids.

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.730
We know that there are all
these objects out there.

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:52.854
Some are closer to the sun.

00:44:52.854 --> 00:44:54.104
Some are further away.

00:44:54.104 --> 00:44:56.270
But we're trying to build
up the picture of how many

00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:57.669
of these versus
how many of those

00:44:57.669 --> 00:44:59.960
could end up with the right
kind of water that we have.

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:01.740
You see, there are
very few objects

00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:04.460
at all that have
water with a low d

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:06.850
to h ratio than the Earth.

00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:08.960
So since we do get
hit by some of these,

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:11.274
how do you get a lower
one on the Earth?

00:45:11.274 --> 00:45:12.690
And there are other
models for how

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:15.170
the Earth's water came
as well, and other people

00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:16.139
will comment on that.

00:45:16.139 --> 00:45:17.680
We can ask some
questions about that.

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:19.420
Maybe it didn't get delivered
from the outside at all.

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:21.400
Maybe it was stored
up on the Earth,

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.160
even when it was very hot.

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:25.455
One of the more fascinating
things about the structure

00:45:25.455 --> 00:45:26.330
of the comet is this.

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:28.290
You can see these lumps.

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:31.650
They were originally called
dinosaur eggs, goosebumps.

00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:33.940
They about a meter
or two across.

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:36.490
And we see internal
structure-- not

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:39.080
on the surface, which is being
processed-- but in the pits.

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:40.315
We see this texture.

00:45:40.315 --> 00:45:41.940
And the question is,
are these actually

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:45.610
the primordial structures,
the objects which

00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:49.750
formed at the beginning
of the solar system

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:51.750
and they actually came
together, agglomerated

00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:53.870
and formed the bigger
objects called comets.

00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:55.870
Are these the building
blocks of comets

00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:58.120
we're actually seeing inside?

00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:00.350
We may, we may get lucky.

00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:02.130
And we may see it
much more clearly,

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:07.112
because 67P has a 500-meter long
crack running through the neck,

00:46:07.112 --> 00:46:08.750
which you can see here.

00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:10.150
We know comets fall apart.

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:12.130
We see it all the time.

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:15.930
67P could fall apart
this time around the sun.

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:18.600
The engineers would
hate that, because they

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:21.390
have to fly around two
objects simultaneously.

00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:22.890
We would love it,
because then we

00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:25.630
could see the primordial
material on the inside

00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:27.467
before it gets
affected by the sun.

00:46:27.467 --> 00:46:29.300
There's no guarantee
it'll happen this time.

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:30.780
It'll happen in
the future someday.

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:34.280
This object's bound
to fall apart.

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:35.560
But it would be very cool.

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:36.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:40.000
MARK MCCAUGHREAN:
Well, thank you.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.420
So, last bit of the talk.

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:43.000
Let me talk a bit
about the landing.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.080
OK So here's another
selfie again.

00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:46.830
This is real photobombing now.

00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:48.790
A comet in the background
of your selfie-- I

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:50.972
mean, you can't do
better than that, right?

00:46:50.972 --> 00:46:52.430
So we arrived in
August and we knew

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:54.846
that we had to plan to get
down to the surface by November

00:46:54.846 --> 00:46:56.400
before the comet got too active.

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.850
And so we started
identifying landing sites.

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:00.680
None of them were going
to be fully clear.

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:05.280
We started with 10 A through
J. We whittled it down to five.

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.080
And you can see in
each case, the square

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:08.760
here is one kilometer.

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:10.487
So this is the
typical accuracy we

00:47:10.487 --> 00:47:12.903
thought we would have when we
threw our dart at the comet.

00:47:12.903 --> 00:47:14.736
Because we don't know
the gravity that well.

00:47:14.736 --> 00:47:16.370
And the gravity's non-uniform.

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:19.010
So landing in a certain
place is not so easy.

00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:23.230
We ended up taking site J
as the best of all worlds.

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:25.680
We also had to place that
had sunlight and satisfied

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:26.686
other constraints.

00:47:26.686 --> 00:47:28.060
But you can see,
there are cliffs

00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:29.680
and there are structures here.

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.500
It was not guaranteed
at all that when

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:34.360
we hit the surface here,
that we would be safe.

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.640
And C was the backup over there.

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:40.340
And a bit more detail, this
is the landing site, now as

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:41.680
an error circle one kilometer.

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:45.420
We aim to land there.

00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:47.240
And the way to think
about it, in fact,

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:50.020
is like darts, to scale.

00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:52.290
If you stood in front
of a normal dartboard,

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:56.700
the dartboard, the distance
of, called in English the oche,

00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:59.570
is exactly the
size of the comet--

00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:01.620
it's the same ratio-- the
distance we threw from,

00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:05.610
20 kilometers, and the
size of the object.

00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:10.350
As you'll see in a moment,
we landed in the 25.

00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:13.770
We were 120 meters away from
the nominal touchdown point--

00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:14.310
amazing.

00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:16.730
I mean, the guys that drive
this spacecraft deserve

00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:19.231
huge credit to go 10
years through space

00:48:19.231 --> 00:48:20.230
and then throw the dart.

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:22.970
They didn't get a bullseye,
so they shouldn't cocky.

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:25.644
But they were pretty close.

00:48:25.644 --> 00:48:26.560
So how do you do this?

00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.810
Well, if you're an astronaut,
it's really easy, right?

00:48:28.810 --> 00:48:29.912
You do this.

00:48:29.912 --> 00:48:31.840
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:33.286
[INAUDIBLE]

00:48:33.286 --> 00:48:39.552
Apparently it's translating
really slow but at least

00:48:39.552 --> 00:48:41.617
[INAUDIBLE].

00:48:41.617 --> 00:48:42.450
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:43.866
So this is Alex,
guest on the ISS,

00:48:43.866 --> 00:48:46.200
who did a demo, an
educational demo for us.

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:49.170
He spent hours doing
this, throwing an earplug

00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:52.305
at a piece of Velcro
on a rotating sphere.

00:48:52.305 --> 00:48:53.430
It looks good in the video.

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:53.929
He got it.

00:48:53.929 --> 00:48:57.870
But lots of one where he
pinged off in-- it's all good.

00:48:57.870 --> 00:48:59.410
In reality, it was
much complicated

00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:00.610
than that, of course.

00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:03.020
We worked our way down
into a 10 kilometer orbit,

00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:04.210
took high res pictures.

00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:06.160
We then had to work our
way back out to get up

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.120
on to this trajectory.

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:10.230
Then when we dropped
down from 20 kilometers,

00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:12.970
more or less straight
towards the nucleus,

00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:15.490
we dropped Philae off,
pushed it out of the back

00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:19.930
at 18 centimeters a second,
and then Rosetta pulled up so

00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:21.620
that it could
maintain radio contact

00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:26.200
throughout the entire seven
hour descent onto the surface--

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:27.460
seven, eight hours descent.

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:29.816
So we actually just-- it was
Isaac Newton at that point.

00:49:29.816 --> 00:49:31.440
It was all down to
the laws of gravity.

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:32.550
No guiding at all.

00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:35.100
We had a gyro on board,
a big stabilization wheel

00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:37.360
to make sure we
maintained orientation.

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:39.790
And it looked roughly like this.

00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:43.270
So music here-- composed for
us by Vangelis, of all people--

00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:45.150
nice original music.

00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:48.030
Of course, the comet's
rotating 12 and 1/2 hours.

00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:50.514
And it takes eight hours
to get to the surface.

00:49:50.514 --> 00:49:51.930
So you're not
aiming at the point.

00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:53.471
You don't even see
it when you throw.

00:49:53.471 --> 00:49:57.324
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:27.185
Now, that was the plan.

00:50:29.982 --> 00:50:32.190
The plan being, of course,
you're arriving at 1 meter

00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:32.690
a second.

00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:33.470
It's walking pace.

00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:35.280
It's a 100 kilo object.

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:38.350
It's low gravity, but
inertia is a killer, right?

00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:40.040
We hit hard, relatively.

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:42.170
Try it, somebody
100 kilos, let them

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:43.620
walk into you at walking pace.

00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:44.890
You'll feel it.

00:50:44.890 --> 00:50:48.300
And of course, the danger
was that we would bounce.

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:50.170
So we had ice
screws in the feet.

00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:52.670
We had harpoons underneath.

00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:54.610
We'll get to that in a moment.

00:50:54.610 --> 00:50:56.360
So this is what it
looked like in reality.

00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:57.560
This is the farewell shot.

00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:59.880
This is Philae taking
a picture of Rosetta

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:01.990
with a solar panel
is it backs away.

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:04.880
And this is the equivalent,
this is Rosetta taking pictures

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:07.487
of Philae as it descends
away down to the surface,

00:51:07.487 --> 00:51:09.820
getting more and more pixelized
as it gets further away,

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:12.470
of course.

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:16.089
We even see it moving across
the surface of the comet.

00:51:16.089 --> 00:51:18.380
Series of pictures here taken
a few minutes apart-- you

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:21.060
can see Philae in each case,
the little legs descending

00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:22.220
above the surface.

00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:24.220
It's actually descending
pretty much vertically.

00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:26.471
But because Rosetta's moving
and the comet's rotating,

00:51:26.471 --> 00:51:27.553
it doesn't look like that.

00:51:27.553 --> 00:51:29.770
But it's more or less going
straight down vertically.

00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:31.590
It's a picture taken
from three kilometers

00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:33.660
as the lander's
approaching the surface.

00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:35.690
And here are the pictures
taken at the surface,

00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:39.690
from about 40 meters
down to about 10.

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:43.570
You can see the lander leg here.

00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:45.130
So that's from about 10 meters.

00:51:45.130 --> 00:51:47.580
And to give you a sense of
scale, this is from Philae.

00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:50.530
But if I put Philae in the
shot and put it on the surface,

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:52.350
this is what Philae
would look like.

00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:54.750
So it's still pretty
rough at that scale.

00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:58.600
It's not as smooth as we
would like to have to been

00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:00.260
and this is accurately
where we landed.

00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:01.770
This is the place we landed.

00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:05.100
And in fact, that boulder there
could be part of the reason--

00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:07.049
when we actually did
bounce, as you know,

00:52:07.049 --> 00:52:08.215
we didn't bounce vertically.

00:52:08.215 --> 00:52:09.870
We went off at an angle.

00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:13.400
And it could be in part
because of hitting that rock.

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.200
And so this is where
we touched down.

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:19.550
You can see the
three feet, there.

00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:20.940
So we have pictures from orbit.

00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:22.930
I can now play you
the sound of landing

00:52:22.930 --> 00:52:24.310
through transducers on the legs.

00:52:27.396 --> 00:52:28.690
And that's in real time.

00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:29.690
That's what landing was.

00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:30.360
We hit down.

00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:32.850
We went through about
25 centimeters of dust,

00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:35.170
which is what you see
these pools kicked up.

00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:37.170
And we hit a very rigid surface.

00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:39.400
Even though, again, we know
that's a very low density

00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:41.140
object, that doesn't stop
it being pretty hard.

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:42.514
Think of balsa
wood or something.

00:52:42.514 --> 00:52:45.960
Can be very light, but
it can be fairly strong.

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:48.100
What we then saw all
shortly afterwards

00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:51.160
was this, from our
navigation cameras.

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:53.300
We see a dark patch there.

00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:56.260
That's a shadow of the
dust kicked up by Philae

00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:58.180
being cast on the surface.

00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:02.110
And then we see Philae
here and Philae's shadow.

00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:05.770
So we see Philae departing in
the navigation camera images.

00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:11.250
And in the high res pictures,
this is the touchdown point.

00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:14.330
And there's Philae, on its way.

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:17.600
Philae flew for a
further two hours,

00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:20.994
and very luckily clipped
a cliff on its way.

00:53:20.994 --> 00:53:22.660
Because if it hadn't
clipped that cliff,

00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:25.200
it would have gone back
out into space again.

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.130
So what we now know
we've reconstructed,

00:53:27.130 --> 00:53:30.800
is it for roughly an hour,
hit the edge of a cliff here.

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:34.020
During this phase-- I told
you it had a big stabilization

00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:34.820
wheel internally.

00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:37.940
That kept it level as it
came down to the surface.

00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:41.470
That was turned off as soon
as we made first contact.

00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:44.660
But as we then flew again,
the angular momentum

00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:46.580
transferred into the
lander and the lander

00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:48.460
started rotating, but level.

00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:50.210
So the lander started rotating.

00:53:50.210 --> 00:53:52.820
When it hit the cliff,
it started tumbling.

00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:55.320
We never lost radio contact
with the lander throughout,

00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:57.050
though, which was amazing.

00:53:57.050 --> 00:53:59.490
And then an hour later, we
end up somewhere over here

00:53:59.490 --> 00:54:00.270
on the edge.

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:02.830
This is landing site B, by
the way, which we chose.

00:54:02.830 --> 00:54:04.650
We didn't want to
land in, so we've just

00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:06.482
flew over it instead.

00:54:06.482 --> 00:54:07.190
We ended up here.

00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:09.920
We bounced one more time,
flew up a little bit

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:12.910
and then a few minutes later
came down a few meters away.

00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:14.860
And here are the
heights that we got to.

00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:18.479
We got about 100 meters,
150 meters above the surface

00:54:18.479 --> 00:54:19.270
during this flight.

00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:21.760
If we hadn't hit this
cliff-- the problem is,

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:23.780
this is actually
stretched out linearly.

00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:24.990
The comet itself is curved.

00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:27.175
We possibly would have
gone off into space there.

00:54:27.175 --> 00:54:30.140
But we did land, and we
landed in this place,

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:31.779
up against a wall.

00:54:31.779 --> 00:54:33.570
We think we're tilted
up against this wall.

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:35.130
It's relatively shadowed.

00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:38.190
So we don't actually have
enough power on the lander

00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:39.470
to keep it going.

00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:41.650
What we wanted was to
land in a sunny location

00:54:41.650 --> 00:54:43.820
where we'd have enough
power to keep the lander,

00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:47.060
after its primary battery,
60 hours, ran out,

00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:50.220
the rechargeable batteries
would kick in and keep us going.

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:52.300
We didn't have enough
sunlight in this location

00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:54.930
at this time to power
the secondary battery.

00:54:54.930 --> 00:54:58.270
So we went into
hibernation after 60 hours.

00:54:58.270 --> 00:55:01.060
The traditional question is,
why don't you use nuclear power

00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:02.045
on your spacecraft?

00:55:02.045 --> 00:55:03.045
Because we're Europeans.

00:55:06.190 --> 00:55:08.230
But what's very
fascinating about this is,

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:11.070
if you want to have a silver
lining, when we first landed,

00:55:11.070 --> 00:55:13.880
we land on a pretty boring place
covered in dust, because that's

00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:15.210
the safest place we could land.

00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:16.670
The scientists
didn't really-- they

00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:18.920
knew they had to land there,
but they didn't want to.

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:22.030
They wanted to land up next
to some primordial material.

00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:24.270
And that's where we ended
up, right next to a cliff

00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:26.289
made out of ice and dust matrix.

00:55:26.289 --> 00:55:27.580
AUDIENCE: This was all planned.

00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:30.740
MARK MCCAUGHREAN: Of
course, absolutely.

00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:32.676
I only wish.

00:55:32.676 --> 00:55:35.050
We would have had a lot more
sleep in the last six months

00:55:35.050 --> 00:55:35.549
or.

00:55:35.549 --> 00:55:37.890
So of course, at the time,
without even touching down

00:55:37.890 --> 00:55:39.450
on the comet was a
colossal success.

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:42.020
Nobody had ever done this--
first soft touchdown.

00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:43.790
At this moment, this
photograph, the guys

00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:45.520
who were about
here in the picture

00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:47.620
already knew we were flying.

00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:49.700
These guys didn't.

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:51.530
So, big media success.

00:55:51.530 --> 00:55:53.260
It was a huge day,
the 12th of November--

00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:54.550
absolutely astonishing.

00:55:54.550 --> 00:55:56.510
The world really got into this.

00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:59.040
And we had front
covers of newspapers

00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:00.010
absolutely everywhere.

00:56:00.010 --> 00:56:01.680
It was just astonishing.

00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:04.014
It became one of those things
where people were talking

00:56:04.014 --> 00:56:05.430
about the fact
people were talking

00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:07.680
about the fact people were
talking about it happening.

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.700
And it just--
absolutely amazing.

00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:11.590
So in fact, yes, we
certainly didn't plan it.

00:56:11.590 --> 00:56:14.540
But if you want to have the
maximum possible engagement

00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:17.360
from the public, build in a
bit of jeopardy in your mission

00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:19.666
and make things
not work properly.

00:56:19.666 --> 00:56:21.540
And we got to the end
of the year, of course.

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:23.120
And this is one
of the reasons I'm

00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:25.070
very happy to be here today.

00:56:25.070 --> 00:56:26.820
We had a Google
Doodle on the 12th.

00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:28.820
And then without us
knowing about it,

00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:30.280
on the end of the year.

00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.080
This one I found-- I'm not sure
I should really say this here,

00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:36.834
but just an interesting lesson
about a risk-averse company,

00:56:36.834 --> 00:56:37.750
let's put it that way.

00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:39.220
We knew that this
Google Doodle was

00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:41.420
being made, the landing one.

00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:43.630
And on the 12th of
November, I looked.

00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:46.370
I went on Google, and it
wasn't there-- come on.

00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:49.810
So I sent an email saying,
you know it's today, right?

00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:52.430
To which the reply was, yes,
but we're not posting it

00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:53.760
until you land successfully.

00:56:57.230 --> 00:57:00.290
So, good enough, I think, right?

00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:03.270
Front cover of
"Science" magazine.

00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:05.880
All these letters
going out of the UK

00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:08.340
had this "Congratulations to
the European Space Agency."

00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:11.270
And as a Brit, the Brits saying
anything positive about Europe

00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:14.200
is not very common, so
thank you very much.

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:16.250
And the flight director,
Andrea [INAUDIBLE] one

00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:18.130
of the key people
in the year here.

00:57:18.130 --> 00:57:21.860
This down here is actually
the Hollywood award,

00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:23.840
Hollywood nomination
for the "Ambition" film.

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:26.652
So our friends from Poland
who made the film for us

00:57:26.652 --> 00:57:28.110
had a nice evening
out in Hollywood

00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:29.550
on the back of "Ambition."

00:57:29.550 --> 00:57:32.050
And a couple of things, I got
to show the competition first

00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:32.540
and then you.

00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:34.355
But the end of the year
videos, this is Facebook.

00:57:34.355 --> 00:57:34.980
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:38.315
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:57:38.315 --> 00:57:41.285
-Stop defining each
other by what we are not,

00:57:41.285 --> 00:57:43.743
and start defining
ourselves by who we are.

00:57:43.743 --> 00:57:46.847
We can all be freer.

00:57:46.847 --> 00:57:47.680
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:49.230
And then yours
starts-- well, it's

00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:51.652
halfway through, of course--
a little more bizarrely.

00:57:51.652 --> 00:57:55.348
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:57:57.660 --> 00:57:59.710
-Just rendezvousing
with this comet

00:57:59.710 --> 00:58:01.582
is an extraordinary thing.

00:58:01.582 --> 00:58:03.040
But we're going to
make discoveries

00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:05.057
that no one's imagined yet.

00:58:05.057 --> 00:58:05.890
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:58:05.890 --> 00:58:07.910
So Bill Nye the Science
Guy, by the way.

00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:12.180
So, just an amazing, amazing
thing to be involved in.

00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:13.739
And it keeps on going.

00:58:13.739 --> 00:58:15.530
I'm going to show
another three-minute film

00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:16.955
to show another
way we've engaged,

00:58:16.955 --> 00:58:18.330
and then I'll wind
up at the end.

00:58:18.330 --> 00:58:22.680
It's a way we've engaged
and it happened by accident,

00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:24.230
but it worked extremely well.

00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:26.510
We've made a series of
films to engage with kids.

00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:30.232
And you now know a
lot about the comet.

00:58:30.232 --> 00:58:32.190
And see how much of what
I've told you actually

00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:33.360
appears in this summary.

00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:36.264
This is what happened
on the 12th of November.

00:58:36.264 --> 00:58:37.180
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:41.520
-Over 10 years has passed since
Rosetta and Philae launched

00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:44.864
on their exciting
mission to comet 67P,

00:58:44.864 --> 00:58:45.780
Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

00:58:48.450 --> 00:58:51.980
After three months investigating
the comet from orbit,

00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:55.200
it was time to send
Philae to its surface.

00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:59.610
A long night of final
preparations lay ahead of them.

00:58:59.610 --> 00:59:04.160
Finally, the moment everyone
had been waiting for arrived.

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:07.030
As the world held
its breath, Rosetta

00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:09.640
moved into the exact
position needed

00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:13.200
to make sure Philae would
reach the landing site

00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:15.140
that scientists on
Earth had picked

00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:17.070
up earlier in the mission.

00:59:17.070 --> 00:59:21.420
Philae and Rosetta were sad to
be going their separate ways,

00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:23.730
but excited at the same time.

00:59:23.730 --> 00:59:26.900
Because this is what they
had been waiting to do.

00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:29.790
Philae was away.

00:59:29.790 --> 00:59:33.020
It would take seven hours
to reach the surface,

00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:37.460
but Philae wanted to get started
on his measurements right away.

00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:41.430
He could soon see the
surface in incredible detail.

00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:43.805
And the moment he
had been dreaming of

00:59:43.805 --> 00:59:45.980
had finally arrived.

00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:50.210
He had reached the
surface of the comet.

00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:52.680
But all was not right.

00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:55.260
His harpoons did not fire.

00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:58.820
Philae realized he
couldn't relax yet.

00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:01.870
He was rising from
the surface again.

01:00:01.870 --> 01:00:06.830
Philae was scared he might
drift off the comet completely.

01:00:06.830 --> 01:00:08.325
This was not in the plan.

01:00:10.930 --> 01:00:13.862
But eventually, he
came back down again.

01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:21.430
However, as he looked
around, he realized

01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:26.600
he had landed in a completely
unexpected location.

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:30.710
Philae immediately set to
work on studying his new home.

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:34.860
It took him just over two days
to conduct all the experiments

01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:36.870
he had brought with him.

01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:41.040
After all his hard work,
Philae began to feel tired,

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:44.870
so he made sure to send all
the data he had collected back

01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:46.450
to Rosetta.

01:00:46.450 --> 01:00:49.700
As the sun set over
Philae's new home,

01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:53.640
he fell into a deep sleep,
safe in the knowledge

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:57.080
that he did his main job
well and that his family

01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:01.930
of comet-chasing heroes would
be proud of his achievement.

01:01:01.930 --> 01:01:02.960
Who knows?

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:07.400
Perhaps one day, enough sunlight
would fall on his new landing

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:12.570
site and wake him up so that
he could carry on investigating

01:01:12.570 --> 01:01:15.466
this incredible world.

01:01:15.466 --> 01:01:20.100
And so, as the comet moved
over closer to the sun,

01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:24.280
Rosetta prepared for the next
part of her exciting adventure.

01:01:29.538 --> 01:01:30.972
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:30.972 --> 01:01:34.800
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:37.530
So the big question is,
where is Philae today?

01:01:37.530 --> 01:01:40.460
We actually don't know.

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:42.850
It's up against
the shaded region.

01:01:42.850 --> 01:01:44.950
We know pretty
clearly where it is.

01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:45.797
It's flown over.

01:01:45.797 --> 01:01:47.380
You can actually see
the two red dots.

01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:48.879
The first one at
the top left corner

01:01:48.879 --> 01:01:50.370
is where we touched down.

01:01:50.370 --> 01:01:52.250
The second one is
the cliff we hit.

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:53.620
And we know we're roughly here.

01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:55.620
In fact, we've refined
this a little bit better.

01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:58.526
We do this through the
tomography ranging experiments

01:01:58.526 --> 01:01:59.150
with the comet.

01:01:59.150 --> 01:02:01.150
We know the timing
very accurately.

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:03.124
So we believe we're
somewhere in this region.

01:02:03.124 --> 01:02:05.290
But you can see, there are
lots of little white dots

01:02:05.290 --> 01:02:06.190
everywhere.

01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:08.200
And we've been looking
at all the images.

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:11.460
Philae's roughly one or two
pixels in size at the closest

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:14.330
pictures we have-- incredibly
difficult to actually sort out.

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:17.420
We'll have a post out next
week showing a little bit

01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:20.110
about that, where
we think we are.

01:02:20.110 --> 01:02:22.420
But we haven't definitively
identified Philae.

01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:24.584
We're waiting for
the sun to increase,

01:02:24.584 --> 01:02:27.000
because as we get closer to
the sun, the energy increases,

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.340
we may recharge
Philae's batteries.

01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:31.530
It may come back to
life this summer.

01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:32.470
We're listening out.

01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:34.060
We're hoping to hear from it.

01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:35.660
At the moment, we haven't.

01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:37.077
Just to show you
what we're really

01:02:37.077 --> 01:02:38.868
doing in studying the
surface of the comet,

01:02:38.868 --> 01:02:41.390
this is an amazing image taken
during a very close flyby

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:42.730
on Valentine's Day.

01:02:42.730 --> 01:02:45.350
We flew six kilometers
above the surface.

01:02:45.350 --> 01:02:48.590
And again, you see these
incredible structures

01:02:48.590 --> 01:02:53.130
and incredibly diverse terrain
in terms of mesas and plateaus

01:02:53.130 --> 01:02:55.499
and dust and boulders.

01:02:55.499 --> 01:02:56.415
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:02:56.415 --> 01:02:58.900
MARK MCCAUGHREAN: No,
crack's up around the neck.

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:01.520
But if you actually
look in more detail,

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:03.620
you get to see some
very interesting things

01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:06.420
as we zoom in.

01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:08.807
And the highest res picture
that we've released so far

01:03:08.807 --> 01:03:10.890
is actually taken just
from about eight kilometers

01:03:10.890 --> 01:03:12.154
above the surface.

01:03:12.154 --> 01:03:14.070
And this is with the sun
right behind the back

01:03:14.070 --> 01:03:14.950
of the spacecraft.

01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:16.491
So you don't see
many of the shadows.

01:03:16.491 --> 01:03:19.150
And in fact, what you
do see is Rosetta.

01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:23.720
It's Rosetta's his own shadow,
from six kilometers up--

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:24.740
eight kilometers up.

01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:26.990
And so we're in this position
now where we investigate

01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:28.760
things absolutely
astonishing, sort

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:31.960
of [INAUDIBLE] alien landscape.

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:34.604
I mean, this is kind of science
fiction from the 1950s in terms

01:03:34.604 --> 01:03:35.270
of the pictures.

01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:36.930
And it really looks like this.

01:03:36.930 --> 01:03:39.130
But more importantly
for us now is it's

01:03:39.130 --> 01:03:41.790
starting to look like this.

01:03:41.790 --> 01:03:43.380
Every day we take
a picture of it,

01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:45.360
we are seeing more
and more jet activity,

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:46.620
more material flowing away.

01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:49.810
This is the material which then
comes out tens of thousands

01:03:49.810 --> 01:03:52.200
of kilometers away,
flows out into the tail,

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:55.100
which we should then be able
to see behind the comet.

01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:55.990
I hesitated there.

01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:58.520
We won't be able to see this
comet naked eye from the Earth.

01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:00.250
It's never going to
be bright enough.

01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:02.450
25 centimeter
telescope will do it.

01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:03.620
But you don't need that.

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:04.480
We're there.

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.281
We're actually there.

01:04:06.281 --> 01:04:08.030
And just one last
picture before I finish.

01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:10.270
This is one we
released last week.

01:04:10.270 --> 01:04:13.620
Over a space of three minutes,
we saw a jet come out,

01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:15.440
two pictures, three
minutes apart.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:17.050
And we see jet emission.

01:04:17.050 --> 01:04:19.565
So we're really in this
fantastic phase now.

01:04:19.565 --> 01:04:21.690
We'd love for Philae to
wake up, but you know what?

01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:23.040
It doesn't matter.

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.340
We have Rosetta there,
doing amazing things.

01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:26.770
So let me wind up.

01:04:26.770 --> 01:04:29.180
We're at this point now where
we're actually flying by.

01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:31.262
We're learning to
live with this comet.

01:04:31.262 --> 01:04:33.220
The closest approach,
what's called perihelion,

01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:35.480
is on the 13th of August.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.560
That's the date at
which-- nothing really

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:40.320
happens, apart from the
closest point to the sun.

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:42.410
We are currently funded
to the end of this year,

01:04:42.410 --> 01:04:44.720
but we think we should
be no problem continuing.

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:48.404
We have enough fuel on board
to run until late next year.

01:04:48.404 --> 01:04:50.320
But as you think about
it, we'll be coming out

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:51.780
of the solar system again.

01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:54.210
So we have to choose-- do
we go back into hibernation?

01:04:54.210 --> 01:04:55.550
Nobody likes that idea.

01:04:55.550 --> 01:04:57.990
So actually, what we're
currently investigating

01:04:57.990 --> 01:05:01.740
is whether we can land
Rosetta on the surface

01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:03.184
and have it all over again.

01:05:03.184 --> 01:05:04.600
The only problem
is, of course, we

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.310
won't have another
spacecraft to talk to.

01:05:06.310 --> 01:05:09.090
So once Rosetta hits
the ground, it's over.

01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:11.900
But it will be a
fun day, I think.

01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:15.360
Lots of social media--
all the good stuff there.

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:17.750
And it's not over.

01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:21.070
And let me end by thanking you
for letting me come and take

01:05:21.070 --> 01:05:22.530
your time today.

01:05:22.530 --> 01:05:25.450
Everybody else watching out
there, thanks very much.

01:05:25.450 --> 01:05:28.320
But I'm just standing in front
of a mission of thousands

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.387
of people across Europe,
across the world.

01:05:30.387 --> 01:05:31.470
United States is involved.

01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:33.180
NASA's involved.

01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:36.350
A lot of people have
become involved making

01:05:36.350 --> 01:05:38.000
movies and all sorts of stuff.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.570
Lots of big media--
and my communications

01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:43.900
team, who've done a lot of
the stuff you've seen here.

01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:45.400
They made it just
a privilege for me

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.230
to be here today and
say, thank you very much

01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:48.190
and keep watching the mission.

01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:48.690
Thank you.

01:05:48.690 --> 01:05:52.546
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:01.989 --> 01:06:05.410
AUDIENCE: One question regarding
the satellites-- so obviously,

01:06:05.410 --> 01:06:08.467
changes during the orbits--

01:06:08.467 --> 01:06:10.550
MARK MCCAUGHREAN: Rosetta
flying around the comet?

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:13.180
AUDIENCE: No, the comet
flying around the sun.

01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:16.090
You didn't comment on how
it would feel for a human

01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:17.830
if you were standing there.

01:06:17.830 --> 01:06:20.035
Like, how bright or
dark would that be?

01:06:20.035 --> 01:06:22.310
Would it be like you were
in the middle of night?

01:06:22.310 --> 01:06:23.520
MARK MCCAUGHREAN: Well,
at its closest point--

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:24.590
AUDIENCE: What's
the lumens like?

01:06:24.590 --> 01:06:25.850
MARK MCCAUGHREAN: Well,
at its closest point

01:06:25.850 --> 01:06:27.460
it's between the Earth and Mars.

01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:33.860
So it's roughly like a sunny day
on the Earth, roughly speaking,

01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:35.810
because the atmosphere
absorbs some light.

01:06:35.810 --> 01:06:38.299
I always make this joke that
when we're out at Jupiter,

01:06:38.299 --> 01:06:40.840
we don't have enough power to
run the solar panels and so on.

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:43.165
Actually, Jupiter the
sunlight intensity

01:06:43.165 --> 01:06:47.090
is roughly the same as a typical
British summer day under cloud.

01:06:47.090 --> 01:06:50.410
So we have an enormous dynamic
range in sunlight on the Earth,

01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:51.730
whether it's cloudy or not.

01:06:51.730 --> 01:06:53.110
But it would be cold,
of course, because you

01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:54.490
would be radiating to space.

01:06:54.490 --> 01:06:56.645
You've got a cold object
next to you as well.

01:06:56.645 --> 01:07:00.070
AUDIENCE: One short one-- where
does the outgassing start?

01:07:00.070 --> 01:07:02.600
MARK MCCAUGHREAN: Well,
we see it happening

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:04.130
from many parts of the surface.

01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:05.847
We see it specifically
in certain areas.

01:07:05.847 --> 01:07:07.430
AUDIENCE: Apart from
the sun, I meant.

01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:08.305
MARK MCCAUGHREAN: Oh.

01:07:08.305 --> 01:07:10.820
We saw it, actually, already
at three astronomical units.

01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:13.111
The astronomical unit is the
distance between the Earth

01:07:13.111 --> 01:07:15.880
and the sun, 150
million kilometers.

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:19.320
We saw that initial outburst--
actually at more like 3

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:20.237
and 1/2 AU.

01:07:20.237 --> 01:07:23.320
So activity can
happen at any time.

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:28.860
It depends very much on
a particular fortuitous

01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:31.800
orientation with respect
to accumulated sunlight

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:34.130
on a given day and maybe
a pocket of volatiles

01:07:34.130 --> 01:07:36.310
near the surface,
expanding and blowing up.

01:07:36.310 --> 01:07:39.530
So activity-- we've seen
Halley, the activity

01:07:39.530 --> 01:07:42.450
continued a long way
out after perihelion.

01:07:42.450 --> 01:07:45.520
So activity can happen, but it
goes as the square, roughly,

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:49.460
as the distance or the inverse
square with the sunlight.

01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:51.885
And there's also
thresholds where

01:07:51.885 --> 01:07:53.385
volatiles reach
certain temperatures

01:07:53.385 --> 01:07:54.852
and suddenly get busy.

01:07:54.852 --> 01:07:56.310
So we're seeing a
lot more activity

01:07:56.310 --> 01:07:58.565
now than at the beginning.

01:07:58.565 --> 01:08:02.750
AUDIENCE: So does Philae have
cameras that can point back out

01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:04.255
in space if it wakes up?

01:08:04.255 --> 01:08:05.130
MARK MCCAUGHREAN: No.

01:08:05.130 --> 01:08:09.540
What it has on board is seven
cameras around the outside,

01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:10.670
which two are stereo.

01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:12.040
It's a stereo pair.

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:14.270
But they look horizontally.

01:08:14.270 --> 01:08:16.210
And then it has
cameras pointing down.

01:08:16.210 --> 01:08:19.149
That having been said, we are
tilted at an angle like this,

01:08:19.149 --> 01:08:21.510
and we know that we
can see in space.

01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:23.460
When we did the
first panorama, we'd

01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:26.689
see very dark material under us
an illuminated cliff and then

01:08:26.689 --> 01:08:28.950
the sky, the point being--

01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:31.381
AUDIENCE: Philae
gets ejected because

01:08:31.381 --> 01:08:34.702
of outbursts, then when it
wake up and then [INAUDIBLE]?

01:08:34.702 --> 01:08:36.410
MARK MCCAUGHREAN:
That's always possible.

01:08:36.410 --> 01:08:38.710
I mean, we're in a
very shaded spot.

01:08:38.710 --> 01:08:40.439
One of the ironies
is that, in fact,

01:08:40.439 --> 01:08:44.529
if we had landed
on the surface, we

01:08:44.529 --> 01:08:46.660
calculated that by
March this year,

01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:49.990
we would have got too hot for
the electronics on the inside.

01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:52.470
And by actually
being in the shade,

01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:53.970
we're pretty cold
soaking, mind you.

01:08:53.970 --> 01:08:55.219
That's one of the big worries.

01:08:55.219 --> 01:08:56.910
We've been in cold
soak for a long time.

01:08:56.910 --> 01:09:00.260
The electronics may be fried
or inverse fried-- unfried,

01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:01.830
if you like-- chilled.

01:09:01.830 --> 01:09:02.840
So we don't really know.

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:04.270
But if it does
come back to life,

01:09:04.270 --> 01:09:05.939
we may be there at
a more active phase.

01:09:05.939 --> 01:09:08.439
So this business of, will it
get ejected if there's activity

01:09:08.439 --> 01:09:10.600
locally-- it's always possible.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:11.810
But it's very tenuous.

01:09:11.810 --> 01:09:14.415
If you think about the
ejected material from comets,

01:09:14.415 --> 01:09:16.540
it's actually about the
same density as the Earth's

01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:18.300
atmosphere, 100 kilometers up.

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:21.892
So it's just not like a strong
wind or anything like that.

01:09:21.892 --> 01:09:23.850
There's very little force
from the-- we see it.

01:09:23.850 --> 01:09:25.960
We sit on the solar panels.

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:30.029
When we're close in, we actually
feel the wind blowing us

01:09:30.029 --> 01:09:31.319
and moving us around.

01:09:31.319 --> 01:09:34.254
We are able to sense that.

01:09:34.254 --> 01:09:37.930
AUDIENCE: OK, Mark, thanks
for this brilliant talk.

01:09:37.930 --> 01:09:42.029
And my question is, you
showed in the last image

01:09:42.029 --> 01:09:44.579
this jet that came up,
three second thing.

01:09:44.579 --> 01:09:45.704
So what's the origin of it?

01:09:45.704 --> 01:09:47.130
MARK MCCAUGHREAN: It's
not really understood.

01:09:47.130 --> 01:09:48.974
I mean, this is a
fairly wide field image

01:09:48.974 --> 01:09:49.890
taken from a distance.

01:09:49.890 --> 01:09:53.140
It may be there's a promontory
which just moved into sunlight

01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:56.220
as it tipped, as the
base of the comet

01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:57.650
tipped into sunlight there.

01:09:57.650 --> 01:09:58.660
Nobody knows yet.

01:09:58.660 --> 01:09:59.900
It's being looked at.

01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:02.857
But we expect to start seeing
very transient effects.

01:10:02.857 --> 01:10:04.690
We know that comets,
of course, occasionally

01:10:04.690 --> 01:10:05.690
just go through big outbursts.

01:10:05.690 --> 01:10:07.520
AUDIENCE: Jets everywhere
in the universe.

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:10.160
MARK MCCAUGHREAN: Jets
everywhere, exactly.

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:11.481
Indeed.

01:10:11.481 --> 01:10:13.230
We take this one-- no,
you've got the mic.

01:10:13.230 --> 01:10:16.110
AUDIENCE: So your best
case and scariest scenario

01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:18.300
is that the comet
breaks in half.

01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:21.447
If that happens, have you
modeled what's likely to Occur

01:10:21.447 --> 01:10:22.780
Is there risk to the spacecraft?

01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:24.530
MARK MCCAUGHREAN: It's
an interesting one.

01:10:24.530 --> 01:10:27.962
People actually think
it may not fall apart

01:10:27.962 --> 01:10:29.920
under centrifugal force,
which you would think.

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:33.220
It may actually slump
and fall together.

01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:34.700
It's all going to be very slow.

01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:37.620
The centrifugal force is
roughly the same as the gravity.

01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:41.012
So there's not going to be any
balls on the end of a string,

01:10:41.012 --> 01:10:42.970
you cut the string and
they fly off into space.

01:10:42.970 --> 01:10:45.950
It's going to be a slow
motion activity, at best.

01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:50.700
And at the moment, at least,
we're 100, 200 kilometers away,

01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:51.500
routinely.

01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:53.650
We have an issue at the
moment, interestingly,

01:10:53.650 --> 01:10:56.130
that in order to maintain
our orientation as we

01:10:56.130 --> 01:10:58.830
fly through our hyperbolic
flybys, well, always

01:10:58.830 --> 01:11:00.480
we use star trackers on board.

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:02.390
We recognize
constellations on the sky,

01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:04.610
compare them to a
catalog on board.

01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:07.320
And as we fly through
the comet's coma now,

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:08.840
we see dust
particles everywhere.

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:10.400
And we're seeing
too many of those.

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.220
And we're confusing
them with stars.

01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:15.430
And we're not able at the moment
to fly that close to the comet.

01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:16.870
So we're still looking at this.

01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:19.620
If you know any people that have
got 10 years old assembler code

01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:24.610
expertise on star trackers--
somebody here, right?

01:11:24.610 --> 01:11:25.940
It's an issue.

01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:28.267
We're actually looking
to how we might

01:11:28.267 --> 01:11:29.850
be able to reprogram
the star tracker.

01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:31.270
It's very difficult to do.

01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:33.916
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
for the Mars Rover.

01:11:33.916 --> 01:11:35.610
AUDIENCE: What
scientific questions

01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:38.026
do you hope to answer in the
remainder of the mission?

01:11:38.026 --> 01:11:39.650
MARK MCCAUGHREAN:
Well, I think there's

01:11:39.650 --> 01:11:42.490
this issue of
overall composition,

01:11:42.490 --> 01:11:46.000
particularly of organics, this
discussion about amino acids,

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.330
for example.

01:11:48.330 --> 01:11:52.320
We know that on previous comets
that glycine has been seen.

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.350
But glycine is an
interesting amino acid,

01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:57.290
because it's the only
one that's not handed.

01:11:57.290 --> 01:11:58.800
It's not chiral.

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:01.330
The crucial thing is all life
on Earth is one-handedness.

01:12:01.330 --> 01:12:03.370
And if we go and we
see the comets are

01:12:03.370 --> 01:12:05.970
all handedness in their
amino acids as well,

01:12:05.970 --> 01:12:07.730
that's an interesting thing.

01:12:07.730 --> 01:12:10.250
It's unlikely to be the case.

01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:12.360
It has to do with how
life evolved on the Earth

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.070
and picked one handedness
over the other.

01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:16.340
But if there's a slight
predominance of one-handedness

01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:19.190
over the other in the comets,
that would be very interesting.

01:12:19.190 --> 01:12:22.490
It's really to study the
comet's evolution over time,

01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:24.760
to try to understand
the amount of wastage,

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:28.060
the amount of erosion that
happens during one perihelion

01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:28.990
passage.

01:12:28.990 --> 01:12:30.820
What are the structures?

01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:32.480
How does the outgassing occur?

01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:33.920
Where does it come from?

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:36.390
Trying to understand how
comets are put together

01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:38.947
by effectively seeing them
fall apart, if you like.

01:12:38.947 --> 01:12:40.780
And we've never been
able to do that before.

01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:42.540
We've never been able
to fly with a comet

01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:45.899
over an extended period and see
the before and after changes.

01:12:45.899 --> 01:12:48.190
And we'll watch it as it
cools down as well, of course.

01:12:48.190 --> 01:12:50.160
We come out from the
sun after August,

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:52.100
we'll see how some of
those processes reverse

01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:54.570
and how the dust settles
back down on the surface.

01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:57.070
So in that sense, it's not
the high end questions,

01:12:57.070 --> 01:12:58.574
are we made of comets stuff.

01:12:58.574 --> 01:13:00.240
But for scientists,
this is exactly what

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.530
we love to do-- go
out and investigate

01:13:02.530 --> 01:13:05.600
weird and wonderful objects,
take them apart, and tell

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:06.597
our friends about it.

01:13:06.597 --> 01:13:07.430
Thank you very much.

01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:11.380
