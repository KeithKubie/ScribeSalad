00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.250
In my humble opinion, the
single most important

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:11.540
biochemical reaction, especially
to us, is cellular

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.640
respiration.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.490
And the reason why I feel so
strongly about that is because

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.180
this is how we derive
energy from what we

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.630
eat, or from our fuel.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.290
Or if we want to be specific,
from glucose.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.260
At the end of the day, most of
what we eat, or at least

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.290
carbohydrates, end
up as glucose.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.189
In future videos I'll talk about
how we derive energy

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.630
from fats or proteins.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.690
But cellular respiration, let's
us go from glucose to

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.350
energy and some other
byproducts.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.170
And to be a little bit more
specific about it, let me

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.530
write the chemical reaction
right here.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.840
So the chemical formula for
glucose, you're going to have

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.350
six carbons, twelve hydrogens
and six oxygens.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.990
So that's your glucose
right there.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.880
So if you had one mole of
glucose-- let me write that,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.870
that's your glucose right
there-- and then to that one

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.020
mole of glucose, if you had six
moles of molecular oxygen

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.080
running around the cell, then--
and this is kind of a

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.110
gross simplification for
cellular respiration.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.650
I think you're going to
appreciate over the course of

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.020
the next few videos, that one
can get as involved into this

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.210
mechanism as possible.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.720
But I think it's nice to
get the big picture.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.190
But if you give me some glucose,
if you have one mole

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.190
of glucose and six moles of
oxygen, through the process of

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.290
cellular respiration-- and so
I'm just writing it as kind of

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.450
a big black box right now,
let me pick a nice color.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.160
So this is cellular
respiration.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.030
Which we'll see is
quite involved.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.480
But I guess anything can be, if
you want to be particular

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.710
enough about it.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.240
Through cellular respiration
we're going to produce six

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.400
moles of carbon dioxide.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.470
Six moles of water.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.780
And-- this is the
super-important part-- we're

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.820
going to produce energy.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.930
We're going to produce energy.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.530
And this is the energy that can
be used to do useful work,

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.750
to heat our bodies, to
provide electrical

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.010
impulses in our brains.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.600
Whatever energy, especially a
human body needs, but it's not

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.910
just humans, is provided
by this

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.590
cellular respiration mechanism.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.130
And when you say energy, you
might say, hey Sal, on the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.730
last video didn't you just--
well, if that was the last

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.880
video you watched, you probably
saw that I said ATP

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:48.080
is the energy currency for
biological systems. And so you

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.280
might say, hey, well it looks
like glucose is the energy

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.600
currency for biological systems.
And to some degree,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.970
both answers would be correct.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.430
But to just see how it fits
together is that the process

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.820
of cellular respiration, it does
produce energy directly.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.690
But that energy is used
to produce ATP.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.270
So if I were to break down
this energy portion of

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.780
cellular respiration right
there, some of it

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.080
would just be heat.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.990
You know, it just warms
up the cell.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.710
And then some of it is used--
and this is what the textbooks

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.230
will tell you.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.010
The textbooks will say
it produces 38 ATPs.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.790
It can be more readily used by
cells to contract muscles or

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.080
to generate nerve impulses or
do whatever else-- grow, or

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.350
divide, or whatever else
the cell might need.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.040
So really, cellular respiration,
to say it

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.200
produces energy, a little
disingenuous.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.200
It's really the process of
taking glucose and producing

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.800
ATPs, with maybe heat
as a byproduct.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.950
But it's probably nice to
have that heat around.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.040
We need to be reasonably warm
in order for our cells to

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.290
operate correctly.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.460
So the whole point is really to
go from glucose, from one

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.020
mole of glucose-- and
the textbooks will

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.270
tell you-- to 38 ATPs.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.540
And the reality is, this is in
the ideal circumstances that

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.920
you'll produce 38 ATPs.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.240
I was reading up a little bit
before doing this video.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.630
And the reality is, depending on
the efficiency of the cell

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.560
in performing cellular
respiration, it'll probably be

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.579
more on the order of
29 to 30 ATPs.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.300
But there's a huge variation
here and people are really

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.540
still studying this idea.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.470
But this is all cellular
respiration is.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.460
In the next few videos we're
going to break it down into

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.300
its kind of constituent parts.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.260
And I'm going to introduce them
to you right now, just so

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.500
you realize that these are parts
of cellular respiration.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.840
The first stage is called
glycolysis.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.880
Which literally means
breaking up glucose.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.180
And just so you know, this part,
the glyco for glucose

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:56.520
and then lysis means
to break up.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.500
When you saw hydrolysis, it
means using water to break up

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.480
a molecule.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.450
Glycolysis means we're going
to be breaking up glucose.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.490
And in case you care about
things like word origins,

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.040
glucose comes from, the gluc
part of glucose comes from

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.980
Greek for sweet.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.360
And glucose is indeed sweet.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.360
And then all sugars, we
put this ose ending.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.950
So that just means sugar.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.930
So you might think it's kind
of a redundant statement to

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:25.850
say sweet sugar.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.550
But there are some sugars
that aren't sweet.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.620
For example, lactose.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.950
Milk, it might be a little bit,
but when you actually

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.860
digest lactose then you can turn
it into an actual sweet

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.820
sugar, but it doesn't taste
sweet like glucose or fructose

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.770
or sucrose would taste.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.440
But anyway, that's an aside.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.380
But the first step of cellular
respiration is glycolysis,

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.830
breaking up of glucose.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.960
What it does is, it breaks up
the glucose from a 6-carbon

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.350
molecule-- so it literally
takes it from a 6-carbon

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.520
molecule-- let me draw it like
this-- a 6-carbon molecule

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.490
that looks like this.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:04.490
And it's actually a cycle.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.010
Let me show you what glucose
actually looks like.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.970
This is glucose right here.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.840
And notice you have
one, two, three,

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.230
four, five, six carbons.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:17.480
I got this off of Wikipedia.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.290
Just look up glucose and you
can see this diagram if you

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.570
want to kind of see
the details.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.650
You can see you have six
carbons, six oxygens.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.270
That's one, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.850
And then all these
little small blue

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.630
things are my hydrogens.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.260
So that's what glucose
actually looks like.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.060
But the process of glycolysis,
you're essentially just

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.280
taking-- I'm writing it out
as a string, but you could

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.390
imagine it as a chain-- and it
has oxygens and hydrogens

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.410
added to each of
these carbons.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.520
But it has a carbon backbone.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.915
And it breaks that carbon
backbone in two.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.180
That's what glycolysis
does, right there.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.240
So you've kind of lysed
the glucose and

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.270
each of these things.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.610
And I haven't drawn all
the other stuff

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:03.650
that's added on to that.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.420
You know, these things are all
bonded to other things, with

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.010
oxygens and hydrogens
and whatever.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.400
But each of these 3-carbon
backbone

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.880
molecules are called pyruvate.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.360
We'll go into a lot more
detail on that.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:20.010
But glycolysis, it by itself
generates-- well,

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:21.370
it needs two ATPs.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:32.240
And it generates four ATPs.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:38.160
So on a net basis, it generates
two-- let me write

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:46.920
this in a different color--
it generates two net ATPs.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.990
So that's the first stage.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:51.180
And this can occur completely
in the absence of oxygen.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.900
I'll do a whole video on
glycolysis in the future.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.540
Then these byproducts, they get

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:56.640
re-engineered a little bit.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.050
And then they enter into what's
called the Krebs cycle.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.810
Which generates another
two ATPs.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:12.740
And then, and this is kind of
the interesting point, there's

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.330
another process that
you can say happens

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:16.400
after the Krebs cycle.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.370
But we're in a cell and
everything's bumping into

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:19.540
everything all of the time.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.140
But it's normally viewed
to be after glycolysis

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:23.580
and the Krebs cycle.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.475
And this requires oxygen.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.950
So let me be clear, glycolysis,
this first step,

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.750
no oxygen required.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.520
Doesn't need oxygen.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.390
It can occur with oxygen
or without it.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.310
Oxygen not needed.

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.840
Or you could say this is called
an anaerobic process.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.680
This is the anaerobic part
of the respiration.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.580
Let me write that down too.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.640
Anaerobic.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.100
Maybe I'll write
that down here.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:02.710
Glycolysis, since it doesn't
need oxygen, we

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.450
can say it's anaerobic.

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:09.260
You might be familiar with the
idea of aerobic exercise.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.450
The whole idea of aerobic
exercise is to make you

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:13.620
breathe hard because you
need a lot of oxygen

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.500
to do aerobic exercise.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.900
So anaerobic means you
don't need oxygen.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.490
Aerobic means it needs oxygen.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:20.890
Anaerobic means the opposite.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.120
You don't need oxygen.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.440
So, glycolysis anaerobic.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:29.230
And it produces two ATPs net.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:35.170
And then you go to the Krebs
cycle, there's a little bit of

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:36.150
setup involved here.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.310
And we'll do the detail
of that in the future.

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:43.750
But then you move over to the
Krebs cycle, which is aerobic.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:44.850
It is aerobic.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.150
It requires oxygen
to be around.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.440
And then this produces
two ATPs.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.650
And then this is the part that,
frankly, when I first

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:54.780
learned it, confused me a lot.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.090
But I'll just write it
in order the way it's

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:57.890
traditionally written.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.290
Then you have something called--
we're using the same

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.290
colors too much-- you have
something called the electron

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:04.540
transport chain.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.920
And this part gets credit
for producing

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.340
the bulk of the ATPs.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.220
34 ATPs.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.450
And this is also aerobic.

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:23.710
It requires oxygen.

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:26.460
So you can see, if you had no
oxygen, if the cells weren't

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.460
getting enough oxygen,
you can produce a

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.800
little bit of energy.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.480
But it's nowhere near as much
as you can produce once you

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.980
have the oxygen.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.230
And actually when you start
running out of oxygen, this

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:42.500
can't proceed forward, so what
happens is some of these

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.720
byproducts of glycolysis,
instead of going into the

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.010
Krebs cycle and the electron
transport chain, where they

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:51.620
need oxygen, instead they go
through a side process called

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.870
fermentation.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.560
For some organisms, this process
of fermentation takes

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.470
your byproducts of
glycolysis and

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.100
literally produces alcohol.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.260
That's where alcohol
comes from.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.500
That's called alcohol
fermentation.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.130
And we, as human beings,
I guess fortunately or

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:12.410
unfortunately, our muscles do
not directly produce alcohol.

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:13.900
They produce lactic acid.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:17.040
So we do lactic acid
fermentation.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.150
Let me write that down.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:19.250
Lactic acid.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:23.540
That's humans and probably
other mammals.

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:30.230
But other things like yeast will
do alcohol fermentation.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.650
So this is when you
don't have oxygen.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:38.840
It's actually this lactic acid
that if I were to sprint

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.070
really hard and not be able to
get enough oxygen, that my

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.890
muscles start to ache because
this lactic acid

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:45.370
starts to build up.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:46.280
But that's just a side thing.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.050
If we have oxygen we can move
to the Krebs cycle, get our

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:51.950
two ATPs, and then go on to the
electron transport chain

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:56.210
and produce 34 ATPs, which is
really the bulk of what

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:57.930
happens in respiration.

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.080
Now I said this as an
aside, that to some

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.510
degree this isn't fair.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:05.050
Because while these guys are
operating they're also

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:06.800
producing these other
molecules.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.670
They're not producing them
entirely, but what they're

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:11.490
doing is, they're taking-- and
I know this gets complicated

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.470
here, but I think over the
course of the next few videos

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:16.890
we'll get an intuition for it--
in these two parts of the

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:20.110
reaction, glycolysis and the
Krebs cycle, we're constantly

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:24.820
taking NAD-- I'll write it as
NAD plus-- and we're adding

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.470
hydrogens to it to form NADH.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:32.670
And this actually happens for
one molecule of glucose, this

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:34.530
happens to 10 NADs.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:38.040
Or 10 NAD plusses
to become NADHs.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.010
And those are actually
what drive the

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.330
electron transport chain.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.870
And I'll talk a lot more about
it and kind of how that

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:47.450
happens and why is energy being
derived and how is this

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:49.210
an oxidative reaction
and all of that.

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:51.500
And what's getting oxidized
and what's being reduced.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.760
But I just wanted to
give due credit.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:56.190
These guys aren't just producing
two ATPs in each of

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:56.680
these stages.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.930
They're also producing, actually
combined, 10 NADHs,

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:06.540
which each produce three ATPs
in an ideal situation, the

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:07.870
electron transport chain.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:12.050
And they're also doing it to
this other molecule, FAD,

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:13.500
which is very similar.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.030
But they're producing FADH.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:19.290
Now I know all of this
is very complicated.

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:21.010
I'll make videos on this
in the future.

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:24.030
But the important thing to
remember is cellular

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:28.350
respiration, all it is is taking
glucose and kind of

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:31.570
repackaging the energy in
glucose, and repackaging it in

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:34.345
the form of, your textbooks
will tell you, 38 ATPs.

00:13:34.345 --> 00:13:36.830
If you're doing an exam, that's
a good number to write.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.340
It tends to, in reality
be a smaller number.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.440
It's also going to
produce heat.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.070
Actually most of it is
going to be heat.

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.680
But 38 ATPs, and it does it
through three stages.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.550
The first stage is glycolysis,
where you're just literally

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:51.260
splitting the glucose
into two.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.940
You're generating some ATPs.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.720
But the more important thing
is, you're generating some

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.400
NADHs that are going to be used
later in the electron

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.670
transport chain.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:01.350
Then those byproducts are split
even more in the Krebs

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:04.240
cycle, directly producing
two ATPs.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.270
But that produces a
lot more NADHs.

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:09.710
And all of those NADHs are used
in the electron transport

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:13.820
chain to produce the
bulk of your energy

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:17.965
currency, or your 34 ATPs.
