00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.320
We're asked to
categorize the value

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.220
of each exponential expression.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.960
And we categorize
each expression

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.520
into either the bucket
less than negative 1,

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.530
between negative 1 and
0, and between 0 and 1.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.350
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.440
and try this out on your own.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.630
So I assume you've
given a go at it.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.080
Now let's work
through it together.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.030
So I just copy and pasted
the exact same exercise right

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.150
over here.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.220
And let's think about
each of these expressions.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.011
And actually, before
doing that, I actually

00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:33.820
want to draw a number line to
think about these categories.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.480
So it looks like
the important things

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.880
to consider-- you have a 0.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.460
You have 1.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.660
And then you have negative 1.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.970
This first category right over
here, less than negative 1,

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.560
that's all of these
values right over there.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.390
Then you have the category
between negative 1 and 0.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.250
That's these values
right over there.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.340
And then finally, you have
the category between 0 and 1.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.140
That's this category
right over here.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.709
So they didn't give us a
bucket for greater than 1,

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:06.750
so I guess it's safe to
assume that none of these

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.470
are going to be greater than 1.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.840
But let's go each expression
by each expression.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.560
So this first expression, 7
to the negative fourth power,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.550
we've already talked
about several times,

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.220
that when you raise something
to a negative exponent,

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.220
this isn't somehow negative 7
to the fourth power or anything

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.840
like that.

00:01:27.864 --> 00:01:29.780
When you see a negative
number in an exponent,

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.900
you should immediately
think reciprocal.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.130
So this is going to
be equal to 1 over 7

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.374
to the positive fourth power.

00:01:37.374 --> 00:01:39.540
And you don't even have to
know what 7 to the fourth

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.100
actually is.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.249
It's 2,401, if
you're interested.

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:43.790
But you don't even
have to know that.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.415
You just know that
this right over here

00:01:45.415 --> 00:01:49.550
is going to be a large
positive number, so 1 over that

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.390
is going to be a very
small positive number.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.220
It's going to be
between 0 and 1.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.150
This is actually one 1/2,401,
but you don't even have to know

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.650
that.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.460
This is a large
number, and so you say,

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.240
well, this is going
to get pretty close.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.550
It's positive, so it's
going to be above 0.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.310
But it's not going to
be too much above 0.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.820
It's going to sit on the
number line-- actually,

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.710
I'm not even doing
justice right over there.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.110
The way I drew it, at
scale, it's not even

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.780
a pixel to the right
of 0 right over there.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.790
So this is going to
be between 0 and 1.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.690
And actually, I'll
draw lines like this,

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.170
to show roughly on our number
line, where it would sit.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.450
Now let's think about
negative 7 to the third power.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.400
So negative 7 to the
third power, well,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.470
this is the same thing
as negative 7 times

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.730
negative 7 times negative 7.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.190
And you could also think
about this as negative 1 times

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.300
7 times negative 1 times
7 times negative 1 times

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.620
7, which is the
same thing as-- you

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.050
have three negative 1's
being multiplied together--

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.950
so negative 1 to the third power
times 7 to the third power.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.636
Well, what's negative
1 to the third power?

00:03:02.636 --> 00:03:04.260
Well, it's negative
1 times negative 1,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.801
which would be positive 1, but
then times another negative 1.

00:03:06.801 --> 00:03:08.630
So this is negative
1 right over here.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.850
So this is going to be equal
to-- let me write it this way.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.120
You could write it either
as-- I could write it

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.620
like this-- negative
7 to the third power.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.032
So 7 to the third,
once again, we

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:20.490
don't even have to
know what it is.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.426
This is going to be a
large positive value.

00:03:23.426 --> 00:03:24.550
But then we're negating it.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.370
If we had 7 to the third,
it would be greater than 1.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.700
But negative 7 to the
third is definitely

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.670
less than negative 1.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.700
So this fits into that
bucket right over there.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.965
Now we have negative 7
to the negative fourth.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.210
So let me write it over
here-- so negative 7

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.504
to the negative fourth.

00:03:44.504 --> 00:03:45.920
So this could be
a little daunting

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.020
because you have a negative base
raised to a negative exponent.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.170
But whenever I see
a negative exponent,

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.300
the first thing I worry about or
the first thing my brain wants

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.480
to do is take a reciprocal.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:05.870
So this is going to be 1 over
negative 7 to the fourth power.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.670
And once again, the same
idea as we just saw over

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.860
here, we could view this
as 1 over negative 1

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.464
to the fourth power times 7
to the fourth power, which

00:04:16.464 --> 00:04:18.839
is going to be equal to--
negative 1 to the fourth power,

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:20.450
this is just going
to be equal to 1.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.660
So this is going to be equal to
1 over 7 to the fourth power.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.730
Well, we've already
thought about what 1 over 7

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.030
to the fourth power is.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.170
It is between 0 and 1.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:39.192
So this right over here
is between 0 and 1.

00:04:39.192 --> 00:04:40.650
Another way you
can think about it,

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.250
this is going to be 1
over negative 7 times

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.632
negative 7 times negative
7 times negative 7.

00:04:45.632 --> 00:04:48.090
You have a negative times a
negative times a negative times

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.030
a negative.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.940
Well, that's going
to be a positive.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.150
So it's positive 7
to the fourth power.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.860
Now let's think about this one
right over here-- negative 7

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.940
to the negative fifth power.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.790
So let me write this
out-- negative 7

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.920
to the negative fifth power.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.530
Well once again, as soon as
you see that negative exponent,

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.160
I want to just take
the reciprocal,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.993
so I don't have a
negative exponent anymore.

00:05:09.993 --> 00:05:14.800
So it's 1 over negative
7 to the fifth power.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.690
And we could rewrite
this as 1 over negative 1

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:27.980
to the fifth times 7
to the fifth, which

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.024
is equal to-- well, what's a
negative 1 to the fifth power?

00:05:33.024 --> 00:05:34.690
Well a negative 1
raised to an odd power

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.250
is going to be a negative 1.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.710
So this is going to be negative
1 over 7 to the fifth power.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.507
So where is 1 over 7
to the fifth power?

00:05:44.507 --> 00:05:46.090
Well, that would be
really close to 0.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.190
This would be positive.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.470
1 over 7 to the fifth would be
a very small positive number.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.280
But now we're taking
the negative of that.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.410
So we're going to jump on
to the other side of 0.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.276
So this is going to be
between negative 1 and 0.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.040
And then finally, negative
7 to the fifth power,

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.290
well that's just going
to be-- this, once again,

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.720
you could view that
as negative 1 times

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.650
7 to the fifth power, which is
the same thing as negative 1

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.940
to the fifth times 7
to the fifth, which

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.200
is the same thing as
negative 7 to the fifth.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.750
7 to the fifth is a very
large number, larger than 1.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.650
So the negative of that is going
to be a very negative number.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.580
It's going to be
less than negative 1.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.490
So this is going to be less
than negative 1 right over here.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.710
So now let's take our results.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.229
And since I have
a bad memory, I'm

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:41.770
essentially probably going to
have to think through it again.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.561
And let's actually put
them in the buckets.

00:06:43.561 --> 00:06:45.250
7 to the negative
fourth power-- this

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.750
is not going to be
a negative value.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.410
This is 1 over 7 to the fourth.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.360
This is going to
be between 0 and 1.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.910
Negative 7 to the third
power-- that's essentially,

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.290
if you take 7 to
the third power,

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.240
you get a very large
positive number.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.440
But then, since that's
going to be times negative 1

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.940
to the third power,
it's going to be

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.650
the negative version of that.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.020
So that's going to be
less than negative 1.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.520
Negative 7 to the
negative fourth-- well,

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.900
we already determined,
especially because this ends up

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.890
being 1 over negative
7 to the fourth power

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:21.890
and that's an even exponent,
it ends up being the same as 7

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.480
to the negative fourth.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.030
And then you had negative 7
to the negative fifth power.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.340
So once again, that was
going to be 1 over negative 7

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.150
to the fifth power.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.130
And so we found that to be
between negative 1 and 0.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.427
And then finally,
this right over here,

00:07:41.427 --> 00:07:42.510
it's going to be negative.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.400
And it's going to be a
very negative number.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.970
It's less than negative 1.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:48.030
And so those are our choices.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:51.290
And we can check our
answer, and we got it right.
