00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:08.410
A space that is new in concept
to Harvard and new in design

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.580
as well is the i-lab
adjacent to the Business

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.440
School on the Boston
side of the river.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.190
It's a space that is intended
to be for all of Harvard,

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.690
and it's a space that's designed
for invention, creativity,

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.680
entrepreneurship, for
people to come together

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.270
to pursue bringing ideas
into the public realm,

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.600
either commercial or nonprofit,
to seek the advice of venture

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.050
capitalists and intellectual
property lawyers who

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.370
come and consult, and
offer classes, and offer

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.230
consultations to groups of
student who join together

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.260
to advance their ideas
and bring them into a form

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.270
where they can make a
difference in the world.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.010
It's a very open space
that can be reconfigured

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.459
in a variety of ways.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:09.400
It's a space that's available
day and night to individuals

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.400
who wish to take advantage
of these opportunities

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.990
to bring their
ideas to a new form.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.150
And I think it's a
space that has marked

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.110
a departure from Harvard into a
realm of entrepreneurship that

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.590
wasn't present here
in the same dimensions

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.520
that the i-lab has enabled
and fostered over the years

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.900
since it came together.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.780
So I love the one
Harvard part about it.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:41.680
I love the collaborative space,
the idea of using our marvelous

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.580
diversity of individuals
to strengthen one another's

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.970
ideas and possibilities,
and I love

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.920
the idea of the kind of impact
that the organizations that

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.460
have begun there have been able
to have already on the world

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.130
and will continue to
have on the world.
