Hey, guys. We're back, and in today's video

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.440
we're making another organic silicone mold.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.360
Today's request comes from HorseyTube in the comments.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.940
He asked, "A brain in a silicone mold? Like if you agree!"

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.220
With over 361 likes that looks like

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.500
this is the experiment we should be doing today.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.039
Now I've actually been wanting to mold a brain for over a month.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.080
Ever since I saw, in Vat 19, these gummy brains

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.859
that they have. So I got in touch with the company,

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:23.970
and they sent me a couple of these that

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.560
we could use for reference as we're

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.210
making a mold here today. So, big

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.769
shout-out to Vat 19, thanks for sending

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.539
these things to me. They are four pounds,

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.489
4,000 calories, and if you wanna look at

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.600
getting one for yourself I'll put a link

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.010
down in the description that will take you

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.820
right to them

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.090
[sniffs] like cherry, smells really good.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.960
Now, at first I was thinking it'd be fun to cast one of these

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.360
gummy brains in silicon to

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.100
make our own gummy brain, but to go one

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.539
step further, I got back in touch with a

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.340
biology corporation and ordered a couple

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.710
of cow brains so the molds we make today

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.840
are 100-percent legitimate brain.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.899
And I had to get them online because apparently cow

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.570
brains are regulated by the FDA. So let's

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.380
open this thing up and see what they look like.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.620
there we go. Okay.  We're seeing this,

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.549
together, for the first time.

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.140
Apparently there's two cow brains in

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.560
there which is ridiculously small. I mean

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.479
this package of two cow brains right now

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.729
is smaller than one of the VAT 19 gummy

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.650
brains by themselves. The difference is,

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.170
these are legitimate brains so let's open

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.220
the bag up to take a closer look.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.260
Yummy.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.860
Oh, yeah. That's the stuff. Right there

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.660
So, same process as last time:  I'm gonna cut this

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.289
bag open we're gonna wash these brains

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:36.740
off, and then we're going to take a closer look,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.700
maybe do a little surgery to get them

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.640
prepped and ready for our silicon mold.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.579
So yeah, these brains are a little bit smaller than the

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:44.079
VAT 19, but they're a little more

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.000
appropriate for serving size as well.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.800
[laughs quietly]

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.759
Admittedly, I don't know much about how

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:49.869
the brain works, so I did a quick google

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.729
search and this is what i learned this

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.140
outer layer covering the brain is

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.849
probably part of the meninges, and this

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:56.619
skin we're looking at is part of the peel

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.689
layer. This acts is an envelope to

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.009
protect the brain and the spinal cord.

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.450
That almost sounds like I know what I'm

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.659
talking about. How does the brain feel? It's a

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.840
little bit spongy, it's firm I feel like

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.160
if I push it too hard though I could

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.320
squish it. It almost feels like gummy.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.340
It actually feels a lot like gummy.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.880
It actually looks so delicate, that if I

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.690
just took my fingers and tugged a little

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.359
bit I think it would slip right off now

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:21.160
this layer here –

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.069
Oh yeah – Now that's actually a lot

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.629
tougher than I was expecting.

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.069
I thought this was just slide right off,

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.989
but it's actually a really hard skin.

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.459
It rips. I'm gonna get my scalpel. My exacto

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.609
knife scalpel. [imitates "shing" sound] Oh wow. Look in here.

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.739
there's some kind of brown fuzz – brown

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.709
fiber. That is really interesting

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.840
it's like going down between the layers

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.130
of brain now and in the center here, it's kind of

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.519
spiney. It's really hard –

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.490
Use what you got.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.420
There's chunks of brain flying out everywhere.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.770
That's pretty tough there. That's like

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.320
snipping a cable. Use my electrical - (unintelligible) - for that. [tools scrape]

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.400
There we go. This is coming off a little bit easier now.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.660
is this considered brain surgery, if I don't put

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.730
it back together.  While we're here looking at

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.830
this, let's take a quick look at this

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.670
brain. So, I imagine what we have over

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.960
here is the brain stem... some kind of a... Oh!

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.340
You know what these things are that's

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.270
from the eyeballs. Oh wow. So all this

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.790
fatty stuff is where the eyeballs would

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.500
have sat. So here's the cow's head, the

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.390
brain, and the eyeballs facing forward–

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.860
which would probably make these the

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.980
frontal lobes, the temporal lobes, and

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.480
then back here is the brain stem, which would lead to the spinal cord.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.020
That's not disgusting at all, is it?

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.420
Before I get too far in here, probably better to chop off

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.200
these eyeballs.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.400
[laughing] Ew.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.120
That's one of the optical nerves that

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.470
would lead to the eyeball, yeah. Actually

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.810
look how thick that optical nerve is.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.840
I didn't realize that it was that big. Very

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.460
interesting, and instead of seeing a

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.530
bunch of electrical cables like you'd see inside a

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.310
copper wire or something, it's just... some kind of mush...

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.480
some kind of matter. Very spongy, Very cool. I feel like I should be wearing a face mask.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.920
Ok so that's opening up. That's good. Oh

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.420
yeah, this is actually encouraging. So,

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.240
looking down inside here you can see

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.100
between those two pieces of brain, and

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.600
it's looking a little more encouraging.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.030
I'm not sure what that piece is that

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.710
looks interesting, but it looks like I

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.630
can cut it away and I'm actually

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.130
interested in these two halves of the

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.900
brain here. But, now it's starting to look

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.120
a little bit more like a brain here as

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.350
we get this peeled away.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.580
We've just got to find a way to disconnect

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.410
this last bit i think we're in business.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.830
Oh wow, this just slides right apart

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.860
that was easy.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.300
I thought that was going to be super

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.919
tough and super thick to get through, but that was super easy. And there

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.500
have it. There's our first brain reveal.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.700
Oh no. There's even another layer here

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.520
so this must be the peel layer. That pulls

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.110
right away and now we get all those

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.060
little cracks and crevices and make the

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.379
brain look like the brain. Looks like saran wrap, sucked right down in there.

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:21.180
But here's the difference so this one

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.099
has a very very fine layer of membrane

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:24.659
over it which I think is the peel layer, and

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:26.460
over here you can see we've removed that

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.810
and you can look right down all those

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.449
cracks and crevices and maybe even like

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:32.189
gently separate them if you needed to.

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:34.710
This stuff is really soft and mushy. I'm

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:35.849
worried about pushing it too hard

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:38.069
because, you can see, it just turns right

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:39.000
into mush.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.069
Ok. Now, we got this layer here that forms a

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:45.449
nice little envelope all around the

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.060
brain and try to gently remove this one

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.620
because it looks to be in better tact than

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.120
our first brain was. What I realize about this is

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.680
that if there ever was a zombie apocalypse

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.139
they're gonna have a hard time actually

00:05:58.139 --> 00:05:59.490
getting to your brain,

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.520
these are not easy. Ooh, look at this. We've

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.889
actually preserved quite a bit of it

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:07.560
there we go i think for best results

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.409
like more of that skin-y stuff we can get off

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:11.669
the better that this is going to work

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:13.919
because the silicone can seep down into those

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:17.129
grooves a little bit better. It's kinda like after you get a sunburn and

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:20.580
your skin starts peeling [laughs] kinda what that reminds me of.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.770
and that's the stuff looks

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.889
like after it's been removed. I would not trust

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:29.819
myself to do real brain surgery. [laughs] It's too bad they did

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:31.229
such a hack job when they sent me these

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:32.729
things. I was hoping maybe a little more

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:34.199
plump, and a little bit better condition

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:37.349
but that's what we've got guys. Two genuine cow

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:39.599
brains and the thing that strikes me is

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:41.009
how small they are.

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:42.449
I would have thought a brain would be

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:43.620
quite a bit bigger than that

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.940
but that's what we're looking at just a

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.850
nice little fist full of cow brain. So,

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.340
kind of creepy, kind of disgusting, kind

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.260
of educational, but in any case I think

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:53.729
this is about as good as we're gonna get

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:55.350
them. So, let's go find ourself some plastic

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.540
containers, mix up some silicone, and cast

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.889
ourselves some new rubber molds.

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:07.620
[music plays]

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.580
[thunk]

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.200
[music continues]

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.700
[air hisses]

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:27.280
[music continues]

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.380
alright so, quick update, guys. So what

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.550
actually happened when we poured the

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.530
first silicon mold, is our brain started

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.780
floating up in the silicon, and floated

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.220
right to the top, and we can't have that.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.560
So we took the other brain, we held it in

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.480
place with a screw from the bottom and

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.770
we took all the silicon from the one

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.750
container and poured it over the second

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.400
brain. So now we have mixed up a second

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.930
batch, we've secured the second brain,

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.870
and we're pouring that as well. Who knew brains

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.140
float in silicone. So, if you try this yourself

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.160
make sure you secure it before you start pouring

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:59.900
[Music plays]

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.180
there you have it guys. Once

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.890
again we made a terrible mess and you

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.510
pretty much know the routine by now.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:06.370
These things are going to need 24 hours to

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.260
cure. Now I took a little of the excess

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.060
silicone and poured over top of the actual

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.340
Vat 19 gummy brain as well, and I'm thinking

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.660
that will give us a skin that we could

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.950
use to probably clone more of those

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.050
gummies in the future as well, if we want to

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:18.970
go with bigger brains. Now, I'm really curious to

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:20.530
see how these molds out because, if they

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.480
turn out ok, I'm thinking about taking

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.030
green and purple gummi and making edible

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.710
zombie brains. What do you think about that?

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.870
and I've still got that other Vat 19 gummy

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.280
brain that still in its wrapper. I'm

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.540
going to give it to one of you and I'm

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:32.890
gonna give it away in my Instagram

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.360
stories. So click the link in the

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.680
description to follow me on instagram

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.479
and look for the secret clue coming in

00:08:37.479 --> 00:08:39.220
the next few days and thanks again to

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.290
HorseyTube for requesting this experiment in

00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:43.060
the comments keep an eye on your youtube

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.550
inbox, I'll be sending 25 bucks. Hey, thanks

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:46.690
for joining me for this video guys! It

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:48.100
was one we had to put our brains

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.840
into. I'll be looking for you in the

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.170
next video, talk to you then. We're gonna make a zombie

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:54.880
brain! That's it! We're gonna make a

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.480
zombie brain.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.180

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:07.020
