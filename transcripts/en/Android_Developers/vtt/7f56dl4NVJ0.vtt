[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.150
Hi.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.260
My name is Daniel Pham,
and welcome to "This Week

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.130
in Android Development" for
Monday, November 18, 2013.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.352
Both Reto Meier and not Reto
Meier are indisposed this week,

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:20.060
so I'll be taking the
reins and providing

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.130
your weekly dose
of updates today.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.500
Last week, Neto Marin
released another "DevByte"

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.600
in Portuguese.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.450
Our faithful teammates presented
various talks at Devoxx

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.910
in Belgium, and Reto graced
AnDevCon in San Francisco

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.340
with the keynote
speech delivered

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.800
in his charming, natural
New Zealander accent.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.280
This week, "Game On!"
is back from hiatus.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.780
Todd returns from
his short stint

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.150
working on top secret
projects to celebrate

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.090
the half birthday of Play Games.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.400
In app update news, Pandora's
got a fresh tablet UI

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.940
with Chromecast integration,
while Ski Safari

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.520
has updated to
include Play Games

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.347
integration, Leaderboards,
and Cloud Sync.

00:00:55.347 --> 00:00:57.430
That's all for "This Week
in Android Development."

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.310
Be sure to check out
our shows this week.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.410
I'm Daniel Pham, and that kind
of luxe just ain't for us.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.304
We crave a different
kind of buzz.
