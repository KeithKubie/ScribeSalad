take a deeper look at Colin Colin was

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190
take a deeper look at Colin Colin was
 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.220
take a deeper look at Colin Colin was
different Colin felt like it was

different Colin felt like it was
 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.470
different Colin felt like it was
exciting it was fun it like made us much

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480
exciting it was fun it like made us much
 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.360

happier to work with when we heard the

happier to work with when we heard the
 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.220

was gonna be a first class language we
 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.420
was gonna be a first class language we
were super excited we knew that that

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430
were super excited we knew that that
 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.670
were super excited we knew that that
meant for us better support for the

meant for us better support for the
 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.110
meant for us better support for the
tooling and everything was kind of

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120
tooling and everything was kind of
 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.189
tooling and everything was kind of
getting it better for cob

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199

first and foremost both times they were
 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.240
first and foremost both times they were
absolutely insane when we first started

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250
absolutely insane when we first started
 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.400

using it it was to the point where we

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410
using it it was to the point where we
 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.680
using it it was to the point where we
decided to port our entire build system

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690
decided to port our entire build system
 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.380

it's been really fun to see how all of

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390
it's been really fun to see how all of
 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.359
it's been really fun to see how all of
those pain points early on have kind of

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369
those pain points early on have kind of
 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.340
those pain points early on have kind of
dissipated and now the build times are

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350
dissipated and now the build times are
 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.480
dissipated and now the build times are

of other developers one of the things

of other developers one of the things
 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.210
of other developers one of the things
that we were surprised about is how easy

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.649
code base one of the things that one of
my co-workers did was pull a graph of

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659
my co-workers did was pull a graph of
 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.870

support and use of Kotlin in the
 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.120
support and use of Kotlin in the
development community means that there's

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130
development community means that there's
 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.780

using Catlin and Expedia has helped us

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270
using Catlin and Expedia has helped us
 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.179
using Catlin and Expedia has helped us
to write more succinct and easier to

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189
to write more succinct and easier to
 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.310
to write more succinct and easier to
read code it also helps make our

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320
read code it also helps make our
 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.010
read code it also helps make our
developers a lot have

now that the language is stabilized well

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060
now that the language is stabilized well
 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.359
now that the language is stabilized well
much happier using cotton for what we do

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369
much happier using cotton for what we do
 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.610
much happier using cotton for what we do
it's also helped guide us into writing

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620
it's also helped guide us into writing
 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.810
it's also helped guide us into writing
better code and making sure we're

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820
better code and making sure we're
 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.300
better code and making sure we're
avoiding null pointer problems the one

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310
avoiding null pointer problems the one
 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.220
avoiding null pointer problems the one
thing that we can measure is that the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230
thing that we can measure is that the
 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.050
thing that we can measure is that the
code is certainly more concise and clear

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060
code is certainly more concise and clear
 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.210
code is certainly more concise and clear
and so we're writing less code overall

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220
and so we're writing less code overall
 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.010
and so we're writing less code overall
so I would say that we write somewhere

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020
so I would say that we write somewhere
 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.080
so I would say that we write somewhere
between 15 to 25 percent less code

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090
between 15 to 25 percent less code
 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.300
between 15 to 25 percent less code
overall than we would with Java the

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310
overall than we would with Java the
 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.800
overall than we would with Java the
biggest thing is that it's made us

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810
biggest thing is that it's made us
 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.570
biggest thing is that it's made us
really happy toward it it's really fun

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580
really happy toward it it's really fun
 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.060
really happy toward it it's really fun
and interesting exciting to work with it

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070
and interesting exciting to work with it
 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.130
and interesting exciting to work with it
and it's just not something we've ever

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140
and it's just not something we've ever
 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.570
and it's just not something we've ever
felt with other languages and I've

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580
felt with other languages and I've
 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.860
felt with other languages and I've
certainly never felt that with another

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870
certainly never felt that with another
 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.930
certainly never felt that with another
language it's exciting to see how

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940
language it's exciting to see how

quickly the developer community has been
 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.620
quickly the developer community has been
adopting common we're just starting to
