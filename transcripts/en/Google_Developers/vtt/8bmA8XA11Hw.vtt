Hi. My name is Magnus. I work for the
Google Drive team.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.060
We're going to look at the Google Drive
integration for the ASUS PadFone device

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.020
which allows you to search in Google
Drive and it also incorporates the Realtime API.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.030
Let's have a look.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.880
In my opinion, the Google Drive API provides the most basic function of all: Search.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.230
And the most basic function, Search, is what Google does best.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.339
At a time when more and more data is in the cloud,
I still think that Search is the easiest

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.229
and most intuitive function to use.
It also offers the ability to upload whole folders.

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:10.550
This may seem like something basic,

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.390
but not every cloud service has this function.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.450
Google Drive also provides a Realtime API

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.650
that makes it easy for our design team

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.320
to facilitate collaboration,

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.390
allowing many individuals to edit a single document simultaneously.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.729
For me, Google Drive is more like a cloud integration service system

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.180
than an ordinary cloud storage service.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.610
Before I give you the reasons why we choose 
Google Drive to co-operate with,

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.619
let me share with you our criteria for choosing 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.440
components and partners from a product
manager point of view.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.060
There are three criteria, number one is quality.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.770
For every component that goes
into the device,

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.190
it should be of high and premium quality
no matter if it's the CPU,

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.429
the chipset, the software, the firmware

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.830
or the services. These should all be

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.840
of high quality. So we choose Google
Drive

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.160
for its most important trait: quality.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.470
The second part is the ease of use.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.170
It is very important

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.620
for us to think and to act like a user.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.280
The integration of Gmail,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.410
calendar, Picasa and all

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.959
other Google services really gives the user

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.910
true benefit and it is very user
friendly. So we choose

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.940
Google Drive for the second reason,
user-friendliness. Now comes the third part.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:52.120
When we make any device, we want to have
innovation. In ASUS we always are thinking about

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.330
what other, better way there is to finish

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.510
the daily tasks of ordinary people,
how a device can help people.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.510
So, PadFone together with Google Drive

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.580
means you can have a very easy way

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.730
of finishing almost 99% of

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.080
what you do on the web or on the go.
