00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.170
The world's first 3D photo printing booth
gives you the chance to become your own action

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.170
figure.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.750
And Los Angeles proudly presents $500 caviar
from a vending machine!

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.600
VSauce, Kevin here.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.080
This is Mind Blow.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.710
A graduate from Design Academy Eindhoven created
a set of cutlery designed to stimulate more

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.010
than just your sense of taste.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.870
Synesthesia is a nuerological condition in
which different stimuli such as touch, taste,

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.129
and hearing are affected and triggered by
each other.

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:41.079
The different pieces explore the effects of
color and various textures on the senses.

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.949
Red colors are supposed to increase the appetite,
and various textures and shapes are intended

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.569
to stimulate the sense of touch inside the
mouth with the intention of enriching the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:52.320
eating experience.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.039
Scientists at MIT have created a tiny transformer.

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.729
the Milli-Motein is a re-configurable robot
that can be programmed to fold itself into

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:03.089
a number of different shapes.

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.190
Another breakthrough with this robot is that
after it has shifted into a new shape, it

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.770
can hold that shape, even when its power is
cut off by using what they call an "electro-permanent

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:13.770
motor."

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.060
They do say that there would need to be a
lot of research, as well as cheaper, more

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.460
durable parts before a real-life transformer
is created.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.290
Ski Dome Denmark is a vison of the world's
biggest ski-dome in the city of Randers, Denmark.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.820
Designed by a Danish architecture firm, the
proposal includes over 3 KM of indoor and

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.100
outdoor slopes, a freestyle park, hotel, restaurant,
and shops.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.789
Resembling a snowflake, the structure consists
of 3 centrally connected arches that each

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.119
span the river.

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.569
Each arch also uses its roof exterior to connect
the city beyond skiing, such as the bottom

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:54.939
arch having a rooftop of green landscaping
that would function as a raised city park.

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:58.420
Who's hungry for a solid chocolate baby head??

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.119
Speaking of chocolate, Cadbury invented its
own melt-resistant chocolate that stays solid

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.909
even when left at 104 degrees Fahrenheit for
3 hours!

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.319
And it has to do with breaking the sugar particles
into smaller pieces, reducing the amount of

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.430
fat covering them, making it more resistant
to heat.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.940
The C-Explorer 5 aims to give people a chance
to finally own a luxury submarine.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.330
For 2.4 million dollars you get seating for
5, air conditioning, an audio system, LED

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.060
lighting, and enough air, food, and water
for up to 96 hours in the off-chance you lose

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.060
power.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.790
Made by U-Boat Worx, their website boasts
that it's the world's first sub-sea limousine,

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.210
and features a 360 degree acrylic pressure
hole so everyone has a view.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.689
The first ever picture of tightly-packed chords
of DNA taken with an electron microscope.

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:57.019
Litographs is bringing books back to the physical
world by printing them on T-shirts.

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.010
The first 4 designs are Alice's Adventure
in Wonderland, On the Origin of Species, The

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.110
Great Gatsby, and Moby Dick.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.019
The shirts contain all, or most of the book
depending on the size, and the text is completely

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.019
legible.

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.459
They've already exceded their Kickstarter
goal, check out the website for more.

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.750
Created in Japan, the BFS-Auto can read books
at 250 pages per minute, which equates to

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.879
an Oxford dictionary in just 10 minutes, or
an entire 32-volume set of Encyclopedia Britannica

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:27.209
in about 2 hours.

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.579
It achieves high-definition resolution at
400 pixels per inch, and can compensate for

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.689
the three-dimensional deformation of the paper
while being flipped, giving it the ability

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:39.920
to scan thousands of books quickly without
damaging them.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.329
Basically, it's like Johnny 5 from Short Circuit.

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.400
Finally, here's a video from M-I-E called
Jammed about the demise of the audio-casette

00:03:47.400 --> 00:04:20.900
in the story of a view-master robot venturing
into an unknown world.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.410
I'm gonna leave you with with Disney's prototype
of a humanoid robot playing catch, and, as

00:04:26.410 --> 00:05:20.669
always, thanks for watching.
