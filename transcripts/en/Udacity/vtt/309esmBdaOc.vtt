To optimize the CSSOM construction we want to remove

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.500
unnecessary styles, minify, compress and cache it. Is that right?

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.960
&gt;&gt; Yep, those are all good ones, but if I remember correctly, I think when you

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.300
run PHP on your site it also recommended that we look in to render blocking CSS.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.330
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah. What's that about?

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.940
&gt;&gt; Well, let's take a look. Let's say we have

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.460
a simple page with one CSS file. The browser downloads

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.850
the HTML, and then this covers and fetches the CSS. What is

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.010
the earliest point where the browser could paint the page? Is it

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.650
a, once the browser has built a DOM? Or ist it B,

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.720
once the Browser has downloaded the CSS and built the CSS object model?
