00:00:01.037 --> 00:00:03.735
PROBLEM: What was the translation applied to move

00:00:03.735 --> 00:00:07.353
the blue solid shape to the orange dashed shape?

00:00:07.353 --> 00:00:11.853
So if you were to start with this blue solid shape,

00:00:11.853 --> 00:00:13.567
and you wanted to shift it

00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:15.486
to where the orange dotted shape is,

00:00:15.486 --> 00:00:16.751
how would you do that?

00:00:16.751 --> 00:00:17.938
And the way that I like to think about it

00:00:17.938 --> 00:00:19.291
is to just pick a point,

00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:22.681
and see what had to happen to that point.

00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:24.794
So this point at the top of this – I guess –

00:00:24.794 --> 00:00:26.325
this quadrilateral-looking thing,

00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:27.659
it moved down here.

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:29.601
So it moved one to the left.

00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:31.951
And it moved one down.

00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:33.600
So we can denote that with a transformation.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.788
Moving one to the left is negative one (-1)

00:00:35.788 --> 00:00:37.186
in the horizontal direction.

00:00:37.186 --> 00:00:37.946
If we were moving to the right,

00:00:37.946 --> 00:00:39.456
it would have been a positive one (+1).

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:42.497
And we moved one down, in the vertical direction.

00:00:42.497 --> 00:00:45.050
And that is another negative one (-1).
