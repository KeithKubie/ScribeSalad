00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.040
Usually there’s an instinct, an idea, and
when the instinct resonates between the three

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.580
of us, then we feel like we need to make it
to bring it to life.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.369
And each time it comes to life, it depends
who’s guiding this instinct to come to life.

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.750
So whether its a pattern who’s guiding it,
whether it’s one of us who’s guiding it,

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.190
whether it’s a textile, or a technology,
that dictates how this idea is going to come

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.060
to life.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.980
Lovely smell.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.610
By being involved in all kinds of intricate
geometry, it required us to go further and

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.989
further into means of expressing that geometry.

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:58.710
So that led us directly into 3D printing because
that enabled us to express exact geometry.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.140
I met Gabi, Adi, and Angie through a mutual
friend, probably Rothenburg, who had been

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.630
doing some of the earlier work with him.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.500
Some earlier textile work.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.430
I had been kind of exploring pattering systems
as it relates to architecture, and how you

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.659
kind of tile space.

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:22.040
I have always been interested in how you could
do similar things in different design disciplines.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.970
Fashion, I think in particular.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.000
And when I kind of first met threeASFOUR and
I was exposed to their work, I was struck

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.229
by how they are exploring a similar thing,
mainly geometry and how you can kind of wrap

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.270
a form in it, or wrap a human body in it,
in this case.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.540
They had a relationship with Stratasys, the
3D printing company, to do a dress, kind of

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.650
sponsoring the fabrication of the dress.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.579
So when we started, the project was to do
a single piece, one dress form.

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:04.119
The most natural way for us to work is to
pick a silhouette that we’ve done before

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.159
and build on that.

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.770
In many cases, it may change.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.290
In this case, it’s a very classic threeASFOUR
cut.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:22.020
We basically scanned a person in real life
wearing the dress, and then we had the base

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.520
silhouette to work from.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.240
We did play with the Z-axis off of that dress.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.680
Because you’re printing it, you’re able
to add thickness to the surface.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.230
So in some parts, like especially the shoulders,
it gets bigger in certain areas and we had

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.200
to kind of, back and forth design the overall
silhouette.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.000
In fashion, function in a geometric case,
is really about the movement of the human

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.980
body, and how you are articulating that, and
working with it.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.489
And I think all of the pieces are definitely
exploring that and interested in that.

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.099
How you can take a patterning system and apply
it across the body, and make it change, and

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:13.390
transform based on the body, and on the ergonomics
of the body, and how the person is moving.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.440
These are the shoulders.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.360
One, two.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.750
That’s the chest.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.220
See?

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.360
These are the back pieces here, and here.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.390
So they’re center-back here.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.700
This is the bottom-back, so that’s your
butt, here and here.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.840
The moment you create a three-dimensional
weave, you start thinking about movement in

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.360
3D— three directions.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.159
So instead of a fabric that’s stretching
on the XY-plane, you have a fabric that is

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:52.890
stretching on the Z-plane.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:00.860
So XYZ becomes much more agile, and much more,
how do you say, true to your anatomy type

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:01.860
of movement.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.290
So the fabric will be able to emulate anatomy,
movement, much more directly.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.340
How you use technology to reinterpret old
ideas is an important thing.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.049
There is a lot of different technologies and
machines to work with.

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:26.350
So the exact dimensional constraints you have
to work with in are different for every technology.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:32.330
The specific material constraints, like how
thin I can go until it breaks, are very different

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.360
for each technology.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.390
So some of the dresses, like ‘Oscillation’
for example, was all printed as flat pieces.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.650
And it was printed in a rubber-like material,
so we can bend it into shape.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:50.740
It’s really a textile design process, because
you’re printing out the pattern pieces as

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.720
geometric swatches, in a way.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.100
And you have to know that when you sew that
all together, it takes on a three-dimensional

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.100
shape.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:05.190
My role in the 3D-printing and division of
threeASFOUR is the ‘manos’ and the machine

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.190
art part.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.130
I’m the one, once those babies come out
of the box, and we have to clean them with

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.980
a toothbrush, and then lay them out like a
piece of puzzle.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:21.670
Make sure everything is correct, and then
try to come in and figure out how to attach

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:28.760
the babies onto something that is like a layer
approximate to human skin, you know?

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.940
But hold it all together.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.880
Which is usually like a mesh body, shell,
underneath.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.190
And in this case, I use fishing wire.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.490
Hold them all into place, you know, because
some pieces that are obviously— as you can

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.590
see here, are on the heavier side.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:49.570
Really thick and blending into something intricate,
and skinny, and soft.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.460
The contradiction between both materials,
which is actually the same material, it’s

00:05:53.460 --> 00:06:01.410
just through the variation of thickness, it’s
like David and Goliath fighting with each

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.880
other actually, when they are put next to
each other, you know?

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.500
The whole process is a lot of back and forth
between analog and digital processes.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.290
So whether we’re playing with paper dolls,
scanning that into the computer.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.600
Or scanning a paper dress on a person, that
goes into the computer.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:25.530
We digitally test it, print some swatches,
maybe print a whole piece, but along the way,

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.840
you are always communicating between different
mediums.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.500
You know we’re not the first ones to be
doing 3D printing.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.120
But we felt that we wanted to approach it
the same way that we’ve been approaching

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.560
fabric manipulation— textiles.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:48.060
So we wanted to see 3D printing as a tool
to evolve textile making into many steps ahead.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.440
To be honest, I think in general, mankind
is not really ready for anything that experimental

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.440
yet.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.000
It’s way too out there for the general public.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.310
But you always need, you know, the pioneers
to take it there so it becomes the norm.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:08.660
You have to be honest and say that the technology
is very far from a point where we’ll readily

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.910
be producing consumer-friendly 3D printed
clothes.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.500
The need for textiles is like one of the most
basic human needs.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.720
And I mean, we’re always going to need them.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:26.860
It’s like how does the tool allow us to
interpret what those are, what a textile is.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.630
Like one of the most ancient human things
out there.
