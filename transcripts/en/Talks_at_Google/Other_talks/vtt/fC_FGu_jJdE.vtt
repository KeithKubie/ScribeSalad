Please welcome Alexandra Schwartz.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:11.870
[applause]

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.120
&gt;&gt;Alexandra: Thanks, Chris. It's really a
pleasure to be here, and thank all of you

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.380
for coming. Is anyone already familiar with
Ed Ruscha's work? Any fans? Well, I'll tell

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.820
you a little bit about him. He's an LA-based
artist. He actually works right down the road

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.759
in Venice. He has a studio there. And he's
been around since the early 1960s. He came

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:39.009
up with the pop artists -- people like Andy
Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, who some of you may

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.200
be familiar with.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.390
But he really was one of the first LA-based
artists to make it big during that time in

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.200
the 60s, and he showed with a gallery called
the Ferus Gallery, which was on La Cienega

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.659
Boulevard, along with other artists like Joe
Goode, Billy Al Bengston, and they formed

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.490
an avant-garde community in LA, really for
the first time. There hadn't been sort of

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.530
a set group in LA before then, and Ruscha
was really the most successful of this group.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.240
He's shown internationally, beginning in the
60s up to now. And now he really has a reputation

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.012
as being one of the key artists of his generation.
So, there's a lot of his work at the LA County

00:02:23.012 --> 00:02:29.500
Museum and the LA MOCA, The Museum of Modern
Art, where I work -- he really is all over

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.680
the place. He was the representative to the
Venice Biennale a couple of years ago.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.190
So, it's particularly timely to talk about
him now, I thought, and what I'm gonna focus

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.880
on today is the relationship he had with Dennis
Hopper, who I'm sure a lot of you know he

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.330
just died a few weeks ago, and there's a show
of his work opening at MOCA on Sunday. So,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:59.220
I hope you all go check it out, and this presentation
that I'm gonna give today, I adapted for the

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.540
catalog essay for the Dennis Hopper show at
MOCA. So, you can also check that out.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.320
But something that was really interesting
about Ruscha is that he was one of the first

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:16.050
artists to forge a relationship with his contemporaries
in Hollywood. Of course, so much art goes

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.930
on in LA, especially now in terms of visual
arts, but at the time there wasn't that much.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:29.050
Really, the creative output coming out of
LA was mostly through film. And Ruscha was

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.470
in a really unique position in that he had
one foot in the visual art world and one foot

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.620
in Hollywood. So, what you're seeing here
is a 1962 painting called Large Trademark

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.390
with Eight Spotlights. It's a really large
work; it's about 11 feet long. It's in the

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:51.180
collection of the Whitney Museum in New York,
and this was one of Ruscha's first big examinations

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.960
of Hollywood, so, of course, you recognize
what this is.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.280
It's the 20th Century Fox logo that you still
see at the beginning of any 20th Century Fox

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.690
film. And it was part of a series of works
that he was doing at the time dealing with

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:12.120
words -- especially logos, things that you
find in everyday objects. So, this work is

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:19.349
called Actual Size. It's about SPAM, which,
of course, we all know. You see a little SPAM

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:24.889
can floating through space down at the bottom
and then the big logo, SPAM, at the top. And

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.260
then Annie, from right around the same time,
1962-63, recognizable from the logo for Little

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.270
Orphan Annie, the comic strip that would've
been especially well-known at the time. So,

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:39.560
Ruscha was doing a series of works in which
he was looking at just things that we see

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.539
every day. If he were doing these now, he'd
probably do a Google sign as well.

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.870
But this was particularly pointed because
he was interested in Hollywood, interested

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.500
in kind of how Hollywood operated, and what
it meant in American culture at the time.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.530
He was taking it straight from the logo, so
we're used to seeing the logo with this sort

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:07.389
of drum and trumpet fanfare, and that's just
a screen shot from what the logo looked like

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:12.400
in the early 60s. But he's changing it. He's
making it a lot simpler -- he's turning it

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.349
into something static instead of something
moving. So, the time when he was doing this

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:23.969
was a really interesting time in Hollywood.
It was the period in the 60s into the early

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:30.509
70s when Hollywood was changing a lot. It
was going from the kind of big studio productions,

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:38.610
like Doctor Dolittle, kind of these very elaborate,
very sort of unnaturalistic works to this

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.520
period that came to be known as "The New Hollywood."
So, I brought a bunch of posters up here from

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.590
some of the most important new Hollywood films,
which I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:54.050
So, The Graduate was one of the first, Bonnie
and Clyde, Easy Rider, which of course, Dennis

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.949
Hopper directed and starred in -- I'll be
talking about that more in a second -- The

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:04.490
Godfather, etc. So, during this time, Hollywood
was realizing, you know it's the late 60s,

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.150
there's a big counter-culture movement and
hippie movement and it was, they were starting

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.960
to realize that they had to incorporate some
of that youth culture into the studio movies

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:21.520
that they were producing. So a lot of young
directors came up -- people like Mike Nichols,

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.650
Martin Scorsese, etc. So, this was happening
at the same time that Ruscha was working as

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:34.659
a visual artist, as a painter in LA. And,
in fact, there had for a while been a sort

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:40.370
of group of people, artists and young Hollywood
types, who were all meeting together and discussing

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:46.879
ideas. They particularly met around an artist
named Wallace Berman, who lived in LA from

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:54.719
the 50s through the 60s, and he had a kind
of group at his house, a salon, where artists

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:59.150
and also Hollywood figures would come and
hang out. One of his biggest fans and closest

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:05.849
friends was James Dean, so this was right
around the time that James Dean was working.

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:11.080
And then Dennis Hopper came to this group
as well, and eventually, Ruscha. Berman was

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.830
an artist in his own right, so what you're
seeing on the left are a bunch of works that

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:21.590
he did in the late 50s into the 60s. He had
a journal called Semina, which was almost

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.810
a precursor to a zine.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:30.240
It was very cheaply done. He'd do a lot of
collage -- cutting up bits of magazines, movie

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.990
magazines, that kind of thing -- and then
distributing it. And he was also a filmmaker.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:41.740
And what you're seeing on the right is a still
from a film called Aleph, which he did in

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:47.849
the late 50s, that incorporated the same kind
of found imagery with some texts, specifically

00:07:47.849 --> 00:07:55.210
Hebrew text, that he was very interested in.
So, Berman was doing his own work, but also

00:07:55.210 --> 00:08:00.909
bringing together musicians, poets, painters,
people like Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the poet,

00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:07.099
would come through, Jay DeFeo, a painter from
San Francisco. And so, what people said is

00:08:07.099 --> 00:08:10.979
that everyone just came and hung out at Wallace
Berman's house, and you never knew what was

00:08:10.979 --> 00:08:15.960
gonna go on, but it was it this very creative,
very interesting kind of atmosphere.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:22.580
So, one of the most prominent Hollywood figures
to come through Wallace's Bermans, Wallace

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:30.590
Berman's house was Dennis Hopper. I know there's
been a lot of discussion about him in the

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:36.260
paper recently because, of course, he sadly
just died. But at this time he had already

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.909
starred in Rebel Without a Cause in the mid-50s.
He had started on a film career, but he got

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:45.940
blackballed from Hollywood. He kind of misbehaved
on the set of one of his films, and the director,

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:50.699
Henry Hathaway, said, "You'll never work in
this town again." And he basically didn't

00:08:50.699 --> 00:08:55.610
for about eight years, but at the same time
he was really interested in visual art.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:09:00.230
He had been making photography since he was
a teenager. He was painting; he was making

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:07.870
sculptures. This is an example of a sculpture
he did with the artist, Marcel Duchamp. Duchamp

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:14.060
had a show at the Pasadena Art Museum, which
is now the Norton Simon, and during the opening

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:20.100
dinner they stole the sign from the hotel,
and they kind of decided it was a work of

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:24.180
art -- a ready-made work of art. And they
both signed it -- so this is signed by Duchamp

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:30.240
and by Dennis Hopper. So, Hopper, because
he couldn't work in film, he wanted to be

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.660
working creatively. He was very passionate
about the visual art scene in LA, so he focused

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:42.860
on that. And he got to know people like Ruscha,
other artists at the time. This is a really

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.940
great photograph from this period. This was
at the sculptor, Claes Oldenburg's wedding,

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:52.639
I'm sorry, these were done by Claes Oldenburg.
It was at a curator named Jim Elliot's wedding

00:09:52.639 --> 00:09:58.459
down by the Santa Monica Pier. And what these
are are plaster sculptures of slices of wedding

00:09:58.459 --> 00:09:59.459
cake.

00:09:59.459 --> 00:10:04.319
This is a photograph that Hopper took. So,
as kind of a present to this couple, Oldenburg

00:10:04.319 --> 00:10:09.760
made all these plaster wedding cake sculptures,
and Hopper told me that at the end, he and

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.970
his wife went and gathered up a bunch of these
slices that people had left, and they made

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:18.639
themselves a wedding cake sculpture that became
part of their collection. So, it really gives

00:10:18.639 --> 00:10:23.899
you a sense that it was this incredibly creative
time during this period. People were having

00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:28.529
these sort of crazy events all over the city,
like at the Santa Monica Pier.

00:10:28.529 --> 00:10:34.600
At the same time, Hopper was also making his
own work. This is a work called After the

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:42.440
Fall from 1961 to 64. And what it is is a
photograph. Hopper was very active as a photographer

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:46.319
and it's of posters on a wall, so they had
been kind of stripped away so you're seeing

00:10:46.319 --> 00:10:52.290
different layers of posters that have been
plastered down. And it's of this girl whose

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:56.750
eyes have been sort of obscured. You can tell
maybe it was a movie poster, but it's been

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:03.310
all ripped up and then he added found elements
to it. So, what you're seeing here, those

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:08.060
are Kleenex boxes. So, the kind of covers
you put on a Kleenex box, which he's attached

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:12.900
to the edge of it. So, it does it, it's got
this kind of surreal juxtaposition of elements

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:17.089
that shouldn't be together, but he was putting
them together and this was very new for what

00:11:17.089 --> 00:11:19.350
was happening in art at the time.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:24.300
That shows a view of the original photograph,
and then the photograph with the sculptural

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:30.670
found objects on top of it. At the same time
that Hopper was making this kind of work,

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:37.250
he was also really active as almost a photojournalist.
He was fascinated by what was happening at

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:44.170
the time politically; of course it was a really
tumultuous period, the mid-60s. And he was

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:50.920
going to a lot of political events and capturing
them. So, what you're seeing here are pictures

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:55.769
from the Selma to Montgomery march, led my
Martin Luther King. And I interviewed Hopper

00:11:55.769 --> 00:12:00.670
a few years ago when, before he got sick,
and he told me that he was just kind of hanging

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:05.540
around and Marlon Brando drove up to him in
his car and he's like, "Hey, you wanna go

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:10.889
to Selma?" And Hopper was like, "Yeah, sure,
let's go." So they went. And he took these

00:12:10.889 --> 00:12:14.410
really incredible photographs of, of course,
this really key time in American history.

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:21.610
So, it's something that's not very well known
about Hopper that he was, he considered himself

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:29.570
a historian in a way. He wanted to capture
what was going on at the time. I'm just comparing

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:34.699
these two. The bottom here is a photograph
by Robert Frank, one of the most prominent

00:12:34.699 --> 00:12:39.580
photographers of the 1950s. He did a book
called The Americans, which some of you may

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.580
know.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:45.149
But it just kind of shows what Hopper was
looking at when he did this top photograph

00:12:45.149 --> 00:12:49.870
from Selma. He was thinking about Robert Frank
and really thinking as a very serious artist.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:54.060
He wasn't just dabbling in this; he was very
passionate about it. And all of these will

00:12:54.060 --> 00:13:07.600
be on view at MOCA, starting on Sunday, so
you guys should check them out. He was also,

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.319
I'm sorry about this slide. I don't know what
happened there, but he was also photographing

00:13:09.319 --> 00:13:11.260
the LA art scene. So, he would photograph
his friends and he was very intentional about

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.389
it. He wanted to photograph people who he
thought would have big careers.

00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:17.040
He kind of wanted to be the documenter of
these people's careers; so sadly, this photograph

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:22.180
that didn't come out very well in the presentation.
It's of the artist, Bruce Conner, and this

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:32.660
woman is Teri Garr. I don't know if you guys
remember her from a lot of 80s movies, but

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:38.089
she was involved with the art scene at the
time. And on the left is Toni Basil, "Hey

00:13:38.089 --> 00:13:41.230
Mickey", from the 80s.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:58.670
So, they were all part of this group and kind
of working with each other, collaborating

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:00.980
on each other's things, and then on the right
is just kind of a funny photograph of Billy

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:01.980
Al Bengston with an anonymous woman in the
background. He was also photographing people

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:02.980
like Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol, New York-based
artists but who were coming through LA. Warhol

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:10.009
actually had his first show at the Ferus Gallery
on La Cienega. And then Ruscha.

00:14:10.009 --> 00:14:16.920
This is a photograph of Ruscha from 1964 that
Hopper took and has been reproduced really

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:22.290
often and sort of captures the young Ruscha.
As you can see, he really looks like a movie

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:27.480
star. He was kind of movie star handsome and
like James Dean or Marlon Brando -- he's striking

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:36.990
that kind of a pose. And because Ruscha's
work was so bound up in the Los Angeles cityscape,

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:42.389
Hopper really wanted to show him on an LA
street, so this was taken, I think, just further

00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:49.510
down on La Cienega Boulevard in front of an
electronics supply store. So, you've got the

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:54.399
sign "TV Radio Service", and then Ruscha kind
of to the side with that movie star pose -- so,

00:14:54.399 --> 00:14:58.700
capturing both the personality and also what
his work was like.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.040
[pause]

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:08.079
So, Hopper concentrated on making art throughout
most of the 1960s, but something he told me

00:15:08.079 --> 00:15:14.050
that I thought was really interesting was
that he always knew he wanted to go back to

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:18.210
making movies, and he saw doing photography
as a way of training himself to be a director.

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:23.779
So, he would never crop his images. He always
shot in full frame and he really saw it as

00:15:23.779 --> 00:15:29.040
kind of a way of going to school; a way of
teaching himself so that when he was ready

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:35.160
to make a film, he would know how to do it,
and he'd have a certain amount of skill. So,

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:41.269
in 1969, Hopper made Easy Rider. Has anyone
seen Easy Rider? Yeah. A fair number of you

00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:42.269
have.

00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:46.249
Something that was really interesting for
me when I watched it again is just how much

00:15:46.249 --> 00:15:52.480
a sort of period piece it is. It's just so
1960s. So, what you're seeing here is Dennis

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:57.611
Hopper on the left, Peter Fonda on the right
and for those of you who haven't seen it,

00:15:57.611 --> 00:16:04.589
it's kind of a road movie. So, Hopper and
Peter Fonda are these two guys, they smoke

00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:12.149
a lot of pot, they do a lot of other drugs,
and they go on this road trip to New Orleans

00:16:12.149 --> 00:16:16.390
and they, along the way they pick up Jack
Nicholson, who was very young at the time,

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:21.029
you sort of wouldn't recognize him, but he
was the straight-laced lawyer and they sort

00:16:21.029 --> 00:16:27.899
of get him into the hippie lifestyle. And
they take this long trip, they have a lot

00:16:27.899 --> 00:16:31.269
of different adventures and in the end, I
don't think I'll be spoiling it because you

00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:37.040
can kinda see what's coming, but they get
in trouble down in the South who are really

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:41.540
threatened by these long haired hippie types
and they end up getting shot. So, it's this

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:46.769
kind of parable about how there's this new
youth culture that the rest of the country

00:16:46.769 --> 00:16:48.899
just kind of can't deal with.

00:16:48.899 --> 00:16:54.410
So, it became a really important movie for
the New Hollywood that I was mentioning earlier.

00:16:54.410 --> 00:17:00.499
It was 1969, the New Hollywood sort of took
off during the 70s, but it was the first time

00:17:00.499 --> 00:17:08.400
that the youth culture really appeared in
a Hollywood movie, and Hopper became a kind

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:13.839
of icon. He had all these groupies, accolades;
he sort of had the status similar to someone

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:19.260
like John Lennon. But what was really interesting
about this movie from the perspective of someone

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:25.860
who's interested in the art of the period,
is that the style of the film was very related

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:32.111
to the style of people like Ruscha, Wallace
Berman, Bruce Conner, etc. It was kinda what

00:17:32.111 --> 00:17:38.720
was happening in visual art in LA in the 60s.
And Hopper was taking all those influences

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:43.020
and putting them into a Hollywood film so
that they became much more widespread and

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.330
influential then they otherwise would have
been.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:49.350
So, these are stills from se-, from a Bruce
Conner movie about the JFK assassination,

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:57.039
so both very famous images that, obviously,
we all recognize. But it was a very experimental

00:17:57.039 --> 00:18:02.330
film. It had a lot of very quick cuts, it
kind of would repeat, and Hopper said that

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:06.880
a lot of his influences for Easy Rider came
straight from Bruce Conner, so what looked

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:12.381
very, very new in a Hollywood film actually
had been happening for awhile in the LA art

00:18:12.381 --> 00:18:19.080
community. He also had a lot of imagery from
contemporary art. What you're seeing here

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:28.049
is by Jasper Johns, the painting Flag, from
1955 in The Museum of Modern Art's collection.

00:18:28.049 --> 00:18:32.929
And then down at the bottom, the Peter Fonda
character's name was Captain America in the

00:18:32.929 --> 00:18:39.380
movie, so he had his motorcycle helmet with
the American flag, his whole outfit, and Hopper

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:43.870
said that he was getting the idea from that
straight from someone like Jasper Johns; kind

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:49.640
of thinking about the symbolism of the American
flag turning it on its head a little bit.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:57.190
So, it was really interesting for me to understand
that in Ruscha's work, what Hopper was doing

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:59.000
was so important and then vice versa.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.420
There really was this very close collaboration
between the two artists, and they remained

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:10.270
friends the rest of their lives. The rest
of Hopper's life -- Ruscha of course is still

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:15.020
working. So, it really was kind of a quid
pro quo. They were talking to each other and

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:21.500
a lot of the same themes, the idea of the
road trip, kind of the big expanse of America,

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:25.309
traveling around the country; it was very
much a part of Ruscha's work as well. So,

00:19:25.309 --> 00:19:31.440
what you're seeing here is a painting by Ruscha
called Standard Station, Amarillo, Texas,

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:37.850
from 1963, one of his most famous early works
 -- showing a gas station, so kind of referring

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:42.960
to the highways to being out on the road to
taking road trips and this, actually, was

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:47.490
bought by Dennis Hopper. This was one of the
first works that Hopper bought and one of

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:52.760
the first works that Ruscha sold, so there
really was this very close collaboration there.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:57.110
And Hopper was dealing with similar things
in his own photography.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:20:02.360
This is a work called "Double Standard," and
the MoCA show is actually called Double Standard:

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:06.980
Dennis Hopper's Art. This was one of Dennis
Hopper's most famous photographs, so this

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:07.980
is quite nearby here. I think it's the corner
of, I don't know if any of you guys would

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:17.850
recognize it, but it was right by Ferus on
La Cienega. So, it's the same Standard station

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:23.036
that you're kind of seeing going down the
street, you see the view from the, the view

00:20:23.036 --> 00:20:28.500
in the rear view mirror. So the same interest
in car culture, in the road, popular culture,

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:35.250
signs are things that Ruscha deals with a
lot, as does Hopper, sort of our everyday

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:40.750
lives in looking at it in a new way. And there's
a direct comparison.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:48.920
The Standard station in the Hopper photograph
and then down there, with Ruscha. Ruscha also

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:55.659
did a book of gas stations. It's called, literally,
Twentysix Gasoline Stations, where he took

00:20:55.659 --> 00:21:03.120
photographs of gas stations on Route 66 going
from LA to Oklahoma City, where he was from.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:08.630
So, it's a little, tiny book. They're literally
photos of 26 gasoline stations, it's called

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:13.840
Twentysix Gasoline Stations, and this is one
of them. So you see the connections between

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.149
what these two artists were thinking about
 -- thinking about the cityscape, thinking

00:21:17.149 --> 00:21:19.919
about being out on the highways.

00:21:19.919 --> 00:21:25.570
Ruscha also did several other books at the
time, and I'm just giving you little images

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:32.472
of them that I'm not sure what's going on
with the quality there, but at the top is

00:21:32.472 --> 00:21:36.260
a book called Every Building on the Sunset
Strip, where he photographed every single

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:40.309
building on the Sunset Strip; spliced them
together into an accordion fold book. So if

00:21:40.309 --> 00:21:46.976
you stretched it out, it would be about 20
feet long. And then this is called Some Los

00:21:46.976 --> 00:21:48.750
Angeles Apartment Buildings, so continuing
to look at the urban landscape, think about

00:21:48.750 --> 00:22:00.909
it in any way. So, whereas the previous, we'll
just go back to that, this book, the way he

00:22:00.909 --> 00:22:06.909
did it was he sat in the back of a pickup
truck, and he had a camera that would shoot

00:22:06.909 --> 00:22:11.659
automatically, so it would shoot picture after
picture after picture. And then he'd splice

00:22:11.659 --> 00:22:16.130
them together by hand so that you got this
kind of view of the street as if you were

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:18.200
driving along it.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:22.570
And he said that it, for him it was very much
related to film because if you think about

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:29.520
film being a series of images moving very
quickly, it was something kinda similar that

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.780
he was trying to do in this book. But Ruscha
also made his own films during this period,

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:40.200
and the first one he made was called Crackers.
And you're seeing two shots from it here,

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:44.340
actually from the book. Something that was
interesting about Ruscha is that he was making

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:48.810
paintings, he was making drawings and prints,
he was making books at the same time he was

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:57.330
making film. So his movie that he did here
came out of a book called Crackers, in which

00:22:57.330 --> 00:23:03.490
he had this kind of very strange story that
unfolded throughout its pages. So the story

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:08.860
that was this guy picks up this woman for
a date -- kind of wines and dines her. And

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:13.669
then takes her home to this hotel room that
he's rented and so you kind of like can guess

00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:17.970
where the story's gonna go. But, in fact,
what he wants her to do is to lie on a bed

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:24.550
of salad and then cover her in dressing. So,
it's this kind of, it's kind of a shaggy dog

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:29.020
story. You don't really understand the point
of it, but it's got a very distinct narrative

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:34.559
and it goes in this direction that you never
would have guessed that it would. So he did

00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:39.190
this book in 1969, and then he decided to
do a movie of the same story. So, to kind

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:45.049
of flesh out the story that he had told picture
by picture into an actual film. And these

00:23:45.049 --> 00:23:49.320
are shots from a film which was called Premium.
And the reason it's called that is because

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:54.461
after he made the salad, the protagonist wanted
crackers and so he leaves the, he leaves the

00:23:54.461 --> 00:24:01.600
girl in the bed with the salad, goes out and
buys Saltines and then goes to his own apartment

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:07.309
and eats his Saltines in bed, alone. So, you've
got Crackers, the book, and then Premium,

00:24:07.309 --> 00:24:11.919
the movie. And these are shots from the movie
that kind of show how it was set up, show

00:24:11.919 --> 00:24:19.600
how he adapted the book into the film version,
and the artist, the protagonist, is actually

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:23.690
the artist Larry Bell, a sculptor who was
working in LA at the time.

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:29.700
So it's kind of pushing it in, in another
interesting direction. A visual artist who

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:36.090
had done this book and then decided to do
film, so it was really fascinating to me to

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:41.131
see this back and forth. And this is a still
from the movie where it's the same people

00:24:41.131 --> 00:24:47.180
that were in the book that got slightly different
styles -- they're acting it out, but the same

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:53.669
basic scenario. Ruscha then went on to do
another film in 1975, which is another kind

00:24:53.669 --> 00:25:01.980
of shaggy dog story, sort of surreal. It stars
someone who's playing an auto mechanic and

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:08.700
he's kind of futzing around with the car,
but over the course of the story, he becomes

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:11.120
more and more sort of like a scientist.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:16.970
His coveralls gradually become less and less
soiled, so that's the miracle of the title

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:22.690
that this kind of divine intervention has
happened as this guy is fixing a car. Again,

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:26.290
it's surreal; it's not supposed to make a
lot of sense. But I think what's really interesting

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:32.740
about it is the same set of themes that he
keeps dealing with, cars, sort of looking

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:40.269
at everyday life in a new way, never quite
knowing what's gonna come of it. So these

00:25:40.269 --> 00:25:42.180
are the only two films that Ruscha did, but
I think it was really interesting that at

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:47.690
the same time that, that there was all this
interest in more experimental films in Hollywood.

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:52.330
You have this artist that was working in LA,
his studio was actually in Hollywood at the

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:57.029
time, who's also making films. There's just
all sorts of very cool crossovers happening

00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:58.029
there.

00:25:58.029 --> 00:25:59.029
[pause]

00:25:59.029 --> 00:26:07.679
At the same time, as I mentioned, Ruscha was
also dealing directly with Hollywood in his

00:26:07.679 --> 00:26:12.299
more traditional art. So this is the image
that we saw at the beginning and in fact,

00:26:12.299 --> 00:26:18.860
it was a series of many pictures at the time
that he was doing dealing with Hollywood.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:23.480
This is a sketch that he made where he was
trying to work out the idea for the Large

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:28.799
Trademark with Eight Spotlights. I really
love this. It's done just on a piece of stationary

00:26:28.799 --> 00:26:34.730
from a hotel, but you see him thinking through
what these very recognizable things, like

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:38.279
the 20th Century Fox logo -- kind of taking
them apart, pulling them apart and putting

00:26:38.279 --> 00:26:39.279
them back together.

00:26:39.279 --> 00:26:40.279
[pause]

00:26:40.279 --> 00:26:53.809
He did a series of these Standard Station
images, and I think it's really interesting

00:26:53.809 --> 00:26:59.510
to notice just how similar they are to the
20th Century Fox image. It's the same, basic

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:07.270
compositional format, so the, the very strong
diagonal. This is called Standard Station

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:15.760
with Cheap Western Torn in Half, so up in
the corner, that's a very precise, illusionistic

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:20.580
rendition of a comic book torn in half. So
he's got this very literal way of titling

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:25.899
his pictures, kind of surreal, but having
a lot of fun with it, of great sense of humor

00:27:25.899 --> 00:27:26.899
about it.

00:27:26.899 --> 00:27:32.659
These are two drawings that show how he sort
of got to this format of the Standard Station,

00:27:32.659 --> 00:27:34.549
preparing it, again thinking about these every
day things that you see every day and looking

00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:44.970
at them in a new way. Down here is obviously
the same compositional format, but he's pretended

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:48.590
that it's a stack of his Twentysix Gasoline
book, Station books that I told you about.

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:52.399
So in the front is, you see the title and
then he was imagining that there was a whole

00:27:52.399 --> 00:28:02.059
stack of book behind it. And this is something
that you see a lot in his work.

00:28:02.059 --> 00:28:09.580
This is a painting from the early 60s, obviously
same subject matter, Paramount Pictures. He

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:13.870
ended up not being happy with it and destroying
it, but this is an early photograph that we

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:18.169
have it, just to show that he was doing it.
So Hollywood was something that he was thinking

00:28:18.169 --> 00:28:25.269
about a lot, kind of thinking about how he
could integrate it into his art. He also is

00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:30.610
very well known for his series of images of
the Hollywood sign. These are things that

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:36.919
he's gone back to, again and again, throughout
his career. He did his first Hollywood images

00:28:36.919 --> 00:28:42.430
in the late 60s; the first painting was 1968.
But this is an early example of how he was

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:49.330
starting to think about the Hollywood sign
and for him, it represents this kind of almost

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:54.030
Boulevard of Broken Dreams type of idea, that
it's so iconic that you can see it from so

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:58.200
many different places in the city, but especially
during this period, it was in terrible shape.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:04.880
It was crumbling, there had been some suicides
from people jumping off some letters, so it

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.049
was really this sort of dark side of the Hollywood
dream that he was interested in. And this

00:29:08.049 --> 00:29:13.799
is a drawing that he did on a menu. So this
is like a paper menu from a Schraff's coffee

00:29:13.799 --> 00:29:14.799
shop.

00:29:14.799 --> 00:29:23.789
This is one of his first fully rendered images
of the Hollywood sign; it's a drawing, pastel

00:29:23.789 --> 00:29:29.620
with ink and pencil on paper. And he usually
shows the Hollywood sign against the sunset,

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:38.070
sort of at an iconic, LA, smoggy, orange-red
sunset. And he always did that so you think

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:43.909
of walking off into the sunset, riding off
into the sunset, these sort of clichés of

00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:51.220
Hollywood movies, but he's showing it looking
kind of ominous, a little scary. He did another

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:56.490
series called The Back of Hollywood, a theme
that he just went back to again and again.

00:29:56.490 --> 00:30:00.990
He was always fascinated by it. Another version
from the 1970s.

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:06.309
And then as I mentioned, he was always interested
in language. He plays around with language,

00:30:06.309 --> 00:30:14.289
you saw it in the SPAM and the an-, in the
images, so beginning in the mid 70s, he started

00:30:14.289 --> 00:30:19.659
doing literally drawings with words in them,
talking about Hollywood. So, this is a pastel

00:30:19.659 --> 00:30:26.659
called Properties in Hollywood, and he kind
of makes you stop and think, "What do you

00:30:26.659 --> 00:30:28.690
mean by 'properties in hollywood'?" Is he
calling on the language of real estate brochures?

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:36.789
Is he talking about a property, like a kind
of film script, something like that? So he's

00:30:36.789 --> 00:30:42.530
taking these language, these bits of language
that are sort of familiar, but making them

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:45.909
strange, making you think, "What does that
actually mean? Why is he putting this is in

00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:47.529
a drawing? What's the point of it?"

00:30:47.529 --> 00:30:53.019
So, again, making you stop and think about
every day things that just pass through your

00:30:53.019 --> 00:30:58.679
life and you don't usually consider. This
is a drawing called "Hollywood". It's from

00:30:58.679 --> 00:31:07.370
a series called Paper Drawings that he did
in the 70s, and so it looks like ribbons of

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:13.620
paper. It's all completely illusionistic.
He's incredibly skilled as a draftsman, but

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:19.720
he was able to do it so that it looks as if
he kind of set up this paper and then did

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:24.230
the drawing of it, but it's all out of his
imagination. Hollywood, California from around

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:31.460
the same period. Another Hollywood Dream Bubble
Popped, this is one of my favorites. It's

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:35.830
just, it's so resonant. It calls up so many
different ideas, but then you think, "Well,

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:40.039
what does it mean? What does it come from?
Where did he get this idea?" But it really

00:31:40.039 --> 00:31:49.809
gets at that sort of dream versus nightmare
idea -- the kind of myth of Hollywood.

00:31:49.809 --> 00:31:54.440
Hollywood is a Verb, another one of my favorites.
Doesn't really make sense at all, but you

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:59.850
sort of understand what he's saying. He has
a quotation that I really like where he talks

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:05.480
about how things can be Hollywoodized. You
can take the most ordinary, mundane object

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:09.940
and Hollywoodize it and it gets this aura
about it, it gets this kind of stardust. So

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:14.279
that's something he's really interested in,
how you can take something very ordinary and

00:32:14.279 --> 00:32:23.400
humble and make it into something extraordinary
that makes you think about it. So, that's

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:28.809
about it. I understand that books are coming
to you on Monday. They didn't get here in

00:32:28.809 --> 00:32:31.000
time, but there's a larger version of this
talk in the book.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:45.460
Other things that I talk about are the LA
art scene of

00:32:45.460 --> 00:33:05.549
the 60s -- how it came together. I have a
chapter on how a lot of architects during

00:33:05.549 --> 00:33:15.640
the 70s were really interested in Ruscha's
books, thinking about the post-modern city,

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.789
thinking about Los Angeles as kind of a new
type of city. And architects -- especially

00:33:17.789 --> 00:33:19.929
Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown, who
were very prominent during the 70s and 80s,

00:33:19.929 --> 00:33:20.929
were directly influenced by Ruscha.

00:33:20.929 --> 00:33:23.500
And then I have a chapter on how Ruscha, and
you get the sense of this I think from the

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.929
Dennis Hopper picture of him, he really was
a genius at marketing himself as a movie star

00:33:25.929 --> 00:33:27.490
type character, and he would place advertisements
for himself in magazines, he was very good

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:28.490
looking, obviously, but he was very clever
at using the media to promote himself as an

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:33.450
artist. And he was really one of the first
to do that. So, I hope you enjoy the books

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:34.450
when you get them. I'm sorry I can't sign
them for you and I also really hope you'll

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:35.450
go check out the Dennis Hopper exhibition
at MoCA. I think it should be really interesting

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:36.450
and opens soon. So I'd be happy to answer
any questions you might have.

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:37.450
&gt;&gt;Chris: Any questions? Ok.

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:38.450
&gt;&gt;Alexandra: Thank you. Thanks so much everyone.

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:39.450
[applause]

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:40.450
&gt;&gt;Chris: We have a question right there. He's,
he's formulating one.

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:41.450
&gt;&gt;Alexandra: Oh, sure.

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:42.450
&gt;&gt;Chris: So.

00:33:42.450 --> 00:34:02.509
&gt;&gt;male audience member1: I thought it was
kind of interesting that, that it's kind of

00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:13.190
the same time, these artists are kind of pointing
out the artifice of Hollywood while, while

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:14.190
Hollywood is kind of going to verite, trying
to be--

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:15.190
&gt;&gt;Alexandra: Yeah.

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:16.190
&gt;&gt;make audience member1: more genuine.

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:17.190
&gt;&gt;Alexandra: Yeah.

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:18.899
&gt;&gt;male audience member1: Is there a relationship
there or is it, do you thing that commentary

00:34:18.899 --> 00:34:22.679
kind of pushed it in that direction?

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:29.129
&gt;&gt;Alexandra: I think there's definitely a
relationship there, yeah. I don't know. It's

00:34:29.129 --> 00:34:35.460
funny because Easy Rider, I, I could've thought
about this in relationships to Easy Rider

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:42.010
because reading the commentary on it in the
60s, in places like Life Magazine and Time,

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:50.160
they just saw it as so outrageous and so new,
but it was really a watered down version of

00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:57.050
what people like Bruce Conner, these avant-garde
artists were doing. So, I guess I think ultimately

00:34:57.050 --> 00:35:04.480
Hollywood kind of won because they had the
money, and so they were really using the ideas

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:10.140
that these artists had been coming up with.
But I think that it was symbiotic because

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:18.380
the sort of critical aspect and Easy Rider
is a pretty critical movie. I think was coming

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:22.859
from the art community. So it was this interesting
dynamic, it was an interesting take, give

00:35:22.859 --> 00:35:27.720
and take, and maybe it's cynical to think
that, that Hollywood exploited these artists,

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:31.920
but I guess I think ultimately that that's
what it is. They really benefitted from them.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:36.770
I mean -- it saved their skins. They were
in terrible trouble. 20th Century Fox actually

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:45.850
shut down for a while in the 60s and these
new artists revitalized it. So, I think it's

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:51.090
a, it's a really interesting question and
a really fascinating dynamic, but I think

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:55.430
ultimately they sort of leeched on what the
artists were doing for profit.

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:58.610
&gt;&gt;Chris: Any other questions?

00:35:58.610 --> 00:35:59.610
[pause]

00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:03.390
Ok, I've got a question,

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:04.980
&gt;&gt;Alexandra: Ok.

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:11.040
&gt;&gt;Chris: So, Ruscha seemed to, especially
in his early career, it's like he's got the

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:18.210
20th Century Fox, he's like looking at corporate
iconography, and I'm wondering did he, and,

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:24.010
and yet he also seemed to like keep his distance
from it too, maybe later in life. Did he,

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:28.020
did he ever work directly with a corporate
patron and, and like do something, some of

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:32.920
the things that some other artists have done?
Actually don't know about that.

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:39.580
&gt;&gt;Alexandra: Not directly. He's very interesting.
I've tried to get him to talk a lot about

00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:46.200
that and he doesn't love to talk about it.
But he never worked for a Hollywood studio.

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:54.650
Some artists did in the 60s, but since, he's
really become kind of a favorite of Hollywood

00:36:54.650 --> 00:37:03.790
collectors, so David Geffen owns a lot of
his work, well Hopper, obviously. I was just

00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:10.180
watching a preview online for Sophia Copola's
new movie, and there's a Ruscha in the movie.

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:17.170
It's kind of up against a wall, and I met
the other day with the main person at Ruscha's

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:21.430
gallery, he shows at the Gagosian Gallery,
and I was meeting with his main contact there

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:26.870
and that, that print was on the wall, and
I said, "Oh my God, did you know that this

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:32.470
is in this preview for the Sophia Coppola
movie?" And he's like, "Oh, yeah. We lent

00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:36.160
it to them." So, Ruscha definitely, he's kind
of popular I think with Hollywood collectors

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:41.780
now. A lot of actors collect his work. He's
good friends with Jack Nicholson, so I think

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:47.380
that there's definitely a relationship there.
It's not kind of set in stone, but because

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:52.790
he's here, because he's such a kind of cool
guy, like you see him in magazines a lot,

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:58.130
he's dated a lot of Hollywood actresses over
the years. I think that it's there but he

00:37:58.130 --> 00:38:01.550
kind of doesn't like to talk about it that
much.

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:07.740
&gt;&gt;male audience member2: I just have a comment
and then a question. One is if anybody hasn't

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.089
seen Easy Rider, it's playing tonight--

00:38:09.089 --> 00:38:10.089
&gt;&gt;Alexandra: Wow.

00:38:10.089 --> 00:38:12.710
&gt;&gt;male audience member2: at The Silent Movie
Theater, and they're actually doing a big

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:18.010
Dennis Hopper retrospective all month and
then after tonight, I think, the second movie

00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:20.619
tonight is a documentary about when he was
making the last movie--

00:38:20.619 --> 00:38:21.619
&gt;&gt;Alexandra: Yeah.

00:38:21.619 --> 00:38:24.440
&gt;&gt;male audience member2: which is supposed
to be like, rarely seen, and he kinda really

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:25.880
went off his head while he was making that.

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:26.990
&gt;&gt;Alexandra: Are these at MoCA or somewhere
else?

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:30.240
&gt;&gt;male audience member2: No, at The Silent
Movie Theater, it's on Fairfax.

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:31.240
&gt;&gt;Alexandra: Ok, cool.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:35.040
&gt;&gt;male audience member2: Yeah, it's a cute
little theater, art theater. And then my question

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:39.579
was just is he still, is Ruscha still working
today and, and what is he working on?

00:38:39.579 --> 00:38:40.579
[Alexandra coughs]

00:38:40.579 --> 00:38:45.030
&gt;&gt;Alexandra: Excuse me. Yeah, I'm seeing him
tomorrow, actually. He's very much still working.

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:49.500
His studio is right in Venice. I don't know
what his very latest things are. I haven't

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:58.590
seen him in a little while, but I'll find
out tomorrow. He did recently a series of

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:04.270
paintings of mountains with words above them,
kind of superimposed upon them, and he told

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:13.210
me that the mountains came from a magazine
that had a story on the Himalayas. So, it's

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:17.870
one of the Himalayan Mountains, and then he
has language on top of it. He's really dealing

00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:21.079
with a lot of the same issues that he has
throughout his career -- a lot on language,

00:39:21.079 --> 00:39:27.710
word play. He's painting a lot; he's still
making books. He's actually done a series

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:33.800
of books documenting other Los Angeles streets.
I told you about Every Building on the Sunset

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:39.560
Strip, but he also photographs the Pacific
Coast Highway, Hollywood Boulevard, every

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:45.859
few years, so he did a book that was Hollywood
Boulevard: Then and Now. So, one set from

00:39:45.859 --> 00:39:51.450
the 60s and one from the early 2000s, kind
of right next to each other. But yeah, he's

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:56.450
still very active, he's in his early 70s and
still working a lot.

00:39:56.450 --> 00:40:05.710
&gt;&gt;Chris: One, one more question. So, is he,
I know that he did a lot of LA, Hollywood,

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:11.349
Southern California based kind of imagery
early on in his career, does he come back

00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:12.990
to that as well?

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:20.569
&gt;&gt;Alexandra: Yeah, he still comes back to
the Hollywood sign a lot. The logos, like

00:40:20.569 --> 00:40:24.190
the 20th Century Fox, he hasn't done that
in awhile, but he's always recycling images,

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:28.500
so I wouldn't be surprised if he does come
back to it at some point. He has the same

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:33.809
sort of preoccupations that he keeps coming
back to, as a lot of artists do. It's really

00:40:33.809 --> 00:40:38.339
interesting to watch that over the course
of artists' careers.

00:40:38.339 --> 00:40:41.520
&gt;&gt;Chris: All right. Thank you very much.

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:45.589
&gt;&gt;Alexandra: Thanks so much. It's been a real
pleasure.

00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:46.269
[applause]
