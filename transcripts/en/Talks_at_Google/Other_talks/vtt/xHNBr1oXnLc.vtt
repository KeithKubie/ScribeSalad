[APPLAUSE]

00:00:06.452 --> 00:00:08.910
SOPHIE DELAUNAY: Thanks a lot,
Nigel, for these kind words.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.121
Can you hear me well?

00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:11.620
OK.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.600
So I'm Sophie Delaunay.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.700
And indeed, I'm absolutely
delighted to be here

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.590
with you today.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.910
When I was preparing for
this meeting, I though,

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.460
you guys are the most informed
people that we can meet.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:36.660
So how can I talk about MSF in
terms that can be new to you,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.750
or what is the
kind of information

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.490
that you may not have, and
that could be of interest.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.810
So I'm going to try to start
with a brief presentation

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.950
of the institution as a whole.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.090
And then I will focus
on the operations.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.310
But I'd like to share with you
mostly the debates, the issues,

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.600
the questions, that
animate the organization,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.310
and the challenges that we face.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:05.890
Things that you wouldn't find
on our website or on the web.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.640
So I represent the
US branch of Doctors

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.100
Without Borders, MSF,
Medecins Sans Frontieres.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:20.120
The US is one of the 28
chapters of the organization.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.090
Within these 28
chapters there are

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.350
five what we call
operational centers.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.810
They are actually the first five
historically created chapters.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.280
And they are the ones to run
the operations in the ground.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.000
And the additional
chapters that have

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.680
been created over
these past four years

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.540
are supporting those operations.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.780
There's been a sort of a deal
negotiated in the organization

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.240
that anybody who
wanted to create an MSF

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.530
chapter in a country would
have the ability to do so,

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.770
according to a number
of criteria, of course,

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.657
but that we would stick to
five operational centers

00:01:57.657 --> 00:01:59.240
on the ground, so
that the countries--

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.650
it's already hard to negotiate
with five MSF sections.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.150
So imagine if it
proliferates without control.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.039
So we have five
operational centers.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.050
And the US is not an
operational center,

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.960
but it's the largest
chapter in the MSF movement.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.470
And it supports the
movement in terms

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.000
of financial contribution,
but also human resources,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.040
communication, advocacy,
and some medical expertise.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.150
And the reason why we're able
to play such a role for MSF

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.770
in supporting our
field operation

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.180
is actually because
in the US, we

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.900
benefit from enormous
contributions from the public

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.600
and from organizations like you.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.000
Our partnership with Google has
been going on for many years,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.770
as Nigel said.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.630
And it's been in the form
of both technical support--

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.050
technical expertise,
and financial support.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.640
And I have to say that both
are equally valuable to us.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.400
In 2015 only, MSF has
received $5 million

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.590
from Google, mostly in the form
of matching gifts, so from you.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.750
And we also received
in 2015 $2.5 million

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.080
from Larry Page and his spouse.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.685
So needless to say that you are
a very important contributor,

00:03:17.685 --> 00:03:20.230
and it's an opportunity
for me to thank you

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.540
for your loyal and
generous support.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.880
So as you will see
in my presentation,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.620
there are, of course,
many challenges

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.610
that we need to address if we
want to respond effectively

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.730
to humanitarian crisis.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.770
But we all know, because
we all are very pragmatic,

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.210
that we can't move ideas,
we can't move good ideas,

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.360
and mobilize committed people
without the financial means.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.200
So that's why I wanted
to start with this aspect

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.150
and express our
gratitude for the trust

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.370
that we've received from you.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.060
Now a quick introduction
on the organization.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:06.450
As I said, we have about 28
offices around the world.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.900
Those offices are
supporting the operations.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.520
And we're working in
about 70 countries.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.700
The model that we've
chosen for our organization

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.990
is a very decentralized model.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:23.340
And there is no real
headquarters in MSF.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.010
There is a secretary
in Geneva whose goal

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.790
is to coordinate and to ensure
that the police to our policies

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.130
are aligned.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.350
So we have a human
resource policy.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.120
So that's to make sure
that a US physician

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.560
and a Japanese physician,
when they meet in the field,

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.600
and if they compare salary, they
don't enter a big fight, right?

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.650
That they are treated equitably.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.840
So we have a number of
international policies

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.880
to make sure that we're a
responsible employer, to make

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.460
sure that we're using the
same medical protocols,

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.040
to make sure that we
develop some tools that

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.630
can benefit everyone.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.240
But at the same time,
we are very much

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.540
attached to our
decentralized model.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.170
And I have in mind
a few examples

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.330
that have proved over the years
that the decentralized model is

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.640
hard to manage, because, of
course, when everybody has

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.080
a say in the decision,
it's not easy.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.530
But it's also very
valuable in terms

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.250
of advancing the
quality of medical care.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.820
For example, we've been
able over the years

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.000
to develop a treatment
for malnutrition

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.880
that has been a
real game-changer.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.110
I'm sure you've heard about the
ready-to-use therapeutic food--

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.300
the Plumpy'Nut-- and
how it has completely

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.340
changed the treatment
for malnutrition.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.190
This would not
have been possible

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.810
if we had had one
operational center.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.470
Because it's because one
operational center decided

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.670
that what the other
was doing was not

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.550
good enough that we ended up
challenging our own protocols.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.470
And it's true in many
areas where we work.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.890
In malaria we've also-- because
some operational centers

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.330
decided to take the risk of
exploring different approaches,

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.860
and then confronting-- having
a sort of healthy competition,

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.860
and constantly critically
challenging ourselves,

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.340
that we've been able to
improve our own practice.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.366
Ebola is also a good
example, because as you know,

00:06:16.366 --> 00:06:19.720
we also have to make sure that
we spend our money effectively.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.840
So there's always a tension
between the right balance

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.630
between redundancies
and duplication.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.870
And some years ago, based
on our operational volume,

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.430
we agreed that we all needed
to keep a strong capacity

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.800
in surgery, a strong capacity
in malaria and vaccination.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.030
But there was some
disease for which

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.620
we didn't need five operational
centers or 28 sections

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.510
to invest in.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.960
And hemorrhagic fever was one
of them, because at that time

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.600
we were confronted with
very small outbreaks here

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.220
and there, every two,
three years in West Africa.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:00.040
And we say, OK, why wouldn't we
ask MSF Belgium, because they

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.140
already have a sort
of expertise to be

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.096
in charge of hemorrhagic fever.

00:07:05.096 --> 00:07:06.220
And they've been in charge.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.540
And they've developed
their know-how.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.060
And whenever there
was an outbreak,

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.870
it was the Belgium who were
going for the response.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.560
And the other
sections, actually,

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.570
did not really
invest in this area.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.980
We first started to have a
problem with that some years

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:26.020
ago when there was an Ebola and
Lassa fever outbreak in Uganda.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.010
And it was the French
section that was there.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.850
And the team was very
powerless in dealing with it.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.930
And it took several
days and weeks

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.800
to actually catch up
with the knowledge that

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.730
had been accumulated in Belgium.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.740
And it's been even
more difficult

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.450
recently in West Africa.

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:42.510
It has actually
slowed our ability

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.860
to scale up, because we
didn't have capitalized

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.860
enough within the organization
the knowledge of Ebola.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.430
And the Belgium, who are
very prompt to respond,

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:52.930
they did fantastic work.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:56.790
But if we had had the full
movement up to speed on Ebola

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.270
at that time, I think we
would have done better.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.950
So it's a lesson for
us that we should not

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.390
duplicate everything.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:07.990
But redundancies
are very important

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:12.830
in order to respond to massive
and large-scale operations.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:18.410
Now when you hear about
MSF, I'm sure you've

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:20.570
heard these
sacrosanct principle--

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.470
neutrality, impartiality,
and independence.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:28.400
It really defines our
culture and our identity.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.120
But let's be honest.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:34.390
These words mean nothing if they
are taken out of the context.

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:37.000
What's important in
these words is more

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.159
the practical implication
that they have,

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:42.429
if you implement them.

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:48.860
So impartiality is at the core
of medical ethics, of course,

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:54.520
because if you provide medical
care, regardless of race,

00:08:54.520 --> 00:09:01.200
political agenda,
regardless of gender, then

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.140
you are able to do
medicine in an ethical way.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:10.680
But in our own situation,
if you practice medical care

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.850
with impartiality-- that is, if
you don't ask for which faction

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.490
the person work-- then you are
able to access the conflict

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:19.310
zones.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.710
So impartiality for us
is not just a principle,

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.790
it's also a very
practical way to access

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.060
those dangerous areas,
and to demonstrate

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.150
that we are neutral,
and that we are not

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.450
taking sides in the
conflict, and that we have

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:37.040
no other agenda than
treating the people.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.320
And actually, those principles
are our main negotiation tools

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.340
in the field.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.740
So how do you get trust
from the communities

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.540
and from the factions
that are present there?

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.500
If you are able to demonstrate
that you can effectively

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.910
provide quality medical care,
impartial care, and that's

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.980
regardless of who they are.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.510
But how are you able to do that?

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:04.520
You are only able to do
that if you are independent.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.500
If you are prompt enough in
responding to the conflict.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.770
If you're not
effectively affiliated

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:11.900
with political powers.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.280
It's not just about saying it.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.340
It's really about
being in the situation.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.890
And how do you avoid
being affiliated

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:22.990
with a power is with your
financial independence,

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:24.150
most of the time.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:27.170
So that's why independence is
also a tool for impartiality,

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.470
that itself is a
tool for access.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:34.400
How do we achieve our
financial independence?

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.140
We made the choice
a number of years

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.730
ago, not to exceed
a certain portion

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.260
of public institutional funding.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.120
What I mean by public
institutional funding

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.440
is government funding.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.780
So we don't exceed
15% of funding,

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.750
which means that
85% of our resources

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:59.430
come from private funding,
which gives us a lot of leverage

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:02.310
and ability to react
in emergencies,

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.990
without being perceived as
affiliated with a power that

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.520
may be involved in the conflict.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.910
So there are governments
we don't take money

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.360
from-- the US government,
the French government,

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.770
because they have so
many stakes in most

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.030
of the conflicts where we work.

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:20.130
And there are
governments we take money

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:26.430
from based on their
distance and if there's

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:30.490
no risk of perception that
we would be affiliated.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:35.650
The second aspect that
allows us to be independent

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.900
is the nature of the funding.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.290
We've opened these
28 offices, as I

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:44.060
showed in the previous slide.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:47.550
And this was a way also
not to be dependent only

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:49.590
on one or two.

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:52.520
The US is already a
very, very big player,

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.990
but we don't want the US to
become the largest contributor

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.350
for MSF, because if there is
a financial crisis in the US

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:02.790
tomorrow, we would have
to close our operations.

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:04.510
And this is not what we want.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:07.340
So we've experienced
this in the past.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:12.780
Spain was our third largest
contributor, MSF Spain.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.630
But with the economy
crisis, we've

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:19.650
been able to compensate from a
growth in Hong Kong, Australia,

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:23.230
and some successes in the US.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.990
So diversification and
also general funding,

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:31.820
un-earmarked funding, is what
allows us to stay independent.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.820
Because when an
emergency occurs,

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:38.990
you don't need to wait for
your team to write a proposal.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:40.770
You don't need to
wait for government

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:42.090
to give you the grant.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.540
You can intervene
right away based

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:47.570
on the needs that you
identify on the ground.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:51.370
So I just wanted to put a bit of
flesh around these principles,

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.210
because they are actually
very practical principles that

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:56.910
allow us to do our work.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:58.155
Now let's move to operations.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.920
So this is the
slide that shows you

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:12.390
how our international
funding is separated.

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:15.440
So in 2013, we
have a cap of 15%,

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:20.280
but actually in 2013, we
only have 9% of our funding

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.060
that would come from
institutions and governments.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:26.150
And the rest would come from
individuals or corporations,

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:30.500
what we call private funding,
which gives us a lot of ability

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:38.930
to operate and a lot of
independence and freedom

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:41.930
to focus on the
humanitarian issues.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:46.610
It depoliticized our funding
and our intervention.

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.890
So what are the main contexts.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:50.910
Here on the slide, you
see all the countries

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.820
where we have operations.

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.910
2/3 of our presence
is based in Africa,

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:03.890
which is where you have most of
the context that define an MSF

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:04.590
operation.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:07.670
So what would trigger
an intervention of MSF,

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:11.000
it's mostly conflict
or unstable areas

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.270
with a number of humanitarian
consequences like displaced

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:20.410
and a lack of access to health
care, or violence and wounded.

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:25.720
The second context is
neglected disease or epidemics.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.590
so the conflicts,
of course, you all

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:32.290
have in mind are Yemen, Somalia,
South Sudan, Sudan, Syria.

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:35.710
But also the
neighboring countries.

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:38.210
For example, Ethiopia
is not at war,

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:42.180
but Ethiopia holds a very large
number of displaced people.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:46.230
So we're working in Ethiopia
as a result of a crisis.

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:49.080
Same for Jordan and
Lebanon, at the moment,

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:55.010
who receive a large
amount of Syrian refugees.

00:14:55.010 --> 00:15:02.930
Neglected disease and
outbreaks are also

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:07.940
a number of issues that
would trigger intervention.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.930
Of course, Ebola
is a good example.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.210
These countries were
not at war, but they

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:17.220
faced an unprecedented crisis
for which the National Health

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:22.180
System was not capable
of responding alone.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:26.010
We also intervene in
times of outbreaks.

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:28.820
For example, for
many, many years,

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.385
until there was a vaccine
that proved effective,

00:15:31.385 --> 00:15:33.370
we intervened every
three years almost

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:39.560
in the meningitis
belt of Africa.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.700
There were meningitis
outbreaks all the time.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.390
And we'd to every year
and use this vaccine

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.300
that would be effective
for three years.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.575
And then every three
years, we had to go back.

00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:52.700
Now we have vaccine that
is effective for 10 years,

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.800
so we have less
reasons to do so.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.000
But you have
constantly, especially

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.110
in countries at war
or unstable countries,

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:04.600
the health system
is dysfunctional,

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:09.830
so you regularly have cholera
outbreaks or measles outbreaks

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.570
that necessitate
an intervention.

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:15.090
And neglected
disease is something

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:19.890
that we want to keep an
eye on, because there

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:23.010
are a number of diseases
that kill millions of people,

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:26.380
although we don't experience
them in our countries.

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.810
And therefore there is very
limited attention to them.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:33.700
So this is the case of
Chagas, of sleeping sickness,

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:38.680
of kala azar, who
are very neglected.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.470
And for us it's a kind
of a political statement

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.110
to continue keep an eye on this.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:47.210
It's not a matter of
covering a whole population,

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:50.770
but it's really shedding
a light on this neglect.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:03.260
So just to finish with
the scope of activity.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.880
And then I will move
to the challenges

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.319
that we face on any
given day, to give you

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.440
an idea of the scale.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:15.230
We have about 35 volunteers and
staff on the ground to work.

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:18.589
MSF is perceived very much as
an international organization--

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:23.130
which we are-- and as
a western organization.

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:25.030
Actually, when you
look at these figures,

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:28.800
you have to know that
90%-- nine zero percent--

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.600
of these 35,000 volunteers
are national staff.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.270
Only 10% are international.

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:37.980
So the lion's share
of the work that

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.240
is being done by
our organization

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:44.940
is being done by the local
population who work with us.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.750
We work in about 70 countries.

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:53.820
And we have usually several
projects per countries.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.810
And also it
oscillates, depending

00:17:56.810 --> 00:18:00.880
on the years, between
300 and 500 project

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.855
locations for our programs.

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:12.460
We could do more,
but our goal is not

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.880
necessarily a goal of
covering all the needs.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.980
We don't want to be the
Ministry of Health of the world.

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:22.110
Our goal sometimes is really to
identify the most acute places.

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:25.930
Our goal is also to
have other organizations

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:30.980
being able to get involved,
take over the needs.

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.250
Being alone in a
place is certainly not

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:37.310
satisfactory for us, because
we feel that then this place

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:39.450
becomes totally
dependent on MSF.

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:41.990
So it's more about
testing new approaches,

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:45.250
challenging the status
quo, shedding a light

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:49.720
on a problem that will define
the scale of our operation.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.180
And of course is there is
nobody-- like Ebola again,

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:55.827
is a good example-- if you
have no other organization,

00:18:55.827 --> 00:18:57.410
and you are overwhelmed
with the need,

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:00.330
you're going to constantly
scale up your operations.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.670
But it's not an end
in itself for us

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:08.260
to do large coverage
in a country.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:12.970
In terms of result, I don't know
if we can talk about impact,

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:16.890
but it's the result.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:22.840
Every year we do between eight
and 10 million consultation,

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.290
medical consultation.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.980
And the figures that follow
are actually interesting,

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:32.990
because if you talk about
malaria case treated

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:37.470
surgical procedure, a baby
delivered measles vaccination,

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:41.350
or severe malnutrition,
you talk about life saved.

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:45.230
Because if you don't get treated
for measles, or vaccinated,

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:47.530
it's very lethal.

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:50.080
The baby delivered-- you know
that in the countries where

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.610
we work, most women
deliver at home.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:57.550
So the babies we are taking
care of are the complicated

00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:01.850
deliveries, are the deliveries
that if they are not assisted,

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:04.970
either the mother, or the baby,
or both, are going to die.

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:08.370
So this is why we actually
have a particular focus.

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:12.580
We follow a very large number
of figures and indicators.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.850
But these ones are
really the ones

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:18.170
that mean a lot to
us in terms of lives

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:19.580
that we've been able to save.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:33.150
So now I'd like to
move to the challenges

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:36.410
that we faced over the years.

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:39.960
The first challenge-- and maybe
let's go back to this conflict

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:44.550
in high security-- is the
accumulation of crises.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:48.160
I have the feeling every year
at the end of the year when

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.780
I meet with a number
of donors, and I'm

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.820
always asked, so
how was this year?

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:59.670
Every time I hear myself saying,
it's been an exceptional year.

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:03.450
But actually I know why it is.

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:09.250
It is because most of the crisis
we're working rarely stop.

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:10.120
Even in Haiti.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.310
Haiti is still suffering
from the aftermath

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:15.050
of the earthquake.

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:17.130
Most of the crisis do
continue, because if you're

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:19.460
talking about heightened
security context,

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:22.380
it's usually because there is
no political solution inside.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:23.850
Think of the Congo.

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:26.330
Think of Somalia, South Sudan.

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:27.770
It's been going on for years.

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:31.830
And the problem that we face is
that we deal with these crises.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:35.075
And every year, there's at least
one or two additional crises.

00:21:35.075 --> 00:21:38.610
So this year it was Central
African Republic and the Ebola.

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:40.640
This is why it's always
more, and it always

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:45.560
feels like it was
an exceptional year.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.960
So the accumulation of
crises is definitely

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.430
something that we
feel very strongly,

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:55.280
and we experience very
strongly, both in scale

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:59.855
and in number of countries where
we have to respond to violence.

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:06.960
A second challenge is
related to this slide

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:13.500
here, is actually a constant
need for simplified adapted

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:20.990
versions of medicine and tools,
because you can have the best

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:25.490
diagnostic tool, the most
sophisticated diagnostic tool

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:28.040
will do no good in
a place where there

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:32.190
is no electricity if the
machine is very sensitive,

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:34.020
we won't be able to use it.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:37.950
So we don't want to do
the medicine for the poor.

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:40.040
We don't want to use
very basic stuff.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.140
What we want is to be able
to take the best technology

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:46.080
and to simplify it
as much as possible,

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.050
and to make it field-friendly.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:50.650
So for example, we want
to latest vaccines,

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:53.890
but we want these vaccines
to be heat-stable.

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:57.750
We want these vaccines not to
necessitate a heavy cold chain.

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:00.070
We want these vaccines
to be uni-dose.

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:03.172
We want these vaccines
to be needle-free,

00:23:03.172 --> 00:23:04.130
because it's dangerous.

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:07.000
Because if you have a needle
you need trained health workers.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.040
Whereas if it's just a patch,
or a Listerine, or whatever,

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.790
then it's easier.

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:18.250
So we're trying to look at what
the new science is bringing,

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.400
but also challenge the
way it is designed,

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:27.530
so that it would be more adapted
to the countries where we work.

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:32.120
What we also want to challenge
is the fact that-- and I raised

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:36.720
it earlier-- the fact that
when a disease kills millions

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.550
of people, but that
none of these people

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:42.420
are in our countries, there
is very limited investment

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:43.390
in research.

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:47.630
It's the case for the
disease I mentioned earlier.

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:52.480
But it's also been the case for
HIV AIDS, until HIV reached us.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.960
It's the case for
TB-- tuberculosis.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.125
It's been years without
any single investment

00:23:57.125 --> 00:23:59.540
in tuberculosis,
because we thought

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:04.640
it had been kind of
eradicated in our countries.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.220
So we're trying to
challenge these status

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.320
quo, because
there's nothing more

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.370
frustrating for a
physician than not being

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:16.160
able to treat patients
because the drug is adapted,

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.270
or because it's too expensive,
or because it simply

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:21.680
does not exist.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.815
So challenging
the status quo is,

00:24:24.815 --> 00:24:28.350
I think, very much
part of the identity.

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:33.920
And it forces us, therefore, to
test constantly new regiments,

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:37.650
to advocate for certain
types of research,

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:43.750
and to try to promote research
and development based on needs,

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:47.230
rather than on
market opportunities.

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:50.810
And this is something
that in trying

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:52.310
to define the most
adaptive tool,

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:55.240
Google has played a
very important part.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.900
And I hope that we
can continue to find

00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:01.950
ways to get your expertise.

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:04.610
We have also engaged
ourselves in the development

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:05.620
of our own tools.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:13.200
For example, we've just
finished testing value load

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:17.870
point of care test for
HIV AIDS in Malawi.

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:23.175
We are engaged Ebola clinical
trials in West Africa.

00:25:27.936 --> 00:25:31.180
We believe we are in a good
situation to test these,

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:35.000
but we also don't want to
subsidize the whole R&amp;D

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:35.890
community.

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:37.510
And so it's always
also a balance

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:41.430
to find between where
to invest our resources,

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:46.440
how to take the opportunity
of the cohort, the field,

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:50.400
and the ability to
advance the medicine

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.900
we use with the need to
actually challenge the system,

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:57.200
and make sure that
research and development is

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.160
made in this direction.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:04.600
And the last challenge that
I'd like share with you--

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.980
there are many more, but I
chose those ones because I

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:12.310
though they would maybe
resonate more with you based

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:14.950
on your field of expertise--
is the logistics.

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:17.450
Because even though we
are medical organizations,

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:20.290
nothing can be done
without the logistic.

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:23.080
And I know that
someone in the room

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:26.340
has his brother as a logistician
in Monrovia, as we speak.

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:30.410
And he would the be able to
say more eloquently than I

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:33.390
do how critical it is
for every single aspect

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:34.460
of the operations.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:39.790
From feeding the
teams to setting up

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:43.290
the hospital to ensuring the
transportation and supply

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:44.340
and everything.

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:48.530
So logistics also requires
constant adaptation

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:50.330
and innovation.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:55.980
We have three supply centers
for the organization.

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.070
Again, three.

00:26:57.070 --> 00:27:00.590
And it's a strategic
decision, because imagine

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:02.780
if we have just one
supply center in France,

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:04.370
and there's a strike in France.

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:05.470
What happens?

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:06.110
Right?

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:08.400
So we realized
very early that it

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.960
would be quite dangerous
to try to centralize this.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:15.720
And having three has proved very
helpful, again for the Ebola,

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:19.470
because the supply center in
Belgium became overwhelmed.

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:23.540
And we were happy to be able
to use the other ones for it.

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:27.350
So the supply center's
role is first to identify

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:29.130
the best tool for the fields.

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:31.690
So they are constantly
exploring the market,

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:34.760
but also in a constant back
and forth with the fields.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:39.190
So imagine a physician
from Bellevue Hospital

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:42.500
is coming for a field
assignment with MSF.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.590
And during his
mission he realizes

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:48.100
that we use a tool that
is not very practical.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.840
And he himself has
used a tool in Bellevue

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.690
that is much more convenient.

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:56.810
So there are systems--
he would be in a capacity

00:27:56.810 --> 00:28:01.070
to actually write to the
medical director and so on.

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:03.400
And who would transfer
the information,

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.930
and then would ask
the supply center

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:07.950
to ask for this type of tool.

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:09.990
So we have a constant
back and forth.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:13.490
And the catalogs are
updated every year.

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:17.290
And there are teams working on
trying to improve and refine

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:22.390
the tools that we are
using in the field.

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:25.410
The second role of
the supply center

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:27.185
is, of course, to
ensure that there

00:28:27.185 --> 00:28:29.940
is sufficient supply
in the long run.

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:33.050
Because it's not just about
be preparing an order.

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:34.900
It's also making sure
that the supplier

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:39.825
is going to be able to catch
up with potential increase

00:28:39.825 --> 00:28:42.210
in the needs.

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:44.710
You've seen all these
pictures with the PPE--

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:46.560
the personal
protective equipment

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.940
that we use for the Ebola.

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.440
Actually there's been
a very, very big issue

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:55.740
in terms of supply,
because we have identified

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:59.870
one supplier as the best
quality supplier for it.

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:02.890
And this supplier
has been constrained

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:06.050
by production capacity
after a few months.

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:08.080
So this is really
a challenge that we

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.930
have to face for every
single tool that we use,

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:14.450
making sure that there is
an appropriate supply chain.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.590
What we've done also, and
what you see in these boxes

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:23.460
is we've created some what
we call ready-to-use kits.

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:26.540
So instead of having
to send each item

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.965
to the field in a
separate fashion,

00:29:28.965 --> 00:29:32.240
we know what is needed to
respond to a cholera outbreak.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.860
We know what is
needed to perform

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:37.520
an investigation of measles.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:40.970
We know what is needed
in case of an earthquake.

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:43.740
So we've designed
some kits that's

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:47.770
we've called measles kits,
cholera kits, earthquake

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:51.910
kits, surgical kits,
that contain everything

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:54.390
from the pen, to the bucket,
to the empty biotechs,

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:56.750
to the for a number of patients.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.410
So for example, we
have Cholera 1,000

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:03.600
is a kit for 1,000 people
affected with cholera.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.970
So that the teams on the
ground, since there is also

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:07.760
a lot of turnover,
they don't have

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:10.230
to relearn about everything.

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:13.580
It they know that they're
facing a measles outbreak,

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:16.690
they know that they just need to
figure out how many people they

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:20.640
need to cover, and they
ask for a measles kit.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:24.080
And those kits are also
updated constantly.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.570
And last but not least,
the logistic centers

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:29.190
are in charge of ensuring
the safe transportation

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:31.880
for the goods, which
is another challenge,

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:35.290
because it's not as if you're
just using a regular airline.

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:39.250
And you take the next Delta
flight from Paris to New York.

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:43.265
It's really about
finding your own planes,

00:30:43.265 --> 00:30:48.310
getting the authorization to
enter some countries where

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:49.900
it's not so easy.

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:53.840
Ensuring the cold chain,
also in those areas.

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:56.090
And the logisticians
in the field

00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:59.380
play a very critical
role in negotiating

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:01.830
the entry of the goods,
especially the drugs,

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:05.000
of course, because
it's a sensitive item.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.920
So sometimes one
obstacle might be

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:12.330
that the boxes are stuck in
the airport or the harbor

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:13.370
for several days.

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:14.880
And it's a matter
of life and death,

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:18.580
of course, that you
receive the items.

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:21.300
So this is why I wanted
to insist on logistics,

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:25.440
because it has
always been an issue,

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:28.240
but it is very, very difficult.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.960
In West Africa,
for example, there

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:34.120
were less and less airlines
willing to travel there.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:38.146
So if you don't have a
plane and some person

00:31:38.146 --> 00:31:42.340
ready to bring the
supply, it's an issue.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:48.740
There are numerous barriers
to access in a growing

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:51.500
number of countries in
terms of regulations

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:55.380
and so on, that make our
work simply a big headache.

00:31:55.380 --> 00:32:00.520
So this is something
we are working at.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:06.360
But it's definitely a challenge
in every country where we work.

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:10.250
So I want to finish with
Ebola, because Google

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:14.670
has been very much-- the crisis
team has been involved in it.

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:18.010
You've supported us all along.

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:22.440
And again, I'm sure you've
read a lot about Ebola.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:26.470
so what I want to do is
maybe to share with you more

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:28.675
how we've lived it from inside.

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:39.490
Because for me, this
outbreak of Ebola

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:43.070
exemplifies all the
dysfunctioning of the system

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:48.080
and all our own
limitations and weaknesses.

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.830
I mentioned the fact
that we had made

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:54.020
the choice of not investing
in hemorrhagic fever,

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:57.730
of just having a centralized
hemorrhagic fever unit.

00:32:57.730 --> 00:32:58.920
Too bad.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.210
It was a bad choice.

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:03.760
We've corrected it since
then, but it was a bad choice.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:10.760
The Ebola outbreak also
illustrated de-medicalized, not

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.475
responsive, humanitarian system.

00:33:13.475 --> 00:33:16.130
It took six months
for organizations

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:18.170
to acknowledge that
there was an issue,

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:21.030
and realize the
seriousness of it.

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:26.890
It also exemplifies
how risk-averse

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:31.210
the community is
to the situation.

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:33.990
It's a disease-- Ebola is
a disease for which there

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:38.690
is no drug, no diagnostic
test, no vaccine.

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:40.690
I mean you can't
find worse, right?

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:41.870
There's nothing.

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:42.840
So you had to invent.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:49.370
You had to create and try
what works and what doesn't.

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:52.560
And finally, Ebola
happened in a country--

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:54.780
which is what we
experience in many places--

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:56.650
where the health
system is very, very

00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:59.570
weak, if not disfunctioning.

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:05.710
So you see on the map
the number of programs

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:08.420
that we've opened in
those three countries.

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:11.560
We've also done some work
in Senegal, Mali, and Cote

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:14.659
d'Ivoire, and Nigeria,
mostly in the form

00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:15.960
of technical assistance.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:21.920
The Ministers of Health were
willing and very strongly

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.280
involved in trying to contain.

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.710
They needed the expertise.

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:28.030
So in those countries
we've actually

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:32.520
provided this expertise, and
not engaging in a full program.

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:39.480
And so far, they've been
able to contain the outbreak.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:44.510
How we've lived it from-- I
will finish with the activities.

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:46.429
So we're engaged
in clinical trials,

00:34:46.429 --> 00:34:49.030
both for vaccines and drugs.

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:53.179
We are trying to bring a sort
of comprehensive approach

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:59.790
to the Ebola outbreak, both
in the form of treatment-- we

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:02.490
can't even talk about treatment,
because there's no treatment--

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:05.590
but it's more isolation
center and palliative care

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:08.870
for the sick patients.

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:11.700
But also the community
outreach, the contact tracing,

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:15.340
surveillance, education.

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:18.350
We've provided disinfection
kits for the people

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:21.570
to at least try to mitigate
the risk of contamination

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:24.050
if they have some sick
patients among them,

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:27.010
until they are able to bring
them to a health facility.

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:29.450
The side effects are huge.

00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:31.120
The health system has collapsed.

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:33.650
And actually we don't
have the figures.

00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:37.010
But when we do some
studies, I'm sure we

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:39.040
will be shocked to see
the number of people who

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:41.640
died of other health
issues than Ebola.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.650
But because of Ebola,
because the health

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:45.420
facilities are not functioning.

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:47.890
So what we did recently
was to also distribute

00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:50.080
some prophylaxia
against malaria,

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:55.460
because first, at least
people can be protected,

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:59.410
and also because malaria has
the same symptoms as Ebola.

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:02.460
And if you have
fever, you don't want

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.620
to be in an isolation
center, take

00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:06.510
the risk of being
contaminated with Ebola

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:08.400
if it's only malaria.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:13.250
So we've tried to get
engaged in those aspects.

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:16.530
I don't see what's written,
but psychological support

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:18.830
and anti-malaria
program, I mentioned.

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:19.480
Yes.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.730
Psychological support
is very, very much

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:26.130
needed for the families, for
the patients, and for the staff.

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:29.460
I mentioned at the beginning
that 90% of our teams

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:31.040
are national staff.

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:31.910
What does it mean?

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:35.010
It means that in
the Ebola outbreak,

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:38.140
those teams have been
there since day one.

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:40.300
They are the ones,
they have no break.

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:43.520
Our international teams, they
rotate every five, six weeks.

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:45.090
But for our national
staff, there

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:49.580
hasn't been any single-- I mean,
there's been a few days break,

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:53.290
but it's been
extremely demanding.

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:58.810
So how have we lived
it from inside?

00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:03.550
I have to say that in the
US we've sent about 90 staff

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:06.160
out of the 800
international staff

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.740
that we've sent on this crisis.

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:12.850
And I've never felt such a
high sense of responsibility.

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:16.960
Although we've sent our people
to very dangerous places,

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.220
but there we have
security protocols.

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:22.920
We have always a
capacity to evacuate.

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:25.240
It's one of the criteria
when we open a program,

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.781
we want to make sure
that we're going

00:37:26.781 --> 00:37:31.850
to be able to
withdraw and close.

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:34.830
But in West Africa,
we have no guarantee

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:36.260
of medical evacuations.

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:41.580
And that really consisted
of a very big challenge.

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.860
The limited science
was a big problem.

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.660
When you claim to
treat patients,

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:48.650
but you don't actually
have a treatment,

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:52.140
the high mortality
rate in our center

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:54.620
created a lot of
frustration and tensions

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:56.591
inside the organization.

00:37:56.591 --> 00:37:59.450
There was this big tension
between clinical care

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:01.680
and public health, because
you want to isolate.

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:04.320
You want to break the
chain of the outbreak.

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.982
But you also want to
treat the patients.

00:38:06.982 --> 00:38:08.440
And you have to
choose where you're

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.606
going to put your resources.

00:38:09.606 --> 00:38:12.120
And I can tell you as we
speak that and there's

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:15.300
a huge debate-- a
very heated debate--

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:19.140
inside the organization
about the choices we've made,

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:21.300
and how to go about this.

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.240
The cultural tensions
around the burial practices

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:26.250
were very, very big.

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:29.060
The countries decided
to go for cremation.

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:31.610
It was very poorly
accepted by the community.

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:33.500
And we had to deal with that.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:36.400
Even when we know that the
main source of contamination

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.940
is through the burial practices.

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:43.010
As we speak, we still have 70%
of the people in our treatment

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:49.120
center who attended a funeral
in the past few days, which

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:52.400
gives a sense of how
this is sensitive,

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.890
but also a key in the
management of the outbreak.

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.130
But I want to finish
on a positive note,

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:04.400
and say that Ebola
also made us grow.

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:07.470
We learned more on
the disease than we've

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:11.830
done in the past 20, 30 years,
because we've been confronted

00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:15.300
with such a large scale disease.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.130
We also take pride
of having been there,

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:20.550
standing with this population.

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:22.980
I think that everybody
in the organization

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:25.027
feels very, very
good about it, even

00:39:25.027 --> 00:39:26.235
though we're very frustrated.

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:33.060
One of you was mentioning
the "Business Week" paper

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:36.990
that prompted actually, the
invitation of MSF here today.

00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:40.320
We have fantastic
stories of survivors.

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.920
Everyone coming
back from the field

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:46.800
has amazing stories to say about
solidarity, about mobilization.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:49.220
And then finally,
I want to believe

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:52.560
that this global
awareness, because finally

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.540
the international
community mobilized itself.

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:58.920
The financial means, the fact
that the scientific communities

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.650
that the mobilized together.

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:05.500
I hope that it's going to be
an opportunity for the system--

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.880
for the global health system--
to be more responsible, to be

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:12.450
more driven by the
needs, and more visionary

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:15.370
about the future
of global threats.

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:19.640
Now we stop here, and I'm
happy to answer your questions.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:22.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:25.085 --> 00:40:28.055
AUDIENCE: My question
is, how do you think

00:40:28.055 --> 00:40:29.540
of organizations
like Google.org,

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:32.015
that invests or
supports young start ups

00:40:32.015 --> 00:40:36.286
in the social open
space can be helpful.

00:40:36.286 --> 00:40:37.762
Like, what can we do?

00:40:37.762 --> 00:40:40.222
The technology aspect
drives [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:49.420
SOPHIE DELAUNAY: I think
that what you can do

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:52.670
is clearly identify the gaps.

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:55.080
So making sure
that this is a gap.

00:40:55.080 --> 00:41:00.770
And making sure that it's going
to be helpful, either for us,

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:02.120
but not necessarily for us.

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:04.850
I think that being helpful
for the communities,

00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:06.502
for the local NGOs is something.

00:41:06.502 --> 00:41:08.710
We've had several discussions
with Nigel [INAUDIBLE],

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:10.795
because they came
with ideas sometimes.

00:41:10.795 --> 00:41:12.920
And they say, what about
this, and what about that?

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:17.334
And we're saying, well, we're
not sure there is a need there.

00:41:17.334 --> 00:41:19.000
We're not sure it's
going to be helpful.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.120
We're not sure it's ethical.

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:25.560
It might pose some ethical
problems, perception problems,

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:27.180
that are actually
counterproductive.

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.860
So I think that it's
really about trying

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:35.820
to understand where the needs
are, and how it can contribute.

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:39.380
But it's more of a conversation
on a day-to-day basis

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:45.140
and with see organizations that
are involved on the ground.

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:48.267
I am sorry I don't have
a clearer answer to that.

00:41:51.249 --> 00:41:55.225
AUDIENCE: How often
do individual members

00:41:55.225 --> 00:41:57.710
on the ground breach
your impartiality?

00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:59.698
And what do you do about it?

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:06.630
SOPHIE DELAUNAY: I'm going
to give you an example.

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:08.670
I don't know if this
policy is still standing,

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:11.130
but for many years
we had a policy

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:16.810
that our international
staff based in Gaza Strip

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:20.140
could not stay more
than six months.

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:22.860
Because we had experienced
that after six months,

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:26.020
they were losing their
impartiality because they were

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:28.300
under so much stress,
they were exposed

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:31.930
to a certain facet
of the problem.

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:34.920
And so the way we do
that is definitely

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:45.380
to anticipate the risk, but
also when we are-- sometimes

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:48.060
it's the person
himself or herself

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:51.870
who has to be evacuated,
because they can't stand it.

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:58.160
And they don't trust their
local partners anymore.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.420
They don't want to work there.

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:04.430
I remember I worked in Rwanda
in 1995 after the genocide.

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:08.380
And I witnessed a
massacre in Kibeho.

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:12.690
It was May 1995.

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:16.380
And I was in the
coordination team.

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:18.870
I was dealing with the
Rwandan authorities.

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:20.870
And I was personally
very shocked

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:25.960
and disgusted by the way--
you know-- it was handled.

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:30.970
And I asked the organization
to stop my mission after that,

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:34.370
because I didn't see how
I could responsibility

00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:37.700
engage with the
local authorities

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:39.230
after what had happened.

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:44.286
And I has lost my
impartiality, let's say.

00:43:44.286 --> 00:43:46.871
So it's really more
about responsible.

00:43:46.871 --> 00:43:49.370
And sometimes it's going to be
your boss who's going to say,

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:50.078
you're losing it.

00:43:50.078 --> 00:43:51.810
It's better that
you go back home.

00:43:51.810 --> 00:43:55.620
NIGEL: Can you ask the
people to go to a microphone?

00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:58.120
SOPHIE DELAUNAY: Maybe I should
repeat the question, right.

00:43:58.120 --> 00:43:58.620
Sorry.

00:43:58.620 --> 00:43:59.695
I forgot.

00:43:59.695 --> 00:44:00.195
OK.

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:08.300
AUDIENCE: I have a question
regarding impartiality,

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:09.250
as well.

00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:12.660
So a few years back there
was a high profile incident

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:15.460
of the CIA using a
vaccination program

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:19.550
to gather genetic information
and conduct military strikes.

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:22.252
How has that impacted
people's perception of Doctors

00:44:22.252 --> 00:44:24.585
Without Borders, especially
in Middle Eastern countries?

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.700
SOPHIE DELAUNAY: This
incident-- I mean, this tactic,

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:36.710
let's say-- has not had an
immediate and direct impact,

00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:40.580
but has largely
contributed to a growing

00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:46.520
perception against humanitarian
aid workers performing

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:48.000
vaccinations.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:54.250
But it's not just these
tactics We actually

00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:57.090
reacted against it
when it happened.

00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:59.070
We expressed our
concern by the fact

00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:03.390
that humanitarian and medical
aid was instrumentalized.

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:09.170
And it is de facto more
difficult to gain acceptance

00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:11.980
and trust if you
claim that you're

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:15.430
going to do vaccinations, and
the CIA just came by the week

00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:20.420
before and using
vaccination as a tactic.

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:25.525
But in the incidents
that happened afterwards,

00:45:25.525 --> 00:45:28.580
you know there's been a series
of killings of vaccinators

00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:31.310
in Pakistan, but
also in Nigeria.

00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:37.150
The CIA tactic is not
the only reason for that.

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:39.350
The approach of the
global health community

00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:42.320
toward vaccination is
also largely responsible,

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:48.645
in our view, for the loss of
trust in vaccination practices.

00:45:55.475 --> 00:45:59.850
The urge, for example,
to eradicate polio,

00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:03.460
and the amount of resources--
so polio is not good.

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:05.520
We all agree with that.

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:09.160
We need to address polio.

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:12.130
But there's been
so many resources

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:17.020
devoted to polio compared
to other health issues,

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:21.760
that it also has created
a perception that it

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:25.230
has contributed to the
attacks on vaccination.

00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:28.030
In Pakistan there are
people who are suffering

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:30.100
from a number of health issues.

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:33.990
And they might not think that
polio is a priority, right?

00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:37.400
So this is to say in
answer to your question

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:41.420
that we are very much
against and concerned

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:47.800
by those practices of using
humanitarian aid to cover

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:50.290
military or political action.

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:55.610
But that the discredit on
health workers cannot be only

00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:58.010
attributed to these practices.

00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:00.050
We also have our
own responsibilities

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:04.760
when we choose the type of
global health agenda and action

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:05.750
that we put in place.

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:08.790
And we have to
make sure that when

00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:13.080
we decide to enter and
vaccination or eradication,

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:16.470
it is also considered a priority
for the communities that

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:17.700
are affected by these issues.

00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:24.370
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:26.270
You talked about
evacuation earlier,

00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:29.600
as one consideration before
you set up a treatment center.

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:31.720
What are some of the
other major questions

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:34.660
that you think about before
setting up a treatment center?

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:36.400
And are there places
that you simply

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.690
won't send your staff to?

00:47:40.305 --> 00:47:41.680
SOPHIE DELAUNAY:
So your question

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:43.510
is only about security, right?

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:45.135
Or it's about the
global criteria?

00:47:45.135 --> 00:47:45.827
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:45.827 --> 00:47:46.660
SOPHIE DELAUNAY: OK.

00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:51.640
So evacuation is a criteria
in a high security area.

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:55.860
It's not a criteria
everywhere, of course, right?

00:47:55.860 --> 00:48:00.440
But the main criteria for
deciding to open a center

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:04.890
is mortality, of course.

00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:08.030
So are we going to
have an added value?

00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:10.030
There can be high mortality,
but we know nothing

00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:11.300
about this disease, right?

00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:12.930
Or we can't do
anything about it.

00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:14.770
So its our own added value.

00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:17.880
And is there anybody
else who can do it?

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:20.200
Is there is another
organization better

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:23.410
placed to respond than us?

00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:26.660
So this would be the
first criteria to decide.

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:29.670
So neglect is very
important, as you see,

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:31.590
because it's both
can we do something

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:33.040
about it that others can't do?

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:36.658
And is it really killing people?

00:48:36.658 --> 00:48:39.714
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:39.714 --> 00:48:40.630
SOPHIE DELAUNAY: Yeah.

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:42.410
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:47.060
You mentioned the concept
of operational neutrality

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:51.540
and keeping your donations
from governments to 15%

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:54.080
to sort of safeguard that.

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:57.134
What about investment
neutrality?

00:48:57.134 --> 00:48:58.550
And what I mean
by that is, well I

00:48:58.550 --> 00:49:00.216
guess there's really
two questions here.

00:49:00.216 --> 00:49:03.380
So number one is, is
there government money

00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:06.940
that you're saying
no to to guarantee

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:08.720
your operational neutrality?

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:12.540
And number two is, the concept
of investment neutrality

00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:15.100
would be you mentioned the
fact that there a lot of things

00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:18.340
you'd like investment in, but
the problem is those things

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:21.250
don't happen in maybe,
like the West, right?

00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:23.410
So there isn't an
investment in those things,

00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:24.840
because people don't see it.

00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:28.780
So is there a way to
maybe-- you're not

00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:30.880
taking operational
monies, but you're

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.650
taking investment money that can
be redirected to those causes?

00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:40.010
SOPHIE DELAUNAY: Yes.

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:42.900
There are definitely
investments that we

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:44.820
wouldn't take from government.

00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:49.282
It's not just about taking
funding from government or not.

00:49:49.282 --> 00:49:54.150
It's about-- we may, for
example, receive funding

00:49:54.150 --> 00:50:02.080
from the field for some
research, for medical research.

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:04.660
But we may not
want the funding--

00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:07.430
we would not want the funding
from defeat for Afghanistan,

00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:08.110
for example.

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:08.610
Right?

00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:11.990
So depending on the
nature of the funding,

00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:14.245
we will make some arbitration.

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:21.530
If I understood your
question, is there

00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:24.710
a way not to get the money, but
to ensure that this money is

00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:28.980
invested so that it
serves our purpose, right?

00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:31.760
Well, this is what we try
to do through advocacy.

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.300
And this is why I
said we don't want

00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:36.940
to be constantly
filling the gaps.

00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:39.850
If there is no drug for
TB, it's not for MSF

00:50:39.850 --> 00:50:42.285
to develop a drug for TB, right?

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:52.040
We have at dedicated some
resources to our advocacy

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:57.350
so that we can try to influence
and mobilize the stakeholders--

00:50:57.350 --> 00:51:00.770
so, big pharma, the large
organizations like Garvey,

00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:02.350
like the Gates Foundations.

00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:04.410
And we have actually
people who are working

00:51:04.410 --> 00:51:06.980
on trying to influence their
agenda, and making sure

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:10.910
that they are paying
attention to those aspects.

00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:15.010
We also where I think we
are the most successful

00:51:15.010 --> 00:51:19.810
is trying to demonstrate
that the protocol work.

00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:22.360
And then having WHO-- the
World Health Organization--

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:26.220
adopt this as
normative protocol,

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:28.280
because then it's the
best way for the countries

00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:33.076
to demand that those
protocols be applied.

00:51:33.076 --> 00:51:34.450
And when you have
a protocol, you

00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:38.290
need to have medicines that
also is adapted to them.

00:51:38.290 --> 00:51:41.640
We're also worked at
providing some specification.

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:46.625
For example, we're working
with a number of lab

00:51:46.625 --> 00:51:49.650
who are working at
point-of-care test.

00:51:49.650 --> 00:51:53.620
And we provide them
with the wish list

00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:56.110
of what would be an
ideal point-of-care test

00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:58.962
in the countries where we work.

00:51:58.962 --> 00:51:59.670
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:05.640
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
whether in MSF there's

00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:08.450
any group-- small
or big-- related

00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:10.710
to information technology.

00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:12.440
Basically our cousins.

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:16.680
Is there any group either
absorbing technologies

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:19.820
or inventing some for
the scenario Cerf by MSF?

00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:26.060
SOPHIE DELAUNAY: So we
have in New York, actually,

00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:31.060
a team that has been asked
to develop health information

00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:33.430
system for the field.

00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:37.830
And I think it would be
super helpful to connect you

00:52:37.830 --> 00:52:40.810
with them, definitely.

00:52:40.810 --> 00:52:44.160
We have a number
of people working

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:47.670
on some specific technology.

00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:51.770
So we have information
system, but I

00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:57.880
have to say that we're very--
we're vintage in MSF on this.

00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:04.190
And it takes time to get even
up to speed in our headquarters

00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:06.820
with what would be
the good system.

00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:09.930
So I don't think it's
a good use of people

00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:12.850
like you to actually
mobilize you on that.

00:53:12.850 --> 00:53:15.020
We need to catch up
on a number of things

00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:16.045
in terms of our systems.

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:21.940
We're better at medical
technology, of course,

00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:23.630
because this is our priority.

00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:27.180
We also have a number
of people working

00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:29.490
on innovations in logistics.

00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:32.440
This is an area
that is interesting.

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:35.670
I've been supporting
one of our teams

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:40.820
who was asked to look,
for example, after Haiti,

00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:49.390
at the management of
waste, because in most

00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:53.110
of the countries, you actually
don't have the industry that

00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:55.450
can eliminate some waste.

00:53:55.450 --> 00:53:55.990
Right?

00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:57.720
So we have our own incinerators.

00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:00.695
But an incinerator does
not eliminate everything.

00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:08.170
And we needed to
figure out whether it

00:54:08.170 --> 00:54:11.110
was better to create our
own management on site,

00:54:11.110 --> 00:54:14.380
or to export our
waste, and make sure

00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:17.370
that it is done in a safe
way in another country.

00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:20.610
In the case of
Haiti, we've actually

00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:24.200
concluded that it was better
to reexport the waste.

00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:25.040
And it's been done.

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:29.020
We had a contract with
a company in the US

00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:33.110
who has imported the waste
that we made from Haiti.

00:54:33.110 --> 00:54:35.890
So there are so many,
so many different areas

00:54:35.890 --> 00:54:40.350
where we look at possible
technical solutions.

00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:42.840
But in terms of
telecommunication and health

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:45.040
information system,
it's really something

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:48.850
we definitely
welcome some support.

00:54:48.850 --> 00:54:56.630
And in terms of the
usual communication

00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:59.880
for the regular functioning
of the organization,

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:02.060
we are far behind, and
we need to catch up

00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:05.711
before we can be a
valuable partner to you.

00:55:05.711 --> 00:55:07.460
NIGEL: This is probably
the last question,

00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:09.028
if that's OK because
we're coming up

00:55:09.028 --> 00:55:11.640
to the limit of our time.

00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:12.750
AUDIENCE: Real quick.

00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:14.479
One question, one
request for comment.

00:55:14.479 --> 00:55:16.520
Question-- what do you
guys use for communication

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:18.510
and collaboration
type technologies?

00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:23.620
Are you using Google
Apps or Microsoft?

00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:26.190
Or what's your email?

00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:28.000
SOPHIE DELAUNAY:
It's Lotus Notes.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:28.934
AUDIENCE: Lotus Notes?

00:55:28.934 --> 00:55:30.100
SOPHIE DELAUNAY: It's awful.

00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:31.141
AUDIENCE: We should talk.

00:55:31.141 --> 00:55:32.190
We should talk.

00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:35.960
The second is, any comments
on the situation in Myanmar?

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:38.490
I know you guys were in the
news quite a bit on the Rohingya

00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:39.780
situation.

00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:40.950
SOPHIE DELAUNAY: Yeah.

00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:42.530
It's a dramatic situation.

00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:45.220
And we're still in negotiation
with the government.

00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:47.810
We have got the
authorization to be

00:55:47.810 --> 00:55:50.840
working in [INAUDIBLE] state.

00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:53.700
So there's a line
of communication

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:54.780
with the authorities.

00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:57.720
But the acceptance on the
ground is very, very difficult.

00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:00.700
So there is so much tension
within the communities

00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:02.950
that even with a
political agreement,

00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:05.210
it's very challenging
to work there.

00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:06.335
The situation is explosive.

00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:10.010
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:11.926
NIGEL: I was going to
probably make a comment,

00:56:11.926 --> 00:56:14.400
having worked with MSF offices
in the field over the years,

00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:15.589
and had run my own.

00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:17.880
There's some very good reasons
why Lotus Notes persists

00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:19.879
in many organizations
that operate in the field,

00:56:19.879 --> 00:56:22.497
partly because the way
it does synchronization.

00:56:22.497 --> 00:56:24.330
Though there are often
better solutions now.

00:56:24.330 --> 00:56:26.570
But organizations still
trying to jump out of that,

00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:28.050
and figure out where to go.

00:56:28.050 --> 00:56:29.170
But that's one of
the big constraints

00:56:29.170 --> 00:56:31.336
is that they might be archaic
systems in some sense,

00:56:31.336 --> 00:56:36.230
but the web just doesn't work
in most of these places, right?

00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:37.400
I wish.

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:39.940
But I was going to say, thank
you very much for coming.

00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:43.920
I had a question myself, which
is really about how you manage

00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:45.970
innovation, because
humanitarianism

00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:47.994
is a very difficult
place to do innovation,

00:56:47.994 --> 00:56:49.160
because of the consequences.

00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:51.730
The downside risk is so huge.

00:56:51.730 --> 00:56:54.770
And you talk about sort of
running in parallel situations

00:56:54.770 --> 00:56:57.356
as a chance for allowing
different solutions to emerge.

00:56:57.356 --> 00:56:59.230
But one of the things
I say, I'm on the board

00:56:59.230 --> 00:57:00.860
of the Humanitarian
Innovation Fund,

00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:04.020
is the way you organize
that critically

00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:06.150
makes a huge difference
for how things work.

00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:07.760
So that was going
to be my question.

00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:10.190
We probably don't have time
for a lengthy answer on that,

00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:12.660
but I was just going to say,
thank you so much for coming.

00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:14.670
We all really, really
appreciate your insights,

00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:15.580
and what you've
been able to share.

00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:16.704
SOPHIE DELAUNAY: Thank you.

00:57:16.704 --> 00:57:17.380
Thanks.

00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:20.430
[APPLAUSE]
