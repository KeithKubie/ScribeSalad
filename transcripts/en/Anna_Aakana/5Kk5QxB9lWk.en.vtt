00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.920
My parents raised me on an accomplishment system.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.320
So for every A earned, I'd get $10.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.300
For every page of a book read, I'd get a penny.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.260
For every video sponsored, today's being Google Chrome,

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.480
I would get capital to fund passion projects or increase my production value.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.800
I grew up being taught that hard work leads to reward.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.480
That reward usually being candy or comic books or Titanic on VHS.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.760
But I get it.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.600
Not everybody has Asian parents to instill a work ethic in them from birth.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.540
So how exactly do you just get stuff done?

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.340
Well first, of course, I'd say...

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.220
[Friendly Anna]: Hey...

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.780
Would you like some candy?

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.720
*shakes box*

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.800
Come on.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.320
All you got to do is turn in that paper.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.050
Look at this delicious candy.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.600
Come on.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.200
All you gotta do is turn over that ten-page-MLA-formatted-essay on the possible-impacts-of-biological-warfare. And this is all yours.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.120
[Anna]: If you want to get stuff done,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.940
One. Stop multitasking.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.940
Numerous studies have proven that multitasking actually leads to getting less done throughout the day.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.200
You have to focus on one task at a time.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.120
Now in the days of tech, I know that can kind of seem counter-intuitive,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.320
because we have to use so many apps in conjunction just to complete a single task.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.580
And we often get sidetracked by social media

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.400
or side projects since we're so busy zipping around our screens.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.340
But I cannot stress this enough,

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.800
if you actually want to be productive, you have to focus on one thing at a time.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.320
Second: Prioritize your to-do list by what's most important and make it results-oriented.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.320
So if today I say, my most important task is to get some sketching done.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.500
I will put that at the top of my list and write out exactly how many sketches I want to finish.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.199
Whether that's one or three or six, if you make your to-do list results-oriented you get...

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.250
Results. And finally be realistic with your schedule.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.200
I have definitely tried to over pack my Google Calendar with things,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.100
without taking in real life necessities into account. Like meals or relaxation

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.240
or how long it takes to drive from place to place in LA.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.020
When you set an impossible standard for yourself,

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.520
and you're not meeting those goals,

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.959
then you'll find yourself less motivated because you're not getting as much done as you expect.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.740
Versus if you're pacing yourself and completely finishing your day's work,

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.220
you feel more motivated that night when you go to bed and ready for the next day's tasks.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.260
I hope this helps you get stuff done. And if all else fails... [Friendly Anna] *being creepy*

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.920
I'm Anna Akana, stay right here for a sponsored message.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.920
I want to say thank you so much to Google Chromebook for sponsoring today's video.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.120
The Chromebook starts up in seconds.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.820
And it doesn't slow down over time.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.000
My favorite aspect of the Chromebook is that the battery lasts 10 hours.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.240
So I can either binge something on Netflix

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.980
or I can work on a plane without worrying that I have to go scramble and find an outlet.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.320
Plus if you're a creative type, it comes with a stylus.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.620
It's really cute and precise. And you saw me draw all those cats, but it can also go into tablet mode,

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.860
or if you want to view it while you're lying down, it does this thing called "clamshell".

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:54.980
That's pretty cool.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.580
Your files never get lost, are constantly saved, and you can access them from your phone, tablet, or any of your other devices.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.400
