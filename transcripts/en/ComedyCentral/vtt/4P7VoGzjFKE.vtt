00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.880
When I was talking to Gregg last night I noticed that he sounded

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:05.470
Horribly sick

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.010
And I did he says he feels fine

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.189
But he's still coughing and wheezing and hacking so I'm making him where I'm making him wear the mask to keep us all safe

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.529
All of us not just not just the people in the studio people listening to this podcast now

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.839
Let's go to Los Angeles where last week the Rams beat the Seahawks?

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.619
But probably the most noteworthy thing from the game

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.319
Where was that two different players Tyler Lockett of the Seahawks and Brandon cooks of the rams

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:41.369
Went out of their way to give a football to Floyd Mayweather after scoring a touchdown. Yeah Floyd medley way

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.989
There was a in the front row in the end zone and a couple teams came and gave him give him footballs

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.719
One person from each team scored a touchdown and gave him the football Cooke said I go kind of track the ball down

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.160
So he could get it and give yeah

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.520
But it wasn't like he had to run like he spiked it and I was like I want to give him anyway

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.939
I was pretty cool. I liked the Greg actually tweeted about this and I think that I think the actual tweet was

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.369
Giving Floyd Mayweather. The the football man zone is the touch TD celebration of the year

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.479
I know cuz I like the tweet and then you deleted it probably rightly

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.539
So I almost never delete any tweets, but it felt like I was trying to you know

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.269
kind of make fun of the situation but then

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.310
You know the nuance maybe would have been been lost on some of the people it didn't didn't seem worth

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.530
I don't know whining anyone surprised, you know

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.839
I mean you got you got two teams playing football and then you've got one of the biggest

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.220
Domestic violence abusers in the world that we know of sitting in the front row. You got to get him the ball

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.979
You got to get involved, you know, both teams have domestic abusers on them

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.618
of course they do and yeah, they're playing they're playing a little hearts out giving 110% but when he got Floyd

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.529
Beat up every woman. He's ever dated Mayweather sitting in the front row. You gotta get on the ball

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.750
You gotta feed him the ball either team giving them the ball. I think that's what the NFL is all about, especially in

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.439
November

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.439
Gregg what you have to say about that

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.310
Anything about that so your theory here is that

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:20.040
Even in a field of athlete's foot in in domestic abusers that you're saying Floyd Mayweather it stands apart

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.379
I'm seeing the NFL more than any other league values certain qualities and it's in its athletes and

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.089
Domestic abuse certainly seems to be up near the top of the list. They've been

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.559
I'm surprised they don't they don't make it part of the combine

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.089
The way the league is going so when you see Floyd Mayweather, you gotta get him the damn ball

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.700
And that's what they did Greg you chicken down

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.720
by the way

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.139
My little more like menacing with this mask on you feel like you can't see me smiling saying over these things you're like bang so

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.559
listeners to the decimal Nick and Rosenthal vanity project

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.619
Junior vice president well know that last week

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.260
We really created a stir with our talked about the migrant Caravan and okay

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.419
The election happened and it's been out of the news

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.479
But you know what the migrant Caravan it's still it's still heading north hasn't even slowed down

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.899
No, it's opting for a safer slightly different route now

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.459
There was an update on Tuesday, but we've been getting a lot of questions about but if anything

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.329
I think the Caravan sped up. Do you know I mean, they know we've been talking about him and

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.220
There were a lot of critics last week saying we shouldn't have talked about this

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.760
But listen, even though the elections over and people when talking about it, we're gonna dig deep and we're gonna keep talking about the caravan

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.340
every single episode

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.609
Until some of them are in our government

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.789
like until they've reached that level we talked about them if they could play in the NFL last year over last week and you were

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.519
Saying they would get crushed by other teams

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.529
And I think a lot of that was it was your political bias

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.089
But now that you've kind of done a little deeper digging into the caravan

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.190
What are the chances the NFL would expand the caravan? I?

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:10.050
was like because think about they were gonna have a game in Mexico City, you know that they could be the Mexico City Caravan and

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.959
Which is a better name than a lot of teams out and they could turn around. I mean you're right

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.830
I feel like the NFL after

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.299
Taking this game. It was supposed to be in Mexico City. The field wasn't ready

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.079
So now they're moving it to Los Angeles. They need to make it up to that market

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.749
Turn the caravan around start getting ready for 2019 does anyone I mean does anyone else in the NFL think it's hilarious

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.449
The game was canceled due to landscaping problems

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.030
Like no one made a joke about that like that's that's the issue guys get it together down there

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.969
I think that you know the NFL's about money, but I bet if you get these four thousand migrants together

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:53.098
Turn them upside down shake them. They gotta have some money on them pull that money together

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.539
You can buy yourself an NFL team. I mean they could they could be like the Green Bay Packers

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.210
Only they own themselves. It's not just the city that owns the team the caravan owns its own team

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.859
And we've been I've sent some scouts out there to get some forty times

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:10.469
See what kind of vertical leap they got

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.399
But I think the caravan I think their playoff team next year. I mean

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:23.430
But the the NFL is all about merchandising, you know, that's why they have every team as so many different types of uniforms

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.609
What would the mascot be for the caravan?

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:29.819
Maybe just just an actual

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:38.039
Caravan, I wake some heads that's a you could not have used your imagination less to come up with the mascot for the caravan

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:41.759
Then you just did great. I think a crying baby a

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.190
Crying baby would be the mascot almost like actually is that the mascot of the New Orleans pelicans?

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.949
They have the king cake baby. King cake, baby. Yeah, it would be like that only darker

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:57.059
I think that would be a good like the huddle buddy

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.659
You tell me you wouldn't buy the Mexico City caravans huddle, buddy

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.279
The NFL's been looking for like a way to do kind of a Developmental League ever since NFL Europe

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.879
Has been gone. I didn't know it was gone. It's been gone for 20 years now. Okay, so

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.299
You mentioned 4,000 people. I mean that they could maybe make a

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:20.399
Caravan league unto its own. It's not just 4,000 people 4,000 athletes

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.490
in their prime

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:25.629
That's what I've been told

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:28.739
I just think the NFL is gonna get bigger and better and

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.989
This Caravan is the answer to almost all the problems and listen. Let me tell you something else

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.740
I've been looking at the comments on the videos people getting upset

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:46.639
yeah, there's videos on YouTube of to the podcast a lot of very upset people people were yelling at me forgetting about the politics let

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:48.090
me say this without

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.090
involving politics whatsoever

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:55.820
Zero politics. No red. No blue. No anything if you were afraid of the caravan

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.600
You were small if you were afraid of immigrants

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:02.569
You were small if you were afraid of women

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:08.149
If you were a misogynist you were small if you were afraid of black people you were a small person and you were scared

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:10.440
Don't be small

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.190
America is not small be big like me

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:20.510
Be I'm I weigh a fucking ton and I'm not threatened or scared of any Caravan or any woman

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:25.190
Or any black person or even Greg's wife none of them?

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.710
You
