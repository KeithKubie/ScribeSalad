uh just very simple says welcome to
gravity fall very simple uh but now the

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390
gravity fall very simple uh but now the
 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.390
gravity fall very simple uh but now the
way you decode this cuz then what does

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400
way you decode this cuz then what does
 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.120
way you decode this cuz then what does
that mean there could mean anything

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130
that mean there could mean anything
 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.250

okay but this no this is really
 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.350
okay but this no this is really
interesting cuz do you know how to

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360
interesting cuz do you know how to
 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.830
interesting cuz do you know how to
decode it I did I I thought I just saw

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840
decode it I did I I thought I just saw
 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.630

paused it for three seconds I mean there
 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.090
paused it for three seconds I mean there
was like a bad scramble hand there at

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100
was like a bad scramble hand there at
 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.890
was like a bad scramble hand there at
the end and then but all I know K by not

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900
the end and then but all I know K by not
 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.990
the end and then but all I know K by not
I almost have you're gonna see some

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000
I almost have you're gonna see some
 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.449
I almost have you're gonna see some
random letters that seem to be like you

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459
random letters that seem to be like you
 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.400
random letters that seem to be like you
know maybe kind of wheel for J like

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410
know maybe kind of wheel for J like
 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.440
know maybe kind of wheel for J like
maybe the spaces are letters or you know

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450
maybe the spaces are letters or you know
 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.060
maybe the spaces are letters or you know
something like that but what just top

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070
something like that but what just top
 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.770
something like that but what just top
your head would you think of gonna I

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780
your head would you think of gonna I
 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.199
your head would you think of gonna I
quit I mean that's why I maybe it's an

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209
quit I mean that's why I maybe it's an
 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.120
quit I mean that's why I maybe it's an
anagram maybe it's mathematical maybe

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130
anagram maybe it's mathematical maybe
 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.160
anagram maybe it's mathematical maybe
it's I have no idea I just saw it only

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170
it's I have no idea I just saw it only
 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.789
it's I have no idea I just saw it only
once

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799
once
 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.920
once
okay no here's and get only three

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930
okay no here's and get only three
 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.020
okay no here's and get only three
seconds okay cuz again I cheated I

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030
seconds okay cuz again I cheated I
 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.240
seconds okay cuz again I cheated I
looked online uh but this is really

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250
looked online uh but this is really
 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.860
looked online uh but this is really
fascinating so okay at the beginning

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870
fascinating so okay at the beginning
 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.380
fascinating so okay at the beginning
credits um they show you a whole bunch

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390
credits um they show you a whole bunch
 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.420
credits um they show you a whole bunch
of stuff and when the title pops up you

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430
of stuff and when the title pops up you
 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.800
of stuff and when the title pops up you
hear kind of this whisper you know like

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810
hear kind of this whisper you know like
 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.810
hear kind of this whisper you know like
this like that it just sounds like

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820
this like that it just sounds like
 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.060
this like that it just sounds like
nonsense if you listen closely done

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070
nonsense if you listen closely done
 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.710
nonsense if you listen closely done
sound like anything apparently if you

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720
sound like anything apparently if you
 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.930
sound like anything apparently if you
play it backwards it says three letters

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940
play it backwards it says three letters
 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.180
play it backwards it says three letters
back huh well that's weird

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190
back huh well that's weird
 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.410
back huh well that's weird
and then when you go to the VN the jumbo

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420
and then when you go to the VN the jumbo
 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.090
and then when you go to the VN the jumbo
apparently with every letter you just go

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100
apparently with every letter you just go
 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.950
apparently with every letter you just go
three letters back and that gives you

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960
three letters back and that gives you
 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.810
three letters back and that gives you
you know the correct letter and that

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820
you know the correct letter and that
 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.280
you know the correct letter and that
spells out the message that's it

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290
spells out the message that's it
 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.430
spells out the message that's it
Oh bullshit you have to play something

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440
Oh bullshit you have to play something
 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.350
Oh bullshit you have to play something
backwards but one normal viewer would go

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360
backwards but one normal viewer would go
 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.660
backwards but one normal viewer would go
and play something backwards oh it's

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670
and play something backwards oh it's
 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:45.620
and play something backwards oh it's
pretty obvious

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630
pretty obvious
 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.970
pretty obvious
oh yeah bullsh that's why you couldn't

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980
oh yeah bullsh that's why you couldn't
 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.760
oh yeah bullsh that's why you couldn't
figure out um but I don't even think I

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770
figure out um but I don't even think I
 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.170
figure out um but I don't even think I

Adventure Time like I said it does have

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.010
Adventure Time like I said it does have
 

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.260
Adventure Time like I said it does have
even more mystery and even more

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:01.270

and the the characters and I think

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:17.350
and the the characters and I think
 

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:18.780
and the the characters and I think
