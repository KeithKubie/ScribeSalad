00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:11.678
UM...
[blows raspberries]

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:14.982
I'M DRUNK AS [bleep].

00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:16.350
WHOO!

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.187
SO SHE WAS EXAMINED BY A DOCTOR.
LIKE, HOW TALL IS SHE?

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:23.257
AND THE NURSE WOULD BE LIKE,
COME AND LOOK AT HOW TALL

00:00:23.257 --> 00:00:25.659
THIS NELLIE IS.

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:27.594
AND DOCTOR WOULD SAY, LIKE,

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:31.732
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
AFTER WE MEASURE NELLIE BLY?

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:35.869
AFTER THE NURSE AND DOCTOR
FLIRTED FOR, LIKE, A HALF-HOUR,

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:39.406
THE DOCTOR'S LIKE,
OH, MY GOD.

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:43.343
THIS NELLIE BLY,
SHE IS A CRAZY, CRAZY PERSON

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:45.512
THAT NEEDS TO BE HERE FOREVER.

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:49.483
AND NELLIE BLY WAS LIKE, YES!

00:00:49.483 --> 00:00:53.020
I'M SO HAPPY.
I'M SUCH A GOOD JOURNALIST.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.189
SHE STARTED TO SEE HOW [bleep]
THE CONDITIONS WERE.

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:58.292
THE NURSES WOULD JUST BEAT
THE [bleep] OUT OF PEOPLE.

00:00:58.292 --> 00:01:00.060
KNOCK THEM IN THEIR EARS.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.495
[blows raspberries]

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:03.063
HITTING THEM LIKE CRAZY.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.532
LIKE, YOU WOMEN ARE ALL CRAZY,
AND YOU SUCK.

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:07.534
AND NELLIE BLY WAS LIKE,
AW, [bleep].

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:09.837
THAT AIN'T COOL.
I'M GONNA WRITE THAT DOWN.

00:01:09.837 --> 00:01:11.972
THESE LADIES ARE GONNA GET
A WORD FROM ME.

00:01:11.972 --> 00:01:16.510
SHE SEES PERFECTLY SANE WOMEN
WHO JUST DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.613
THE DOCTORS WERE LIKE,
WE DON'T SPEAK GERMAN.

00:01:19.613 --> 00:01:21.415
YOU'RE CRAZY.
[blows raspberries]

00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:23.217
YOU GO TO THE ASYLUM FOR LIFE.

00:01:23.217 --> 00:01:24.551
AND THERE WAS A WOMAN,

00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:26.420
SHE WAS LIKE, I JUST
GOT A LITTLE OVERWHELMED.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.455
I'M NOT CRAZY.

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:32.492
AND THEY WERE LIKE,
THIS WOMAN IS IN--SO INSANE.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:34.661
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO BUT
KEEP HER LOCKED UP AT THIS

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:36.697
IN-SYLUM FOREVER.

00:01:36.697 --> 00:01:38.932
THE INSANE ASYLUM WAS HORRIBLE.

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:41.902
AND THEN THERE'S THE--THE BATHS.

00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:45.172
THE NURSES WOULD JUST SCRUB
THE [bleep] OUT OF THEM,

00:01:45.172 --> 00:01:47.774
AND NELLIE BLY WOULD BE LIKE,
THIS KIND OF HURTS A LITTLE BIT.

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:51.311
SHE WAS LIKE, YOU BE QUIET
OR I WILL--I WILL--I WILL

00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:54.114
MAKE YOU WISH YOU NEVER
SAID ANYTHING TO ME.

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.983
I'LL SCRUB YOU SO HARD.

00:01:55.983 --> 00:01:56.984
- WOW.

00:01:56.984 --> 00:01:59.319
- I GOT AT LEAST
TWO BATHING SUITS.

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.788
SHOULD WE PUT THEM ON
AND GET IN THE TUB?

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:03.323
- REALLY?

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:05.926
- YOU DON'T HAVE THE BALLS
TO GET IN THE TUB WITH ME

00:02:05.926 --> 00:02:08.562
WITH A BATHING SUIT, DO YOU?

00:02:08.562 --> 00:02:08.629
- [laughs]
