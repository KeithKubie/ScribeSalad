00:00:05.114 --> 00:00:08.198
Well, I must say it was the time

00:00:08.198 --> 00:00:11.166
when we had to open up grease interceptors.

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.457
And grease interceptors are these tanks

00:00:13.457 --> 00:00:15.563
that they are underground

00:00:15.563 --> 00:00:16.763
that all the food waste

00:00:16.763 --> 00:00:18.953
coming from a restaurant would go into,

00:00:18.953 --> 00:00:21.873
and it's supposed to trap grease and food particles.

00:00:21.873 --> 00:00:24.293
And we had to open these manholes

00:00:24.293 --> 00:00:27.560
and extract samples from these grease interceptors.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.705
And we had to do one

00:00:28.705 --> 00:00:31.649
where we had to monitor it for 24 hours,

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:37.312
and it was really quite difficult working conditions.

00:00:37.312 --> 00:00:39.847
But we realized it was very important to do this

00:00:39.847 --> 00:00:41.850
because we had to understand what was happening

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.780
inside these grease interceptors,

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.270
so that we could understand the fate

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.419
of a lot of contaminants that entered the sewer systems,

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:49.965
and the wastewater treatment plants,

00:00:49.965 --> 00:00:52.226
and eventually our rivers and lakes.
