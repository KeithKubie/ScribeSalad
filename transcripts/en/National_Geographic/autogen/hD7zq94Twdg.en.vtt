scientists determine if those changes

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610

changes which we would call geo

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900

morphological changes to the coastline

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910
morphological changes to the coastline
 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.009
morphological changes to the coastline
can be assigned to any singular event of

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019
can be assigned to any singular event of
 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.410
can be assigned to any singular event of
oil washing up or if it's just business
