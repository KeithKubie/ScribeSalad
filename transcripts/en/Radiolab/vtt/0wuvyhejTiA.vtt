00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:02.843
[inaudible].

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.030
<v 2>I'm Jad Abumrad today on radiolab.</v>

3
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:10.140
Robert Krulwich and I are tackling a question which is very big in neuroscience

4
00:00:10.141 --> 00:00:11.610
at the moment. What makes you,

5
00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:15.550
you sounds actually like a childhood question man.

6
00:00:15.551 --> 00:00:20.400
It is except no one really knows the answer for the station Id we heard one

7
00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:23.730
scientist's theory that the self or the mind or even the soul

8
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.500
<v 3>is nothing but a story of the brain tells itself.</v>

9
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.860
Listening to, what was the name of that guy? Paul Paul Brock. Bob Rocks. Um,

10
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.350
the notion that what you are,

11
00:00:36.351 --> 00:00:41.351
what a self is is just a story you tell has some scientific authority behind it

12
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.790
and that's it. Cause I actually didn't exactly know what he's talking about.

13
00:00:46.791 --> 00:00:51.440
Well vs Ramachandran who is a world famous neurologist also believes that what

14
00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:56.441
is peculiarly human about us is our ability to construct stories.

15
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.700
And he says this ability is new or relatively new.

16
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.330
It happened at a particular moment in time and he thinks he knows about when

17
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.800
maybe 200,000 years ago, half a million years ago,

18
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.450
something absolutely astonishing happened.

19
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.570
What the evolution of introspective consciousness and the evolution of the south

20
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.430
evolution of introspective consciousness. What does that mean? Well,

21
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.000
let's do this simply and back up for a minute.

22
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.180
[inaudible] there are different sets of creatures in the world.

23
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.420
There are dumb ones. There are smarter ones. And then there's us. Okay,

24
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.630
so let's just choose, say a worm for our dumb candidate.

25
00:01:32.631 --> 00:01:35.540
Imagine you're aware and you're crawling through the ground like worms like to

26
00:01:35.541 --> 00:01:39.520
do, and you bump into a pebble. Now, here's what a warm doesn't do.

27
00:01:39.521 --> 00:01:44.521
A warm doesn't think I can't seem to move this pebble [inaudible] because

28
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.311
they're warm.

29
00:01:45.311 --> 00:01:49.060
Doesn't have a brain big enough or a nervous system strong enough to support the

30
00:01:49.061 --> 00:01:53.140
idea of Dang me. Pebble. Certainly not. Dang,

31
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.210
there's no I'm, I'm not a worm.

32
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.870
But as far as vs Ramachandran is concerned inside the worm's head,

33
00:01:58.871 --> 00:02:02.830
there is no picture at all. There's just a set of inherited instincts.

34
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.760
No pictures in that worms head. No story there. Okay?

35
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.850
So let's step up to another level of creature. You give me a creature, uh,

36
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.450
but it has to be a more complex one. Okay. How about going back to the monkey?

37
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.490
Okay. Monkey monkey swinging through trees.

38
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.910
Monkey sees a lady monkey, the lady monkey.

39
00:02:19.911 --> 00:02:23.710
If it has a red, um, how should I put this bottom then the,

40
00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:28.670
the lady monkey is interested in sex. So if you notice, says Dr Ramachandran,

41
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.620
if that rump is red, the red rumps of of a female primates.

42
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:34.620
I like to eat red.

43
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.380
I claim a monkey after seeing red can react to it.

44
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.860
Maybe you can even remember the red and do the appropriate reaction.

45
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.610
And the probably reaction in this case would be to grab that lady monkey and you

46
00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:47.810
know, might make a baby with her.

47
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.200
This monkey pulls an image of another monkey in, makes an association.

48
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.540
And so there's images in the monkey's head.

49
00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:58.230
But now here's something the monkey can't do.

50
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.220
You can't the symbol red and it's Ed. So if I said to a monkey,

51
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:07.720
see that Volvo over there, that White Volvo, let's make it a red Volvo.

52
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.160
Any human being can take a white car and make it in their imagination.

53
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:15.420
You can paste red on it in his imagination, but a monkey you don't think can do.

54
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.820
We cannot. And this is so simple for a human being to do. And I just,

55
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.760
let's run through a quick exercise. Okay. Imagine for me a bird in your head.

56
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:26.410
Got a bird in there. Yeah. What kind of bird? A canary. Yes.

57
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:27.760
Now there it's there.

58
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.740
Make it into a brilliantly red canary even though, ah,

59
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.340
okay. Like kind of a cardinal, but canary's Barney, it's there. It's right now.

60
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:40.510
Make it into a striped canaries. Trapped. What? Color stripes? Purple. Purple.

61
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.710
Purple Stripes. Purple stripes on a Red Canary. Wait, hold up.

62
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.180
Purple stripes on a Red Canary. Got It. Is it in there? Now?

63
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.860
It's there and an l. It's vivid glory. Ornithological stripe.

64
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.640
And this is not one of your favorites. All right,

65
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.610
so at this moment I'm going to point out something to you.

66
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.800
There is no such thing as a purple striped red. The canary in the world.

67
00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:05.830
You could search the world and never find one that does not surprise me,

68
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.820
but you've got one now in your head. However lamely it's in there somewhere.

69
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.720
Only a human being could do this because only humans can take images from the

70
00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:20.380
real world, pull them into their heads, divide them into parts,

71
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.220
and then start turning those parts into abstractions. Monkeys does.

72
00:04:24.221 --> 00:04:25.750
Ramachandran can't do that.

73
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.500
A monkey can be trained to think of a bird putting the bell in, show it a bud,

74
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.900
and the fifth time you just ring a bell.

75
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.410
Presumably it's conjuring up an image for bud.

76
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.220
Now you can not only train a human to think of the bad,

77
00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.830
you can train a human to think of babies,

78
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.640
but now the human can think of a birds wings on a human baby conjured an angel,

79
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.150
which has never seen this is because he is now has what are called Tokens.

80
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.100
He has created design body tokens.

81
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.610
So color is Hogan big is it took adjectives or adjectives or tokens and then he

82
00:05:04.611 --> 00:05:07.340
can manipulate these tokens,

83
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.550
juxtapose them in counterintuitive ways.

84
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.930
He can create even outlandish scenarios,

85
00:05:14.931 --> 00:05:16.610
what we call imagination.

86
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.400
Let me see if I can get this straight. Okay,

87
00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.300
you've got the worm who can sense the world sort of,

88
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.290
and then you've got the monkey who can pull the world in to some degree and make

89
00:05:30.291 --> 00:05:31.460
an association. Right?

90
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.870
Then you've got us and we can play with those associations. How did,

91
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.440
how did that happen? Well, the cut cause of evolution,

92
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.870
it's like we're not different from other creatures.

93
00:05:41.871 --> 00:05:46.250
We're just more than other creatures and when we have these brains that have

94
00:05:46.251 --> 00:05:48.770
this extra like it's like a layer on layer cake,

95
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.910
we can manipulate any idea at all and we're constantly doing that.

96
00:05:52.911 --> 00:05:57.080
We're constantly abstracting. We are imagining so often,

97
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.830
thoroughly and so well that we eventually can imagine ourselves.

98
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.640
I can sit here looking right at you and I can see you right now as jab,

99
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.850
the little boy if I want, or Jen, y'all dying, man, if I want,

100
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.370
or Jad with a purple stripes and an elegant set of Taffeta wings.

101
00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.130
The idea of self, if you think about it this way,

102
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:26.080
is you take all the things that have ever happened to you, pluck from your life.

103
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.970
If you're sad, you might pick the sad things.

104
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
If you're happy on what particular day you might puck the happy things and you

105
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.460
stitch them together into a general abstract idea and me then an idea of self is

106
00:06:37.931 --> 00:06:40.630
really a story that we tell ourselves.

107
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.220
It can change from day to day and it allows the human being to exercise that

108
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.760
peculiarly human muscle to experience stuff.

109
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.910
And then to abstract it into a story that's so

110
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:09.380
<v 5>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

111
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.720
<v 2>this is Radiolab. Chad here with Robert Krulwich.</v>

112
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.670
So this makes more sense to me now.

113
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.270
I think this idea that the brain, uh,

114
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.960
spins a story moment to moment as you're walking about.

115
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.190
And that story is you yourself. If it's so automatic,

116
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.870
does it even happen when we sleep? Why do I say that?

117
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.330
Well, I asked Paul Brocks this question and he told me something really strange,

118
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.110
something that made me think that maybe when we're asleep the brain loosens its

119
00:07:39.111 --> 00:07:44.111
grip on the self to self tumbles into a thousand parts

120
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.350
creatures. I don't know what he,

121
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.860
you tell me basically is that when he was young,

122
00:07:49.861 --> 00:07:54.300
he would have these dreams where he'd see these things, these parts of himself.

123
00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.910
Presumably the dream would be going along fine, everything would be normal.

124
00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.990
And then all of a sudden along would come these little pieces.

125
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:02.820
<v 6>Yes. Literally little people, they were,</v>

126
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.640
they were hordes of these little creatures over.

127
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:08.410
I'd see them in a great pageants or the sweeping vine and occasionally they'd

128
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.610
come up and I've sensed that kind of looking at me. But uh,

129
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.100
but then I'd go away again and I just sort of watch. Do they,

130
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.500
were they were aware of you? Uh,

131
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:21.560
well that's a very eerie thought cause it's my brain that was producing them,

132
00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.180
um, as well as producing me.

133
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:28.870
<v 3>That's a strange thing. He, he really means little people. Yeah.</v>

134
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.190
And oddly enough, he discovered he wasn't alone,

135
00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:34.000
<v 6>which is why I was very fascinated by Robert Louis Stevenson because his</v>

136
00:08:34.001 --> 00:08:36.850
descriptions were very similar to the sort of things that I experienced.

137
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:37.980
<v 3>Stevenson.</v>

138
00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.620
Do you know the [inaudible] one of the most important writers of the 19th

139
00:08:40.621 --> 00:08:42.960
century? Apparently he saw them too.

140
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:46.290
The little people who manage mans in total theater.

141
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.630
That's how he describes them in one particular essay.

142
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.000
Read for us here by an actor, Joshua Cain.

143
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.070
For anyone who's ever wondered where do dreams come? Where does

144
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.150
<v 7>an idea come from? This essay is an interesting read and confusing.</v>

145
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:01.613
First of all,

146
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.430
Stephenson always refers to himself in the third person as he is honest,

147
00:09:05.431 --> 00:09:08.520
feller war, the dreamer, the dreamer. I'm not sure why.

148
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.450
Maybe it's not so strange considering the rest of the essays about little people

149
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.580
and his mind. Okay. In any case, what he writes is it,

150
00:09:15.581 --> 00:09:19.540
at first the stories they acted out for him were, well,

151
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.340
they didn't make any sense.

152
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:24.000
<v 8>The little people play it upon their stage like children rather than like</v>

153
00:09:24.001 --> 00:09:27.300
drilled actors performing a set piece to a huge hole of faces.

154
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.340
<v 7>Anytime. An interesting thing happens,</v>

155
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.930
Stevenson decides to become a writer to write and sell his tails in things

156
00:09:33.931 --> 00:09:34.764
change.

157
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:35.371
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

158
00:09:35.371 --> 00:09:39.060
Was he in here with a little people who did that part of his business in quite a

159
00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:40.080
new conditions.

160
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.790
<v 7>Now, the little people weren't just the things he saw in his dreams.</v>

161
00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:44.890
They were a business opportunity.

162
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.630
<v 5>Mm.</v>

163
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:49.690
<v 7>See, he was broke always and had to crank out the stories.</v>

164
00:09:49.691 --> 00:09:52.450
So very much in the spirit of the industrial revolution,

165
00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.090
he decides to exploit his little people,

166
00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.480
turn them into a storytelling factory,

167
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.180
<v 8>which meant he writes a story.</v>

168
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:04.410
It was now be trimmed and pad and set up on all fours.

169
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:08.790
It must run from a beginning to an end and fit with the laws of life.

170
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.390
The pleasure in one word had become a business.

171
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:16.920
And that not only for the dreamer, but for the little people of his theater,

172
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:20.280
they understood the change as well as he

173
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:22.990
<v 5>[inaudible].</v>

174
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.630
<v 7>So then what happens? Well, he needs stories.</v>

175
00:10:25.631 --> 00:10:29.560
He can sell [inaudible] so he trains this little people.

176
00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.500
This is what he writes in his essay. He trains them. W what do you mean? Well,

177
00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:36.790
he had this elaborate pre bedtime ritual. He would, uh, lie on the bed,

178
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:41.260
feet off, raise one arm, close his eyes,

179
00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.080
raises his arm. Yeah,

180
00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:46.960
it was a signal for the little people of his mind to tell him a story.

181
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.770
And Man, you better be a good one.

182
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:51.800
<v 8>And behold at once,</v>

183
00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:56.270
little people begin to buster themselves in the same quest and labor all night

184
00:10:56.271 --> 00:10:57.104
long.

185
00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.510
When he did not realize was just how good they could be.

186
00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:05.060
Here is one exactly as it came.

187
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.870
It seemed this time that the dreamer was the son of a very rich and wicked man.

188
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.900
The owner of broad acres and the most damnedable temper.

189
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.800
The son had been living abroad on purpose to avoid his father.

190
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:24.260
When he returned, it was the find his father married again to a young wife.

191
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.490
Because of this marriage, as the dreamer indistinctly Yadda stood.

192
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.580
It was desirable for the father and son to have a meeting.

193
00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.740
Yet both being proud in both angry, neither would condescend on a visit,

194
00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.800
but meet they did accordingly.

195
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:44.270
In a desolate sandy country by the sea to the shore, please drive it. Yes,

196
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:49.220
I'm there. They quarreled. How dare you.

197
00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:54.280
You selfish and the stung by some intolerable insults struck the father.

198
00:11:58.930 --> 00:11:59.763
<v 9>Oh,</v>

199
00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:04.780
<v 8>no. Suspicion was aroused. The dead man was found and buried.</v>

200
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.820
The dreamer succeeded to the broadest states, to the rigging, to the rigging,

201
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.360
and found himself installed under the same roof with his father's widow.

202
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:17.283
Good evening,

203
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:21.200
<v 10>Marilyn, will you join me for separate? Thank you.</v>

204
00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:26.070
These two lift very much alone as people may after bereavement sat down to the

205
00:12:26.071 --> 00:12:30.630
table together. Trio, long evenings, Randy? Yes, please.

206
00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.640
And Group daily, better friends.

207
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.730
The West Garden is so lovely this time of year. Yes.

208
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.550
Lumtree gone to Flower Omega? Yes. Do you recall it? Yes. Yes.

209
00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:43.230
I used to climb it as a boy.

210
00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:48.000
Really thought I'd teach you how to climb trees. No.

211
00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.640
<v 8>No, he didn't until it seem to him.</v>

212
00:12:52.641 --> 00:12:55.280
Suddenly the Jews prying about dangerous matters,

213
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.240
but he had conceived a notion of his guilt. Rotary watched him,

214
00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:04.100
tried him with questions, so they lived at cross purposes in life.

215
00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:08.630
Have a look broken dialogue, challenging glances and suppressed passion.

216
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:14.520
Until one day he saw the woman slipping from the house in a veil facing.

217
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.040
Yes ma'am.

218
00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.120
You followed her by train to the seaside country and out over the sandhills to

219
00:13:22.121 --> 00:13:25.560
the fairly place where the murder was done. Yeah.

220
00:13:25.561 --> 00:13:27.440
She began to grow up among the fence.

221
00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:34.530
Watching her flat upon his face present to be something in,

222
00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.170
this is hint come up with number one applies,

223
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.510
but it was deadly evidence against the dreamer.

224
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:46.470
I've actually held it up to me credit perhaps from the shock of the discovery or

225
00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:51.720
foot slipped and you can get some pedal on the brink of the tall sample use.

226
00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.900
[inaudible] you have no thought with a spring up in rescue. Huh?

227
00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:05.180
Take my hand there. They stood face to face.

228
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.920
She went back.

229
00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:11.540
Deadly matter openly in our hand is very present on the spot.

230
00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:16.490
Another link of proof he was playing, she was about to speak.

231
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:21.260
This was more than he could bear. Come and he cut us short.

232
00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:23.630
The conversation had to be going.

233
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.620
<v 10>He passed the evening of the drawing room as in the past. [inaudible] yes,</v>

234
00:14:31.621 --> 00:14:33.630
please. Thank you.

235
00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:36.790
<v 8>About to spend some fear drummed. The dream was bosom.</v>

236
00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:39.710
Why is she not announce me? I think when Lucia,

237
00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:46.050
so his thoughts ran once indeed he seats an occasion when she was a fraud.

238
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:48.720
You're ransacked from gluten getting it.

239
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.210
And at last he didn't know way among the Jews found the damning evidence.

240
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:56.330
Very stood holding this thing,

241
00:14:56.331 --> 00:15:00.290
which was his life in the hollow of his hand and marveling at her behavior that

242
00:15:00.291 --> 00:15:03.080
she should seek and keep. And yet not use it.

243
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:07.070
Then the door open and behold herself.

244
00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.193
Oh,

245
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:15.250
<v 10>cool. What's, what are you doing? What are you doing?</v>

246
00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.660
<v 8>Once more, they stood eye to eye with the evidence between them.</v>

247
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.440
Right before he left the room,

248
00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:28.040
he laid back down his death warrant where he had founded at that her face lit

249
00:15:28.591 --> 00:15:29.424
up.

250
00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:34.230
<v 10>[inaudible] the next he HUD, she was lying to her mate. [inaudible] happens.</v>

251
00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.670
You're a real robbery. Oh No, no, no. It's nothing.

252
00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:41.670
It's I'm embarrassed. Really. I, I thought I'd lost something

253
00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:43.430
<v 8>then. You see, I was looking at me.</v>

254
00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.890
Flesh and blood could bear the strain no longer,

255
00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.900
and I think it was the next morning though.

256
00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:50.300
Chronology has always hazy in the theater of the mind,

257
00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.530
but he burst from his reserve. No thank you. Your team.

258
00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:58.330
Please show that please. You'll be all right.

259
00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.940
No sooner with the seven squad and these two protagonists alone together,

260
00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.740
but he leaped to his feet. Three to sprang up with a paddle face.

261
00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:10.490
I'm not denouncing me. You'd know everything. Why do you torture me?

262
00:16:10.491 --> 00:16:13.490
Fell upon her knees and with outstretched hands.

263
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.330
<v 10>Dan, I love you.</v>

264
00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:19.493
<v 11>Oh,</v>

265
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:29.100
[inaudible] uniform with a pint of wonder and looking tired, delight, dreamer.

266
00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:30.683
Oh, whoa.

267
00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.770
<v 7>My auntie's mercantile delight is not of long insurance.</v>

268
00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:39.600
As it became plain that in this spirited tale, they will unmarketable elegance.

269
00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:41.521
Ultimately,

270
00:16:41.521 --> 00:16:45.360
Robert Louis Stevenson found this story unusable and he couldn't sell it.

271
00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:48.450
But there's a deeper question here. The question of Authorship,

272
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:52.740
let's think about it in more modern terms. When you see moving lights go down,

273
00:16:52.741 --> 00:16:55.020
you settle in from one moment to the next,

274
00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:58.290
you the viewer have no idea what's going to happen.

275
00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.490
You scream at the scary parts, laugh at the jokes, cry during the sad scenes.

276
00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:06.240
You take it on a ride, but in order for you to have that experience,

277
00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:10.710
someone needed to write the movie, someone needed to direct it,

278
00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.840
someone other than you.

279
00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:16.980
How is it when we dream that we do all three at the same time?

280
00:17:16.981 --> 00:17:20.790
We write direct and watch the films. If you've never seen it before,

281
00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.040
the little people are substantive inventors and performers. To the end,

282
00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.660
they had kept a secret, the dream or had no guests,

283
00:17:27.661 --> 00:17:29.130
whatever the motive of the woman,

284
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:33.390
the hinge of the whole well invented plot until the instant of the traumatic

285
00:17:33.391 --> 00:17:38.280
revelation was not his tail, it was the little peoples.

286
00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:45.380
<v 10>I am awake now and I know this trade and yet I cannot better it.</v>

287
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.040
The more I think of it, the more I am moved

288
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.200
<v 6>the press upon the world. My question,</v>

289
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.710
who all the little people. Okay.

290
00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.070
It's almost like watching a video.

291
00:18:00.071 --> 00:18:02.980
You could sort of go and inspect their activities,

292
00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:05.710
scrutinize their activities very closely.

293
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:09.010
That's how neurologist Paul Brocks describes his little people dreams.

294
00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:12.190
And it kind of fascinated me that this was part of me,

295
00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.640
part of my brain activity, but not me. Um, so which,

296
00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:17.570
which part of my brain activity is me

297
00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.850
<v 7>and if it seems there's a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde quality to the mystery of the</v>

298
00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:25.450
little people, that is no coincidence. On another night,

299
00:18:25.451 --> 00:18:29.260
our dreamer Robert Louis Stevenson, once again captivated by the little people,

300
00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:33.340
screamed so loudly, his wife wakes him, Robert, Robert Dialing Waco.

301
00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.940
What's wrong? He was not pleased. Damn it. Woman.

302
00:18:36.941 --> 00:18:40.270
I had been dreaming a fine bogey tail, but he didn't manage to remember.

303
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:43.300
If you thinks from the dream one a scene at the window,

304
00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:48.330
then a man pursued for a crime and that man takes a potion and undergoes a

305
00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:50.800
transformation.

306
00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:57.090
That man's name of course would become Mr. Hyde and our dreamer Robert Louis

307
00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:00.670
Stevenson, the author of that classic tale of a divide itself.

308
00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:10.730
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

309
00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:14.390
<v 7>the story of Robert Louis Stevenson is a little people came from an essay from</v>

310
00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.960
Paul Brocks from his excellent book into the silent land and it was adapted for

311
00:19:17.961 --> 00:19:19.250
radio by Ellen Horn.

312
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.070
<v 6>Joshua Kane was the voice of Robert Louis Stevenson from his essay,</v>

313
00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.850
a chapter on dreams and he had a supporting cast of Lorraine Mattox,

314
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:31.140
John Henry Boudreaux, Frank Podro, Nick Kappa [inaudible], Sally,

315
00:19:31.141 --> 00:19:34.260
her ships and Keith Scott. And if anyone was listening closely,

316
00:19:34.261 --> 00:19:38.520
they would have also recognized you [inaudible] which on that CCI cliff diet,

317
00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:42.150
Diet. Here's the thing.

318
00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:44.340
What is hard to recognize?

319
00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:48.300
If you take a look into somebodies brain and you asked the question,

320
00:19:48.301 --> 00:19:50.160
which we've been asking this whole hour,

321
00:19:50.161 --> 00:19:54.480
like you know who's there or where is the author or where is the,

322
00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:55.650
where am I?

323
00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:00.880
The story points up that if you look scientifically into a brain,

324
00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:04.080
what you encounter is hundreds of thousands of players,

325
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.780
not just little people but teeny, teeny, teeny,

326
00:20:06.781 --> 00:20:09.690
teeny brain cells which do all this flashing back and forth.

327
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.690
If you were to go to any one of those cells and say,

328
00:20:12.691 --> 00:20:16.530
so are you the author of chuckle and hide,

329
00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.700
the cell wouldn't would just

330
00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:23.280
write this vocabulary of a neuron. It's just on wrong.

331
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:28.290
It is only in the group that you can see the electrical outline of a thought,

332
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.940
but ultimately of a self. While you think of yourself as a,

333
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:34.740
even the thought,

334
00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:39.980
I am a one springs from 100 million cells connecting 2 trillion synapses and

335
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:48.710
that all of this multiple activity paradoxically creates the,

336
00:20:48.851 --> 00:20:51.850
you have this moment, you are always plural,

337
00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:55.630
[inaudible] and that's especially true in the story we have coming up for you.

338
00:20:55.631 --> 00:20:59.650
In 60 seconds. This is Radiolab, Mum, Jab, Homerun, Robert Crow, which,

339
00:20:59.651 --> 00:21:01.300
and I will continue in a moment.

340
00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:05.680
You're listening to radio on New York public radio, public radio.

341
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.640
W N was.
