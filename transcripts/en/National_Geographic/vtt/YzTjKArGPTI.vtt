00:00:01.834 --> 00:00:04.766
NARRATOR: Rod Bud is
the safety supervisor,

00:00:04.767 --> 00:00:07.400
and is responsible for
bringing these scientists back

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.600
home alive.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.700
ROD BUD: Fins on, we're
good to jump in the water.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.934
NARRATOR: He'll be the first
one in, to ensure conditions are

00:00:13.934 --> 00:00:15.332
safe for the rest of the team.

00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:22.266
[music playing]

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:25.500
Without protective clothing, ice
cold waters can knock a person

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.934
unconscious within minutes.

00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:31.667
While this team is wearing
well-insulated dry suits,

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:34.834
their heads are almost
completely exposed.

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:37.700
This is just a quick test
dive, but when the real mission

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.800
begins, the dive
team will only get

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.567
40 minutes to finish the job.

00:00:42.567 --> 00:00:45.066
And at 35 minutes,
we give four pulls.

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.166
And we're able to
call the diver,

00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:48.666
and say, dive's
pretty much over.

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:50.367
NARRATOR: Down here,
ropes signals are

00:00:50.367 --> 00:00:54.032
the only way to call for help.

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:56.800
But as the body's core
temperature decreases,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.166
one of the first handicaps
is loss of dexterity.

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.233
And at these
temperatures, regulators

00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:06.800
can quickly malfunction and
drain the diver's air supply.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.000
[music playing]

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.500
[inaudible] slow.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.300
[music playing]

00:01:19.934 --> 00:01:21.100
Oh.
Good.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.333
Very well?

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:23.300
OK?

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.033
My hands-- my hands
are pretty cold.

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:27.600
It does drop your whole core
temperature there a little bit

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.133
though.

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.467
NARRATOR: Until his body
temperature returns to normal,

00:01:31.467 --> 00:01:34.033
Rod is prohibited
from going back down.
