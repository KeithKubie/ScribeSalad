Hello everyone my name is Rowan and Donovan and I'm in the field working on a story in northern Rwanda about mountain gorillas

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.459
Hiking at 11,000 feet is not easy

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.919
We've so far gone up 3,000 feet since we started

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.730
Thicker stuff about 11,500 feet now

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.229
So we found the Grylls we have eyes on them but

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.179
They're gonna side of this ravine, and there's one up towards the skyline they're

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:44.879
Gonna be tricky

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.160
So dingo tracking this morning we just found two snares

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.890
Felix is cutting the bamboo rod so that it can't be used again

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.198
So really close to the grills we can hear them chest pounding just over here in the bushes

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.879
And we can see this trail that they used to go up the side of the ravine

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.850
Okay, we just found the gorillas

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.799
Well that's it for today folks, thanks again for following along with me here in Rwanda

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.819
I hope you enjoyed seeing the mountain gorillas. I know I did
