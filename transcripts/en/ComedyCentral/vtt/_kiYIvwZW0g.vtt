00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:03.302
Amy, you're my best friend.

00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:05.571
We do everything together.

00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:07.140
We love to have
tea parties.

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:08.541
And dance parties.

00:00:08.574 --> 00:00:09.976
(woman)
 Get ready for a day

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:11.277
 of fun and glamour

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.112
 when you're hanging out
 with Amy,

00:00:13.145 --> 00:00:15.014
 the official
 Amy Schumer doll.

00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:17.150
Look, she's spicing up
her coffee.

00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:20.153
Glamorous.
(alarm clock ringing)

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:22.955
1:00 P.M.! We're allowed
to wake her up now.

00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:25.925
She's waking up in a
stranger's bed again.

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.560
She's so popular.

00:00:27.593 --> 00:00:28.895
(record skipping)
Uh-oh.

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:30.329
No wrappers on
the floor.

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:32.131
Time for Plan B.

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:35.034
 Amy comes complete with a
 variety of accessories,

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:36.769
 including a purse
 for her essentials

00:00:36.802 --> 00:00:38.438
 that you can dump
 on the table.

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:39.639
What's in your
purse, Amy?

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:43.276
Birth control, Lexapro,
dusty candy corn,

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.812
and a business card
from a Tekserve employee

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:48.014
that gave her a vibe.

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:50.750
 Amy also comes with a six-pack
 of cranberry juice

00:00:50.783 --> 00:00:52.185
 to help her UTI.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:54.554
You'll feel better
soon, Amy.

00:00:56.021 --> 00:00:57.757
 Dress her in three
 different outfits

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.492
 that hide
 her problem areas:

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:00.827
 a crop top...

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.096
This shows off
her tramp stamp.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.530
 ...skinny jeans
 to keep in the closet...

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:05.965
For someday.

00:01:05.998 --> 00:01:07.100
 ...and one nice thing
 for court.

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.102
(gavel bangs)

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:10.103
(girls laughing)

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:11.270
It's okay, Amy,

00:01:11.303 --> 00:01:13.206
you can fall asleep
in your clothes again.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:14.974
Don't forget
to sleep on your side.

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:17.110
(Amy retching)

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:20.279
 It's Amy,
 the official Amy Schumer doll

00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:22.245
 from the makers
 of Fat Babs.
