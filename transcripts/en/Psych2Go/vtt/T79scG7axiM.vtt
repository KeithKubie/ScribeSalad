00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:09.779
Growing up in a dysfunctional family is not always obvious.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.450
Similar to symptoms of anxiety and depression,

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.449
the signs may range from mild to severe, which can go unnoticed in everyday lives of toxic families.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.449
Here are five types of dysfunctional family dynamics.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:29.460
One: the chronic conflict family. In this type of dysfunctional family members fight with each other in harmful ways.

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.609
They'll leave one another physically and emotionally wounded.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.590
The tension is breeded from toxic parental styles, such as abusive and authoritarian.

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:42.029
The parents will usually be strict, rigid and unreasonably harsh with their kids.

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.749
Fear is a tool commonly used by them to maintain control and

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.549
punishment methods are often abusive illness treatments that can be traumatizing for the individual.

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.269
Prolonged conflict within the family can damage a child's neural chemistry,

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.399
which can create chronic stress, anxiety,

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:02.579
depression and an insecure attachment style as they cultivate relationships with others outside of the household. 

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:08.159
Two: the pathological household. In this type of family, severe psychological,

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.580
mental health disorders, terminal illnesses and substance abuse or drug addiction affect the members' everyday lives.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.570
One or both parents may suffer from terminal illnesses such as cancer,

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.150
mental disorders like schizophrenia,

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.939
personality disorders such as borderline personality disorder or mood disorders like bipolar disorder.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.930
Along with drug addiction problems, one or both parents may also have addictions associated with alcoholism or gambling. 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.769
In the pathological household the family roles are reversed, in which the children are more responsible and take care of everyday functions,

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.790
whereas the parents are the ones being looked after. The parents' disorders or illness can cause children to become preoccupied with tasks

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.929
they aren't meant to handle until they are more mature. This can cause them to develop social deficiencies, anxiety and depression over time.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.739
Three: the chaotic household. In this type of family, the children are often poorly looked after

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.759
when the parents are too busy, not present or do not set clear and consistent regulations. The parents do not establish any

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:16.139
organization, system or routine that the whole family can follow, which makes it hard for the children to find any grounding or assurance.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:23.070
Often, the older siblings take on the responsibilities the parents have failed to fulfill, and they learn to play the role of the caretakers.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.970
Meanwhile,

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.889
the younger siblings or school-aged children in the chaotic household usually have trouble with discipline, concentrating in school and listening to authority figures.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.890
Four: the dominant-submissive household. In this type of family one parent is a dictator while the other one is passively

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.619
obedient. The Dictator parent has no considerations for the wishes or feelings of the other family members.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.130
This often causes the other parent to feel depressed and they usually have a lot of repressed negative and angry emotions.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:01.350
Consequently, the whole family faces tension and all the members are extremely unhappy and dissatisfied with their home life. While one parent is

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.830
controlling and pays little attention to the way their actions affect the whole family, the rest of the members suffer silently from their poor choices,

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.080
showing little open revolt.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.880
Five: the emotionally distant family. This may be one of the least obvious dysfunctional family types. On the outside,

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.630
nothing is loudly or noticeably chaotic but behind closed doors

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.730
there's very little affection shown between the family members. The parents rarely show warmth towards their children,

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.760
which teaches them to repress their feelings as they grow older.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.219
This brings about an insecure or non-existent attachment which can negatively affect the child's identity,

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.260
self-esteem and their ability to form relationships with others. In this household

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.809
communication is rarely open and the members often choose to deal with their problems alone instead of seeking help.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.520

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.470
