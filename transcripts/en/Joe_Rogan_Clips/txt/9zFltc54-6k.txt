Speaker 1:          00:00          So now when you were doing stand up and you started to get in some trouble for bits, a lot of trouble. A lot of trouble. Like how much travel? Yeah, a lot of money. I spent a lot of money. Really as long as I lost a lot of sauces, I lost a lot of lessons because of jokes. Really. Lawsuits. Yeah. So like who was suing you? Uh, the people who fell offended. So people in the audience, artists when I make fun of a celebrity, they would sue you. Yeah, they can, they can sue you. They can get money out of all the TV shows. They can get up politicians. So who sued you? You know, I got this, uh, this last, so they really, uh, put me in trouble. It was because of a singer. It was, she was a singer and a kind of a almost cute my career.

Speaker 1:          00:47          He actually did, that's why I'm here. So No, uh, yeah, I got into a huge lawsuit and it looks dumb when you explain, oh, it's just a singer. But he became all this talk about freedom of speech and what comedians can say. And what they cannot say. Are you allowed to feel a fandom? And now there's like law schools talks about the lawsuit that I had law school discussions, discussions out cause okay. Yeah because I made fun. He was a shitty joke. That's the problem. You know, it's not because of the losses. I want to be sued by the good ones because I don't want to be known by a bad joke. Right, right. Oh of course. Yeah. It's just like I was saying, this will say it's just like you were meeting, uh, Eddie Murphy, one of the greatest comedians ever. They think, oh, there's doctor Doolittle.

Speaker 1:          01:40          You don't want that right now. This is the same thing with me. That joke was a shitty joke. And she was like bragging on TV and she was like doing a story on TV. And I was the host of this huge TV show, like the daily show and like the daily show meeting, the view. It was something like that. And uh, and in the middle of the things she was show us there and my friend asked me, oh, she's pregnant. And do you think she's still hot? And I said, she's so hot that I would fuck her in her baby and shit, but it was live. It was like right on time. Everybody laughed and there was no problem. But next week there was this huge thing because she was like, her husband was very influential and uh, her husband was managing run now do, which was one of the biggest soccer player ever.

Speaker 1:          02:33          So there was this whole thing, the TV show lost the sponsors and uh, and they want to suspend me from the TV show because the have a joke that I did. She didn't tell, they didn't tell me to apologize at first, but they suspended me. So I quit the show. They didn't know. So you just apologize. And I decided not to apologize because I felt that after like 10 years, don't stand there or 12 years doing stand up. It was important for me to like put my feet on the ground and say, you know, if we step back right now, what am I, what am I going to do in like a two years? This is important for all of us is important for comedy. So I lost, lost tell us movies a, so what did they, what did they rule in the lawsuit? Like what was the ruling I have friended her on or honor or the ad was something like that.

Speaker 1:          03:26          She's like, uh, uh, they, people can sue you. Just suing is part of the democracy. It's okay to sue you. But to look, to lose a lawsuit is, that's the problem. I lost like $150,000 or OTC, but in Brazil was 350,000 high. So, right. If you're a lawyer and you get $10,000 a month, you get 10,000 hours a month. So He's, you don't translate money. So I lost a lot of money, but the thing has gotten me a huge headache and uh, he was, he was bad. It goes bad chest from that one just for that one. But you saw other lawsuit? Yeah. How also because I did it like a rape joke and uh, I got like this women movement like trying to break, break into my bar and break my door of my comedy club. And there was like, that was a while. But the discussion was more important than the problem itself. I kind of thought it was the discussion about freedom of speech and that was, that was huge. What is freedom of

Speaker 2:          04:28          speech like in Brazil? Is it the same? I mean obviously we have the first amendment. You have the first summit. Do you have something? We don't, we don't have that. They didn't have that in Canada. We don't have that. I had Mike Ward on and Canada. Do you know his story? Yeah, I know he's the guy. He made a joke about a sick boy. The boy was still alive years later. I thought it was. And you know it was just a bad joke about this guy is still being alive and can he get his money back? Cause like, cause they donated money. It's like, it's fucked up joke, but it's supposed to be a fucked up joker who's doing it in a nightclub situation where people are drinking, you say things that are inappropriate and that's the art form. He got sued and he's still in the process of it right now.

Speaker 2:          05:08          There's another case in Vancouver where these women were heckling, uh, they were yelling things out during the show and then the comedian went on stage and be rated the women and then the women's sued and won because a, they were lesbians and he made some lesbian jokes about them at their own expense. And so then they took him to court and they won and they won what? They want some judgment where he had to pay them. I want to change Jimmy. How much was it? I want to say it was somewhere in the neighborhood of $30,000. $30,000. Yeah. I went in and for this gentleman, this comedian, uh, I think that was a lot of money. I don't, 40 to 40. $2,000. Yeah, that's a lot of fucking money for opening comedian. I mean, he wasn't a famous guy, so you know, that might be two years worked for him. Who knows, you know, of course, of course, yeah. Lost a lot of money. Canada's similar count. Canada does not have freedom of speech the same way the United States does.

Speaker 1:          06:00          Yeah. The debt. That's why, uh, I feel what I do comedy here and I feel that people get uncomfortable about a joke or two. That's when I get stressed. It's like you have the feeder of saying those things. Yes. I have this joke that I say it is about the n word as well. I might have it, maybe I have to change my, but I have this young that I do is like, when I arrived here, someone said to me, you don't use the n word or people are gonna kick her ass. But they never told me what the n word was. So for the past six months, I have been avoiding all wars with the leather. And the other day a guy came up to me and said, can I fuck your ass? And I was like, mm. Maybe in a, when I say this job is like I have to set up, it's crazy because when I first did, he was like a fucking thing.

Speaker 1:          06:51          Everybody got uncomfortable. But now I set up as a misunderstanding because I'm a foreigner and now I'm free to do everything. Yes, yes. Yeah. So I kind of, I found the way you found a way in. Yeah. So that's, it's crazy. And I watch you alive and I see a lot of people here. I saw the other guy, this guy, this guy did an interview with you and he did this show in a college and he did a joke and people took him out of State Mesh. Nimesh Patel. Yeah. Yeah. That's crazy. Because you built the freedom to do that. Yes. And now you're discussing the, if you can or you cannot solely in colleges though in children today,

Speaker 2:          07:37          and I'm going to call them children, they do not understand the danger in suppressing free speech. And so they think that what they're doing is by suppressing free speech and changing the way people communicate. What they're doing is making the world a better place. They think they're signaling the virtue and making the world a better place at the same time. But it's just ignorance. They just don't understand that you can't, you can't necessarily, you can't control people. And to think that by just getting upset and silencing someone on removing them from the stage at that ends the conversation. It doesn't, it reinforces their position. It says, okay, look, I was right about you fucking snowflakes and you little babies like you, you can't even understand when things are uncomfortable that it doesn't necessarily mean it's negative. And that like you're like x, try to put yourself in someone's position.

Speaker 2:          08:26          See what he's saying. And in the meshes this case, it's actually kinda funny, first of all, he's very open minded guy, very progressive. He's, he's not in any way a racist. And his joke was that people say that being gay is a choice. And he said, I know it's not a choice cause I have a friend who's black and gay. There's no way he would choose both of those things. And it was just double up. It was just him being funny. It's a funny joke. And they were like, cut, get the fuck off the stage. Like what? Come on man. You don't think that's funny. That's crazy. I mean and it's also coming from an Indian man who I'm sure is experienced racism. So though the whole thing is, it's very fascinating to see young kids who are growing up in this PC culture bubble and you know, and sometimes people say on this podcast that we talk about it too much and maybe their correct.

Speaker 2:          09:16          Maybe sometimes it's annoying if you're listening to your cubicle and you hear me talking too much about this, but it's because it's an issue that's very dear to my heart. Cause I understand the dangers of not being able to communicate freely. And I also stay understand what happens when if you suppress free communication, the people that you're suppressing, they're going to get more and more angry and radical and it just makes their position, they're, they, they, they feel more justified in there in perhaps even people who are racist could perhaps be more racist or people who are angry about gay people will become more angry about it if you suppress their ability to express himself. That's when borns, those little movements and Neil Nasi movements, little groups, little groups on the web, in the deep web when discussion, it's like when you, for when it's for beating I think is that you can forgive them the power that they didn't have.

Speaker 2:          10:07          I think so. And I think this is something that we really just getting to understand now. You know, I have, I've had a few conversations about this recently with the head of Twitter and with the an independent journalist Tim pool last week and I think what people were just started to kind of understand, even though everyone's uncomfortable about this, is we're still trying to figure this out. Social media is only 10 plus years old. This is an incredibly new experience for us and I don't think everybody knows exactly how to proceed. And this idea that you could just band people and they just banned people for life. If they say something that makes people uncomfortable, if they say an opinion you don't agree with, banned them for life. And we're, we're experiencing that right now. And uh, we're trying to figure out what to do and how to, how to fix this and how to mitigate it without endorsing people, harassing people and divorcing people, uh, you know, threatening people and giving out their address and their phone number and things along those lines.

Speaker 2:          10:58          But it's a process that we're, we're all going through, right? It is a learning process for the, the, the, the whole country. But the thing that a, a noise annoys me a little bit is that I, I leave it in another country and I see how things are difficult and how much time I spent explaining to people what I was doing. And for you guys, it's like I was having the same problems that Lenny Bruce was having like a long time ago. Yes. And a, you guys built that. Yeah. To have that discussion. It's like it is important because that's the way the war uh, evolved. But at the same time he feels old. It feels old because you understand the history of it in America. Yeah. It feels old because you already had that discussion a long time ago. Yeah. Yeah. You kinda keep having this conversation when you think that you'll finally feel free to say whatever you want now there's people trying to hold you back.

Speaker 2:          11:55          It's crazy. Well, it's not really effective. See there's, there's people that are angry about it. I mean there is on social media, there's certainly people that are being effective with it. But in stand up comedy, it's this, there's blow back and push back. But it's not very effective. Like for the top guys, for guys like Dave Chappelle and you know, Bill Burr, it's, it actually makes their stand up better because people are so tired of all this shit. They're so tired of PC culture. They're so tired of being told what they should and shouldn't think is funny and what is acceptable and not acceptable. And you know, there's a, there's a lot of weird shit going on right now.
