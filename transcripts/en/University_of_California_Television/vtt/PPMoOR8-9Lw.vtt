00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.094
- We're gonna switch gears and talk about

00:00:13.094 --> 00:00:16.222
dermatologic issues in
kids with Down Syndrome.

00:00:16.222 --> 00:00:19.400
This talk was created together
with Dr. Renee Howard,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.210
one of our professors of

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.243
pediatric dermatology at UCSF.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.030
We thought about doing this in tandem,

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.160
switching mics, and then we
figured, it might be best

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.260
if one of us presented the information,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.140
but she will be presenting next about

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.400
dermatological issues in all
individuals with disabilities,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.270
and will be answering questions together,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.970
AKA she'll answer all the
questions about dermatology.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.723
Still nothing to disclose.

00:00:44.943 --> 00:00:47.670
We're gonna talk about
common dermatologic issues

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.447
in individuals with Down Syndrome,

00:00:49.447 --> 00:00:51.416
talk about some treatment modalities,

00:00:51.416 --> 00:00:54.580
and then identify which things to refer

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.870
and which things to
manage in your own offices

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:57.853
if you're a doctor.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.900
So let's start by talking
about cutaneous features

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.662
in children with Down Syndrome.

00:01:05.662 --> 00:01:07.871
A variety of dermatologic issues

00:01:07.871 --> 00:01:11.010
are more common in Down Syndrome.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.760
The single transverse palmar crease,

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.720
please do not call it a simian
crease, that's insulting,

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.420
is the most common cutaneous finding.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.110
It's unilateral, but it's also very common

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.573
in the general population.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.360
In general, transient
cutaneous manifestations

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.010
are more likely to be
seen early on in life,

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.980
while the more chronic skin conditions

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.853
tend to emerge later on in life.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.480
There's several pre-disposing factors

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.913
to having skin stuff.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.923
Number one, I think hypotonia.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.240
When you're a baby, you're more likely

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.740
to stay in one position.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.260
So the neck, the armpits,
the inguinal folds

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.360
are gonna be chronically
exposed to moisture,

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.905
which can lead to rashes.

00:01:51.905 --> 00:01:53.890
Lying on your back all the time

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.740
can lead to rashes, bald spots,

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.550
pressure sores in rare occasions.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.653
The low oral motor tone
often leads to drooling.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.900
Poor coordination with
feeding leads to milk facials,

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.069
and food facials which are
not great for the skin,

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.810
and then the delayed
achievement of continence

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.770
means that someone is gonna be in a diaper

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.000
for a longer period of time,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.623
also pre-disposing to rashes.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.580
Premature aging, also pre-disposes

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.562
one to skin differences.

00:02:27.562 --> 00:02:30.440
Pre mature onset of age dependent changes,

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.130
like hair graying and
thinning and wrinkling,

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.930
and is thought to be related

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.530
to a lower basal level
of DNA repair enzymes.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.460
Especially the decreased ability

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.950
to repair UV induced DNA damage,

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.950
as well as possibly overproduction
of oxygen free radical.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.270
This peroxide dismutase
gene is on chromosome 21

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.700
and oxidative stress has
been linked to T-cell

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.330
mediated skin diseases,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.910
from psoriasis to seborrheic dermatitis,

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.820
to contact derm and atopic derm.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.991
Immune dysfunction also plays a role.

00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:06.810
Individuals with Down Syndrome

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.540
all have sort of a
relative immune deficiency,

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.630
no unifying diagnosis,

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.110
but definitely abnormal.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.325
Antibody mediated and cell
mediated immunity in vitro,

00:03:18.325 --> 00:03:22.200
we've seen reduced killing
of Candida albicans

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.221
and Staph aureus,

00:03:23.221 --> 00:03:26.090
and then, unclear whether this translates

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.280
to clinical significance

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.590
because studies that have looked
at zinc replacement are old

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.100
and they're all from the
eighties and nineties

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.960
and have not shown a huge difference,

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.110
but increased prevalence
of zinc deficiency

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.020
may have something to do with increased

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.923
dermatologic issues as well.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.640
Increased risk of autoimmunity,

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.600
which is well described in
individuals with Down Syndrome.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.360
Obviously has an effect on the skin.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.790
Some autoimmune diseases have
dermatologic manifestations,

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.418
this is dermatitis herpetiformis,

00:03:57.418 --> 00:04:01.590
associated with celiac but
also thyroid disease, diabetes,

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.630
autoimmune hepatitis can
have skin representations.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.550
And then some autoimmune diseases
directly affect the skin,

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.253
from vitiligo, to alopecia
areata, to psoriasis.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.180
So from here on out,

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.250
I'm gonna take you
through a whirlwind tour

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.690
of skin conditions.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.480
I have thirty minutes to
go over thirty slides,

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.360
so I will have to go quickly,

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.390
everything is in your handouts,

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.540
and I made the slides a bit busy

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.580
so you could refer to them in your handout

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.640
if you come up with any of these issues.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.378
Starting with vascular lesions.

00:04:36.378 --> 00:04:39.150
Pretty much all babies
will have some degree

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.380
of cutis marmorata, or livedo reticularis,

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.710
which are very, very similar conditions.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.714
When dermatologist thinks of
livedo reticularis, they think

00:04:48.714 --> 00:04:50.900
autoimmune, rheumatologic conditions.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.700
But when it comes to
kids with Down Syndrome,

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.990
it actually doesn't seem to be

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.640
associated with vasculitides.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.150
They're more prominently
seen in cold temperatures,

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.713
so whenever my nurses undress
the babies to weigh them,

00:05:02.713 --> 00:05:05.028
you can see the cutis marmorata,

00:05:05.028 --> 00:05:08.616
you can see some cutis and livedo

00:05:08.616 --> 00:05:11.209
in the pictures above.

00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:13.580
You don't have to refer cutis.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.660
It will go away on its own,

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.320
it will probably take longer to go away

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.596
than most other babies
without Down Syndrome,

00:05:18.596 --> 00:05:21.768
but it's not scary or dangerous.

00:05:21.768 --> 00:05:24.093
Vascular malformation.

00:05:25.907 --> 00:05:28.770
I couldn't find anything in the literature

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.970
that showed a clear increased
risk of vascular malformations

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.250
in individuals with Down Syndrome,

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.370
but what we do know is that
kids with Down Syndrome are

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.908
at increased risk of atresia
throughout the GI tract,

00:05:38.908 --> 00:05:40.880
including anal atresia,

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.656
and anal atresia is associated

00:05:42.656 --> 00:05:44.860
at times with vascular malformations

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.360
as part of bigger syndromes

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.970
such as PELVIS and SACRAL syndromes.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.980
I love dermatology because
all their syndromes

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.993
make complete sense and have cute names.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.579
So PELVIS stands for perineal hemangioma,

00:05:57.579 --> 00:06:02.379
external genital malformations,
lipomyelomeningocele,

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:04.410
vesicorenal abnormalities,
imperforate anus, or a skin tag.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.409
SACRAL is spinal dysraphism,

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:12.021
anogenital cutaneous renal,
and urologic anomalies,

00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:15.583
and angiomas in the
lumbosacral localizations.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.910
So this is an example of one patient with

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.350
this rash that would be paler,

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.360
and then become red, and
then become purplish,

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.620
and then disappear,

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.840
and this child that has anal atresia,

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.780
and also has a tethered cord,

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.040
and really fits the picture
for one of these syndromes.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.910
And vesicoureteral reflux

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.110
it really fits the
picture for the syndrome.

00:06:38.118 --> 00:06:40.541
Transient myeloproliferative disorder

00:06:40.541 --> 00:06:43.650
is seen with increased
incidents with individuals

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:44.620
with Down Syndrome,

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.843
it's a transient aberrant proliferation,

00:06:49.657 --> 00:06:51.093
of some cell lines.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.210
Some kids need treatment,

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.450
for some kids it resolves on its own.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.430
And then the more serious version,

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:59.996
congenital leukemia.

00:06:59.996 --> 00:07:04.996
Both of these conditions
can be associated with

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.580
dermatologic manifestations.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.940
Congenital leukemia is associated

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.010
with leukemia cutis,

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.430
which are these blue, firm

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.630
infiltrated papules and nodules,

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.040
and then for leukemoid reactions

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.290
and transient myeloproliferative disorder,

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:25.151
kids can have vesiculopustular eruptions,

00:07:25.151 --> 00:07:28.630
such as the ones seen in this text book

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.833
or peer-reviewed article picture.

00:07:32.196 --> 00:07:35.010
There should be a deferential, because

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.860
it could be, of course, Herpes, Staph,

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.499
congenital candidiasis,

00:07:39.499 --> 00:07:43.440
however, a CBC might give you
a clue into what's going on,

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.530
because if you see a
whole lot of white cells,

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.610
then it's probably transient
myeloproliferative disorder

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.660
or congenital leukemia.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.270
And it resolves with treatment,

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.970
the treatment is not geared at the rash,

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:59.037
the treatment is geared at
the blood cell dyscrasia.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.920
Atopic dermatitis is common.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.630
According to the literature,

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.310
about as common as it is
in the general population,

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:09.363
which is common.

00:08:10.462 --> 00:08:13.390
Xerosis cutis, so dry skin, is so common.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:14.540
Everybody gets it,

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.720
or almost everybody has dry skin,

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.173
I can ever generalize.

00:08:19.427 --> 00:08:23.050
And it tends to get worse
with time and with age.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:24.900
And certainly having dry skin

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.780
and a non-intact skin barrier

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.330
can pre-dispose you to
have irritant contact derm,

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.030
and allergic and contact dermatitis.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.560
So gentle skin care needs to be emphasized

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.280
from the very beginning.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.040
I won't use names or brands,

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.610
I'd just say, if you can smell the soap,

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:40.600
it's not good for you.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.860
If you can smell the lotion,
it's not good for you.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.610
And you know, we talked
about sensory issues.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.290
But if you get used to this baby

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.363
being lubed up all day long

00:08:49.363 --> 00:08:50.760
from when they're babies,

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.580
then it's just going to be
a part of their routine,

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.900
as opposed to if you tried to start

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.123
moisturizing a teenager
with sensory issues.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.300
Eczema is also common,

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:05.340
and where I see it a lot is the cheeks,

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.200
so malar erythema is commonly seen

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.130
in kids with Down Syndrome,
especially in the winter.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:15.050
Many of you are quite
familiar with treating eczema,

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:18.140
so gentle skin care, topical
steroids when indicated,

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.400
and managing the Staph colonization

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.343
that can worsen eczema.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.800
Most eczema doesn't need to be referred,

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.840
if you get stuck and you cannot get

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.530
good results and you know that the family

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.300
is actually doing what they're supposed to

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.330
then you should refer,

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.450
but the cases that are
referred for atopic derm

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:41.203
are few for Down Syndrome, for me.

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:46.423
Cutaneous infections are common,

00:09:46.423 --> 00:09:49.920
ranging from folliculitis to furuncles,

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.043
to abscesses to secondary
impetigo in someone with eczema.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.759
A study, there's the same few studies

00:09:58.759 --> 00:10:02.010
are referenced throughout this talk,

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.080
because there aren't that many people

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.850
who are looking at dermatologic issues

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:07.520
in individuals with Down Syndrome.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.420
I want to note that some of these studies

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.200
were done in institutionalized patients,

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.170
so we have to keep that in mind

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.327
when thinking about
our sample size and the

00:10:16.327 --> 00:10:19.190
factors of living in an institution

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:20.762
that could affect the skin.

00:10:20.762 --> 00:10:23.650
But Schepis et al found folliculitis

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:25.360
to be the most common dermatologic

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.480
condition in their studied population.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.267
It was a mix of bacterial folliculitis,

00:10:30.267 --> 00:10:33.830
which is very common in the
gluteal and perineal region,

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.260
as well as pityrosporum
folliculitis which is

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.040
often seen in adults with Down Syndrome,

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.653
in the chest and infrascapular region.

00:10:42.823 --> 00:10:44.140
How do we treat it?

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.110
If it's bacterial

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:48.060
we often use eradication measures,

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.704
so your diluted bleach bath,

00:10:50.704 --> 00:10:54.230
topical antiseptics like Hibiclens wipes,

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.080
and then topical clindamycin gel

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.570
is often very effective at controlling

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:00.737
the bacterial folliculidities.

00:11:02.046 --> 00:11:02.879
For pityrosporum, topical ketoconazole,

00:11:06.046 --> 00:11:07.823
your Selsun Blue, basically.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.670
But you know, you don't want to put

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.700
shampoo necessarily on the skin,

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.823
so you can also get two
percent ketoconazole lotion,

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.330
but you may need oral treatment.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:23.009
And a single dose of
flucon is often enough

00:11:23.009 --> 00:11:25.912
to eradicate pityrosporum.

00:11:25.912 --> 00:11:29.430
So you don't really have
to refer folliculitis

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.663
unless it's refractory complicated.

00:11:33.724 --> 00:11:35.539
Seb derm is super common,

00:11:35.539 --> 00:11:39.070
and it has a bimodal age distribution.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.430
Babies, but all babies have some,

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:44.072
or most babies have
some seb derm cradle cap

00:11:44.072 --> 00:11:48.263
on the scalp and on the T-line.

00:11:48.263 --> 00:11:49.663
Or the T-region.

00:11:50.788 --> 00:11:53.880
And then later on, in older childhood,

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.853
often presenting as itchy dandruff.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:03.320
Strong association with
pityrosporum folliculitis.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.520
For babies, as Dr. Howard says,

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.500
who is it bothering?

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.230
The parent or the child, right?

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:12.168
So you can do mineral oil in a comb,

00:12:12.168 --> 00:12:13.986
you may use hydrocortisone,

00:12:13.986 --> 00:12:17.410
for older children ketoconazole,
two percent shampoo,

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:22.363
or Selsun Blue, can
control seb derm very well.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.800
You don't have to refer it

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.860
unless it seems really hard to treat,

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.330
because the deferential
of seb derm in the scalp

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:30.530
is scalp psoriasis,

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.360
so if you don't get good
control with these measures,

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.730
then it might be psoriasis,

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:37.143
then it probably needs a
dermatologist's, input.

00:12:39.777 --> 00:12:43.180
Keratodermatoses are very common as well.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.860
Keratosis pilaris has a well known

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.240
association with Down Syndrome.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.643
15 percent of individuals
with Down Syndrome

00:12:50.643 --> 00:12:53.320
were found to have K.P in one study.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.340
And what it is is the hair follicles

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.265
get plugged up with dead skin cells,

00:12:57.265 --> 00:12:59.360
which creates this rough texture,

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:03.850
it often happens here and on the thighs.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:07.463
And it can be itchy, and it can be dry.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.935
The treatment is trying
to use non-soap cleansers

00:13:12.935 --> 00:13:16.070
to allow the skin to retain its moisture,

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:21.070
but exfoliating the dead
skin cells can be helpful.

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.430
And then using moisturizing creams,

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.870
especially moisturizing
creams containing urea,

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:29.573
or salicylic acid, can be very
helpful in controlling K.P.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:34.803
Palmoplantar hyperkeratosis
is also very common,

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.960
high prevalences in some studies.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.060
I have to be honest, I
don't see as much of it

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.430
as what's quoted in the studies.

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:46.260
But it's well defined,
hyperkeratotic plaques

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.620
that are distributed at pressure points

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.190
of the palms and soles.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.146
And the treatment is emollients

00:13:52.146 --> 00:13:54.100
and keratolytic agents.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.173
You can use topical retinoids

00:13:57.318 --> 00:14:02.260
and topical vitamin D ointments,
such as calcipotriene.

00:14:03.099 --> 00:14:05.340
These are things that
don't need to be referred

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.705
unless they're complicated refractory.

00:14:07.705 --> 00:14:10.610
You know, a lot of
families come in saying,

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:13.210
I need a dermatologist referral,

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:16.822
and I feel very empowered to say,

00:14:16.822 --> 00:14:20.610
okay, how about I try to treat the rash,

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:23.150
since there's a long wait
to see the dermatologist,

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:27.110
because there's few excellent
people like Dr. Howard,

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:29.930
and then if we get stuck, then no problem.

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:34.180
And it feels real good
to solve people's issues

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:37.743
without having to send them
to yet another specialist.

00:14:39.643 --> 00:14:42.810
Periorificial dermatitis, I see it a lot.

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:45.625
They're periorificial
papules and pustules,

00:14:45.625 --> 00:14:49.547
and they can start as
isolated papules and pustules

00:14:49.547 --> 00:14:51.740
and can become more confluent.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.750
And they're on the spectrum of rosacea.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.800
So if you're familiar with rosacea,

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.880
you know that it can
flare and then go away,

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.330
and it might flare with

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:05.720
the time of day, with the temperature,

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.870
hopefully my kids are
not drinking alcohol,

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.537
but it can wax and wane.

00:15:11.537 --> 00:15:15.290
Pre-disposing factors is
steroids around the area,

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.870
and how many of our kids
are on intra-nasal steroids,

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:22.210
or inhaled corticosteroids
if they have asthma.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:24.210
So think of that mask,

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:27.720
a face there with mask, as an offender.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.560
And then, to be frank,

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.010
sometimes you don't know what it is,

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:32.270
you think it might be eczema

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:33.103
so you're like,

00:15:33.103 --> 00:15:34.254
let's put some steroids on this and--

00:15:34.254 --> 00:15:35.087
(growls)

00:15:35.087 --> 00:15:36.093
it gets really upset.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.810
The treatment, topical antibiotic gels

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:44.630
like metronidazole gel
or a topical Clindagel

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.130
can be effective.

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.970
Sometimes it flares the rash
before it makes it go away,

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:50.913
which is hard for the family to see.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.217
And you can use systemic treatments

00:15:54.217 --> 00:15:58.550
like doxy cycling at acne
doses over a couple of weeks,

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:00.852
or Azithromycin at pneumonia dosing,

00:16:00.852 --> 00:16:03.890
and it will melt the rash away.

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:06.360
If it fails the first line treatments,

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.803
you should refer for further guidance.

00:16:11.202 --> 00:16:14.210
Certainly some of these bother the parent

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:15.043
more than the kid,

00:16:15.043 --> 00:16:16.872
but I definitely see a lot of kids

00:16:16.872 --> 00:16:20.030
scratching and really
bothered by the rash,

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.540
so that's something that I like to treat.

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.743
Especially if I see excoriation marks.

00:16:26.612 --> 00:16:29.420
This, I find very interesting.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:30.590
It's not that there's

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.670
higher concentration of calcium in the

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:34.740
sweat channels of people
with Down Syndrome,

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.170
which might lead to
sweat duct calcification,

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:40.892
which leads to these
milia-like calcinosis cutis,

00:16:40.892 --> 00:16:44.684
which are these small,
discreet white papules

00:16:44.684 --> 00:16:47.490
that look like milia but are more firm

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:51.120
and like look chalky, like
there's calcium in there.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.130
Usually, they're asymptomatic,

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:54.340
they're not bothering anyone,

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:55.810
someone might think they're a wart

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:57.378
and get real freaked out by it.

00:16:57.378 --> 00:17:00.640
But otherwise, they're
not that bothersome.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.637
And no treatment is necessary

00:17:02.637 --> 00:17:05.110
unless they're painful
and if they're painful

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:06.200
they can be curetted.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:10.090
And they shouldn't be
confused with milia milia,

00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:12.593
like those seen in under the eye

00:17:12.593 --> 00:17:14.433
in the picture below.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.650
But either way, you're
not gonna do much about it

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:19.743
other than re-assure.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:26.080
Syringomas are similar to milia,

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:29.140
but they're small, flesh colored,

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.520
yellow-brown dermal papules.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.800
And in our individuals with Down Syndrome

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.090
are very often seen in the eyelid

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:39.010
and that's actually much,
much, much more common

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:42.063
to be seen under the eyelids
than in the general population.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.360
There's a female pre-dominance,

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:49.176
as reported in this very
recent study from 1964,

00:17:49.176 --> 00:17:51.085
and there's an association with

00:17:51.085 --> 00:17:53.250
the milia-like calinosis cutis,

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.663
so wondering if it's some sort of similar

00:17:56.663 --> 00:17:59.260
pathogenesis to it.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:00.723
They're not easy to treat,

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:05.290
and they don't bother
anybody other than the child

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.200
if they don't like how they look,

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.300
or the parent if they
don't like how they look.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.180
So I would say refer

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:13.883
only if the kid is bothered by it.

00:18:13.883 --> 00:18:15.880
Because it the kid is bothered by it

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:16.870
then we should treat it, right?

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:20.760
If someone is having self
esteem and image issues

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.690
related to these,

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.530
then, you know, just like
we would for anybody else,

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:25.620
we should refer,

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.250
but if nobody else
cares, then leave him be,

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:30.207
because the treatment is

00:18:30.207 --> 00:18:32.590
electrocoagulation, cryotherapy.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.523
And neither of those feel great.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.272
Vitiligo consists of de-pigmented,

00:18:41.272 --> 00:18:44.600
generally well demarcated areas.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.570
Not hypo pigmented areas.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:48.173
So it's not just lighter than the skin,

00:18:48.173 --> 00:18:49.493
it's like, white.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.327
The estimated prevalence is two percent,

00:18:53.327 --> 00:18:56.750
as opposed to one percent
of the general population.

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:59.210
There is an association
with hypothyroidism,

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.260
so I do check TSH and free T4 and

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.710
even the antibodies.

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:04.460
And kids will come in with vitiligo

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:07.263
as well as alopecia areata.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:12.000
They will light up brightly
under Wood's light,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.190
as shown in this picture.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:18.283
And in terms of treatment,
it's difficult to treat.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.380
You can start with topical steroids,

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:25.290
like 0.1 percent triamcinolone.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:29.790
Maybe even lidex, and
then you might need to add

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:32.253
a topical tacrolimus,

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:37.160
and then light therapy is very effective,

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.500
but talk to Dr. Howard for two minutes

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.820
to get to hear what light therapy access

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:44.710
is like in our area.

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:46.008
Non existent.

00:19:46.008 --> 00:19:47.533
Sorry, I spoiled it.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.443
This is something that should be referred,

00:19:51.443 --> 00:19:54.360
because we're talking
about big gun steroids,

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:58.503
big gun immunosuppressants,
like tacrolimus.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.910
The focus of treatment

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:04.690
is generally more on the
face than on the body,

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:06.800
and I think that part of
the focus of treatment

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.059
is also acceptance.

00:20:08.059 --> 00:20:13.059
And positive body image type messaging,

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:14.940
because it is hard to treat,

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:17.480
and it's unlikely that
we'll be able to make

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.309
all these spots go away.

00:20:19.309 --> 00:20:22.820
So feeling comfortable
with them is important.

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.130
And then some people use makeup

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:28.213
to cover them up if they're
not comfortable with them.

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:33.632
There's famous models with vitiligo.

00:20:33.632 --> 00:20:36.770
If you want to look at awesome pictures,

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:39.242
look up Positive Exposure
by Rick Guidotti,

00:20:39.242 --> 00:20:41.134
a famous fashion photographer

00:20:41.134 --> 00:20:43.730
who decided to start photographing

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:46.450
individuals with all
different genetic conditions

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:47.730
in a way that's respectful,

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.770
as opposed to the textbook pictures

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:52.120
with the eyes blocked
and the genitals visible.

00:20:53.944 --> 00:20:56.821
Alopecia areata is also more prevalent

00:20:56.821 --> 00:20:58.323
in individuals with Down Syndrome

00:20:58.323 --> 00:21:00.149
than in the general population.

00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:02.650
There's a possible female predominance.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:07.650
Again, there's an association between

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.716
genes that live on the 21st chromosome

00:21:09.716 --> 00:21:13.020
and alopecia, specifically MxA,

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.910
the product of MX1 gene,

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:17.141
which is an interferon inducible protein,

00:21:17.141 --> 00:21:21.600
that is strongly expressed in
the lesional anagen hair-bulbs

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.211
from patients with alopecia areata.

00:21:24.211 --> 00:21:27.210
It is associated with vitiligo,

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:30.393
thyroiditis, hypothyroidism,
trachyonychia.

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:32.890
So again, if I see it,

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:36.610
I check thyroid levels
and thyroid antibodies.

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:38.860
It tends to be more severe

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:42.638
in individuals with Down
Syndrome and harder to treat.

00:21:42.638 --> 00:21:45.590
Topical steroids are the first line,

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:46.930
but you should refer.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:48.300
I don't think you should hold off

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.630
on starting topical steroids as you refer,

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:53.740
because I told you to start.

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.080
Because Dr. Howard told you to start.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.723
But do refer, because again,
this is hard to treat.

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:03.380
The next three things I'm gonna talk about

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:04.549
are related to weight,

00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:07.410
which takes me on a tangent.

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:10.040
Please do not use the Down
Syndrome growth curves

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:13.187
to evaluate for obesity in
individuals with Down Syndrome.

00:22:13.187 --> 00:22:15.930
Growth curves are normative
curves, like, you know,

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:18.070
take the bell curve and
turn it into curves.

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:20.170
So if there's a condition that's prevalent

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:22.650
in fifty percent of the population,

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:24.980
then what will look 50th percentile

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.450
and average on that growth curve

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:27.730
is actually gonna be obesity

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:29.300
and you're gonna miss obesity.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.730
So please, please, please,

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:33.020
use the CDC growth curves when evaluating

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.600
weight and BMI for individuals
with Down Syndrome.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.900
Newer studies from Children's
Hospital of Philadelphia

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.610
suggests that the 85th percentile for BMI

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:42.740
in individuals with Down
Syndrome actually represents

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:46.260
obesity, based on different
fat distributions.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.810
Acanthosis Nigracans starts as

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.590
flat hyperpigmentation,
and then becomes velvety.

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:53.360
It's often seen in the back of the neck,

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.280
also in the armpits.

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.150
Many patients think that the kid is dirty,

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:59.240
and really it's a skin change.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.314
It's associated with insulin resistance,

00:23:01.314 --> 00:23:03.630
and we have to think about that

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:06.120
because the incidence
of diabetes mellitus,

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.887
both type one and type two,

00:23:07.887 --> 00:23:11.851
is higher in our patient population

00:23:11.851 --> 00:23:14.550
of individuals with Down Syndrome.

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:16.310
There's a really high prevalence

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:19.080
of being overweight and
obesity, as I just said.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.890
And then newer studies are showing

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:24.400
that actually an extra copy

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:29.400
of the DSCR1-4 gene
from the 21st chromosome

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.470
actually leads to
dysregulated hepatic glucose

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.469
homeostasis and pyruvate intolerance,

00:23:35.469 --> 00:23:38.130
which is likely what explains

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:40.020
the higher incidence of non-alcoholic

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:41.240
fatty liver disease

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.920
in our individuals with Down Syndrome,

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.790
so I am strict about sugar.

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:48.000
At our parties, there's
no juice, there's no soda,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.200
there's just water.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.420
And I talk to everybody
about limiting sugar intake

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.093
and not rewarding with food.

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:56.640
Because of these issues.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.730
You don't have to refer

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:00.000
to dermatology for acanthosis,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.484
but maybe consider referring to nutrition,

00:24:02.484 --> 00:24:05.290
consider referring to endocrinology.

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:08.850
I follow a skinny-mini
who's had acanthosis

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:09.720
for a couple of years

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.350
and I'm watching her A1C rise

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:14.170
and I think she's gonna reveal herself

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:17.193
as a type one diabetic soon.

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:22.710
Hidradenitis is another condition

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:27.179
that's made worse by
being overweight or obese.

00:24:27.179 --> 00:24:29.860
They're inflammatory pustules, nodules,

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:30.693
and abscesses

00:24:30.693 --> 00:24:33.240
that are often seen in
the armpits, the groin,

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.120
and sometimes the inframammary region.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.550
And they are not infections, per se,

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:41.240
they're not the boil that you lance

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.647
and then you solve the infection.

00:24:42.647 --> 00:24:47.150
They are related to an
inflammatory reaction

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:48.860
to bacterial skin colonization,

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:50.520
so we can not take the blame

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.034
completely away from Staph,

00:24:52.034 --> 00:24:53.790
but unfortunately

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:55.560
you won't be able to treat it forever

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.770
just by lancing them
or giving antibiotics.

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:00.540
And if not treated promptly,

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.460
they'll lead to fistulous tracts,

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:05.722
and become much, much harder to treat.

00:25:05.722 --> 00:25:08.230
The incidents in individuals
with Down Syndrome

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:10.330
is higher than in the general population,

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:12.590
and we do have a UCSF study going on

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:14.073
right now on hidradenitis.

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:17.810
The age of offset is younger.

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:20.270
Hidradenitis has a clear
female predominance

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:21.920
in the general population.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.450
I have not seen studies
specific to Down Syndrome,

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:27.610
but again, because there's
a genetic underpinning,

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:29.660
I suspect that that female predominance

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.133
might not be quite as marked.

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:36.530
Treatment, part of it is
weight loss, because again,

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:39.420
this is exacerbated by
being overweight or obese.

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.920
Topical cleanser, diluted bleach baths,

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.550
the skin colonization
measures, are important.

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:48.570
You can start with topical
clinda for mild disease,

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:50.420
and see if that words.

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:53.110
Systemic treatment with, like,

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:56.440
taking doxycycline or
clindamycin all the time

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.513
might be needed to control.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.440
These antibiotics both
control the bacteria,

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:08.240
but also have, on their own right,

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.790
anti-inflammatory properties

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:11.700
that help control hidradenitis.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.350
If that fails, you might need to use

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:15.670
a combination of rifampin and clindamycin.

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:16.624
Oh, my goodness.

00:26:16.624 --> 00:26:20.470
And then really, really
good results with Humira.

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:22.880
And at a recent talk
that Dr. Nicole Kittler,

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.650
one of the new UCSF dermatologists

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:26.440
gave at our Grand Rounds in Oakland,

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.623
she actually recommended
referring early for dermatology,

00:26:28.623 --> 00:26:30.900
because I think sometimes
we beat around the bush

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.261
and let this get out of control,

00:26:32.261 --> 00:26:35.567
when this could've been
ameliorated a lot earlier

00:26:35.567 --> 00:26:37.373
with immunologic treatment.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.580
I have a patient with hidradenitis,

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.410
and we tried the wipes,
wouldn't tolerate them.

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:45.236
Tried topical, wouldn't tolerate them.

00:26:45.236 --> 00:26:48.310
Tried antibiotics, wouldn't tolerate them.

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:49.527
And I was like, you know, mom,

00:26:49.527 --> 00:26:52.670
I think that we might
need to go to injections,

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:53.916
and I was floored, she was like,

00:26:53.916 --> 00:26:56.580
please give me injections,
I don't want to fight

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:57.540
with him all the time,

00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.878
just once a week is so much better.

00:26:59.878 --> 00:27:02.633
Also, forget your biases,

00:27:02.633 --> 00:27:05.620
because parents might feel
very differently from you

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.223
about escalating treatment.

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:15.110
Psoriasis also has an
association with weight.

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:17.520
Psoriasis is a chronic
inflammatory skin condition,

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:21.350
characterized by clearly
defined, red scaly plaques,

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:23.950
with the Auspitz sign
where it like, it bleeds

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:25.750
if you scratch it, right?

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:27.340
Okay.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.680
And you should look for
it in the scalp as well.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.551
Actually that's where I see it the most.

00:27:31.551 --> 00:27:33.801
I don't have as many patients who have

00:27:33.801 --> 00:27:35.915
scalp psoriasis elsewhere,

00:27:35.915 --> 00:27:39.290
the majority of my patients
have it on their scalp.

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:40.900
And if it's just on the scalp,

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:44.640
keeping the hair short and
using things like tar gel and

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.470
ketoconazole shampoo can control it often,

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:51.930
sometimes we do have to
use topical steroid lotions

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:53.207
as well on the scalp,

00:27:53.207 --> 00:27:56.460
but keeping the hair short,
especially for the males,

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.653
and those other two measures
are quite effective.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.311
If it's on the skin,

00:28:02.311 --> 00:28:05.570
then the treatment is more intensive.

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:08.993
It involves a high
potency topical steroids,

00:28:08.993 --> 00:28:12.650
vitamin D ointments, Dr. Howard
will talk more about that.

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:14.928
And the deferential includes seb derm,

00:28:14.928 --> 00:28:18.218
crusted scabies, other things.

00:28:18.218 --> 00:28:20.263
But this is something you should refer.

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:23.090
Doesn't mean you can't start treatment,

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:23.923
especially if you have

00:28:23.923 --> 00:28:25.790
a wonderful dermatologist like Dr. Howard,

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:28.490
who will answer you at all
times of the day and night,

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:31.660
but this is something
that should be followed

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.763
by a dermatologist.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.647
A word on oral manifestations.

00:28:35.647 --> 00:28:38.840
Macroglossia, sometimes
kids have a big tongue,

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.360
and sometimes the tongue just looks big

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.360
because the oral cavity is small.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.520
The tongue can be fissured,

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:46.070
it can be geographic and
this is super common,

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:49.270
and it's not scary, and I just reassure.

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:51.780
Lip fissures and a lot
of angular cheilitis,

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:52.990
I think that has something to do

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:56.193
with that impaired killing,
fungal killing on the skin.

00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:58.300
It's quite common,

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:02.046
and the treatment is some
topical lotrimin at first,

00:29:02.046 --> 00:29:04.296
and then you can add a
little hydrocortisone.

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:07.185
After a couple of weeks.

00:29:07.185 --> 00:29:09.050
You don't want to put steroids right away

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:10.460
on something that's thought to be fungal,

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:12.660
otherwise the fungus
is gonna throw a party.

00:29:13.635 --> 00:29:14.870
You don't have to refer

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:17.520
unless the cheilitis develops
some sort of granuloma,

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:21.463
because of picking or touching
or excessive inflammation.

00:29:24.365 --> 00:29:28.270
A word about institutionalization
in dermatology.

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:29.590
When you read these articles

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:31.160
about dermatology in Down Syndrome,

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:34.750
it talks about high rates of
onychomycosis, and scabies,

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:36.530
and the question is, well,

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:38.910
is it truly because of an inherent thing

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:39.743
with Down Syndrome?

00:29:39.743 --> 00:29:41.500
Or is it because you studied patients

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.825
in an institutionalized setting

00:29:43.825 --> 00:29:48.029
where things like scabies
can spread like wildfire?

00:29:48.029 --> 00:29:49.506
What we do know about scabies

00:29:49.506 --> 00:29:51.940
is that individuals with Down Syndrome

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.010
are more likely to have a crusted scabies

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:55.290
type of presentation,

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:56.830
and one of the thoughts is that maybe

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:58.470
they feel the itching a little bit less

00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:59.380
due to the differences

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:01.670
in sensory perception and processing.

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:04.470
And that could lead to more

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:06.653
wide spreading of the scabies mite.

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:10.250
I did it.

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:12.149
So thank you for your attention,

00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:14.430
and we'll answer questions together

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:15.813
after Dr. Howard's talk.
