[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.380
CHRIS DIBONA: Hi,
I'm Chris DiBona.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.490
I work for Google.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.260
It's a company.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.290
And I look after open source
software for the company, as

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.570
much as anyone does.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.400
I like to say that I'm
responsible for a lot of stuff

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.080
around open source, as much as--

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.060
So you can blame me if
there's something wrong, is

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.892
the long and short of it.

00:00:28.892 --> 00:00:31.100
But I'm not the only person
who works on open source,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.240
by any measure.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.490
And so what I'm
going to do is I'm

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.210
going to ask our panelists
to introduce themselves

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.790
and to give you a picture
of what a day in their life

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.850
is like working
on these projects.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.000
And maybe each of
you can say what's

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.880
the favorite thing you see in a
contributor, a new contributor

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.260
to a project.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.860
Right?

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.584
So, Cassandra,
introduce yourself.

00:00:54.584 --> 00:00:55.750
CASSANDRA SALISBURY: Oh, OK.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.541
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah.

00:00:56.541 --> 00:00:58.910
CASSANDRA SALISBURY: My
name is Cassandra Salisbury.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.350
I am on the open source strategy
team and a program manager

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.780
for developer
relations for Golang.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.380
Ooh, a day in my life--

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.720
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.860
CASSANDRA SALISBURY:
It's a lot of emails

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.410
but they're primarily around
strategy for growing Golang

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.980
and how to work open
source at Google,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:28.115
as well as how to support
our 1.6 million users for Go.

00:01:28.115 --> 00:01:29.740
My favorite thing
about a contributor--

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.031
CHRIS DIBONA: How many million?

00:01:31.031 --> 00:01:32.760
CASSANDRA SALISBURY:
1.6 million.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.500
Yeah.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.057
Yeah, it's up a lot
in the last year.

00:01:35.057 --> 00:01:36.890
CHRIS DIBONA: Did you
personally count them?

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.700
CASSANDRA SALISBURY: I mean, I
asked for the gophers by color

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.662
and demographic, and I
feel like it's close.

00:01:43.662 --> 00:01:44.870
Yeah, I feel like it's close.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.729
Maybe we'll get more
exact this year.

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.270
But yeah, I think my favorite
thing about a new contributor--

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.870
is that you asked?

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.080
It's just passion,
and excitement,

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.730
and willing to jump in and solve
a problem where they see one.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.050
CHRIS DIBONA: So your favorite
kind of new contributor

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.255
is one who just dives in.

00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:05.630
CASSANDRA SALISBURY: Yeah,
it's the most helpful I think,

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.430
for me to see
someone take charge.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.509
CHRIS DIBONA: So if I were to
put my finger out and point

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.030
at somebody and say, you're
going to connect to Go,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.580
you're going to have them
go to the bug list or the--

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.955
CASSANDRA SALISBURY: I'm going
to have them go to GitHub,

00:02:15.955 --> 00:02:18.740
or I'm going to have
them join Gopher Slack,

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.510
because it's a
really active group.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.620
If they are already into
Go and programming in Go,

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.220
then they can go
help the newbies out.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.870
And if they haven't,
then they can

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.730
get a lot of their
questions answered there

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.010
and figure out where the
best place to start is.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.350
CHRIS DIBONA: And
the Gopher Slack--

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.720
I'm sorry, I'm going
to betray my age.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.650
In the old days, on the
#Perl on [INAUDIBLE],,

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.410
if somebody were
to ask a question,

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.130
often a certain
person would say,

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.769
I'm not here to do
your homework, or--

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:55.310
it wasn't me.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.840
It wasn't me.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.570
Or that sounds like
web programming.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.793
You want a different channel.

00:03:00.793 --> 00:03:02.180
And it was very unfriendly.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.137
Is the Slack channel friendlier?

00:03:04.137 --> 00:03:05.720
CASSANDRA SALISBURY:
One of the things

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.170
I love about the Go community is
we have a pretty stringent code

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.450
of conduct and the Gopher
Slack is very heavily regulated

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.620
for welcomeness and inclusivity.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.770
CHRIS DIBONA: That's good.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:19.853
CASSANDRA SALISBURY: Yeah.

00:03:19.853 --> 00:03:21.937
CHRIS DIBONA: Because
#Perl drove tons of people

00:03:21.937 --> 00:03:23.020
into Python's loving arms.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.510
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.110
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah,
which was fine.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.470
Python's a fine language, right?

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.070
[CHUCKLE]

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.870
Will.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:30.650
WILL NORRIS: Yes.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.271
CHRIS DIBONA:
Introduce yourself.

00:03:32.271 --> 00:03:33.770
WILL NORRIS: My
name is Will Norris.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.020
I work for Chris.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.330
So I work in our Open
Source Programs office.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.140
I manage two teams that
are primarily focused

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.180
on open source compliance.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.280
So we are ultimately responsible
for reviewing all open source

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.860
code that comes into
Google and all open source

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.360
code that leaves Google,
which turns out to be a lot.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.030
So we review every
package as it comes in--

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.530
CHRIS DIBONA: By
hand, line-by-line.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.029
[CHUCKLE]

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:03.450
WILL NORRIS: Yeah, line-by-line,
we review each one.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.250
No.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.320
So our engineering
team-- the only way

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.140
that we're able to handle
this is by automating as much

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.490
of this as possible.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.280
So we have a lot of tooling
around automatically scanning

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.970
for licenses and enforcing
various policies.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.170
We manage-- I don't know.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.370
We're at 140 or so
organizations on GitHub,

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.350
which is a lot to manage.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.970
So we've got a lot
of tooling that

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.910
uses their API to manage
that, and that kind of stuff.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.150
And then I also work
in a lesser capacity

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.660
with our outreach team,
which is responsible

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.800
for our own programs
for doing outreach,

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.601
Google Summer of
Code, Google Code-in

00:04:41.601 --> 00:04:43.100
are both kind of
focused at students

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.470
and getting them
involved in open source.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.280
We do that a lot.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.360
And then we also--

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.360
we do a lot of sponsorship,
and donations, and memberships,

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.660
and things like that.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.840
CHRIS DIBONA: And what
is the TODO Group?

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.474
WILL NORRIS: The TODO Group is--

00:04:56.474 --> 00:04:58.640
it's an organization-- it's
a group within the Linux

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.520
Foundation that is
basically the open source

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.000
offices at a lot of
different companies.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.510
So it's kind of like me
or Chris at Facebook,

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.180
and Microsoft, and most
of the big companies

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.710
that you would think about.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.800
We get together about
quarterly and share a lot

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.697
of best practices, some tooling.

00:05:17.697 --> 00:05:19.280
Because it turns out
we're all solving

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.800
exactly the same problems
in slightly different ways.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.790
And so it's trying to get more
dialogue between companies that

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.840
are really trying to
do open source well,

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.520
and getting those
companies talking.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.260
CHRIS DIBONA: And like
we asked Cassandra,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.840
when you see a
newcomer coming in,

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.700
are there any specific
traits that you say,

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.910
oh, that's going to be
a successful developer?

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:44.840
I know it.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.429
Or, they're going
to be a disaster?

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:47.970
I don't know.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.136
I'm not going to a negative.

00:05:49.136 --> 00:05:50.689
But, Yeah.

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:52.230
WILL NORRIS: I think
someone who is--

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:53.355
CHRIS DIBONA: Because you--

00:05:53.355 --> 00:05:57.920
So Will has to handle the bulk
of the incoming new people

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.806
and making sure that
they're properly--

00:06:00.806 --> 00:06:03.260
WILL NORRIS: I
think someone who is

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.600
willing to take
the time to learn

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.030
the community that they're
getting involved with.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.280
We actually just hired a
few engineers on my team

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.770
and we use Go for
all of our tooling.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.796
And someone made a comment
about tabs versus spaces.

00:06:15.796 --> 00:06:16.670
And I was like, yeah.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.753
You just have to understand
with Go, you use gofmt

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:21.020
and you're done and you
don't think about it.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.070
And just how refreshing
it is to just accept

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.622
the community that you're moving
into and not try to fight it.

00:06:28.622 --> 00:06:30.080
That tends to work
out really well.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.500
We see the same thing with
CLAs, our legal agreements,

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.982
that we have to have for
a variety of reasons.

00:06:36.982 --> 00:06:38.690
But I would actually
answer your question

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.370
a little bit
differently, which is,

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.220
the thing that I love
to see most in newcomers

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.880
is when they land that
first patch to a project

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.960
and just the sense of completion
and joy that comes from that.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.140
And the Go team did a special
hackathon about a year ago,

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.890
where they were really
focusing on getting

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.290
people contributing to GoCore.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.230
And it was an amazing
event where they got--

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.601
I don't know how many dozens
of new contributors to the core

00:07:06.601 --> 00:07:07.100
project.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.950
And it worked out really great.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.640
CHRIS DIBONA: Thank you, Will.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.140
Sarah.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.790
SARAH NOVOTNY:
I'm Sarah Novotny,

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.750
and I lead the Open Source
Strategy Group for Google Cloud

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.370
Platform.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:27.620
And my first project here
at Google was to embed--

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.800
much like Will described--
learning the Kubernetes

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.190
community and engaging
with that community

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.340
to help it evolve
from being a company

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.090
led project to a
community led project.

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:45.050
Since then, we have grown the
team and the number of projects

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:51.350
that we are embedding people
in, to eight, including Go,

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.740
which Cassandra is embedded in.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.310
And we choose these
projects as projects

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:01.820
that are either strategically
important for Google

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:06.350
to open source, so a first
party or outbound project.

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.930
And some open source
projects that are

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.060
strategically important
to our customers

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.770
on Google Cloud Platform.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:15.380
So things like, Node.js.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:19.760
Since JavaScript is now, more
common in production than Java,

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.920
we needed to be involved in
that language and JavaScript

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.570
standards and work like that.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:34.250
So I also lead the relationship
with the Linux Foundation.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.350
Will mentioned the TODO
Group as part of that.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:39.980
I sit on the Node.js
Foundation board,

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:44.000
helped found and move Kubernetes
to the Cloud Native Compute

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.800
Foundation, and helped the
Open Container Initiative

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.940
build its first specifications
for container portability.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.850
But you want to know what I
want to see and a contributor.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:56.460
CHRIS DIBONA: A new contributor.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.834
SARAH NOVOTNY: A
new contributor.

00:08:57.834 --> 00:08:59.930
CHRIS DIBONA: New, shiny.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:01.550
SARAH NOVOTNY: Brand new.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.190
I think there are a couple
of things in someone coming

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:07.400
into a community, any
community, whether it's

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.910
your local nonprofit
Boys and Girls Club,

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:14.210
or an open source
community, it's

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:17.270
understanding the
norms of that community

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:20.300
and not trying to
change it too quickly.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:24.890
You have to start by
learning the story of how

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:28.220
that community has gotten to
where it is before you say,

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:29.960
you're doing it wrong.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:35.330
And you spoke about the people
who come into a community

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.800
and you're like, ooh,
that's not going to work.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.600
It's those that come in and
say, you need to change this.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.590
You need to do it this way.

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.800
You have to earn
your credibility

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:51.380
and earn your opportunity to
make those sorts of changes

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.520
in a community.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.730
You really need to start
with helping the community

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.600
with the things they need before
you tell them the things you

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.500
think they should do.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:06.080
CHRIS DIBONA: So I want to
make sure that I clarify.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.960
So when I find
someone who I go, oh

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.947
gosh, they're coming
on strong, or oh gosh,

00:10:10.947 --> 00:10:12.530
I'm not sure that's
going to work out,

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.725
those are the ones that
I try to like grab--

00:10:15.725 --> 00:10:16.950
SARAH NOVOTNY: Mentor.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.449
CHRIS DIBONA: --like
a mother kitten

00:10:18.449 --> 00:10:20.930
and bring them into the
project and say, hey, here's

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:22.240
something you should check out.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.050
And this-- it's right
in line with what

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.550
you seem to be good at.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:31.220
And I try to make them
into the thing that

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.910
is best for the project.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:35.780
SARAH NOVOTNY: It also
speaks to Cassandra's point

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:39.020
about being excited
about and engaged in,

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.660
because sometimes people come
into these communities saying,

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.970
oh you really need to fix this.

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:45.770
And that's their
excitement showing.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.840
So if you can redirect
that excitement--

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.930
It's sort of like
open-source jujitsu--

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:56.100
move that weight and say, here
are three things we need done.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.440
Let's start with these and you
can actually encourage them.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.370
We've, in the
Kubernetes community,

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.600
Paris Pittman has spent
a lot of time working

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.540
on multiple types of
mentoring in order

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.870
to help the new contributor
onboarding experience

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:15.380
and bring people in as
graciously as possible,

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.280
and get them working on
things that the project needs

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.760
that also gets them the
quick win to the first patch.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:28.830
And then from there, grow
their influence in the project.

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:31.760
CHRIS DIBONA: So one thing I
want to ask all three of you

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:32.300
is--

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.258
so we've been talking
about these big projects,

00:11:34.258 --> 00:11:35.780
your TensorFlows,
your Kubernetes--

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.450
I was thinking about TensorFlow.

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:40.330
We didn't talk about it yet.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:41.330
And all the rest.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:45.500
But one of the things that
people come and ask me

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.560
about all the time--

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.560
and I know that
you've been asked

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:54.800
this- is getting that first new
contributor, going from this,

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:59.810
oh, well here's a cool
thing we're going to release

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:02.490
and then skipping right to--
it's like step one underpants,

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:03.350
step three profit.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.840
It's like, we all talk
about these communities

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.560
and building these
huge ecosystems

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.800
but a lot of
projects, they never

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.080
get to that first
external contributor.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.840
So what would you do to
help a project get there

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.230
or what have you done to
help a project get there?

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:22.240
Maybe it's in a sub
library of Go, or--

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.560
Yeah, I'm very curious.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.200
Because I honestly, I
have the hardest time

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.000
with this question.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.949
SARAH NOVOTNY: So I'll
jump in because in my team,

00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:33.740
we have a number of
people that are working

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.750
across a number of
projects and some of them

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:39.200
are at very early stages.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.650
There are projects that
have been recently released.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:46.620
There are projects that have
been out for eight years.

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:50.240
And so there's this whole
gamut within the lifecycle.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:55.490
The new projects,
one of the best ways

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:59.840
to get new people involved
and get people excited

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.500
is to be an advocate
in that project.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:08.870
And so that means that it is
easier and more successful

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:12.500
if someone who is already
participating in a project

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.660
is super excited
about it and starts

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.690
drawing in their friends,
starts drawing in the people

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:21.260
that they know, starts
talking about it on Twitter,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.590
starts just sharing
that excitement.

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:28.970
And those projects start
to take off and start

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:34.460
to build just a reinforcement
of that advocacy,

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.590
if you can share
your excitement.

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:38.836
If you're doing this
because it's horrible,

00:13:38.836 --> 00:13:40.460
and it just needs to
be fixed, and then

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.320
I'm going to open
source it, it's

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.830
not likely to take off
as a broader project.

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:49.100
But if you can say why this
is super neat and why you are

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:53.390
so excited about fixing it,
or making this available

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:57.950
to the broader community, or
how it fits in another community

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:03.779
and bootstrap off of that, then
you find like-minded people--

00:14:03.779 --> 00:14:04.820
they may be your friends.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.300
There may be other
people trying to solve

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.460
the same sort of problem.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.850
And you can invigorate
their interest.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.800
But it does take
some evangelism.

00:14:16.087 --> 00:14:18.170
WILL NORRIS: I would say
one of the key things you

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:21.050
can do is to make sure
that your project is ready

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.840
and welcoming to newcomers.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.500
And so, this comes down
a lot of times to the way

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:31.070
that you manage your community
and just the documentation.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.980
We find that from projects
that had participated

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.740
in the Summer of Code
in previous years,

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:40.220
even if the work that the
students did on that project--

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.200
I mean, maybe it was
great, maybe it wasn't.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.500
But invariably,
those projects end up

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:49.840
having to focus so much on their
getting started documentation,

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.310
of making sure that they
have a clear guide for people

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.900
to get up and running in a
very short amount of time.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.310
And those kinds of changes
really stick with the project

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:01.530
and just make the project
welcoming in general.

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:03.500
One of the things we
encourage a lot-- and this

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.640
is pretty common.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.030
--is having a set of
issues on your project

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:10.870
that are specifically
labeled for beginners,

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:14.480
like beginner tasks that the
core team doesn't work on.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.130
And they intentionally
don't work on it

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:22.640
so that when that newcomer
comes there's a really bite size

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.440
issue that they can fix.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.850
And that really eases--
setting them up for success,

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:30.835
I think is really kind
of where I would say.

00:15:30.835 --> 00:15:32.210
SARAH NOVOTNY: To
that point, you

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:36.140
can use those new contributors
to help with that onboarding

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.314
process, cause they get stuck.

00:15:38.314 --> 00:15:39.230
You say, that's great.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.610
Lets document this.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.890
And then you work with them
to improve that process.

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:47.540
WILL NORRIS: One of the most
valuable perspectives I think,

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.940
is the person who doesn't know.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.820
And it's so valuable because
you lose that perspective

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:54.420
so quickly.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.150
And we find this
internally at Google

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:58.490
because Google is structured
so that you can move around

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:00.240
between teams very easily.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.000
And so there's a
lot of mobility.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.240
And when that new person
comes to your team,

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.460
you have to take
advantage of that time.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:10.080
It's like you've got a very
short window before they start

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.530
learning all that
institutional knowledge that

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.550
never gets written down.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.160
And so you've got
to write it down

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.730
when that person
is first coming on.

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.790
CASSANDRA SALISBURY: Kind
of piggybacking off of that.

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:27.350
I totally want to just point
out the cross-promotion of,

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:28.710
with other communities.

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:29.210
Right?

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:34.270
Because we've seen that on
a massive scale with Go,

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.810
in Kubernetes, in Docker.

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:40.610
I used to run a meet up
in San Francisco for Go.

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:43.910
And the amount of
evangelists, kind

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:49.010
of naturally coming to that
and doing speaking engagements,

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:51.920
really perpetuates that
level of like, ooh, this

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.580
sounds really awesome.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.630
So five years ago,
I'm looking at, oh, I

00:16:56.630 --> 00:17:00.830
heard that one meet up, that one
time, that one talk, and it's

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:04.020
exploded just because people
are willing to talk about it.

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.339
I also think-- of
off Will's point--

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:10.430
in a smaller project that I
worked on prior to Google,

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:15.839
labeling in GitHub was a huge
help for new contributors.

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:18.800
And then after-- since we've
talked about the getting

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:23.329
of the contributors-- after you
have a nice little, small pool,

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:26.000
we would do weekly
meetings with them

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.831
for like 30 minutes
just to encourage them

00:17:28.831 --> 00:17:30.830
and to make them feel
like they were really part

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:33.480
of a collaborative process.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.660
SARAH NOVOTNY: Which
ends up leading to making

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.790
the feeling of a tribe.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:41.900
So you need to have some sort
of cohesive group feeling

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.905
in order to join
and participate.

00:17:44.905 --> 00:17:46.280
And you have to
feel as if you're

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:51.560
making some sort of contribution
that is recognized and valued.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:57.290
And every community needs to
have that space where you are

00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:00.210
able to say, I participated.

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:06.260
I met the luminary who
wrote Go, the luminary who

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:07.940
started Kubernetes.

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:13.100
And then there's this
sense of togetherness.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:17.120
You end up aligning a group of
people in a single direction.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.360
And you can't understate
how valuable--

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:24.290
or you can't overstate
how valuable that is.

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:28.354
CHRIS DIBONA: So before I ask my
next broad question type thing,

00:18:28.354 --> 00:18:29.520
we do have some microphones.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.930
And in about 10 minutes, if
you want to ask, we'll see.

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:36.110
There's there and there.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:40.070
So we say this word
community a lot.

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:44.870
It's kind of, in some ways,
the least defined thing ever.

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:46.930
And we say, open, a lot.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:50.800
And I'm not going to say
it's frustrating for me

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:56.360
but I've always tried
to be really annoyingly

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.940
particular about this.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:03.110
And so when you say
community, when you say,

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:06.470
open, and I think,
open source software

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:08.090
licensed under an
open sourced license

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:12.050
and offered to the public.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:13.830
But what does it mean to you?

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:20.690
What is your gold standard of
how you like to best interact

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:24.440
technically in these projects?

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.140
So I just--

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:30.020
And I know this is partly
me projecting but--

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:34.800
CASSANDRA SALISBURY:
If I'm looking at,

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:39.660
what does it take
to be open, then I'm

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:42.840
looking at transparency.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:47.340
Do we know why decisions
are being made in a project?

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:50.110
Can we see clear paths?

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:54.000
Is documentation
transparent, easy to follow?

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.070
I'm looking at collaboration.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:00.990
So, how easy is it to
contribute to the process?

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:02.490
Does it feel collaborative?

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:04.140
Are people interacting?

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:05.820
Are they meeting at conferences?

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:09.090
Are they interacting on
a slack or a channel?

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:13.920
And then I think, lastly,
it would be inclusivity,

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.650
making sure that
there's an openness

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:20.130
of all types of
opinions and needs,

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:21.930
and that they're
being listened to.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:24.090
And that people
feel it's easy to,

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:28.950
again, just have access and
feel included in the process.

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:31.590
SARAH NOVOTNY: I think there's
another underpinning component

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:35.400
to all of those, which
is respect for all

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.600
the people participating.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:43.560
And it goes back to Will's point
that that newcomer's view--

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:47.280
even if you don't see it and
it seems perfectly obvious how

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.620
you should get from A to C--

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:55.320
that newcomer's view is gold
because there is friction

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:55.950
there.

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:57.900
And that friction,
if it's not going

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.300
to be a contributor
who drops out,

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.310
it might be user who drops out.

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:05.110
And so you're decreasing
your adoption.

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:09.630
So you have this adoption curve,
or this contributor curve,

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:12.150
where it's like, everybody who
thinks the Kubernetes might

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:13.630
be awesome.

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.740
And then everybody who
has read CONTRIBUTING.md

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.990
and maybe got stymied by it.

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:20.760
And then suddenly
you've got a list

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.400
of people who did understand
what we were saying

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.350
because we actually
forgot to mention

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:29.340
that K8S means Kubernetes.

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.710
And then you've got
this group who's

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:35.700
bothered to stick around
long enough to actually go

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:36.990
through all these hurdles.

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:40.380
And so you've decreased
the number of people,

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:43.320
and the people that
you're engaging with,

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:46.830
a lot, if you're not respecting
that newcomer view, if you're

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:51.180
not respecting the challenges
and feedback that people

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.590
are bringing to you.

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:55.020
So that, to me, is one of
the core pieces of openness.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.120
CHRIS DIBONA: Will--

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.290
SARAH NOVOTNY: Licenses.

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:02.060
Sorry.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.800
WILL NORRIS: No, I would say--

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.960
maybe provide a slightly
different perspective,

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.250
which is, we've
often said at Google

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:13.340
that there's no one
way to do open source.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.080
And I really do believe that.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.450
And that's true in so
many different ways,

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:21.110
in terms of licenses, in
terms of governance models,

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:24.500
in terms of community
management styles.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.009
And Google is big enough that--

00:22:27.009 --> 00:22:28.550
Sarah was making
this point earlier--

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:31.250
that even within the eight or so
projects that they engage with,

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:32.630
there's a lot of variety.

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:35.570
Within the thousands of
projects that Google releases,

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:37.640
there is a huge
amount of variety.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.370
And it really comes
back to, why did you

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:41.959
open-source it to begin with?

00:22:41.959 --> 00:22:44.000
And it's going to be
different for every project.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.766
And so that gold standard
really depends on,

00:22:47.766 --> 00:22:49.640
what were the goals of
releasing that project

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.260
in the first place?

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.709
And that's going to guide how
you make a lot of decisions.

00:22:53.709 --> 00:22:56.000
And that's something that
Sarah and I have been working

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.910
on together for a little
while is, helping provide

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:02.900
that guidance for teams at
Google to really think through,

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.000
why are they releasing
it as open source,

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.110
and then, let that
dictate how they answer

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:10.650
a lot of these other questions.

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:15.740
SARAH NOVOTNY: You also have
the spectrum between open source

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:20.120
software, to an
open source project,

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:24.860
to an open inclusive community,
which is even further.

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:28.070
So open source
software, I often define

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:31.520
as code that is
publicly available

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:37.400
and has a license that
the OSI has checkboxed,

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.140
said, this is an
open source license.

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.020
So that would be
open source software.

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.060
Doesn't mean you get
an opinion on it.

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.910
It doesn't mean you get
to contribute or change it

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:47.690
but it's open.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:48.440
It's available.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.360
It is-- you're free to use it.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.190
You're free to look at it.

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:53.180
You're free to fork it.

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:55.050
You're free to change
it on your own.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:58.400
But you may not be able to
modify the core software

00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.910
as it stands.

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:03.800
But as you move toward, down the
progression and the continuum

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.470
toward project, it
becomes much more

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:09.740
about pulling together a
cohesive community that

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:14.210
is looking to solve a
larger problem than any one

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:17.330
perspective can
accurately scope.

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:21.740
Sort of the blind men trying
to describe an elephant.

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:24.290
Each different piece
of your community

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:27.590
comes to the project bringing
you a different perspective.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:30.410
And this is one of the
things we saw in Kubernetes.

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:35.030
Google had a very opinionated
way of dealing with containers.

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:35.930
We built Bork.

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:37.160
We built Omega.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.620
We knew Kubernetes
was going to be

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.230
a thing that the
world needed but we

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:44.330
needed more perspectives.

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:47.240
And so that had to
be an open community.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.280
That is not every project.

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:53.340
And that is not every project
that is released by anyone.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.550
It's not every project
released by Google.

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:58.940
Android, as an example,
has fewer people

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:00.740
contributing and
changing the way

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:05.660
the Android open source
project moves from outside

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.060
of Google than many--

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.590
than Kubernetes at this--

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:13.970
well, maybe not direct
numbers because of the years,

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:17.240
but there are different
amounts of influence

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:22.660
based on the strategic
goals of the project.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.540
CHRIS DIBONA: So I
don't want to turn this

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.690
into my personal meeting
with my colleagues

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:32.880
but what's wrong with how
we release code from Google?

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.340
What would you want
to see different?

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:36.870
What's hard?

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:39.540
What problems have you
seen when releasing code

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:40.610
from the company?

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:43.151
Because I have people from other
big companies come to me all

00:25:43.151 --> 00:25:45.380
the time and say, wow, you
released a lot of stuff

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.963
but you didn't release this one
thing I wanted you to release.

00:25:47.963 --> 00:25:49.390
And I'm like, eh, you know.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:52.890
So tell me how we could
be doing a better job

00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:55.475
and how we could all
be doing a better job.

00:25:55.475 --> 00:25:57.850
WILL NORRIS: I'd know the
answer to that one immediately.

00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:00.224
And it really relates to what
we were just talking about,

00:26:00.224 --> 00:26:02.910
that there is no one
way to do open-source.

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:06.880
We could absolutely do a better
job of setting expectations,

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.810
that when you find a random
project in one of our GitHub

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:15.130
orgs, or on googlesource.com,
or wherever you find a project,

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:19.600
is this a project that is being
used in production at Google?

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.180
Is this being
actively developed?

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:25.080
Is it looking for community?

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:29.010
Or is this just a project that
is intended to be consumed

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:31.840
but maybe not collaborated on?

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.520
And we can-- you can argue
on which one is better

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.840
and all of that but regardless
of any of that, just

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.270
setting the right
expectation is something

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:45.630
that we could absolutely
do a better job of.

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:48.420
CASSANDRA SALISBURY:
For the Go project,

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:51.090
we do have a really
collaborative-- we

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:53.100
want contributors, et cetera.

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.430
And so, some of the
things that we've learned

00:26:56.430 --> 00:27:01.830
would be, ask for opinions
and contributions early on.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:04.890
So if you are going
to release then--

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:07.970
sometimes we get feedback
from behind the doors,

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:10.830
so that when you do you get
a little bit less of a nudge

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:12.240
there.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:18.506
But I think even more so,
it is that you need to--

00:27:18.506 --> 00:27:20.130
exactly what you're
saying, Will-- it's

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:23.040
an iterative process,
usually, when you

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.080
have a collaborative project.

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.340
It's all iterative.

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.830
And so that's the one thing
we've learned is, be clear.

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:32.790
Yes, it may not be perfect
when it is first released

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.405
but it's all iterative.

00:27:34.405 --> 00:27:36.030
And the reason we do
that is because we

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:37.554
want those contributions.

00:27:37.554 --> 00:27:38.970
WILL NORRIS: And
just being honest

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:41.817
and transparent about where a
project is along that spectrum.

00:27:41.817 --> 00:27:42.900
CASSANDRA SALISBURY: Yeah.

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:44.816
SARAH NOVOTNY: I'm willing
to go out on a limb

00:27:44.816 --> 00:27:48.070
and say, I guarantee it won't be
perfect when it goes out first.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.640
CASSANDRA SALISBURY:
No, it for sure won't.

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:49.840
Yeah.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.120
No, for sure.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.900
SARAH NOVOTNY: But to
Will's point, making sure

00:27:54.900 --> 00:28:00.060
that we are setting expectations
is important but also showing

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:03.000
growth paths, showing how
someone can contribute,

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.290
and how they can continue
to engage with the project,

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:10.680
showing where the
project needs are,

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:17.040
and making sure that when we
are engaging with the community,

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.470
that their feedback
is recognized,

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:20.750
even if it isn't followed.

00:28:25.519 --> 00:28:27.810
CHRIS DIBONA: So should I
ask about contributor license

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:29.016
agreements and DCOs?

00:28:29.016 --> 00:28:29.516
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:29.516 --> 00:28:31.920
I mean, how much
actual problems do you

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:36.930
see around the apparatus
of intellectual property

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:39.461
actually keeping you from
getting contributors and all

00:28:39.461 --> 00:28:39.960
the rest.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.126
Because this is something
we talk about quite a bit.

00:28:42.126 --> 00:28:43.280
We are a big company.

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:46.350
So we care a lot about
where software comes from,

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:50.820
who's writing it, who owns that
intellectual property as it's

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:53.610
released, and we have to be
very, very careful about it

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:55.520
because we get sued a lot.

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.890
So I'd be really
interested in hearing

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:03.300
if you've seen a real
problem because of that or--

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:04.680
because--

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.780
WILL NORRIS: You
see it occasionally.

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:09.510
For the most part, the
biggest problems we see

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:12.540
are just weird edge cases
that our automated tooling

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:13.710
can't handle.

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:16.380
And so a fair amount of my
time, and my team's time,

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:18.496
is spent dealing with
those edge cases,

00:29:18.496 --> 00:29:20.120
and walking people
through the process,

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.810
and figuring it all out.

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:24.030
We will occasionally
see someone who

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:27.240
just is adamant about not
wanting to sign a contributor

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.950
license agreement.

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:31.638
And in those cases,
we have to say,

00:29:31.638 --> 00:29:33.762
I'm sorry this is just
something that we do require

00:29:33.762 --> 00:29:36.380
for a variety of reasons.

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.820
And we've seen time
and time again,

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:43.530
where having that contributor
license agreement has saved us,

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:47.140
or has allowed us a
degree of flexibility.

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:50.490
For example, we relicensed
Angular a few years ago.

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:53.680
We originally released it
under the Apache 2 license.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.010
The community-- the
JavaScript community

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:58.140
largely preferred MIT.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.630
And so we talked about it
and we made that decision

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:03.810
to relicense the project
under MIT, at the community's

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:04.830
request.

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:07.250
This was something that was
only possible because we

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.000
had contributor license
agreements for all

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.170
of those contributors.

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:14.070
SARAH NOVOTNY: And I'll
play devil's advocate

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:17.100
because Kubernetes was
a challenge for this.

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:21.000
So Kubernetes went
out into the world

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.690
with a half dozen
corporate entities

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:26.830
really working
closely with Google.

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:32.040
So our 1.0 launch had all of
these corporate collaborators.

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:36.120
And that worked great because we
all understood how this worked.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:40.320
We were all signing the Google
contributor license agreement.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.180
It was all OK.

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:47.370
But the idea that Kubernetes
was to be industry changing

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:51.480
and actually move the way
we thought about portable

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:56.160
workloads in the cloud meant
that we needed more, and more,

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.970
and more companies-- especially
very large companies,

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:04.320
especially companies who may
or may not compete with Google

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:11.520
in different consumer areas
and business product areas--

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:15.060
means that it got to be
a lot more contentious.

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.310
So, I want to contribute
to your thing.

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.410
I want to help you
achieve your goals

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:22.330
but I can't sign your license.

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:27.720
And so we got stuck with a few
corporate contributors saying,

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.380
that's great but we can't.

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:34.020
And Kubernetes, because we
knew we wanted this-- again,

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:36.610
going back to, what
was the strategic goal?

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:38.610
Going back to what the
strategic goal was,

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:41.260
we wanted this to
change the industry.

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:43.920
And so we knew that to
do that we had to let

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.450
go of some of the control.

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:49.320
And that was the creation of the
Cloud Native Compute Foundation

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.330
at the Linux Foundation.

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:56.520
And that then allowed us to
take the same language we

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.710
use for the Google
Contributor License Agreement,

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:02.220
cross-out Google, say
Cloud Native Compute

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:06.540
Foundation in all the locations,
change the tooling so that it

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:10.290
was the Cloud Native
Compute Foundation License,

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:14.460
transfer all the licenses with
all the existing contributors.

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:17.100
And now those
companies that were not

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:21.060
happy about signing a Google
Contributor License Agreement

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:25.200
were perfectly content
to sign the same language

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.100
as long as that transfer of
IP went to the Cloud Native

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.020
Compute Foundation.

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:34.650
And that was a fine
solution for this.

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:39.930
A lot of younger projects,
more recent projects,

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:44.550
have focused on
DCOs and not CLAs--

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:46.800
Developer Certificates
of Origin,

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.680
instead of Contributor License
Agreements, or Corporate

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.750
Contributor License Agreements.

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:54.870
And that's not
something that Google

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:58.110
is comfortable with because
there's not a lot of case

00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:59.920
law about it at this point.

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:03.700
And a lot of the case law is
being litigated right now.

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.160
And until there is a clear path.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.160
Until there is a
clear way that you

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.670
can handle the, oops, we need
to relicense this, or oops,

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:14.580
we need to make a big
change without having

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:18.900
to contact the thousands
of contributors that

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:20.820
may have contributed
to a project,

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:25.968
until that case law exists,
it's too big of risk.

00:33:25.968 --> 00:33:28.450
CHRIS DIBONA: Have you seen
any problems with this?

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:31.300
CASSANDRA SALISBURY: Well,
Go sits a little differently

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.720
in the bucket than I think
everything else's projects do.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:34.440
SARAH NOVOTNY: See, no one way.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.523
CASSANDRA SALISBURY: Yeah.

00:33:35.523 --> 00:33:37.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:40.110
We, being that we're a
programming language,

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:41.850
it is a little bit different.

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:46.000
But I can say that last
summer, before I joined Google,

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.520
I sat in a room--

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.110
Will, you alluded to this--

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:55.860
with a I think it was 150,
for our first ever contributor

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:56.790
workshop.

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:59.790
And it did require that everyone
go through the CLA process,

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:01.890
which was interesting together.

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:05.640
But it was also super
rad and I definitely

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.710
didn't have any
problems at my table.

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:09.929
And I don't believe
we had any problems

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:13.020
with that particular portion
of it at the other tables.

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:15.420
So--

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:17.640
CHRIS DIBONA:
Thank you for that.

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.260
SARAH NOVOTNY: Inside baseball.

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:20.343
CHRIS DIBONA: What's that?

00:34:20.343 --> 00:34:22.350
SARAH NOVOTNY: It's
totally inside baseball.

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:26.679
CHRIS DIBONA: It is but I'm
the moderator, so whatever.

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:27.940
No, I mean that in a nice way.

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:31.199
So-- and we're out
of time, so I'm

00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:34.110
going to say thank you
to all of you for coming.

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:35.850
And thank you to the panelists.

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:37.874
And have a great
rest of your I/O.

00:34:37.874 --> 00:34:40.718
