00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.600
- This idea of mastery learning

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.079
was always kind of this gold standard.

00:00:03.079 --> 00:00:05.662
(upbeat music)

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.700
This was actually as
a part of a fellowship

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.743
I had while I was at MIT
called the Eloranta Fellowship

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:14.123
to make a learning software
for students with ADHD.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.220
And it immediately struck a chord with me

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.000
because going into that the
whole premise of the software

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.820
that I was working on was this idea

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.596
that it's not that students
aren't capable of learning

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:30.883
some advanced mathematics

00:00:30.883 --> 00:00:33.326
or that the topics are actually difficult,

00:00:33.326 --> 00:00:36.260
it's more that they just
have gaps in their knowledge.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.815
And I did a lot of
tutoring in high school.

00:00:37.815 --> 00:00:40.550
And I saw that over and over again

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.940
that the reason why students were having,

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.440
my friends were having trouble
with algebra, geometry,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.650
it was just because they had a
gap in their negative numbers

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.603
or divide and get decimals or
logarithms or whatever else.

00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:03.940
Good students start failing
in algebra all of a sudden

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.969
and start failing calculus all of a sudden

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:08.730
despite being smart,
despite having good teachers

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.400
and it's usually because they
have these Swiss cheese gaps

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.310
that kept building
throughout their foundations.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.080
Now a lot of skeptics might say,

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.250
well hey, this is all great,

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.530
philosophically this whole
idea of mastery based learning

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.963
and its connection to mindset,

00:01:19.963 --> 00:01:22.550
students taking agency over their learning

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.813
makes a lot of sense,
but it seems impractical.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.830
The real philosophical
core of Khan Academy

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.460
is mastery learning.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.970
And everything we've built,
whether it's the video library,

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.383
the articles we have, the 70,000 items,

00:01:46.383 --> 00:01:48.960
the game mechanics that
we have on our site,

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.259
it's all in service to mastery learning.

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.842
