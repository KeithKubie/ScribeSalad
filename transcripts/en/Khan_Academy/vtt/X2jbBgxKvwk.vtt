00:00:00.387 --> 00:00:02.135
- [Instructor] This is
the Khan Academy exercise

00:00:02.135 --> 00:00:05.136
on relative maxima and minima,

00:00:05.136 --> 00:00:09.734
and they ask us to mark all
the relative maximum points

00:00:09.734 --> 00:00:11.464
in the graph.

00:00:11.464 --> 00:00:13.770
Like always, pause this video
and see if you can figure out

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.521
which are the relative maximum points.

00:00:16.521 --> 00:00:18.364
Okay, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:18.364 --> 00:00:21.248
And just as a review, a
relative maximum point

00:00:21.248 --> 00:00:23.212
is a point of the graph

00:00:23.212 --> 00:00:27.275
where the values of the
graph around it are going

00:00:27.275 --> 00:00:29.630
to be less than or equal to the value

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.848
of the graph at that point.

00:00:31.848 --> 00:00:33.849
So, for example, this
point right over here

00:00:33.849 --> 00:00:36.890
would not be a relative maximum point,

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.320
because if we were to
go to the right of it,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.472
the function is larger than at this point.

00:00:40.472 --> 00:00:43.022
It has a higher value than at this point.

00:00:43.022 --> 00:00:46.016
This point over here, which
looks like a peak of a mountain,

00:00:46.016 --> 00:00:47.498
and that's a pretty good giveaway

00:00:47.498 --> 00:00:49.898
if it looks like the top of a
hill or a peak of a mountain

00:00:49.898 --> 00:00:52.439
for a form of relative maximum point.

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:54.305
This looks like a really good candidate.

00:00:54.305 --> 00:00:56.674
If we move to the right a little bit,

00:00:56.674 --> 00:00:58.428
we get lower values for our function,

00:00:58.428 --> 00:00:59.972
and if we move to the left a little bit,

00:00:59.972 --> 00:01:01.685
we get lower values for our function,

00:01:01.685 --> 00:01:04.027
and so this is a relative maximum point.

00:01:04.027 --> 00:01:06.269
Let's do another example.

00:01:06.269 --> 00:01:09.775
Here they say mark all the
relative minimum points

00:01:09.775 --> 00:01:11.502
in the graph.

00:01:11.502 --> 00:01:14.941
Well, a relative minimum
point is a point of the graph

00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:18.140
where if were to look at the
values of the graph around it,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.159
they're all going to
be the same or higher.

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:22.059
One way to think about it,

00:01:22.059 --> 00:01:25.047
this would be the bottom
of a dip in the graph.

00:01:25.047 --> 00:01:28.095
And you see one big dip in this graph,

00:01:28.095 --> 00:01:30.130
and the bottom of it is right over there,

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.215
so that would be a relative minimum point.

00:01:32.215 --> 00:01:35.738
And you can see if you have
the X values around it,

00:01:35.738 --> 00:01:38.506
the values of the function at
those X values are all going

00:01:38.506 --> 00:01:40.186
to be the same or higher

00:01:40.186 --> 00:01:42.884
than the value of the
function right at this point.

00:01:42.884 --> 00:01:45.008
That's not true for
any of the other points

00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:47.508
that we can see of this graph.
