00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.200
We can see what might be relationships between price

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.420
and clarity and price and color, which we'll keep in

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.050
mind for later when start modelling our data. You might

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.200
remember this when you create the box plots in problem

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.080
set three. Be that as it may, the critical factor

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.590
driving price is the size, or the carat weight of

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.620
the diamond. As we saw at the start of the

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.980
lesson, the relationship between price and diamond size is nonlinear.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.270
What might explain this pattern? On the supply side, larger

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.070
continuous chunks of diamonds without significant flaws are probably harder to

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.220
find than smaller ones. This might help explain the sort

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.090
of exponential looking curve, and I thought I noticed this when

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.860
I was shopping for a diamond for my soon to

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.780
be wife. Of course, this is related to the fact that

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.980
the weight of a diamond is a function of volume, and

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.980
volume is a function of the length times the width times

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.720
the height of a diamond, and this suggests that we might

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.400
be especially interested in the cube root of carat weight. It's often

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.420
the case, that leveraging substantive knowledge about your data like this can

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.050
lead to especially fruitful transformations, and we'll see that in a second.
