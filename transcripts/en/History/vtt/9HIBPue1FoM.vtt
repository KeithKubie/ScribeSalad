00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.210
[music playing]

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.880
J. NEILSON: Bladesmiths,
welcome to our strength test.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.170
What your blades do to the
ice, I don't really care.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.210
I want to see what the ice is
going to do to your blades.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.380
Ashe, you ready to go?

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.330
Mm-hmm.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.830
There we go.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.380
ASHE: I think my handle's
going to be a problem.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.380
I don't know how well the
epoxy bonded to the tang.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.670
I'm worried that the blade
could fly right off the handle.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.580
[music playing]

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.920
[grunting]

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.750
Hell yeah.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:44.580
Congratulations.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.170
You survived the ice.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.540
Your blade held up very nice.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.420
You've still got
an edge on here.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.750
You do have a bit of a
problem back here though.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.420
The epoxy was connected
back here before,

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.920
and it's not anymore.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.250
You can see it
moves quite easily.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.420
But overall, nicely done.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.880
Thank you, sir.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.790
Geoff, you ready to go?

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.250
Let's go.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.210
The ice chop is a
terribly destructive test.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.120
You'd have to be silly not
to be concerned about it.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.580
[music playing]

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.920
[grunting]

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.790
Wow.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.540
She survived, Geoff.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.880
This just feels like it wants to
keep cutting and keep cutting.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.880
You got a lot of handle here,
but it was comfortable enough

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.420
at the radiusing.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.040
Everything stayed tight.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.790
Nicely done.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:44.830
Thank you.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.170
Levi, what are you thinking?

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.120
Let's dance.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.080
J. is super tough on blades.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.920
With my blade in his
hands, of course,

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.670
I'm going to be nervous.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.670
[music playing]

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.000
[grunting]

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.620
J. NEILSON: All right, Levi,
we got a bit of an issue here.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.460
If you look at those first two
strikes, your blade's bent now.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.250
The other issue is this
knuckle right here.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.000
I wish you had, like,
another half an inch.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.880
I could feel it beating onto my
knuckle every time we struck.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.710
Sorry, J.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.620
My turn.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.380
To test the sharpness
of your blade,

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.380
I'll be using the serrated
section to cut this rope.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.330
Once that rope's cut, a
melon drops from the ceiling,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.290
and I'll use your blade
to slash through that.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.040
Ashe, you're up first.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.790
Are you ready?

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.540
Let's do it.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.210
OK.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.880
[music playing]

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.540
This is a sharp blade.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.880
Your serrations-- they're
nice and sharp all

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.540
the way through those valleys.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.830
Just a push and a pull on that
rope, and I was through it.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.210
As far as the melon goes,
there was no resistance.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.880
Good job.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.920
Thank you.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.380
DAVID BAKER: Geoff, you ready?

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.250
Let's go.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.000
[music playing]

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.330
Dave's really struggling
to get through the rope.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.250
I know I'm in trouble.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.580
DAVID BAKER: First off, the
cutting edge of your blade

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.040
blew through the melon
like it was nothing.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.580
It's great.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.540
But Geoff, we got
a bit of a problem.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.420
These are not serrations.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.960
These are saw teeth.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.620
On a serration, you've got
a continuous edge, sharp

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.040
all the way through.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.960
But saw teeth have
what's called a gullet.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.080
That's that low spot
there that has no edge.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.290
And these saw teeth
hung up on the rope,

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.210
as opposed to sliding through
the way a serration would.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.580
All right, Levi, you're up.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.290
Are you ready?

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.960
Let's dance.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.120
[music playing]

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.210
Nice.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.460
DAVID BAKER: Levi, nice job.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.710
By putting these serrations
only coming from one side,

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.580
it's giving it that super
razor edge on the other.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.670
One stroke on the rope,
and it was gone and cut

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.290
through the melon like that.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.790
I love the shape of this.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.170
Well done-- cut beautifully.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.750
Thank you.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.080
[music playing]

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.670
WIL WILLIS:
Bladesmiths, the judges

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.460
have made their final decision.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.830
The bladesmith leaving
the forge is Geoff.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.500
Your blade did not make the cut.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.330
GEOFF: I did some things that
were extremely difficult to do,

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.790
and I did them pretty well.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.170
I just didn't do them as
well as my competitors.
