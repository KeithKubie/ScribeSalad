that would get rolled into a world
 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.069

downstream consequences really just

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430
downstream consequences really just
 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.990
downstream consequences really just
don't add up to a whole lot at the scale

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000
don't add up to a whole lot at the scale
 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.600

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:37.629
appreciation of the great achievements
 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:41.040
appreciation of the great achievements
of my ancestors since I have both French

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050
of my ancestors since I have both French
 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.850

and English background nevertheless I
 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.520
and English background nevertheless I
couldn't I can't see any any big lesson

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530
couldn't I can't see any any big lesson

and Japan seems to have a more a greater
consequence in terms of showing the

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810

consequence in terms of showing the
continuation of relations between States

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860

in East Asia
 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.279
in East Asia
now I focused on that recognizing and

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289
now I focused on that recognizing and
 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:18.330
now I focused on that recognizing and
mentioning that this I was doing for a

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340
mentioning that this I was doing for a
 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.999
mentioning that this I was doing for a
chapter that is called northern Eurasia

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009
chapter that is called northern Eurasia
 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.719
chapter that is called northern Eurasia
and I kind of ridiculed the name of the

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729
and I kind of ridiculed the name of the
 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:26.969
and I kind of ridiculed the name of the
chapter saying you know it was just sort

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979
chapter saying you know it was just sort
 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.110
chapter saying you know it was just sort
of a convenience to find something that

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120
of a convenience to find something that
 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.059
of a convenience to find something that
would allow you to cover those empires

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:33.069
would allow you to cover those empires
 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:34.619
would allow you to cover those empires
you hadn't yet covered in the other

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:34.629
you hadn't yet covered in the other
 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:37.860
you hadn't yet covered in the other
chapters and the result was that you

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870
chapters and the result was that you
 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.800
chapters and the result was that you
throw Japan China and Russia into the

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810
throw Japan China and Russia into the
 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.469
throw Japan China and Russia into the
same chapter with Korea sandwiched in

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479
same chapter with Korea sandwiched in
 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:48.329
same chapter with Korea sandwiched in
between a little bit about the southern

00:05:48.329 --> 00:05:48.339
between a little bit about the southern
