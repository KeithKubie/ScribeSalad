You know, yes, Chomsky did look at the structure of language and he did

00:00:03.082 --> 00:00:07.977
believed that there was a universal structure to language. And that humans have

00:00:07.977 --> 00:00:12.230
this inborn natural capacity to acquire language. In fact, he called it a

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.670
language acquisition device that we're born with. So in fact, specific

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.988
languages, all 6,000 of the world's languages. Are just expressions of this

00:00:23.988 --> 00:00:30.532
universal grammar, and so in this sense Chomsky was a nativist. He argued very

00:00:30.532 --> 00:00:36.450
much that we don't so much learn language as we discover it. It's natural,

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.270
universal grammar.
