00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.350
first of all I think the biggest

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360
first of all I think the biggest
 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.970
first of all I think the biggest
misconception about overweight and

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980
misconception about overweight and
 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.859
misconception about overweight and
obesity is that it's the patient's fault

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869
obesity is that it's the patient's fault
 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.679
obesity is that it's the patient's fault
this is truly a disease now you're right

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689
this is truly a disease now you're right
 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.330
this is truly a disease now you're right
like we said before you could eat less

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340
like we said before you could eat less
 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.670
like we said before you could eat less
but that's like telling somebody who has

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680
but that's like telling somebody who has
 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.279
but that's like telling somebody who has
diabetes to control their sugar by just

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289
diabetes to control their sugar by just
 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.810
diabetes to control their sugar by just
not taking in sugar and of course we

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820
not taking in sugar and of course we
 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.160
not taking in sugar and of course we
tell them to do it it's very hard to do

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170
tell them to do it it's very hard to do
 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.170
tell them to do it it's very hard to do
your body is mismanaging these things

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180
your body is mismanaging these things
 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.900
your body is mismanaging these things
and so obesity is a disease it is not

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910
and so obesity is a disease it is not
 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.549
and so obesity is a disease it is not
the individuals fault it takes

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559
the individuals fault it takes
 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.410
the individuals fault it takes
superhuman willpower to keep obesity

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420
superhuman willpower to keep obesity
 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.790
superhuman willpower to keep obesity
under control for the long term and

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800
under control for the long term and
 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.139
under control for the long term and
that's why these surgeries make sense

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149
that's why these surgeries make sense
 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.729
that's why these surgeries make sense
that these are very dangerous operations

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739
that these are very dangerous operations
 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.670
that these are very dangerous operations
I think 20 years ago the mortality rate

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680
I think 20 years ago the mortality rate
 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.020
I think 20 years ago the mortality rate
of these operations were in excess of

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030
of these operations were in excess of
 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.060
of these operations were in excess of
two percent so of every hundred people

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070
two percent so of every hundred people
 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.799
two percent so of every hundred people
that came in the operating room to

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809
that came in the operating room to
 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.470
that came in the operating room to
didn't leave the hospital anyway that's

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480
didn't leave the hospital anyway that's
 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.810
didn't leave the hospital anyway that's
not the case anymore in a center of

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820
not the case anymore in a center of
 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.950
not the case anymore in a center of
excellence in a place that does this

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960
excellence in a place that does this
 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.110
excellence in a place that does this
really well and a lot of it the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120
really well and a lot of it the
 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.609
really well and a lot of it the
mortality rate for a gastric bypass is

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619
mortality rate for a gastric bypass is
 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.410
mortality rate for a gastric bypass is
about three and a thousand and the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420
about three and a thousand and the
 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.149
about three and a thousand and the
mortality rate for a lap band is less

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159
mortality rate for a lap band is less
 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.950
mortality rate for a lap band is less
than one in a thousand so these

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960
than one in a thousand so these
 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.260
than one in a thousand so these
operations are much safer than they used

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270
operations are much safer than they used
 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.870
operations are much safer than they used
to be so much so that the risk

to be so much so that the risk
 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.399
to be so much so that the risk
associated with having the operation is

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409
associated with having the operation is
 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.870
associated with having the operation is
way less than the risk of death from

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880
way less than the risk of death from
 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.480
way less than the risk of death from
that operation over the ensuing years

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490
that operation over the ensuing years
 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.120
that operation over the ensuing years
sorry so much so that the risk of having

sorry so much so that the risk of having
 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.160
sorry so much so that the risk of having
the operation is way less than the risk

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170
the operation is way less than the risk
 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.440
the operation is way less than the risk
of having obesity for the ensuing years

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450
of having obesity for the ensuing years
 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.539

common misconception is that they always

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329
common misconception is that they always
 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.999
common misconception is that they always
fail and people regain their weight back

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009
fail and people regain their weight back
 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.950

some of the older operations didn't work

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960
some of the older operations didn't work
 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.600
some of the older operations didn't work
that well and some percentage of

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610
that well and some percentage of
 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.060
that well and some percentage of
patients do gain way back still but most

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070
patients do gain way back still but most
 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.280
patients do gain way back still but most
don't with gastric bypass I'd say

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290
don't with gastric bypass I'd say
 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.929
don't with gastric bypass I'd say
eighty-five percent of patients maintain

eighty-five percent of patients maintain
 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.609
eighty-five percent of patients maintain
long-term significant weight loss and

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619
long-term significant weight loss and
 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.289
long-term significant weight loss and
with lap band is probably close to the

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299
with lap band is probably close to the
 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:02:01.830
with lap band is probably close to the
same just not as dramatically

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840
 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.690
well that's tough I think that that I

these designations probably has

these designations probably has
 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.050
these designations probably has
long-term follow-up so that's really

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060
long-term follow-up so that's really
 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.910
long-term follow-up so that's really
important and the surgeons probably have

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920
important and the surgeons probably have
 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.500
important and the surgeons probably have
at least a minimum amount of experience

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510
at least a minimum amount of experience
 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.840
at least a minimum amount of experience
doing this so that's important but truly

operations the learning curve goes on
 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.650
operations the learning curve goes on
probably to about 250 operations and

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660
probably to about 250 operations and
 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.210
probably to about 250 operations and
then some you want somebody who's

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220
then some you want somebody who's
 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.190
then some you want somebody who's
offering you all types of operations not

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200
offering you all types of operations not
 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.990
offering you all types of operations not
somebody who's selling just one type or

somebody who's selling just one type or

if somebody does 99% one type of
 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.590
if somebody does 99% one type of
operation because they're probably

operation because they're probably
 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.330
operation because they're probably
trying to fit you into their operation

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340
trying to fit you into their operation
 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.610
trying to fit you into their operation
not find the best operation for you and

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620
not find the best operation for you and
 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.050
not find the best operation for you and
you want some place that has a program

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060
you want some place that has a program
 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.840
you want some place that has a program
for long-term care and management and if

you have all those three components

you have all those three components
 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:13.979
you have all those three components
you're probably in a place that's safe

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989
 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.479
well I think the most important thing to

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489
well I think the most important thing to
 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.520
well I think the most important thing to
know is that right now less than two

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530
know is that right now less than two
 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.900

percent of people who qualify for

percent of people who qualify for
surgery or having it in most places

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190
surgery or having it in most places
 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.970
surgery or having it in most places
that's because patients really aren't

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980
that's because patients really aren't
 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.229
that's because patients really aren't
choosing it I think there's

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239
choosing it I think there's
 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.120
choosing it I think there's
misconceptions about the risk and the

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130
misconceptions about the risk and the
 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.740
misconceptions about the risk and the
benefits of this operation these

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750
benefits of this operation these
 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.140
benefits of this operation these
operations save lives they make people

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150
operations save lives they make people
 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.790
operations save lives they make people
have better quality of life they make

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800
have better quality of life they make
 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.560
have better quality of life they make
people healthier they make people live

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570
people healthier they make people live
 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.449
people healthier they make people live
