00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:08.719
Everyone feels differently about the water.

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.360
One person’s paradise can be another’s
nightmare, especially if they can’t swim.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.670
But regardless of the camp you’re floating
in, we’re willing to bet that some of the

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.240
scenes on this list will stay with you forever.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.150
Here are the 10 Most Unforgettable Water Scenes
of All Time.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.270
Titanic, Sinking Ship
Titanic is one of the most epic love stories

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.210
ever, and made box office history when it
was released in 1997.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.690
James Cameron’s use of special effects was
amazing throughout, but it’s the sequence

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.360
where the ship begins to sink that stands
out the most.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.890
After a fatal collision, people on the ship
are seen either scrambling for safety, or

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.010
preparing to meet their maker.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.769
Occasionally the movie cuts to a perspective
from one of the lifeboats, and the magnitude

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:44.640
of the situation becomes even more extreme.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.389
The tragic scene is an all-encompassing experience,
especially if you have surround sound.

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:54.260
Jaws, “Chrissie's Last Swim”
Drinking, darkness, and the ocean are three

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.840
things that do not go together.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.319
And if you’ve ever seen Jaws, you’ve probably
thought twice about a late night swim.

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:02.780
If you haven’t, take the opportunity to
learn from Chrissie’s mistakes, because

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.220
you never know when a human-eating shark is
going pop in for some noms.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.220
And when you’re the only target because
your stupid drunk boyfriend fell asleep on

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.280
the beach, you’ll wish you had listened
to us.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.700
For a movie set almost entirely on the water,
there were lots of scenes to choose from,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.510
but this one scarred us for life.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.610
Casino Royale, Beach Bond
The Bond movies aren’t known for their subtlety.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.940
Fast cars, fist fights, and explosions make
up more than half the appeal.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.540
A new actor plays 007 every so often, and
the change-ups always make entertainment headlines.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.690
The one thing that is for sure, is that there
will be a sexy new Bond girl in every installment.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.550
But in Daniel Craig’s inaugural appearance
as the super-spy, he wasn’t content to let

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.730
the ladies have all the attention.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.210
Usually there’s a gratuitous shot of a bikini-clad
vixen, Casino Royale evened the score a little

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.210
bit.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.350
Not only did it mark the return of short swim
trunks for dudes, it reinforced that the actor

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.280
was… physically capable… of playing the
part.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.900
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, The Second
Task

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.900
Magic is awesome.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.330
It’s intricate and varied, and every writer
uses it differently.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.770
In the world of Harry Potter, every wizard
does too.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.100
During the Triwizard tournament, fans watch
as a handful of special students compete for

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.100
the title.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.970
The participants are given tasks with only
their wits to guide them.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.450
The second task has the wizards on a mission
to save a loved one hidden somewhere in the

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.450
Black Lake.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.390
Being a magical universe, there are some cool
creatures lurking in the depths.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.010
And watching as the champions bend magic to
their will is also pretty awesome.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.769
The Abyss, Brigman Drowns
Ahh James Cameron - we meet again.

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.019
Except this time, its something that’s already
underwater that sinks.

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.780
And there may or may not be aliens involved.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.629
The diving team in The Abyss seemingly hit
every single underwater snag possible, and

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.730
it’s a pretty intense movie as a result.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.630
After a submarine sinks, American Navy SEALs
team up with the crew of an underwater oil

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.140
rig to investigate what happened.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.810
At one point two of the crew become stranded
with only enough oxygen for one of them, and

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.200
the other drowns while being towed en route
to safety.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.909
And the high-tension CPR scene that follows
is equally emotional.

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.609
Singing in the Rain
Weather has a bad reputation in Hollywood,

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.139
and is the foundation for a lot of tragic
stories.

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:58.019
Directors love using rain to convey sadness,
or to give the scene a gloomy little punch.

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.870
So it’s easy to get caught up in the illusion
that rain is the enemy.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.920
But the truth is, some people are just better
at finding the sunshine.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.540
The Gene Kelly classic Singing In The Rain
serves as a reminder that happiness affords

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.799
a certain level of invincibility.

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.420
And suddenly you’re impervious to the annoyances
involved in everyday life.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.670
So the next time you curse the weather gods
for raining on your parade, turn the tables

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.439
by dancing in it.

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.930
Cast Away, Losing Wilson
When Cast Away was released, people were wondering

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.450
if one person could actually carry an entire
movie.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.849
In Hollywood when you want something done
right, you hire Tom Hanks.

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.840
The veteran actor captivated audiences to
the point of hypnosis.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.980
It hurts to watch his character struggle,
and viewers are drawn in by his strategic

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.049
survival methods.

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.840
When he feels triumphant, we do too.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.099
So when he loses his only friend on the way,
it hits the audience just as hard.

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.739
Once you step back and realize that millions
of people have cried over a volleyball, the

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.190
talent on display is hard to ignore.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.069
Inception, Falling Van
There are a million unforgettable moments

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.510
in Christopher Nolan’s Inception.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.739
But the way the movie plays with its timeline
can be hard to follow for some.

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.790
Even though one of the characters gives an
explanation, sometimes it’s just easier

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.930
to show people what you mean.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.660
The first dream level is set in a rainy city
where the team spends the majority of their

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.950
time strapped down in the back of a van as
Yusuf hauls ass to a bridge.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.040
For everyone to wake up, the van has to fall
off the side and hit the water.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.629
When it finally goes overboard, Nolan draws
it out.

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.459
Cutting back to it between scenes to remind
us that the clock is ticking.

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.340
Plus, the suspended gravity created in level
1 is the reason we get that awesome fight

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.790
sequence in level 2.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.940
The Little Mermaid, Under the Sea
The Disney archives are a treasure trove of

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.060
musical moments.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.880
Some are catchier than others, but the soundtrack
for The Little Mermaid is nothing but gold.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.840
And since all the best arguments are delivered
through song, Sebastian sings to Ariel about

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.690
how awesome it is to live underwater.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.210
Under the Sea is a clever tune designed to
show the mermaid all the amazing things she’d

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.120
be leaving behind if she lived on land.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.400
And after listening to it on repeat for an
hour, we kind of agree.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.250
That many happy fish can’t be wrong.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.100
Fast Times at Ridgemont High, The Pool
All instances of hot girls getting out of

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.060
pools in slow motion lead back to one place:
Fast Times at Ridgemont High.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.570
Phoebe Cates and the infamous red bikini have
been turning a lot of heads since the movies

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:58.880
release in 1982.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.730
The scene featured heavily in the trailer,
and is still instantly recognizable today.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.880
Cates’ character appears topless in a fantasy,
then accidentally walks in on the person fantasizing.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:17.990
The scene is an odd mix of sexy and traumatic,
so we’re not sure how to feel.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:27.880
But we won’t forget it anytime soon.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.070
What do you think of our list?

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.100
