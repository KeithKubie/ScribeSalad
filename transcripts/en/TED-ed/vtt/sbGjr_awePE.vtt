00:00:06.951 --> 00:00:08.713
Like many heroes of Greek myths,

00:00:08.713 --> 00:00:13.930
the philosopher Hippasus was rumored to
have been mortally punished by the gods.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.606
But what was his crime?

00:00:15.606 --> 00:00:16.957
Did he murder guests,

00:00:16.957 --> 00:00:19.474
or disrupt a sacred ritual?

00:00:19.474 --> 00:00:23.524
No, Hippasus's transgression was
a mathematical proof:

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:26.583
the discovery of irrational numbers.

00:00:26.583 --> 00:00:30.311
Hippasus belonged to a group
called the Pythagorean mathematicians

00:00:30.311 --> 00:00:32.922
who had a religious reverence for numbers.

00:00:32.922 --> 00:00:35.463
Their dictum of, "All is number,"

00:00:35.463 --> 00:00:39.013
suggested that numbers 
were the building blocks of the Universe

00:00:39.013 --> 00:00:43.317
and part of this belief was that 
everything from cosmology and metaphysics

00:00:43.317 --> 00:00:46.477
to music and morals followed eternal rules

00:00:46.477 --> 00:00:50.175
describable as ratios of numbers.

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:53.488
Thus, any number could be written
as such a ratio.

00:00:53.488 --> 00:00:55.995
5 as 5/1,

00:00:55.995 --> 00:00:59.085
0.5 as 1/2

00:00:59.085 --> 00:01:00.505
and so on.

00:01:00.505 --> 00:01:07.907
Even an infinitely extending decimal like
this could be expressed exactly as 34/45.

00:01:07.907 --> 00:01:11.421
All of these are what we now call
rational numbers.

00:01:11.421 --> 00:01:16.051
But Hippasus found one number
that violated this harmonious rule,

00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:18.825
one that was not supposed to exist.

00:01:18.825 --> 00:01:21.395
The problem began with a simple shape,

00:01:21.395 --> 00:01:25.105
a square with each side 
measuring one unit.

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:26.898
According to Pythagoras Theorem,

00:01:26.898 --> 00:01:30.183
the diagonal length 
would be square root of two,

00:01:30.183 --> 00:01:35.528
but try as he might, Hippasus could not
express this as a ratio of two integers.

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:39.839
And instead of giving up, he decided
to prove it couldn't be done.

00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:44.196
Hippasus began by assuming that the
Pythagorean worldview was true,

00:01:44.196 --> 00:01:49.145
that root 2 could be expressed
as a ratio of two integers.

00:01:49.145 --> 00:01:52.981
He labeled these hypothetical integers
p and q.

00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:56.358
Assuming the ratio was reduced
to its simplest form,

00:01:56.358 --> 00:01:59.957
p and q could not have any common factors.

00:01:59.957 --> 00:02:02.987
To prove that root 2 was not rational,

00:02:02.987 --> 00:02:08.074
Hippasus just had to prove that
p/q cannot exist.

00:02:08.074 --> 00:02:11.422
So he multiplied both sides 
of the equation by q

00:02:11.422 --> 00:02:13.291
and squared both sides.

00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:15.320
which gave him this equation.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.274
Multiplying any number by 2
results in an even number,

00:02:19.274 --> 00:02:22.332
so p^2 had to be even.

00:02:22.332 --> 00:02:24.715
That couldn't be true if p was odd

00:02:24.715 --> 00:02:28.154
because an odd number times itself
is always odd,

00:02:28.154 --> 00:02:30.702
so p was even as well.

00:02:30.702 --> 00:02:36.176
Thus, p could be expressed as 2a,
where a is an integer.

00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:39.074
Substituting this into the equation
and simplifying

00:02:39.074 --> 00:02:43.248
gave q^2 = 2a^2

00:02:43.248 --> 00:02:47.180
Once again, two times any number
produces an even number,

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.921
so q^2 must have been even,

00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:52.012
and q must have been even as well,

00:02:52.012 --> 00:02:54.393
making both p and q even.

00:02:54.393 --> 00:02:57.710
But if that was true, then they had
a common factor of two,

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.576
which contradicted the initial statement,

00:03:00.576 --> 00:03:04.796
and that's how Hippasus concluded
that no such ratio exists.

00:03:04.796 --> 00:03:06.756
That's called a proof by contradiction,

00:03:06.756 --> 00:03:08.234
and according to the legend,

00:03:08.234 --> 00:03:11.453
the gods did not appreciate 
being contradicted.

00:03:11.453 --> 00:03:14.928
Interestingly, even though we can't
express irrational numbers

00:03:14.928 --> 00:03:16.802
as ratios of integers,

00:03:16.802 --> 00:03:20.891
it is possible to precisely plot
some of them on the number line.

00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:22.149
Take root 2.

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:27.844
All we need to do is form a right triangle
with two sides each measuring one unit.

00:03:27.844 --> 00:03:32.596
The hypotenuse has a length of root 2,
which can be extended along the line.

00:03:32.596 --> 00:03:35.144
We can then form another
right triangle

00:03:35.144 --> 00:03:38.491
with a base of that length
and a one unit height,

00:03:38.491 --> 00:03:41.135
and its hypotenuse would equal
root three,

00:03:41.135 --> 00:03:43.932
which can be extended 
along the line, as well.

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:48.953
The key here is that decimals and ratios
are only ways to express numbers.

00:03:48.953 --> 00:03:52.948
Root 2 simply is the hypotenuse
of a right triangle

00:03:52.948 --> 00:03:54.875
with sides of a length one.

00:03:54.875 --> 00:03:58.259
Similarly, the famous irrational number pi

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:01.128
is always equal 
to exactly what it represents,

00:04:01.128 --> 00:04:04.570
the ratio of a circle's circumference
to its diameter.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.565
Approximations like 22/7,

00:04:07.565 --> 00:04:13.707
or 355/113 will never precisely equal pi.

00:04:13.707 --> 00:04:16.218
We'll never know what really happened
to Hippasus,

00:04:16.218 --> 00:04:20.665
but what we do know is that his discovery
revolutionized mathematics.

00:04:20.665 --> 00:04:24.936
So whatever the myths may say,
don't be afraid to explore the impossible.
