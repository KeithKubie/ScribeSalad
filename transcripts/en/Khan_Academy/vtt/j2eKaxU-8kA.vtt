00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.440
We finished off the
last video entering

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.770
into the Great Depression.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.430
It wasn't just a
depression for the US.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.650
It was a depression
for the world.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.108
But I want to back
up a little bit,

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:11.150
because I forgot to mention
a very important fact that's

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.680
hugely important to
the rest of US history

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.980
into the 20th century.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.750
And that's what happened in
1917, actually during World War

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.790
I. And that's the
Bolshevik Revolution.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.350
The Russian empire was
overthrown by the Bolsheviks.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.970
And it became the Soviet
Union, which you probably know

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.870
was a communist state, and
it became the United States

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.950
archenemy over the
rest of-- well,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.960
not over the rest of--
but near the, I guess,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.182
the second half of
the 20th century.

00:00:41.182 --> 00:00:42.640
So with that out
of the way, I just

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.000
want to make sure you know that
Russia is now the Soviet Union.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.689
Let's fast forward back
through the Great Depression,

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:50.230
and probably the
one point when we're

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.150
doing this very high-level
overview that's of interest.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.020
And as you can see, even
though the focus of this series

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.864
of videos is on US
interest, what's

00:00:57.864 --> 00:00:59.280
happening in the
rest of the world

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.780
is starting to become much more
important, because the US is

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.450
starting to become this
really serious global actor.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.150
And so in 1933-- so this
is right in the middle

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.840
of this global depression,
and Germany was especially

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.890
hit hard because of all the
damage done by World War

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.510
I and the war reparations
and all the rest.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.890
You have Hitler coming to
power as chancellor of Germany.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.175
And it's interesting to
note that it was actually--

00:01:24.175 --> 00:01:26.760
he came to power in
a democratic process.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.500
Chancellor of Germany is
analogous to prime minister

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.540
of other countries,
and so essentially he

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.830
was ruling a coalition.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.690
The Nazis, his party, did
not have the majority.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.000
But they were able to
control this coalition.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.371
Although it was a very weak one.

00:01:41.371 --> 00:01:43.620
But what they were good at
is intimidating and rigging

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.250
elections and all the rest.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.340
And so over the course
of the rest of the '30s,

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.540
essentially the Nazis
consolidated power

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.110
until we get to 1939.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.140
And the rest of the world
would kind of watch Hitler.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.030
He was consolidating power.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.920
He came in democratically,
but he was essentially

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.700
consolidating power
under himself,

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.060
turning it into a dictatorship.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.780
He was militarizing Germany.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.417
People started to get
concerned, but they all

00:02:09.417 --> 00:02:10.750
had the doctrine of appeasement.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.940
Hey, you know, let's just
not make him too angry

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.520
and maybe he won't
start anything too bad.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.335
But in 1939, Germany
invades Poland.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.700
And this is kind of
viewed as the one event

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.270
that kind of-- the straw
that breaks the camel's

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.450
back, so to speak.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.160
And so it begins World War II.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.870
So this is the beginning
of World War II.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.590
And initially it's
between-- I guess

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.870
if you think about the great
powers that initially get

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.270
involved, it is the British
Empire and the Soviet Union.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.310
France is involved.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.100
It quickly gets
overrun by the Nazis.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.130
And what happens
is that the US-- it

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.930
wasn't like the situation
with World War I

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.990
where the US was
trying to stay neutral.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.820
The US had recognized,
especially FDR, Franklin Delano

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.690
Roosevelt, he had recognized
that Hitler was an aggressor,

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.141
that he was, from FDR's point
of view, definitely in the wrong

00:03:06.141 --> 00:03:06.640
here.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.980
So even from the
beginning of World War II,

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.210
the US did help
support the Allies.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.810
So it would send arms and
any other type of assistance.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.780
When Japan and Italy joined
on the side of Germany,

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.410
the US embargoed oil to Japan.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.552
The US was an exporter
of oil to Japan.

00:03:28.552 --> 00:03:30.010
And you could
imagine Japan did not

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.030
produce a lot of its own oil,
and oil is super important

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.090
when you're trying
to run a war machine.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.940
So that didn't make
Japan too happy.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.560
So you fast forward to 1941,
and you have Japan bombing Pearl

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.070
Harbor.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.910
So until this point, US kind
of played a non-direct role.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.850
It definitely
supported the Allies.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.370
It did what it
could economically

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.270
and by providing military
aid, but it did not actively

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.660
participate in the fighting.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.940
But then December 7,
1941, the Japanese

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.060
bombed the US Pacific
fleet at Pearl Harbor.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.100
And that's a whole
interesting debate

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.480
because, or discussion,
it was lucky for the US

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.570
that a lot of the Pacific
fleet was not there.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.720
But it was obviously this thing
that convinced the US public

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.920
that World War II
was worth joining.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.640
So in 1941, because of Pearl
Harbor, the US enters the war.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.240
And it enters the
war in both arenas,

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.630
both in Europe and
in the Pacific.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.130
And then you fast forward.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.760
It goes against the
Italians in North Africa.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.000
And then you fast forward
to 1944, it actually

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.090
enters into the fight
in mainland Europe.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.500
This is the invasion
of Normandy.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.530
This is D-Day.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.577
June 6, 1944.

00:04:47.577 --> 00:04:49.410
If you have ever seen
"Saving Private Ryan,"

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.690
it starts with this.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.730
I've never stormed
a beach, but I

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.390
could imagine that's probably
the most realistic reenactment

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.420
of what it was like to
storm the beach at Normandy.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.240
But you fast forward to 1945.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.880
And eventually, especially
between the Soviet and the US,

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.840
or I should say all
the Allied forces,

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.000
they're able to, I guess, win
the European front of World War

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.030
II.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.170
And then you fast forward
to the end of that year.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.570
Japan was still kind of
fighting pretty ferociously.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.125
And so the US-- and
this is once again--

00:05:24.125 --> 00:05:25.500
I could make many
videos of this.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.710
We can debate the ethical
implications of this.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.960
But the US develops
the atomic bomb,

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.960
ignites one over Hiroshima
and then a few days later one

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.380
over Nagasaki.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.710
And that essentially
ends World War II.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.640
And so the outcome
of World War II

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.540
is you have two
remaining superpowers.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:49.790
You have the Soviet Union, and
you have the United States.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.540
And what happens after that
is that you have the Cold War.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.560
These two huge powers,
the Soviet Union

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.200
is this communist country.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.170
It's obviously trying to
create this communist sphere

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.720
of influence.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.730
A lot of Eastern Europe was
falling under Soviet sway.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.240
The United States, not
a communist country,

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.732
a very capitalist
country, you can imagine.

00:06:08.732 --> 00:06:10.690
And this is something
that gets confused a lot.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.770
The Soviet Union was communist,
and it was totalitarian.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.975
Communism and Democracy
aren't necessarily things

00:06:16.975 --> 00:06:18.100
that go against each other.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.250
But the Soviet Union had
neither a capitalist system,

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.550
nor democracy.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.649
It was both communist
and totalitarian.

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:27.190
And when I say
communist, I'm talking

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.740
about no private wealth.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.360
The state really
owned all resources.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.120
The United States, on the other
hand, was hugely capitalist.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.370
And you could imagine many
people in the United States

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.540
did not want any of
this communism business

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.280
to come to us.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.500
So you have this major battle
that never really erupts

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.320
into direct conflict between
the Soviet Union and the United

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.820
States.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.270
It's always done
through proxies,

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.750
through people who the United
States or the Soviet Union

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.229
is acting on the behalf--
or who are acting on behalf

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:57.770
of the United States
or Soviet Union.

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.665
But you have the
Cold War beginning.

00:06:59.665 --> 00:07:02.040
And it's called the Cold War
because it wasn't a hot war.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.850
The United States
and the Soviet Union

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.370
never really fired
bullets at each other.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.837
Instead, they
supported other parties

00:07:08.837 --> 00:07:10.670
that would fire bullets
at the Soviet Union.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.628
Or the Soviet Union would
support other parties

00:07:12.628 --> 00:07:15.040
that would fire bullets
at the United States.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.090
And for the United
States, it was all

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.630
about stopping communism.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.850
It was all about preventing
this domino theory

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.275
that if one country in a
region would fall to communism,

00:07:24.275 --> 00:07:25.400
that other countries would.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.220
So the United States
became a bit paranoid,

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.420
or maybe it was justified.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.370
Either way, it
was very concerned

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.364
about the spread of communism.

00:07:33.364 --> 00:07:35.780
And the first time that this
really gets tested-- and 1950

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.000
is an interesting year, because
this is the first time--

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.320
obviously, the US had
nuclear weapons as of 1945.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.360
But in 1950, the
Soviet Union tested

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.850
its first nuclear weapon.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.580
So now the Cold War is
starting to get very serious.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.470
Both of these
adversaries can now

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.560
nuke each other
if they wanted to.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.060
And also in 1950,
you have Korea.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.700
And Korea, before World
War II-- so that's

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.160
a very small
depiction of Korea--

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.680
it was a Japanese colony.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.980
But obviously,
Japan had now lost.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.660
And so after World
War II, it was

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:10.290
split between an area,
North Korea, which

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.590
was influenced by the Russians,
and South Korea, which

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.420
was influenced by
the United States.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.430
And it was split along
the 38th parallel,

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.356
and I know this is a
super small diagram.

00:08:18.356 --> 00:08:19.730
We'll go into more
detail when we

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:23.120
do detailed videos
about the Korean War.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:28.120
But in 1950, you have the North
Koreans invaded the South.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.350
So it started the Korean War.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:30.490
The US sent troops.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.740
The North Koreans had China on
their side, the Chinese army.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.690
The Soviets were
also supplying them.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.720
But at the end of
the day in 1953,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.570
you fast forward,
it ends up being

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.750
a little bit of a stalemate,
because the end result was is

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.310
that the original 38th
parallel border gets,

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:49.620
I guess, reinstated.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.920
But that was the first real
conflict of the Cold War.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.610
And notice there were
never US or Russian--

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:58.430
or I shouldn't say Russian--
US or Soviet troops

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.780
directly firing at each other.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.730
The US were at
war with the North

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.520
Korean and the Chinese
troops, but they

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.460
were kind of proxies
for the Soviet Union.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.010
And at the same time,
as you can imagine,

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.370
because you have these
two adversaries, these two

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:15.730
technically sophisticated
adversaries--

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:18.670
they both had
nuclear weapons-- it

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:22.240
became very interesting on who
can kind of dominate space.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.040
So you have this kind of
space race developing in 1957.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:31.052
The Soviets are able to launch
the first artificial satellite

00:09:31.052 --> 00:09:31.760
around the earth.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.900
This is Sputnik One over here.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.490
Some people think
the first Sputnik

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:38.110
is the one that
had the dog in it.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:39.640
No, that came a
few months later.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.360
That was Sputnik Two, actually.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.240
Had the picture of the dog here,
but the dog eventually dies.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.764
But it was alive for
a little bit in orbit.

00:09:46.764 --> 00:09:48.180
So that gets
everyone freaked out.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.250
The US responds.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:52.100
Then in 1961 you
have Yuri Gagarin.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.760
He's the first person in space,
first human being in space.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.490
He returns safely.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:59.990
We eventually get up there--
or the United States eventually

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:01.330
gets up there as well.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.590
And you fast forward all
the way to 1969, the US

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:05.090
is the first to be on the moon.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:06.490
So you have this space race.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:10.300
The two countries are really
trying to one up each other.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.520
And at the same time
that that's happening,

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.790
you have-- and I bring this
up just because so much

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.620
happened during his presidency.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:21.210
In 1960, you have
John F. Kennedy

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:24.640
being elected kind of in
the heart of the Cold War.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.200
And the other
interesting thing is

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.420
he was the first
Catholic president,

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.199
which people questioned.

00:10:31.199 --> 00:10:32.490
That by itself was interesting.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:35.130
But what was really interesting
in his short presidency-- and I

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.030
think you might know
that only had really--

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.720
he actually became
president in '61.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.470
This is an error.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:43.590
He was elected in '60, but
he became president in '61.

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:45.560
He had a very short presidency.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.560
He was assassinated
in '63, but a lot

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.410
happened in that
short presidency.

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:55.950
In 1957, right before he became
president, you had-- oh, sorry.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:56.787
Not 1957.

00:10:56.787 --> 00:10:57.870
Let me get my years right.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:01.510
1959 you had the
Cuban Revolution.

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:03.710
Cuba became communist.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.920
Fidel Castro takes over.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.740
It becomes communist.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.980
So you could imagine,
the Americans

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:13.950
didn't like a communist state
so close to our own borders.

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:21.240
So in 1961 we support
some ex-Cubans,

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.880
or some Cuban exiles,
to try to invade Cuba.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.800
And that also can be a whole
topic for another video.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.590
There's debates between the CIA
and the Kennedy administration

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.940
for who was to blame for
it being such a failure,

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.195
but it was a failure.

00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:39.030
So it was a huge embarrassment
to the United States.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.770
And from the
revolutionaries' point

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.300
of view, the communist
revolutionaries' point of view,

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.770
they kind of viewed this as
solidifying their hold of Cuba.

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:50.500
It showed that
they could fend off

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:55.370
a counter-revolutionary assault.

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:58.270
And then you have in 1962.

00:11:58.270 --> 00:11:59.640
We have these spy planes.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.930
And we see that the
Soviets are starting

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.099
to put these ballistic missiles
in Cuba, which really freaks

00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:07.640
the United States out, because
these ballistic missiles could

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.500
reach any part of
the United States.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.640
We actually had similar ones
in parts of Europe and Turkey,

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.540
but we don't like
these things here.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:18.160
So we essentially used
our Navy to, I would say,

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.810
blockade any more arms
shipments to the Soviet Union.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:25.860
So Kennedy really has this kind
of stand-off with the Soviet

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.470
Union during the Cuban
Missile Crisis in 1962.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:30.910
And most people
believe that this

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:34.270
was the closest that the United
States and the Soviet Union

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:37.100
ever got to actually
having a war,

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.640
and which would have probably
turned into a nuclear war.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.050
But the stand-off
eventually got resolved.

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:47.650
The Soviet Union agreed
to remove their missiles.

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:50.300
Well, one, not send anymore
missiles and dismantle the ones

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.367
that they had already set up.

00:12:52.367 --> 00:12:54.200
And this wasn't publicly
stated at the time,

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.630
but the United
States also agreed

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:57.860
to do the same thing
for our missiles

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.460
that were pointed
at the Soviet Union,

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.660
to remove those from Turkey.

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:05.140
So the world, at least
at that point in time,

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:09.217
had avoided a mutually
assured destruction.

00:13:09.217 --> 00:13:10.800
The whole time that
this is happening,

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.960
remember, the United
States is paranoid.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.500
And maybe justifiably so.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.940
Paranoia usually means worried
when there's not a cause.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.000
But maybe justifiably worried
about the spread of communism.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.720
You have a situation
where, in Vietnam, you

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.460
have a Vietnam, which
is right about-- let

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.230
me make sure I circle the
right country-- you have

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:35.840
in Vietnam the communists come
to power in North Vietnam.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.610
This was formally
a French colony.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.080
The US, right from
the get-go in 1950,

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:45.850
start sending advisers to
aid the anti-communists

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.490
in South Vietnam.

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:50.800
In Kennedy's administration,
the amount of advisors-- and I

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.890
should probably
put that in quotes,

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:56.930
because these advisers started
becoming much more involved--

00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:58.140
really grew.

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.430
And until 1965,
the United States

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:04.630
started sending it acts
actual official combat

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.480
troops to fight in Vietnam.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.735
And you fast forward
that all the way to 1975.

00:14:09.735 --> 00:14:11.360
And the reason why
this is significant,

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.370
other than this being one of
the more recent major wars

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.350
the United States
has been in, it's

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.061
the first war that the United
States kind of unambiguously

00:14:19.061 --> 00:14:19.560
lost.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:25.600
In 1975, the last presence
of the United States left.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.140
And essentially
Saigon, which was

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:30.770
the capital of South Vietnam,
fell to the communists.

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:33.430
So I'll leave you there,
and we're now essentially

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.120
in modern history.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.370
At least from my point
of view, because I

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.470
was born not too
long after that.

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:41.830
Anyway, hopefully you
found that interesting.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.740
Let me, oh, I couldn't
find the stop button.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:46.500
There you go.
