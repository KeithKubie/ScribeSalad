00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.830
Radiation therapy is one of
the most well used applications

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.540
of optimization in health care.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.170
In practice,
radiation machines are

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.120
connected to treatment
planning software that

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.510
implements and solves
optimization models.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.790
Both linear optimization
models, like we

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.110
saw here, and other types
of optimization models.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.390
Some examples of
radiation machines

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.320
that use optimization
software are

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.100
Pinnacle by Philips, RayStation
by RaySearch Labs and Eclipse

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.600
by Varian.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.260
There are many extensions
to the optimization model

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.030
we described here.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.700
One is the selection
of beam angles.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.010
The beam angles can be selected
jointly with the intensity

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.010
profiles by using an
integer optimization.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.000
This allows the treatment
to be further personalized

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.090
to the specific tumor and
person receiving the radiation.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.680
Integer optimization is another
type of optimization model

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.060
and will be the
topic of next week.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.930
Another extension is
accounting for uncertainty.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.600
Often the quality
of IMRT treatments

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.460
is degraded due to
uncertain organ motion.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.920
For example, in lung
cancer, the target area

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.740
is around the lungs.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.420
But since the
patient is breathing

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.430
throughout the treatment,
the target area is moving

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.830
and the location is
slightly uncertain.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.140
We can manage this
uncertainty using

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.800
a method known as
robust optimization.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.800
There is a significant amount
of literature on this method

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.979
and its application
to radiation therapy.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.979
Linear optimization
significantly

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.620
improves the efficiency
of radiation therapy.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.560
Manually designing
an IMRT treatment

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.480
would be inefficient
and impractical.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.640
By using linear
optimization, IMRT

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.830
can be designed in an
efficient and systematic way.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.680
As we saw in this
lecture, clinical criteria

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.520
can be modeled using constraints
and the treatment planner

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.680
can explore trade-offs
by changing the model.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.360
But ultimately, IMRT and
the use of optimization

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.320
benefits the patient.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.310
In head and neck
cancers saliva glands

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.490
were rarely spared
prior to IMRT,

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.820
but by using optimized
IMRT treatments,

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.079
saliva glands can now be spared.

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.170
In prostate cancer,
IMRT treatments

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.750
reduced toxicities and
allow for higher tumor doses

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.150
to be delivered safely.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.570
And in lung cancer
optimized IMRT

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.030
reduced the risk of radiation
induced pneumonitis.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.600
These are just three examples
of the benefits of IMRT.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.370
Overall, optimized
IMRT allows clinicians

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.950
to deliver treatment that
was previously impossible

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.790
and to improve the quality
of life for patients.
