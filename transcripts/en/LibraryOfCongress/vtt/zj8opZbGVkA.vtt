00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.820
&gt;&gt; I want to introduce our
presenter, Lee Ann Potter,

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.890 position:56%
who's Director of Education
Outreach of the Library of Congress.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.260 position:64%
Lee Ann Potter leads a dynamic team
committed developing educational programs

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.910 position:61%
and materials based on primary sources.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.770 position:70%
Before coming to the library, she created
and directed education and volunteer programs

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.760
at the National Archives in
Washington D.C. for 16 years.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.390 position:75%
Prior to that, she worked at the Smithsonian on
a project to build museums, school partnerships,

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.120
and before that, was a high
school social studies teacher.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.960
She has conducted hundreds
of presentations as author

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.570
of numerous articles promoting
teaching the primary sources.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.510 position:56%
So Lee Ann welcome and take it away.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.120
&gt;&gt; So I'm ready to get started.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.830
Sessions where we're talking about
what's new are always a lot of fun.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.450 position:69%
And this first slide is a new slide compared

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.160
to a similar session that
I did this time last year.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.440 position:72%
This is where you get to see what I look like.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.830 position:59%
And the reason I've included it is
actually sort of a shout out to my mom

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.030 position:59%
and dad who participated in last
year's session and gave me a hard time

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.620 position:73%
about how difficult it was too participate in a
session and not know who was actually talking.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.710
They wanted to know what
the presenter looked like.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.340 position:66%
So, there's the shout out for mom and dad.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.880
And now we'll get started.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.920
I suspect that many of you had
an interest in this session

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.710 position:58%
because you like things that are new.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.210
And I do as well.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.710
We all seem to like things that
are new and there is a lot to talk

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.050
about that is new at the library.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.220 position:73%
This is true in terms of online collections, as
well as teaching resources, programs and more.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.180
So let's start with this butterfly.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.330 position:73%
What is it about a butterfly that suggests new?

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.940 position:72%
Yes, just emerged from a chrysalis, excellent.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.030
Rebirth and growth, metamorphosis,
new beginning, perfect.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.080
I love all these answers.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.240
That's what I think of as well.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.860
I think of springtime when I see
butterflies and I thought, well,

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.740
I stumbled on this butterfly
in the library's collection.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.090
It's a new object that's
available online from the library.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.270
And when I saw it, I absolutely
was thinking about what was new.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.180
But then I saw another image
that had a connection to it.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.730
So, I'm going to show it to
you all and see what you think.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.530
So what if I paired this butterfly
with this other photograph?

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.150 position:72%
And when I do that, does the new thing we were
just looking at suddenly become an old thing?

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.430 position:72%
Or perhaps just different or maybe unexpected?

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.320
In both cases, we're looking
at images of this butterfly.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:45.580 position:73%
The -- Of course the image on the left was sort
of distorted in terms its size and what not.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.680
We think it's bigger than it is,
because the actual butterfly,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.830
it is a little cardboard
butterfly that is in the picture

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.440 position:72%
on the right sitting on Walt Whitman's finger.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:06.200 position:75%
That photograph and the card, and that butterfly
card by the way, is actually part an Easter card

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.710
that Walt Whitman received in 1877
and took his photograph with it

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.330
in the picture that's on the right.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.880
I love that Cynthia, exactly.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.330 position:75%
The new butterfly becomes part of the old image.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.740 position:73%
So both -- But in this case, both the butterfly

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.200
and this photograph are new
to the library's website.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.250
And I'll tell you a little bit more
about them in just a little bit.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.940
But a presentation on What Is New?

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.970
at the Library of Congress really
would be completely in accurate.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.030 position:59%
I didn't start by telling you about a
new person at the Library of Congress.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.680
Many of you are already aware that
on September the 14th the Library

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.710 position:58%
of Congress welcomed Dr. Carla Hayden
as the 14th librarian into Congress.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.010
She was sworn in, in a ceremony
in the Jefferson building.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.450 position:59%
And we are very excited by her energy
and looking forward to her leadership.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.740
So welcome Dr. Hayden to
the Library of Congress.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.330
In the past year, well actually, as
I was preparing for this session,

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.610 position:63%
I sent a note to a colleague of mine
that works in our Web Services Division.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:22.410 position:61%
I said, "Hey, I know there's been a ton
digitized this year, and I'd love to --

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.170 position:63%
if you could send me a list, so I can
really capture everything, I'd love it."

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.800
And he did.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.290 position:72%
He shared a list with me and I was blown away.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.680 position:56%
It was a really lengthy spreadsheet.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.630 position:75%
It was more than ten pages long, and needless to
say, I don't have time to talk about everything,

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.080 position:67%
but I will be sharing just some highlights.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.140 position:64%
And the items I'm going to share with
you come from the papers of Walt Whitman,

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.380 position:59%
as well as some new historic newspaper
collections and World War One artwork,

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:55.180 position:70%
some public radio and television
recordings, as well as some slave narratives.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:02.270 position:69%
All of these are new to the library site
and I hope that as I share these highlights,

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:08.550 position:67%
I am able to reinforce for you our teaching
with primary sources program philosophy,

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:15.300 position:70%
and that is that primary sources are powerful
teaching tools that can inspire and fascinate

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:22.200
and engage learners of all
ages and in every subject.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.270 position:64%
By the end of our session, I'd love it if
you'd be able to describe our philosophy,

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.810 position:75%
participate in some primary source analysis
activities that hopefully will amaze and inspire

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.190
and perhaps surprise you,
identify new collections available

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.340
through the library's website and
finally brainstorm some strategies

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:48.340 position:58%
for sharing these resources with both
your colleagues and your students.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.240
So let's really get started.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.710 position:67%
I'd like to ask you to focus your attention
for a minute on this newly available item.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:02.320 position:67%
And for those of you who are familiar with
the library's primary source analysis tool,

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:09.660 position:61%
asking you to observe and reflect and
question should not come as a surprise.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.980
So, I'm curious what do you see?

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:17.000 position:58%
And what does it make you think and
perhaps what does it make you wonder?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.160
What kind of a document is this?

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.000
Who wrote it?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.770
What are all these scribbles about?

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.940 position:56%
Is there anything familiar about it?

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:34.680 position:66%
I see handwritten notes, a draft, edits,
looks like someone is editing it, perfect.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.130 position:58%
Do you know this particular document?

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.870 position:56%
You can kind of look up close at it.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.180
Perfect, yeah, Debra.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.300 position:66%
Poem by Walt Whitman about Lincoln, that's
exactly right, A Captain My Captain.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.300
Good, Julia, a work in progress.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.970
All of these are excellent.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:54.710
Looks like the original editing
possibly by Whitman, yeah?

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.190
And the first time I saw this
item, I did exactly the same thing.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.780
I was so excited wondering
whose writing is that?

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.020
You know, whose handwriting is it?

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.900 position:58%
And is it Walt Whitman's handwriting?

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.960
And what's going on here?

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.070
Is he editing the poem as it
is -- as it is being written?

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:14.090
Good. And Harry great improvements.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:21.830 position:73%
It's important when we're sharing materials
with our students that we let them find answers

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:26.540
to some of their questions by
looking at other primary sources.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.710 position:58%
And that's the beauty of having these
collections go up in their entirety.

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:38.200 position:72%
So in the case of the Walt Whitman papers, not
only does this page that appears to be a draft

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.660
of some sort appear, but -- O,
by the way, that's the analysis I

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.790 position:64%
that I've made reference to a minute ago.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:46.730 position:75%
I mean all of these items are linked by the way.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.220
So you can go back to them.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:56.360 position:72%
This additional item is part of the Walt
Whitman collection, and it has something to do

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.940 position:73%
with the first document that I shared with you.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:09.000 position:75%
And so my question here is: Does the information
contained in this little scrap of paper add to

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.070
or help answer any of the questions
that the first item prompted

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.450 position:58%
in your [technical audio difficulty]?

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.800
It says Camden, New Jersey,
February 9th, '88, Dear Sirs:

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.500 position:56%
Thank you for the little book number
32, Riverside Literature Series.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:35.550 position:75%
Somehow, you've got a couple of big perversions
in O' Captain, and I send you a corrected sheet.

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:37.490
Walt Whitman.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:44.760 position:63%
So does this new document shed any light
on the questions that you had earlier?

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.230
Yes Gloria, that's right.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:48.840 position:56%
It look like his tone has been
edited and he wasn't happy about it.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.630
I love that.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.340 position:66%
Gives the purpose of nearly perfect, yeah.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:58.110 position:70%
One of my favorite things about finding
these complete collections is being able pair

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:04.390 position:66%
documents together so that the questions
posed by one possibly answered by another,

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:07.420
and then give us more of the story.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:10.640
And of course, I'd love anything
that's handwritten

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.510 position:67%
and scribbled, like this one in particular.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:18.480
So the Walt Whitman papers have
been digitized by the library.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.100
And there are some extraordinary
items in these collections --

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:28.220 position:63%
not only, you know, the poetry that
we're familiar with but also photographs

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:35.690 position:75%
and correspondence materials like that butterfly
and other cards that you might not expect

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:43.180 position:75%
to exist but they do, and as a result, there are
actually two collections of Walt Whitman papers

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.610
at the library that have
been digitized this year.

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:50.630
And all totaled, they contain
literally thousands

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:53.540
of documents related specifically
to Walt Whitman.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:58.400 position:70%
So if you were ever looking for any good Walt
Whitman materials, highly recommend poking

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.040 position:69%
around the library's manuscript collections.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:06.000
But Walt Whitman's collections are
not the only manuscript collections

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.230 position:63%
that went up this year from the library.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:16.020 position:58%
A whole bunch of others did as well
including The Papers of Salmon Chase,

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:21.250 position:58%
of General William Tecumseh Sherman,
The Papers of Phillip Henry Sheridan,

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:26.920 position:67%
The Papers of Martin Van Buren, William
Henry Harrison, John Tyler, Zachary Taylor,

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.830 position:59%
John Pershing, George Patton and more.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.100
And I'm assuming you see that
list and you think, oh wow,

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.590 position:59%
a bunch of white men, and that's true.

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:38.030 position:58%
And there are lots of others as well.

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:43.640
Many of these collections are
actually coming from microfilm.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.850 position:61%
These are materials that had been
microfilmed by the library decades ago.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:55.850 position:75%
And the microfilm has now been digitized and is
now searchable through the library's website as,

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:58.830 position:75%
you know, the digital images from the microfilm.

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.110 position:59%
And by the way, I want to also mention

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:07.690 position:69%
that there are now 51 manuscript collections
available on the library's website.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:12.590
And just to think about some
things that are coming,

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:17.930 position:61%
we are gearing up for the 19th
Amendment anniversary, and as a result,

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:23.210 position:67%
you will soon be seeing The Papers of
Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:28.580 position:67%
and Lucretia Mott and others that are in
the process of being digitized to be posted

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.110 position:69%
on the library's website in the coming year.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:36.550
But in addition to these papers, a
collection went up back in February

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:39.280 position:56%
that we were all very excited about.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.140
It was The Papers of Rosa Parks.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.960
In November a year ago, so I guess
actually almost two years ago now.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:53.800 position:75%
The Howard G. Buffet Foundation gave the Library

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.210
of Congress the Rosa Parks
Collection on an extended loan.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:02.860 position:75%
And while the papers are at the library, they've
been digitized and have now been made available.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:09.460
They contain more than 10,000 items
that were the papers of Rosa Parks.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:14.140 position:58%
They include notes and correspondence
and photographs.

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:21.610 position:70%
The collection has letters and birthday cards
that school children sent to Rosa Parks.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:26.810 position:61%
This particular item that is part of
the collection is really real animated.

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:27.810
It's one of my favorites.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:35.920 position:70%
It's notes that she wrote about what happened
to her after being arrested, you know,

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:41.450
for actions in Montgomery
that led to the bus boycott.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:45.950 position:66%
And she writes: "I have been pushed around
all my life, and I felt at this moment

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:47.580
that I couldn't take it anymore."

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:52.370 position:56%
And then she goes on and talks about
what she was feeling at that moment.

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:57.800 position:63%
And there is nothing better than reading
a person's word in their own handwriting

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.460 position:67%
and getting a real sense of their thoughts.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.030
And that's something I think that
is really quite extraordinary

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.570
about the Rosa Parks Collection.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.870 position:59%
And I love what you're saying exactly.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:12.660
You're getting a sense of
her perspective and a sense

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:19.920
of how we can engage our students
with these kinds of materials.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:25.540 position:58%
And I just -- That little image
there -- In all of these collections,

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:29.670 position:69%
when you go to the library's website and you
search on The Papers of or if you just go

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:34.060 position:64%
into the manuscript collection and start,
you know, glancing at what's available,

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.690
you'll see that there is a strip
across the page that gives you some

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:39.850 position:69%
of the items that are within the collection.

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:41.280 position:59%
They give you a sense of what's there.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.780 position:61%
And I think you can get a little bit of
that with this Rosa Parks Collection --

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.200 position:63%
as I mentioned that there are
photographs and notes and correspondence

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.390 position:70%
and so forth, really, really worth exploring.

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:52.990 position:61%
And Courtney, I totally agree with you.

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:54.770
I think students will love this.

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:58.860
It will be an opportunity for
them to get to know someone

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.830 position:70%
that they think they know a little bit about,

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:06.880 position:59%
but really get a much more robust
image of Rosa Parks and her character.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:16.120 position:56%
In addition to Rosa Parks, there are
many other manuscript collections.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.450
And I want to show one other
object that has become a real,

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:22.630 position:64%
I don't know, kind of a favorite of mine.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.730 position:69%
And I need to tell a silly story about this.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:29.020
But years ago when I was a
classroom teacher in Houston Texas

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:35.130 position:64%
and I was teaching American History, one
of the most challenging topics that I had

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:40.110 position:66%
to teach related to the Bank of the United
States during the Jacksonian period.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:44.450 position:67%
And of course, I taught about the
nullification crisis, and I taught about --

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:47.490
And I just remember thinking,
I have got figure out a way

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:53.140
to make teaching the US Bank
interesting to teenagers.

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:58.380 position:69%
And I'm not convinced I ever succeeded quite
like I wanted to, but I'm convinced now

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:02.530
that if I had access to the Jackson
papers like I do and like you do

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:08.220 position:75%
and like all your students do, you might stumble
into some resources that could make teaching

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.310
about the Bank of the United
States quite interesting.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:15.920 position:66%
So, when the Jackson Papers went up, I
went looking for just exploring, you know,

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.790
what's there, what might I find
that I don't expect to find?

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:22.240 position:69%
And I got to thinking about that bank issue.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:27.500 position:64%
So I did a search on bank, and suddenly
some images of checks started coming out,

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:28.990
and I thought, oh, well that's
really interesting.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:33.300
So then I just did a search
within Andrew Jackson Papers.

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:37.010 position:59%
And by the way, this is a check for 50
dollars to his son, which, of course,

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:39.060 position:59%
I want to know the rest of that story.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:44.340
But when I did the search in the
Jackson Papers on just the term

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:50.920 position:59%
"check," what came up was 642 results.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:55.310 position:73%
And as I looked through these different checks,
some of them, not all of them were on the,

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:57.000 position:70%
you know, from the Bank of the United States.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.070 position:58%
Some of them were banks in Tennessee.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:00.530
Some were other banks.

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:06.500 position:69%
Well, what I started to get a sense of was
some approaches to teaching economic history

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:12.160 position:72%
that had never occurred to me before because I
never thought about checks as a primary source

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.590 position:66%
that I could incorporate into instruction.

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:19.180 position:67%
And so as I scored them, of course I wanted
to know more about who were these people

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:24.170 position:59%
that he's writing checks to and
getting checks from and in some cases,

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:27.350
the memorandum actually tells you.

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:31.490 position:61%
And anyway, what struck me about this
is that of course, and for those of you

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:37.230 position:72%
who teach American History and know about the
Bank of the United States, that the first bank

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:41.340 position:56%
of the US was proposed by Hamilton
and then the second bank was formed.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:46.630 position:56%
And Andrew Jackson never liked the
bank and claimed it was too cautious

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.620 position:70%
and that it constrained economic development.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:54.050 position:58%
And so as soon as he was reelected
in 1832, he removed all federal funds

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:55.880 position:70%
from the bank immediately after the election.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:00.030 position:59%
What I thought was so funny about
that is that here's a check from 1833,

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:03.660
and even though he's removed all
the federal funds from the US bank,

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.680 position:70%
he's still using it for his personal account.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:09.300 position:66%
And I just thought that was kind of funny.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.990
But anyway, I hope that just
thinking about the format

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:17.400
of this particular document might
inspire some interesting searches.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:22.790 position:58%
By the way, I also have done searches
within the Jackson Papers and also --

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:26.060 position:56%
and this is the really fun one,
through the Thomas Jefferson Papers,

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:32.310 position:67%
I did a search on the word "receipt," and
found some fabulous receipts from materials

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:34.990 position:66%
and objects purchased by Thomas Jefferson.

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:38.420 position:56%
And one of them, it really caught by
attention awhile back was a receipt

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:42.960 position:67%
for a thermometer that Jefferson purchased.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.920
And those of you who know
how much we get excited

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:48.800 position:63%
about anytime we can incorporate primary
sources into the science classroom,

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.510
you can see why that would've
gotten me kind of excited.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:56.140 position:69%
So, I'm going to -- Oh, and I love this too.

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.740 position:64%
The -- This came up when I shared this
check with some colleagues the other day.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:03.270
We were giggling about do students
today even know what a check is?

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:11.480
You know, chances are their world
is and will be their debit card.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:17.180 position:73%
And thinking about whether they're even
familiar with checks is actually kind of funny.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:21.240 position:72%
So anyway, back to the manuscript collections.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:28.630 position:58%
Many years ago, the library
microfilmed the WPA Slave Narratives.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.210
Now, these were interviews.

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:37.440
These were first person accounts
that were compiled by workers

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:46.430 position:73%
with the Federal Writers Project, which was
part of the WPA during the period 1936 to 1938.

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:52.060 position:70%
And like I said, there were 2300 first person
accounts, and all of them were microfilmed.

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:55.400
And so then the Slave Narratives
have been available.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:00.030
But what is really I think again,
marvelous about the new format

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:05.680 position:66%
on the library's website is the ability to
search within a collection and to be able

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:12.860 position:69%
to search on different formats and to
scroll through those featured content areas,

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:20.150 position:70%
make it really much easier I think to stumble
on materials that sort of catch your eye.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:27.810 position:72%
And one of the items that I stumbled into
while exploring this collection was this item.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:31.380
And this particular item --
I'm not going to read it to you

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:37.340 position:69%
because I know it's a little hard, but it
says: "The state of Alabama, Barbour County.

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:46.070 position:69%
I Jonathan Thornton do solemnly swear that I
will henceforth faithfully support, protect,

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:50.880 position:73%
defend -- excuse me and defend the
Constitution of the United States and the Union

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:57.470 position:64%
of States thereunder, and that I will in
like manner abide by and support all laws

00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:03.500 position:69%
and proclamations, which have been made
during the existing rebellion with reference

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.100 position:72%
to the emancipation of slaves so help me God."

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:12.360 position:58%
When I -- Again, when I taught school
and I was teaching the Civil War

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:18.590 position:64%
and got to discussing Reconstruction with
my students, I knew about amnesty oath,

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:21.270 position:61%
but honestly I'd never seen one before.

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:27.480 position:66%
And I certainly didn't expect to find an
amnesty oath in a collection such as this,

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:34.230 position:67%
because the rest of what is in a WPA Slave
Narratives are transcriptions of interviews

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:37.810
that were done with individuals
who had been enslaved.

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.620 position:73%
And these interviews were conducted in the 30s.

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.520 position:56%
So the people they were interviewing
in most cases were quite old,

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:48.600
and they were sharing stories
about time many years previously.

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.420
Within the collection, there
are about 500 photographs

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:57.230 position:61%
of the previously enslaved
individuals who were being interviewed.

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:02.740
And this item, this amnesty
oath, is in that collection.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.700
And I still -- You know, it's
one of those -- I found it.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.520
I'm excited that it's there.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.670 position:63%
I think there's a great deal of value in
it, but I'm not sure how it got there.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:15.000 position:59%
So I am just very curious about how it
landed in that particular collection.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.140
With that said, I guess sort of my
question for you all is have you

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:28.380 position:70%
or your students ever stumbled on a document
that didn't really belong where you found it,

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:34.450 position:59%
and yet, it piqued your curiosity in
a way that made it even more valuable?

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:39.070
Have you ever stumbled on
something in your own research?

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:42.940 position:72%
So many of you know about Chronicling America.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:47.960 position:66%
And by the way, one of our sessions
tomorrow afternoon, I believe it's the one

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:52.260
at four o'clock also is focused
primarily on Chronicling America.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:55.370
So if you have time, check it out.

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:59.060
The Chronicling America website
is really amazing.

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:04.810 position:72%
It's supported by both the Library of Congress
and the National Endowment for the Humanities.

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:14.600 position:75%
And there literally are tens of millions of
newspaper pages that are fully check searchable.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.790 position:66%
And this past year, Chronicling America --

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:21.950 position:61%
up until this year, Chronicling America
only went back as far as the 1820s,

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:29.730 position:75%
so the amount of coverage in these old
newspapers was basically the 1820s to the 1920s.

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:33.490
But now because of three
collections that have been added,

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:40.010
Chronicling America now has
materials that go back as far 1789.

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:45.840 position:61%
So, this year, Chronicling America
added the Gazette of the United States,

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.810
The National Gazette and
The National Intelligencer.

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:59.750 position:72%
So here's my question for you, what newsworthy
topics do you think might have been included

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:07.880 position:58%
in one of these newspapers during
the period 1789 to 1809 if I told you

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:13.850 position:59%
that these newspaper covered New York,
Philadelphia and Washington D.C.?

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:23.240 position:70%
So did anything big happen between 1789 and
1809 in New York, Washington or Philadelphia?

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.810
So my daughter is 13 years old.

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:31.550 position:69%
And in her History class right now, they are
studying this time period and I cannot wait

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:35.090
to have her start poking around
and seeing what she can find.

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:37.940 position:58%
I shared something with her the
other day that she got a kick out of,

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.430
and I'm going to show it
to you in just a minute.

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:40.850 position:70%
But I'm going to give you guys another second

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:44.390
or two to tell me what you think
might have been newsworthy.

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:47.780 position:56%
Yeah, Adrienne [Assumed Spelling]
excellent -- The Constitution, yeah.

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.580
So how about this?

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:54.600 position:64%
Did any of you or maybe you were thinking
about it even if you didn't write it,

00:23:54.600 --> 00:24:02.920 position:66%
did any of you think about the duel
between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr?

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:06.110
This is great.

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:07.930
This is -- this is what it says.

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:11.620
This was The National Intelligencer
in Washington Advertiser

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.470 position:56%
in Washington D.C., July 16th, 1804.

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:16.890
It's page three, column five.

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:22.390 position:69%
And it reads: "A duel was fought on the
11th inst [phonetic] meaning this past 11th,

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:29.010 position:75%
at New York between General Hamilton and Colonel
Burr, in which the former was mortally wounded

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:32.340 position:63%
at the first fire at died at 12 o'clock.

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:35.540 position:59%
Both gentlemen fired at the same time.

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:39.150
General Hamilton's ball did
not touch Colonel Burr.

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:44.590 position:69%
The cause of the duel is said to be
political, but it is not definitely stated."

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:47.850
How about that?

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:52.450
And by the way, the newspapers also
ran a great deal of information

00:24:52.450 --> 00:25:00.700 position:75%
about Hamilton's funeral precession and included
the fact that his horse followed his casket

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:04.200 position:56%
and those were the details, like I
said, caught my daughter's attention

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.970 position:66%
when I shared these news stories with her.

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:12.110 position:69%
Her reaction by the way to this one was that
there wasn't a lot of detail, you know --

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:14.770 position:63%
so matter of fact that it's kind of sad.

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:18.350 position:63%
And I really -- I liked her observation.

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:29.520 position:75%
The move of the US capitol to Washington D.C. is
covered extensively in these three newspapers.

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:34.790
Information that really covers
every major event during

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:38.350
that time period is now available
in these newspapers.

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:43.370 position:75%
And thinking about the potential to introduce
students to these topics and to these, you know,

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:47.810 position:73%
to the individuals involved is really exciting.

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:51.110 position:63%
And I like -- Laurie, I love that you
keep writing, "wow" and Carmen, you too,

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:52.910
because that's exactly how I feel.

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:55.880
It's like, wow, it's available
to us so we can find these things

00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:00.660
and Chronicling America makes
it very, very easy.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:07.770 position:61%
More resources, I'm cognizant of time,
because I want to keep going and I want

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:09.560 position:64%
to make sure I've got time for questions.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:17.490 position:69%
So I mentioned that Chronicling America is a
partnership between the Library of Congress

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:20.690 position:72%
and the National Endowment for the Humanities.

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:23.840
The library is involved in
a lot of partnerships,

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:29.830
and this one is between the
Library of Congress and WGBH.

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:34.360
It is called the American
Archive by Public Broadcasting.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:40.870 position:66%
And through this partnership, a brand new
website recently launched the website here

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:45.550 position:56%
and you can link directly to it,
but it's simply americanarchive.org.

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:49.600
It provides access to a collection
of American public radio

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:54.780
and television content that
dates back to the 1950s.

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.290
This project -- Funding for
this project by the way began

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:01.230 position:70%
with the corporation for public broadcasting.

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:10.960 position:75%
And today, there are about 15,000 television and
radio programs that are accessible for streaming

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.460 position:64%
through this website online reading room.

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:16.810
It's really -- it's amazing to me.

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:20.960 position:63%
And, you know, whenever anybody tells me
that there are 15,000 things available,

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:26.640 position:69%
on the one hand I get really excited and on
the other hand, I get really kind of frozen,

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:32.250 position:75%
because I think, where do you even begin to look
at 15,000 objects that could be of real value,

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:38.130 position:72%
particularly when -- You know, I've had so
many colleagues recently talk about, you know,

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:42.290 position:58%
the challenges that the library faces
in terms of copyrighted materials.

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:46.860 position:56%
You know, one of the reasons why so
many of the materials on the Library

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:51.470
of Congress' website are quite
old is because of copyright laws.

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:57.360 position:69%
And here's a great example of resources from
the 20th century that are available to us

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:01.920 position:72%
because they were public broadcasting, so they
were paid for with public monies and they're

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.740
in the public domain in most cases.

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:11.980 position:58%
If you jump onto this page and it's
too hard to navigate too many things,

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:19.910 position:67%
if you click on "curated exhibits," you'll
see that there are a handful of collections

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:26.600 position:66%
that have been put together by individuals
who've been working with this project.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:31.310 position:59%
There's one on -- if it's entitled,
"The Voices of Democracy, Public Media

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:34.850 position:69%
and Presidential Elections," it is terrific.

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:36.110
It is a marvelous collection.

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:44.610 position:70%
There's an interview in there between John F.
Kennedy and Eleanor Roosevelt that, you know,

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:47.900
it's 15 minutes long, but it's
absolutely worth your time.

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:48.750
There's another one.

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:55.470 position:72%
It was a program from the 1964 election that
was looking at the big issues of the election,

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:59.250
and it was a broadcast kind of
highlighting the similarities

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:01.800 position:61%
and differences between the candidates.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.690 position:72%
And there are -- there's footage from debates.

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:08.090
There is footage from interviews.

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:13.440 position:72%
There are radio programs that were
essentially curated radio programs at the time

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.340 position:61%
that they were made available on radio.

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:24.260 position:75%
There is another curated collection that is
focused on celebrating public broadcast stations

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:28.850 position:56%
and their histories, which is really
an interesting way of kind of poking

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:33.090
into a local history topic that
might not have crossed your mind.

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:36.320
And then there's another curated
exhibit on climate change.

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:42.170 position:61%
And again, all of these curated
collections help you navigate the site.

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:46.640 position:61%
And then once you kind of explore
them, you have a sense of what's there.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:50.690
And just having a sense of what's
there I think helps with searching

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:54.350 position:66%
through the vastness of these collections.

00:29:54.350 --> 00:30:00.040 position:64%
But again, these are streaming audio and
visual collections from the 20th century.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.570
And that's just a marvelous
thing to have our hands on.

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:07.950
I'm really excited about
this -- about this project.

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:11.420
I mentioned curated collections.

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:15.210
And I want to -- Oh, and
there's one other by the way,

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:18.240 position:75%
and it doesn't come up in this -- on this image.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:22.560 position:70%
But another one of the curated exhibits
that's available through the American Archive

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:29.380 position:72%
of Public Broadcasting is a collection focused
specifically on the Civil Rights Movement.

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:34.290 position:59%
And you can use your imagination as to
what public broadcasting had available

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:38.460
between the 1950s and really
very recently related

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:42.820 position:72%
to Civil Rights -- absolutely worth exploring.

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:51.650 position:69%
Okay, let's see -- Okay, Laurie, I'm going
to correct you on this one just so you know,

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:55.610 position:67%
the War of the Worlds, that was a
Columbia broadcasting event, so it was CBS.

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:59.670 position:61%
But you can still find that online too.

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:02.240
It's just not on this site.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:05.940
So I mentioned curated collections.

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:09.920 position:61%
And the curated collections that I want
to refer to now are the ones that are

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.710 position:56%
on the Library of Congress' website.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:15.290
Many of you are already familiar
with the library site,

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:17.680
so you know how you can go
right into the catalogue.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.380
You can find individual objects.

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:23.210
You can go into the various
collections and find materials.

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:28.470 position:59%
If you go into the online exhibitions,
what you're seeing are online versions

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:35.790 position:75%
of the exhibition that are available and mounted
in the Library of Congress' Jefferson building

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:39.130
and in some cases, in the
library's Madison building.

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:46.560 position:69%
Now when those physical exhibitions go away,
these online ones remain and we love that.

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:51.850 position:59%
And I really want you to -- I hope you
hear this, there often are materials

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:57.540 position:61%
in the online collections that are not
necessarily in the library's catalogue.

00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:01.440 position:56%
And what that means is if you go on
the library's website and you search

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:07.010 position:67%
on a particular topic, that might live in
an exhibition, but doesn't necessarily live

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:09.540
in the online catalogue, you may
or may not find it right away.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:14.480 position:64%
So, I encourage you to explore the
online exhibitions and notice when you're

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:21.160 position:73%
on the exhibition's page, at the top left where
it says: Search this site, when you do that,

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.810
you're only searching within
the online exhibitions.

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:28.130
So it really does help you narrow
what it is you're looking for.

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:36.500
This past year, the library
mounted six new online exhibitions.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:40.510
One of them related to Jacob Reese.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:45.850
One of them related to the Mexican
Revolution and the United States.

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:50.580
And by the way, that exhibition
is in both English and Spanish.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:33:00.450
There was another exhibition
the America Reads exhibit,

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:05.820 position:64%
which was a [technical audio difficulty]
This particular exhibit features 20 books

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:13.100 position:64%
that were identified as being significant
milestone books in American history.

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:17.340 position:64%
And that exhibit is available online now.

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:20.120 position:61%
There's an exhibit on the jazz singers.

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:25.900 position:70%
And there's also another exhibition entitled,
"Opera Before Instagram," that our colleagues

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:30.260 position:66%
in the Performing Arts division and the
Music division at the library collaborated

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:33.780
with our interpretative programs
office to create.

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:42.180 position:70%
But the one that caught my eye was an online
exhibition on "World War One, American Artist

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.370
and Their View of the Great War."

00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:48.330
This exhibit is currently in the
Jefferson building at the library,

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:51.090 position:63%
and it's sort of a precursor exhibition.

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:56.590 position:66%
Next spring, in April of 2017, the Library

00:33:56.590 --> 00:34:02.470
of Congress will be opening a
major exhibition on World War One.

00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:06.020 position:64%
And the exhibit, the amount of time that
the exhibit is in the Jefferson building,

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:10.530 position:58%
mimics the amount of time the United
States was involved in World War One.

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:14.330 position:72%
So the exhibit will be up for quite some time.

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:21.650 position:75%
And what I really like about this online
exhibition is that it's giving us just a glimpse

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:27.390 position:72%
of some of the materials that are in the
library's collection related to World War One.

00:34:27.390 --> 00:34:29.100
It features posters.

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:30.730
It features drawings.

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:37.470 position:63%
It features items that were both created
by the government and by individuals

00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:40.060 position:56%
who were involved in the war effort.

00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:46.030 position:63%
And many of the stories that emerge
from the items in the exhibition, again,

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:51.850 position:75%
they introduce some surprises or some
perspectives that you might not have considered.

00:34:51.850 --> 00:34:54.350
And one of them is this.

00:34:54.350 --> 00:35:01.670 position:61%
This item is a poster that is featured
in the World War One artist exhibition.

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:09.420 position:56%
And it says: The Camp Library is
yours," and the caption continues --

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:15.610 position:66%
it says: "You will find popular books for
fighting men in the recreational buildings

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:17.500
and at other points in this camp.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:21.770
Free, no red tape, open every day.

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:25.240
Good reading will help you advance.

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:31.500
Library war service, American
library association."

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:38.710 position:73%
What I really love about the online exhibitions
at the library is that not only do you stumble

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:41.840
on an object like this, it
might catch your attention,

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:45.060 position:61%
but you also get the exhibition script.

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:50.010 position:73%
So you get a little more contextual information
than you would get if you were just stumbling

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:52.040 position:61%
on the item in the library's catalogue.

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:58.480 position:61%
So in this case, not only do we get the
object and its citation information,

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.120
but we also get a little bit more.

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:05.460
And in this case, what it tells us
is, it says: US Military officials,

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.060
concerned by low literacy rates,

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:13.120 position:59%
even among native-born American
soldiers promoted reading and writing.

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:18.040 position:67%
The American Library Association maintained
libraries for servicemen, both at home

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:21.310 position:70%
and overseas through its library war service,

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:25.420
directed by the Library of
Congress, Herbert Putnam.

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:31.740 position:69%
In this case, artist, Charles Buckles Falls,
who signed this poster with only an F,

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:36.940 position:73%
designed a number of World War One recruitment
posters, as well as those encouraging Americans

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:41.280
to donate books and soldiers
to use camp libraries.

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:47.500
Between 1917 and 1920, some
seven to ten million books

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:51.080
and magazines were distributed
to our armed forces.

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:56.010 position:73%
Again, one of those, you know, stories I didn't
know a lot about, but now that I know it,

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:58.120 position:56%
I feel like it adds another level --

00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:05.110 position:70%
another layer to my understanding of not only
World War One and the soldier experience,

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:09.360
but some home front information,
as well as connections to libraries

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:13.560 position:70%
and literacy that I got pretty excited about.

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:17.000 position:64%
And speaking of getting pretty excited, I
have another new thing to tell you about.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.600 position:61%
And this jumps away from new
collections and into some new programs.

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:27.300
Many of you know that the library
has a Teacher-in-Residence program.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:30.280
And our Teacher-in-Residence
program is really terrific.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:35.490 position:61%
It's a great way for myself and my team
to continue learning about things going

00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:40.760 position:72%
on in the classroom, to get to know a terrific
educator, and for that educator to learn

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:44.940 position:63%
from the library, so that we can extend
the reach of our programs and materials.

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:51.060 position:69%
And this year, we have a teacher in
residence whose name is Teresa Saint Angelo,

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:54.330
and Teresa is a kindergarten
teacher from New Jersey.

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:59.200 position:73%
And she joined us about six or seven weeks ago.

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:02.670 position:69%
And what was so great is we continually talk

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:07.960
about primary sources being
valuable across the grade spectrum.

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:14.220 position:59%
And Teresa has absolutely proven that
that is the case with her 5-year-olds.

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:19.470 position:70%
Some of the activities that she has engaged
her 5-year-old kindergarteners in with regard

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:25.860 position:75%
to primary sources are really awe-inspiring and
we are excited that Teresa will be sharing a lot

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:30.720
of those strategies with all
of you in the coming year.

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.790
By the way, we will be -- We intend

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:38.570
to host a teacher-in-Residence
for the 2017/18 school year.

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:43.240 position:72%
And if you have any interest in that
opportunity, the announcement about it will go

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.270
out this coming February or March.

00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:49.860
So be on the lookout for that.

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:53.450
Ashton, it's so true, 5-year-olds
in [inaudible] is so -- You --

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:57.740 position:64%
There's a terrific blog post by the way
on the library's website and our teaching

00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:59.490
with the Library of Congress blog.

00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:03.890
You just search on "kindergarten
historians," you can read about it.

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:10.170 position:66%
And also, Teresa is doing a session
tomorrow as part of our online conference.

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:13.710
So if you want to sneak-peek at
some of the things that she's going

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:18.980 position:59%
to be doing throughout the year, you
might sign in to her session tomorrow,

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:22.310 position:69%
the one entitled, "Kindergarten Historians."

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:29.610 position:67%
Okay, I love telling about this project,
so I'm glad I've got a couple more minutes.

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:33.440
So Juan Felipe Herrera is the poet
laureate of the United States.

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:36.370 position:67%
And he became the poet laureate a year ago.

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:40.690
And last year, he had a marvelous
national project.

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:45.750 position:66%
It was called "Casa de Colores," and what
he was doing is he was working with groups

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:49.580
and individuals all around the
country to create an epic poem.

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:56.080 position:69%
This year, he's decided that he wants to
work with teachers and librarians and second

00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:00.230
and third graders all over the
country to write a children's book.

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:05.590 position:64%
And the project is called, "The
Technicolor Adventures of Catalina Neon."

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:11.520
It is a bilingual illustrative poem
that is being created with the help

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:15.840 position:58%
of artist Juana Media and second and
third graders all around the country.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:21.320 position:67%
So if you go to the read.gov website on the
library's site or you just go to library

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:25.120 position:58%
and you do a search on poet laureate,
this is the page that will come up.

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:29.580
And when you're on this page,
you can click on the image

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:33.650
of the Catalina Neon book
and read the first chapter.

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:40.020 position:61%
So, Juan Felipe and Juana Media have
collaborated to write the first chapter

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:45.630 position:56%
and now they are inviting classes of
students to read that first chapter,

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:53.580 position:64%
get to know Catalina Neon and her little
dog, Tortilla and write the next chapter.

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:59.000
Write what they think should happen
next in Catalina's adventure.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.590 position:67%
And the first round of submissions for the
next chapter are going to be due next week.

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:08.340
So if you're a second or third
grade teacher or librarian,

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:12.030
here's an opportunity to
get your students creating.

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:17.100 position:63%
And also, this is -- these announcements
about writing the next chapter are going

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.460 position:64%
to come six times during the school year.

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:22.450
So there are lots of opportunities
for participation

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:28.340
and we're really quite excited
about the outcome.

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:30.910
So, we have brand new TPS partners.

00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:36.000
We are very excited to welcome
them into the fold so to speak.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.210 position:75%
And if you go tour blog, recently our colleague,

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:45.240 position:72%
Vivian Awumey wrote a marvelous piece
welcoming new partners from across the country

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.520
who are going to be working with us

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:51.480 position:56%
to develop professional development
opportunities and more for teachers.

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:54.460 position:73%
There is always something new with the library.

00:41:54.460 --> 00:42:01.500 position:66%
I encourage you to keep finding out what's
new through press releases and blog posts.

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:06.000
At the end of my PowerPoint here,
there are links to all kinds

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.350 position:64%
of resources that I've made reference to.

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:13.450 position:66%
Here's a way for you to stay connected
with us through our blogs and Twitter feed

00:42:13.450 --> 00:42:15.160
and there's my contact information.

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.930
