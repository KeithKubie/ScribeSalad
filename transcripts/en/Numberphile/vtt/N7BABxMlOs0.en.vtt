Can Fish Count?

Films by Brady Haran

00:00:05.425 --> 00:00:05.992
 Brian Butterworth: It turns out

00:00:06.192 --> 00:00:08.171
and there's now quite a history of this.

00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:11.838
Relatively recently people have found that

00:00:12.038 --> 00:00:14.390
there are a lot of species who can do

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:15.632
number tasks.

00:00:15.832 --> 00:00:16.997
By number tasks I mean

00:00:17.197 --> 00:00:20.241
tasks which depend upon
understanding

00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:22.181
 the number of objects in the display,

00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:24.008
or what we would call "numerosity".

00:00:24.208 --> 00:00:26.915
So, you have to be very careful here,

00:00:27.115 --> 00:00:30.101
because you can't talk to other species,

00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:31.670
and they can't talk to you.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.986
So you can't explain to them

00:00:34.186 --> 00:00:38.256
what aspects of the stimulus
you want them to respond to.

00:00:38.456 --> 00:00:42.007
But you have to design the stimuli
rather carefully,

00:00:42.207 --> 00:00:45.124
so that the critical aspect of the stimuli

00:00:45.324 --> 00:00:47.047
is the numerosity of objects.

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:49.093
Actually, before the second world war,

00:00:49.293 --> 00:00:52.886
a brilliant German ethologist called Otto Koehler,

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:56.844
had shown that corvids, crows, 
jackdaws and so on,

00:00:57.044 --> 00:00:58.892
had quite a good number sense,

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:03.561
that they could match to a sample
numbers up to about 7.

00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:06.851
So he showed them a sample,
black blobs,

00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:08.267
then they had to select 

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:11.117
one of the two or three objects

00:01:11.317 --> 00:01:12.866
which had the same number
of blobs.

00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.010
The blobs would be arranged differently

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.803
If they got it right they got rewarded,

00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:16.872
if they got it wrong they didn't.

00:01:17.072 --> 00:01:19.201
And they were pretty good at this,
these corvids.

00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:23.962
Since then, there was a...
Since the 30's there's been

00:01:24.162 --> 00:01:29.106
a kind of a hiatus in research of
animal numerical cognition.

00:01:29.306 --> 00:01:32.430
But since the 90's it really started
to take off again.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.275
And we now know that a whole range
of different animals

00:01:35.612 --> 00:01:36.632
can do this.

00:01:36.832 --> 00:01:40.322
In the wild and in laboratories, 
particularly in laboratories.

00:01:40.647 --> 00:01:45.593
We were interested in the counting
abilities of fish.

00:01:45.793 --> 00:01:49.872
Now, small fish often swim
in shoals,

00:01:50.094 --> 00:01:55.004
and if they are in a shoal
there's a smaller risk of predation

00:01:55.337 --> 00:01:56.829
than if they are by themselves.

00:01:57.029 --> 00:02:00.686
And if they are in a bigger shoal,
they have a smaller risk of predation

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:02.269
than if they are in a smaller shoal.

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:04.169
Brady Haran: Safety in numbers.
Brian Butterworth: Safety in numbers, exactly.

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.716
So you can use this natural behavior
of the small fish,

00:02:09.916 --> 00:02:12.484
and test it the laboratory.

00:02:12.684 --> 00:02:15.526
So you can put them in
a transparent tank,

00:02:15.726 --> 00:02:18.199
with a few fish on this side
and a few more fish on the other side,

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:21.318
and you see which side
they swim to.

00:02:21.538 --> 00:02:25.738
It's been checked, not by me,
but by my collaborators,

00:02:25.938 --> 00:02:30.638
that they will swim to the shoal
of the side of the tank with more fish in it.

00:02:30.838 --> 00:02:34.916
What we were interested to do
in a paper we published this year

00:02:35.116 --> 00:02:41.131
was to see whether they had
a difference between small number perception

00:02:41.331 --> 00:02:42.858
and large number perception.

00:02:43.058 --> 00:02:47.120
So in humans, what happens is
that if you have to compare

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.746
4 versus 3,
4 versus 2,

00:02:49.946 --> 00:02:51.570
4 versus 1,
3 versus 2,

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.908
this is all equally easy.

00:02:54.108 --> 00:02:57.860
I doesn't depend on the ratio
of one number to the other.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.419
So 4 against 1 is just as easy
as 4 against 3.

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:04.434
However, once you get larger numbers

00:03:04.634 --> 00:03:06.604
let's say, 8 against 7,
or 8 against 5,

00:03:06.825 --> 00:03:08.660
then there's a ratio effect.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.176
That is, the bigger the difference 
between those two numbers

00:03:12.276 --> 00:03:13.067
the easier it is.

00:03:13.267 --> 00:03:17.754
The question is, would this be true
of guppies, 

00:03:17.954 --> 00:03:19.479
which are small fish about that big,

00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:22.108
relatively small brain.

00:03:22.308 --> 00:03:24.384
And the answer was - Yes,

00:03:24.584 --> 00:03:28.396
that these small fish didn't show
a ratio effect

00:03:28.596 --> 00:03:32.757
when you asked them to compare
4 versus 1 as compared to 4 versus 3.

00:03:32.957 --> 00:03:36.243
But for larger numbers, they did show
a ratio effect,

00:03:36.443 --> 00:03:39.836
which suggests that like us
they have these two systems,

00:03:40.036 --> 00:03:43.123
small number system and
a larger number system.

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:46.923
And we thought this was really quite
an intriguing result.

00:03:47.123 --> 00:03:49.732
Brady Haran: I can imagine someone
at home thinking:

00:03:49.932 --> 00:03:53.726
"Well, surely the fish just looks
at two different groups of fish

00:03:53.926 --> 00:03:57.762
or shoals of fish,
and can just measure which one is bigger,

00:03:57.962 --> 00:04:01.363
which one takes up more volume
and swims towards that.

00:04:01.563 --> 00:04:05.718
And it hasn't used any number sense there,
it just used an understanding of

00:04:06.392 --> 00:04:07.208
how big something is."

00:04:07.408 --> 00:04:11.497
How is the experiments that you have been
involved with getting around that?

00:04:11.697 --> 00:04:13.769
 Brian Butterworth: Well, it is very difficult to control,

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:19.035
because not only there are more fish over here 
that go swimming around, 

00:04:19.135 --> 00:04:22.649
and you can have fewer fish over there,
and they are swimming around.

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:29.821
So, it's really quite difficult for the subject fish
to be able to make an estimate,

00:04:30.021 --> 00:04:32.247
even though they do it actually rather well.

00:04:32.447 --> 00:04:35.770
How do we know that they are
enumerating the fish,

00:04:36.261 --> 00:04:37.771
that side versus that side,

00:04:37.971 --> 00:04:41.376
Well, there are ways in which
you can manipulate

00:04:41.576 --> 00:04:43.432
the amount of fishiness on this side

00:04:43.632 --> 00:04:44.871
and the amount of fishiness on that side.

00:04:45.071 --> 00:04:48.515
For example by putting slightly larger fish
on this side

00:04:48.715 --> 00:04:50.825
to balance the number of fish on that side.

00:04:51.042 --> 00:04:56.507
That creates some problems,
because of fish psychology

00:04:56.707 --> 00:04:58.284
which I'm not an expert in.

00:04:58.484 --> 00:05:03.668
Like, some fish prefer to swim in shoals
with larger fish

00:05:03.868 --> 00:05:07.819
and so, you know, that creates complications.

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:12.460
However, my collaborators have done
a nice training experiment,

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.948
in which the fish doesn't have to choose
between two shoals,

00:05:17.148 --> 00:05:23.045
it has to select a gate into another
tank, to join its friends.

00:05:23.245 --> 00:05:27.442
And above the gate will be
a number of blobs.

00:05:27.642 --> 00:05:32.789
And the fish has to choose
the right number of blobs.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.395
It would have had a training session
in which 

00:05:35.595 --> 00:05:40.463
a certain number of blobs will be rewarded 
and a different number of blobs will not.

00:05:40.663 --> 00:05:42.387
Let's say, 3 is rewarded,
2 is not rewarded.

00:05:42.587 --> 00:05:48.950
In the test there will be different blobs.
There will be 3-ness and 2-ness,

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.847
but different arrangements of 3-ness and 2-tess.

00:05:52.047 --> 00:05:53.484
And the fish can learn this.

00:05:53.684 --> 00:05:55.013
Actually it can learn it quite well.

00:05:55.213 --> 00:05:58.073
So, there's now quite good evidence that

00:05:58.273 --> 00:06:00.753
the fish can respond to number.

00:06:00.953 --> 00:06:05.467
But, of course, they might also in the wild
be responding to other cues

00:06:05.674 --> 00:06:08.858
like the amount of fishiness in
the neighborhood,

00:06:09.121 --> 00:06:12.360
and, of course, these are typically
correlated with a number.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.256
So, you want to try
and tease them apart experimentally

00:06:18.456 --> 00:06:22.477
but in real life, of course, they tend
to get together.

00:06:23.897 --> 00:06:27.708
Brady Haran: How is understanding 
the mathematical cognition 

00:06:27.808 --> 00:06:31.172
or the number cognition of guppies help anything? 

00:06:31.372 --> 00:06:33.483
Why do you have
an interest in this?

00:06:33.683 --> 00:06:37.383
 Brian Butterworth: Well, we want to know 
what kinds of capacities

00:06:37.383 --> 00:06:40.675
the human brain inherits.
