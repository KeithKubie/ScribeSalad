00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.530
hey my name is Ellie Hughes I worked

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540
hey my name is Ellie Hughes I worked
 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.940
hey my name is Ellie Hughes I worked
android for a while now and actually my

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950
android for a while now and actually my
 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.610
android for a while now and actually my
first job on Android was working on the

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620
first job on Android was working on the
 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.379
first job on Android was working on the
Java core libraries and actually

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389
Java core libraries and actually
 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.620
Java core libraries and actually
cleaning up some of the bugs in our j'ni

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630
cleaning up some of the bugs in our j'ni
 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.810
cleaning up some of the bugs in our j'ni
so first off I'll show you what you're

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820
so first off I'll show you what you're
 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.970
so first off I'll show you what you're
probably expecting to see when you think

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980
probably expecting to see when you think
 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.089
probably expecting to see when you think
j'ni which is code that looks like this

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099
j'ni which is code that looks like this
 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.540
j'ni which is code that looks like this
and I I'm guessing no one can tell that

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550
and I I'm guessing no one can tell that
 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.679
and I I'm guessing no one can tell that
the code that actually does anything

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689
the code that actually does anything
 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.530
the code that actually does anything
useful isn't on that screen yet and I'm

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540
useful isn't on that screen yet and I'm
 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.940
useful isn't on that screen yet and I'm
guessing that no one can tell me within

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950
guessing that no one can tell me within
 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.440
guessing that no one can tell me within
five seconds where the useful line in

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450
five seconds where the useful line in
 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.540
five seconds where the useful line in
that either is so like this this is this

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550
that either is so like this this is this
 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.700
that either is so like this this is this
talk is basically how to not do that how

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710
talk is basically how to not do that how
 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.340
talk is basically how to not do that how
do we get away from that and the the one

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350
do we get away from that and the the one
 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.770
do we get away from that and the the one
line answer is use C++ better if you if

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780
line answer is use C++ better if you if
 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.770
line answer is use C++ better if you if
you if you're using the C API S which is

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780
you if you're using the C API S which is
 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.139
you if you're using the C API S which is
what most people do it's really tricky

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149
what most people do it's really tricky
 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.580
what most people do it's really tricky
you end up with this sort of go-to fail

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590
you end up with this sort of go-to fail
 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.350
you end up with this sort of go-to fail
style or you have the sort of nested-if

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.910

lot of special cases as well like you

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920
lot of special cases as well like you
 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.229

similar for arrays you don't want to be

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790
similar for arrays you don't want to be
 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.310
similar for arrays you don't want to be
having to deal with like a J byte array

when you could just use operator square

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659
when you could just use operator square

array local references - and there's a
 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.980

long list of other things but there's

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990
long list of other things but there's
 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.380
long list of other things but there's
strings and primitive arrays I think are

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390
strings and primitive arrays I think are
 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.880
strings and primitive arrays I think are
the two major ones and most of the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890
the two major ones and most of the
 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.260
the two major ones and most of the

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270
benefit you get from that exceptions
 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.969
benefit you get from that exceptions
harder than they look and the the sort

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979
harder than they look and the the sort
 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.710
harder than they look and the the sort

of raw primitives you get in J and I are
 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.889
of raw primitives you get in J and I are
not super useful the they expect you to

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899
not super useful the they expect you to
 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.600
not super useful the they expect you to
find the class yourself they expect you

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610
find the class yourself they expect you
 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.959
find the class yourself they expect you
to create an instance if you if you want

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969
to create an instance if you if you want
 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.569
to create an instance if you if you want
to actually include a proper detail

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579
to actually include a proper detail

message or a cause you end up doing

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
message or a cause you end up doing
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.190

weird things like you know I need to

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200
weird things like you know I need to
 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.230
weird things like you know I need to
find the constructor for my for this

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240
find the constructor for my for this
 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.210
find the constructor for my for this
exception and then I need to invoke the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220
exception and then I need to invoke the
 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.680
exception and then I need to invoke the
consort blah blah blah it's a lot of

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690
consort blah blah blah it's a lot of
 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.059
consort blah blah blah it's a lot of
code especially if you deal with the

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069
code especially if you deal with the
 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.750
code especially if you deal with the
special cases

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760
special cases
 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.010
special cases
so having

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020
so having
 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.020
so having
a function that just takes a printf

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030
a function that just takes a printf
 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.050
a function that just takes a printf
style format string is a huge relief and

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060
style format string is a huge relief and
 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.030
style format string is a huge relief and
right so I've been talking about this

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040
right so I've been talking about this
 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.440
right so I've been talking about this
kind of in the abstract I'm saying you

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450
kind of in the abstract I'm saying you
 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.660
kind of in the abstract I'm saying you
should do these things there are many

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670
should do these things there are many
 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.810
should do these things there are many
choices that you can use for this and I

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820
choices that you can use for this and I
 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.550
choices that you can use for this and I
think a problem a lot of people have is

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560
think a problem a lot of people have is
 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.930
think a problem a lot of people have is
they get hung up on like what's the

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940
they get hung up on like what's the
 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.580
they get hung up on like what's the
exact perfect way to do this what's the

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590
exact perfect way to do this what's the
 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.940
exact perfect way to do this what's the
best

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950
best
 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.220
best
doesn't matter any of these are better

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230
doesn't matter any of these are better
 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.510
doesn't matter any of these are better
than writing the kind of code that we

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520
than writing the kind of code that we
 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.640
than writing the kind of code that we
saw on the first couple of slides

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650
saw on the first couple of slides
 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.410
saw on the first couple of slides
Android itself uses live native helper

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420

been talking about or if you don't like
 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.790
been talking about or if you don't like
any of the others on the internet you

any of the others on the internet you

really not that hard so what does it
look like if you actually do switch to

look like if you actually do switch to
 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.210
look like if you actually do switch to
using something like this this is the

is plenty of time for you to actually

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880
is plenty of time for you to actually
 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.600
is plenty of time for you to actually
see which is the line that actually does

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610
see which is the line that actually does

the work there you can make this shorter
you don't actually need to have the

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220
you don't actually need to have the
 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.090
you don't actually need to have the
style where we we have the constructors

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100
style where we we have the constructors
 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.620
style where we we have the constructors
and then we check like did that actually

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630

exceptions and do some kind of
 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.340
exceptions and do some kind of
transformation but that's kind of a more

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350
transformation but that's kind of a more
 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.620
transformation but that's kind of a more
advanced topic I think this gets you 90%

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630
advanced topic I think this gets you 90%
 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.780
advanced topic I think this gets you 90%
of the benefit for like 20% of the

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790
of the benefit for like 20% of the
 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.730
of the benefit for like 20% of the
efforts so this this is this is what

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740
efforts so this this is this is what
 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.890
efforts so this this is this is what
Android does internally this is actually

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900
Android does internally this is actually
 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.690
Android does internally this is actually
what the code looks like in Android for

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700
what the code looks like in Android for
 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.170
what the code looks like in Android for
that call so that was a really simple

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180
that call so that was a really simple
 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.670
that call so that was a really simple
thing where there really was just one

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680
thing where there really was just one
 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.920
thing where there really was just one
line of active ingredient in there but

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930
line of active ingredient in there but
 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.160
line of active ingredient in there but
this scales really well and our

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170
this scales really well and our
 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.530
this scales really well and our
recommendation is that you actually you

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540
recommendation is that you actually you
 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.170
recommendation is that you actually you
try to keep your code like that so don't

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180
try to keep your code like that so don't
 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.990
try to keep your code like that so don't
mix all the J&amp;I boilerplate stuff in

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000
mix all the J&amp;I boilerplate stuff in
 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.090
mix all the J&amp;I boilerplate stuff in
with your actual code keep those

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100
with your actual code keep those
 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.140
with your actual code keep those
separate in the same way that you

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150
separate in the same way that you
 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.180
separate in the same way that you
wouldn't you know it's on the other end

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190
wouldn't you know it's on the other end
 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.470
wouldn't you know it's on the other end
of the spectrum if you wouldn't sort of

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480
of the spectrum if you wouldn't sort of
 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.600
of the spectrum if you wouldn't sort of
mix your your business logic and your UI

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610
mix your your business logic and your UI
 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.420
mix your your business logic and your UI
rendering stuff down here it's it's

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430
rendering stuff down here it's it's
 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.110

similar sort of advice don't do that and

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120
similar sort of advice don't do that and
 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.060
similar sort of advice don't do that and
again if you want a good example of this

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070
again if you want a good example of this
 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.240
again if you want a good example of this
the Android system OS class is

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250
the Android system OS class is
 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.890
the Android system OS class is
implemented in exactly this way that the

implemented in exactly this way that the
 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.750

the implementation super repetitive

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760
the implementation super repetitive
 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.400
the implementation super repetitive
really boring and that's the way we like

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410
really boring and that's the way we like
 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.280

about old Android releases and you have
 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.160
about old Android releases and you have
multiple ISO files that can get very

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170
multiple ISO files that can get very
 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.320
multiple ISO files that can get very
tricky we recommend that you consider
