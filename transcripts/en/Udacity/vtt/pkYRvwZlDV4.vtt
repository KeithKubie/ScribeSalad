00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The error that we just saw happening in the quiz is called the global truncation error or GTE if you will.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This error stems from using a finite step size.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
If you would be using an infinitely small step size, you could theoretically achieve zero error.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
That's part of the truncation using a finite step size and as we saw,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
this global truncation error depends approximately linearly on the step size.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It's more or less some constant times h for the forward Euler's method.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This is different for other methods and beware this constant depends on the simulation time.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
If you look at the global truncation error at this point, it maybe smaller

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
if you take at some further orbital periods, this truncation error may explode.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Beware of that this constant is not a constant when it comes to changing the time.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
When there's a global truncation error, there's of course a local truncation error.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
That's the error that we're making in every step.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
See this supplementary material for the local truncation error if you're interested.
