time in my laboratory to learn some of

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070
time in my laboratory to learn some of
 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.999
time in my laboratory to learn some of
some of our techniques and i think

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009
some of our techniques and i think
 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.490
some of our techniques and i think
they's they put them to good use on my

these place cells in the hippocampus I

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530
these place cells in the hippocampus I
 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.319
these place cells in the hippocampus I
suppose the lesson from that is that one

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329
suppose the lesson from that is that one
 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.940

them yes I think I have a reputation for

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680
them yes I think I have a reputation for
 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.649
them yes I think I have a reputation for
being patient yeah actually I hadn't

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659
being patient yeah actually I hadn't
 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.120
being patient yeah actually I hadn't
realized it was that long but it is yes

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
realized it was that long but it is yes
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.840
realized it was that long but it is yes
it's it's a 42 43 years and I have to

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850
it's it's a 42 43 years and I have to
 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.370
it's it's a 42 43 years and I have to
say in the beginning most people were

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380
say in the beginning most people were
 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.880
say in the beginning most people were
quite skeptical um no idea that you

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890
quite skeptical um no idea that you
 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.960
quite skeptical um no idea that you
could go deep inside the brain

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970
could go deep inside the brain
 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.430
could go deep inside the brain
and find things which correspond it to

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440
and find things which correspond it to
 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.460

taking a while but then that there were

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450
taking a while but then that there were
 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.880
taking a while but then that there were
some people early on who accepted it and

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890
some people early on who accepted it and
 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.290
some people early on who accepted it and
of course very grateful and of course

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300
of course very grateful and of course
 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.980
of course very grateful and of course
