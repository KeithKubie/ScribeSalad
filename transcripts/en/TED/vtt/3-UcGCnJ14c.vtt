00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:17.508
Throughout the United States,
there is growing social awareness

00:00:17.532 --> 00:00:20.929
that sexual violence and harassment
are far too common occurrences

00:00:20.953 --> 00:00:23.287
within our various institutions --

00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:26.259
occurrences often
without any accountability.

00:00:27.374 --> 00:00:29.488
As a result, the Me Too
movement is upon us,

00:00:29.512 --> 00:00:32.426
and survivors everywhere
are speaking out to demand change.

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:35.810
Students have rallied against
sexual assault on campus.

00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:39.687
Service members have demanded
Congress reform the military,

00:00:39.711 --> 00:00:43.669
and workers ranging from
Hollywood stars to janitorial staff

00:00:43.693 --> 00:00:46.530
have called out sexual harassment
in the workplace.

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:49.418
This is a tipping point.

00:00:49.857 --> 00:00:53.950
This is when a social movement
can create lasting legal change.

00:00:53.974 --> 00:00:55.901
But only if we switch tactics.

00:00:56.509 --> 00:01:01.023
Instead of going institution
by institution, fighting for reform,

00:01:01.047 --> 00:01:03.749
it's time to go to the Constitution.

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.613
As it stands, the US Constitution
denies fundamental protections

00:01:08.637 --> 00:01:11.805
to victims of gender violence
such as sexual assault,

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:13.044
intimate partner violence

00:01:13.068 --> 00:01:14.468
and stalking.

00:01:14.492 --> 00:01:17.949
Specifically, the Fourteenth Amendment
of the Constitution,

00:01:17.973 --> 00:01:22.006
which prohibits state governments
from abusing its citizens,

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.576
does not require state
governments to intervene

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.335
when private parties abuse its citizens.

00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:29.779
So what does that mean in real life?

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:33.583
That means that when a woman
calls the police from her home,

00:01:33.607 --> 00:01:36.207
afraid that an intruder may attack her,

00:01:36.231 --> 00:01:39.829
she is not entitled
to the state's protection.

00:01:40.873 --> 00:01:43.484
Not only can the police fail to respond,

00:01:43.508 --> 00:01:45.939
but she will be left
without any legal remedy

00:01:45.963 --> 00:01:48.390
if preventable harm occurs as a result.

00:01:49.182 --> 00:01:50.503
How can this be?

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:53.898
It is because the state, theoretically,

00:01:53.922 --> 00:01:57.280
acts on behalf of
all citizens collectively,

00:01:57.304 --> 00:02:00.077
not any one citizen individually.

00:02:00.873 --> 00:02:05.669
The resulting constitutional flaw
directly contradicts international law,

00:02:05.693 --> 00:02:07.962
which requires nation-states to intervene

00:02:07.986 --> 00:02:11.289
and protect citizens against
gender violence by private parties

00:02:11.313 --> 00:02:12.791
as a human right.

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:15.926
Instead of requiring intervention,

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.128
our Constitution leaves discretion --

00:02:18.152 --> 00:02:21.244
discretion that states have used
to discriminate systemically

00:02:21.268 --> 00:02:23.993
to deny countless victims any remedy.

00:02:25.062 --> 00:02:28.234
Unlike what you may have seen
on "Law &amp; Order: SVU,"

00:02:28.258 --> 00:02:30.992
justice is rare for victims
of gender violence.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.398
And even in those rare cases
where law enforcement has chosen to act,

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:39.788
victims have no rights
during the resulting criminal process.

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:43.786
You see, victims are not parties
in a criminal case.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.738
Rather, they are witnesses;

00:02:45.762 --> 00:02:47.473
their bodies, evidence.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.795
The prosecution does not represent
the interests of a victim.

00:02:52.315 --> 00:02:55.700
Rather, the prosecution represents
the interests of the state.

00:02:56.368 --> 00:02:59.837
And the state has the discretion
to dismiss criminal charges,

00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:01.477
enter lax plea deals

00:03:01.501 --> 00:03:04.889
and otherwise remove
a victim's voice from the process,

00:03:04.913 --> 00:03:06.249
because again,

00:03:06.273 --> 00:03:11.664
a state theoretically represents
the interests of all citizens collectively

00:03:11.688 --> 00:03:14.510
and not any one citizen individually.

00:03:16.204 --> 00:03:18.032
Despite this constitutional flaw,

00:03:18.056 --> 00:03:20.622
some victims of gender violence
have found protections

00:03:20.646 --> 00:03:22.514
under federal Civil Rights statutes,

00:03:22.538 --> 00:03:24.000
such as Title IX.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.762
Title IX is not just about sports.

00:03:26.786 --> 00:03:29.535
Rather, it prohibits all forms
of sex discrimination,

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:32.290
including sexual violence and harassment

00:03:32.314 --> 00:03:35.526
within educational programs
that accept federal funding.

00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:39.780
While initially targeting
sex discrimination within admissions,

00:03:39.804 --> 00:03:42.149
Title IX has actually evolved over time

00:03:42.173 --> 00:03:46.700
to require educational institutions
to intervene and address gender violence

00:03:46.724 --> 00:03:48.823
when committed by certain parties,

00:03:48.847 --> 00:03:53.239
such as when teachers, students
or campus visitors commit sexual assault

00:03:53.263 --> 00:03:54.566
or harassment.

00:03:55.103 --> 00:03:58.296
So what this means
is that through Title IX,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.512
those who seek access to education
are protected against gender violence

00:04:02.536 --> 00:04:05.361
in a way that otherwise
does not exist under the law.

00:04:05.977 --> 00:04:09.590
It is Title IX that requires
educational institutions

00:04:09.614 --> 00:04:11.937
to take reports
of gender violence seriously,

00:04:11.961 --> 00:04:13.725
or to suffer liability.

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:16.544
And through campus-level proceedings,

00:04:16.568 --> 00:04:19.740
Title IX goes so far as to give
victims equitable rights

00:04:19.764 --> 00:04:21.529
during the campus process,

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:25.858
which means that victims can represent
their own interests during proceedings,

00:04:25.882 --> 00:04:29.416
rather than relying on
educational institutions to do so.

00:04:30.165 --> 00:04:31.897
And that's really important,

00:04:31.921 --> 00:04:35.500
because educational institutions have
historically swept gender violence

00:04:35.524 --> 00:04:36.675
under the rug,

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.504
much like our criminal justice
system does today.

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:42.545
So while Civil Rights
protects some victims,

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:45.250
we should want to protect all victims.

00:04:45.274 --> 00:04:47.994
Rather than going
institution by institution,

00:04:48.018 --> 00:04:51.488
fighting for reform on campus,
in the military, in the workplace,

00:04:51.512 --> 00:04:54.437
it's time to go to the Constitution

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:57.022
and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.830
Originally proposed in 1923,

00:04:59.854 --> 00:05:03.986
the Equal Rights Amendment would guarantee
gender equality under the law,

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.417
and much like Title IX on campus,

00:05:06.441 --> 00:05:09.598
that constitutional amendment could
require states to intervene

00:05:09.622 --> 00:05:11.569
and address gender violence

00:05:11.593 --> 00:05:14.523
as a prohibitive form
of sex discrimination.

00:05:14.547 --> 00:05:18.328
While the Equal Rights Amendment
did not pass in the 1970s,

00:05:18.352 --> 00:05:21.140
it actually came within
three states of doing so.

00:05:21.164 --> 00:05:22.885
And within the last year,

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:26.150
at least one of those states
has ratified the amendment,

00:05:26.174 --> 00:05:28.898
because we live
in different political times.

00:05:29.338 --> 00:05:31.624
From the Women's March
to the Me Too movement,

00:05:31.648 --> 00:05:34.031
we have the growing
political will of the people

00:05:34.055 --> 00:05:36.610
necessary to create lasting, legal change.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.892
So as a victims' rights attorney

00:05:38.916 --> 00:05:41.251
fighting to increase
the prospect of justice

00:05:41.275 --> 00:05:43.556
for survivors across the country

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.334
and as a survivor myself,

00:05:46.358 --> 00:05:48.471
I'm not here to say, "Time's Up."

00:05:49.038 --> 00:05:51.306
I'm here to say, "It's time."

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.799
It's time for accountability
to become the norm after gender violence.

00:05:54.823 --> 00:05:58.070
It's time to pass
the Equal Rights Amendment,

00:05:58.094 --> 00:06:01.849
so that our legal system
can become a system of justice,

00:06:01.873 --> 00:06:05.972
and #MeToo can finally become "no more."

00:06:06.518 --> 00:06:07.669
Thank you.

00:06:07.693 --> 00:06:09.988
(Applause)
