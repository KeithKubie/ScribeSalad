00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And this course we are mostly using the computer to do simulations

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
numerically, that is by number crunching.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The major reason for that is that most problems can't be solved

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
by clean equations, unlike school book problems.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The real road is way too complex to do that.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
A second reason is that particularly we have to base our simulations

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000
on huge numbers of measurements be it climate's data, be it financial data, be it data from biology,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but the numerically approach also has a series of drawbacks.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
In particular, it's very hard to prove general results using numerics.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Is there no way that a particle in some system escapes to infinity?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You can look at a single trajectory at a time, but you cannot look at an infinite number of trajectories

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and numerical methods almost always introduce discretization errors

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
also known as truncation errors.

00:00:53.000 --> 99:59:59.000
In particular, we have to work with finite steps in time.
