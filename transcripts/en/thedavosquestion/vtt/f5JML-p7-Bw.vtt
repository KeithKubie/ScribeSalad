My name is Jack Sim from the World Toilet
Organization. I think that's there's no joint

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.750
politic conflict possible because people will
then find the opportunity to invest back home

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:25.220
internally. And they can invest back home
in their poorer region to help close the income

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.480
gap. Or they could also invest in the night
economy. For example in Singapore there is

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:38.520
no poorer region. There is a waste of economy
time at night where offices are empty, roads

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.699
are empty, and all these national assets cost
trillions of dollars and if we invest in the

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:50.399
night economy then we can get people to work
at night. People don't usually want to work

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.039
at night when the family lives in the day.
But if they moved a higher family into the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.499
night and there's night school, there's night
shopping, there's night recreation, night

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:09.579
responsibility around the country 24 hours,
you can internally generate enough economic

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:17.560
activities until the new recovery comes. By
then you might still want to work 3 shift.
