MALE SPEAKER: Hello, everyone.

00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:06.987
Welcome to Chrome Dev
Summit 2-- The Sequel.

00:00:06.987 --> 00:00:09.070
MALE SPEAKER: We have a
bunch of Chrome developers

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.960
here to talk about the
work they're doing.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.960
MALE SPEAKER: Today is all about
you all connecting with us.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.168
MALE SPEAKER: Archimedes
said, "Use [? will change ?]

00:00:16.168 --> 00:00:17.500
sparingly."

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.000
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Motion and animation

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.139
reinforce the idea that the
user is initiating change.

00:00:23.139 --> 00:00:25.180
MALE SPEAKER: We created
a tool called Vulcanize.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.460
MALE SPEAKER: As you've
all been sitting here,

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.330
we've actually secretly
been updating the website.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.788
FEMALE SPEAKER: We also want
to make it easy for developers

00:00:30.788 --> 00:00:32.526
to be able to use this
commission system.

00:00:32.526 --> 00:00:35.072
AUDIENCE: Just a home screen
or "installs" my web app.

00:00:36.982 --> 00:00:39.190
FEMALE SPEAKER: The best
part about the Chrome Summit

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.850
for me has been hearing
about these APIs right

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.180
as they're being worked
on, before they've actually

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.222
hit the ground.

00:00:45.222 --> 00:00:46.660
MALE SPEAKER: I think
the big thing I get out

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.120
of the Chrome Summit
is a lot of validation

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.204
on the future of the web.

00:00:49.204 --> 00:00:51.870
MALE SPEAKER: It's about getting
this really personal connection

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.180
to people working on Chrome,
being able to talk them

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.656
on a very personal level.

00:00:55.656 --> 00:00:57.600
AUDIENCE: Is it going
to work on my device?

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.516
And how are we going
to get to that?

00:01:00.516 --> 00:01:03.918

SUNDAR PICHAI: It's
an incredible time.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.930
We expect over 5 billion
people in the next few years

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.949
to have a smartphone.

00:01:17.949 --> 00:01:20.240
I think it's one of the
biggest opportunities all of us

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.040
will see in our
lifetime in computing.
