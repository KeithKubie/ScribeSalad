00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.520
Okay so I'm going to try to figure this out. How do I change a field type? So

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.520
View Fields, and if I scroll down. We've got

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.540
our Festival field. This is the relationship, the lookup.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.530
&gt;&gt; So I'm going to try this. I'm going to try to hit Edit. Change Field type.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.290
&gt;&gt; There you go.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.665
&gt;&gt; Hey that wasn't so bad.

00:00:21.665 --> 00:00:23.801
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:23.801 --> 00:00:25.270
&gt;&gt; Okay, all this stuff still

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:25.990
makes sense.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.140
&gt;&gt; And the great thing about this is you can do this with any field type,

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.280
not just relationships. So if you ever need

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.110
to change a field down the line, you can.
