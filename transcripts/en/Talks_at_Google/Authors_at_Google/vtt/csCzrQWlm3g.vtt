[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.910
SPEAKER 1: Well, thank
you for being here.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.670
Thank you, DC Comics.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.360
So I wanted to start by asking a
general question to all of you.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.430
What does Superman stand for?

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.940
And why has he been a fan
favorite for 80 years?

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:20.440
Who's brave?

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.860
PAUL DINI: Well, when
you're that strong,

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.180
you don't stand for much.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.110
SPEAKER 1: [LAUGHS]

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.442
PAUL DINI: Sorry, bad joke.

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:26.900
BRIAN MICHAEL
BENDIS: Well, hope is

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.540
what he stands for in
the most general sense.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.080
And that's why the character
has lasted long because you

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.580
can't argue with that.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.300
It's inarguable.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.510
Hope is good.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.790
So, yeah.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.540
SPEAKER 1: Agreed.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.045
DAN JURGENS: Moral integrity.

00:00:40.045 --> 00:00:40.711
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:43.090
DAN JURGENS: Yeah, which
extends to everything.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.455
MARV WOLFMAN: Truth without
looking for a reward.

00:00:49.065 --> 00:00:51.120
PAUL DINI: Yeah, he
stands for the future.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.850
He puts himself up there
as a suggestion of what

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.520
mankind could look toward.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.460
And he doesn't force
anybody to do that.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.039
But he's out there and
seeks to inspire people.

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:06.830
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
Yeah, and also truth,

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.440
justice, and the American way.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.940
This is a phrase synonymous
with Superman for decades.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.750
And it's just one of those
almost cliche things.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.449
But now in this day and
age, truth and justice

00:01:19.449 --> 00:01:21.490
and the American way--
they mean different things

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.390
to different people.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.750
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.916
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: And
some of it is under siege.

00:01:24.916 --> 00:01:31.235
And so writing a character
who believes in them so much--

00:01:31.235 --> 00:01:33.130
it's actually a great
way to spend your day.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.030
MARV WOLFMAN: Well, it's
completely ingrained in him.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.470
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
Yeah, oh yeah.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.300
MARV WOLFMAN: He doesn't
have to think about doing it.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.130
He just does it.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.536
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: Yep.

00:01:39.536 --> 00:01:41.980
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, and we
need that always, especially

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:42.580
right now.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.480
PAUL DINI: Exactly.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.890
SPEAKER 1: So do
you guys see him

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.710
more as the Boy Scout
figure he has kind of been

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.710
for a long time or
more as the prominently

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.580
alien counter-cultural
figure he's been recently

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.412
and perhaps was originally?

00:01:57.412 --> 00:01:59.870
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: Well, I
don't see him as a Boy Scout.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.150
That was the question
as the new Spider--

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.000
Spider-Man-- Superman, rather.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.440
DAN JURGENS: Wait, wait, wait.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.870
What was that?

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.610
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: I'm
still writing Spider-Man--

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.880
PAUL DINI: Oh, yeah.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.820
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
It's going to be a while.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.569
I'm still writing
Spider-Man on my checks.

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:21.290
But with Superman comes a great
deal of empathy and pathos.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.530
And sometimes people
can relate to that

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.097
as vanilla or Boy Scout.

00:02:26.097 --> 00:02:27.930
And nothing could be
further from the truth.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.760
And I remember, like, when I was
writing, like, Captain America

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.229
or Cyclops, they would
say the same thing and go,

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:34.520
isn't that a vanilla character?

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.910
I'd go, oh, no, no, no, no.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.970
Those characters are the most
interesting to peel back on.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.390
As someone who can stand
there and has the guts

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.210
to be a Boy Scout, there's
a lot going on in there.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.840
And to peel it back and show
you how relatable it is,

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.754
is quite something.

00:02:51.754 --> 00:02:54.170
MARV WOLFMAN: Well, to call
someone a Boy Scout in the way

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.895
they mean it means
they're bland.

00:02:55.895 --> 00:02:57.020
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: Yeah.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.519
MARV WOLFMAN: And
that's ridiculous.

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.560
A character who is just
trying to do good, who's

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.000
trying to do the right thing--

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.190
if you say that's bland,
if you say that's bad,

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.710
you're saying doing
the right thing is bad.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.110
But doing the wrong
thing is cool.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.470
And that's totally the wrong
message for the character.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.981
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: Totally.

00:03:13.981 --> 00:03:15.730
PAUL DINI: I've always
thought of him as--

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.100
there was a line, I think,
in one of the early Fleischer

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.690
Superman cartoons.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.450
There was a race of Supermen
from the planet Krypton.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.790
And I've always felt that
there was something about him,

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.690
maybe either
spiritually or even just

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.420
in the way the
Kryptonians evolved,

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.810
that they look ahead, that
they look out for each other.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.540
They look toward
the better things.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.980
Whereas humans might see crime
as an option or something

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.580
to consider, that's
not the Kryptonian way.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.890
It would be abhorrent
to think that way.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.270
And I think that he personifies
the best of that nature

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.750
and is trying to put it out
there as a way of saying,

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.275
this is where I come from.

00:03:57.275 --> 00:03:58.790
And this is what I do.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.794
And I think he was lucky enough
to find adopted parents who

00:04:03.794 --> 00:04:04.960
fostered that belief in him.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.130
SPEAKER 1: Mm-hm.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.070
Anything to add, Dan?

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.840
DAN JURGENS: No,
only that to me,

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.500
the Boy Scout thing-- he only
ever had a couple of villains

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.750
refer to him as a
Boy Scout, if any.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.540
That was always something that
came up on the part of fans.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.902
And they meant it in
a derogatory sense.

00:04:19.902 --> 00:04:21.860
And I always thought was
remarkably unfortunate

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.780
because, yeah, it's true.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.700
If we're to say it's bad to try
and embrace the best qualities,

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.542
there's something
totally wrong with that.

00:04:29.542 --> 00:04:30.250
PAUL DINI: Mm-hm.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.040
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: Yeah,
but the struggle to do it

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.260
is not a vanilla struggle.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.735
DAN JURGENS: No, not at all.

00:04:33.735 --> 00:04:35.401
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
It's insanely hard

00:04:35.401 --> 00:04:36.440
to do what he's doing.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.010
So I always, like, bat
that away as not even

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.319
worth discussing because it's so
obvious what a struggle it is.

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:44.110
DAN JURGENS: Right.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.790
PAUL DINI: Yeah.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.300
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, so see,
being good is cool, guys.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.100
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: Yeah.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.250
SPEAKER 1: So it's probably safe
to assume that most Superman

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.610
fans obviously cannot fly
or bench press the Earth.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.560
So what do you think
makes Superman relatable?

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.310
DAN JURGENS: I think it's the
fact that he is one of us.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.860
And if you go back to his
creation and this idea that

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.550
here is this kind of like farm
kid in the middle of the United

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.380
States in Kansas that I
thought at that time, in 1938,

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.430
that becomes representative
of what we were thinking

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.750
America was at that point.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.280
It was much more typical
then than it is now.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.000
But at the same time, I think
that is very much who he is--

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.700
this farm kid who grew up
with a respect for life

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.330
because if you live on a farm,
you have animals around you

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.980
all the time.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:34.938
They come, and they go.

00:05:34.938 --> 00:05:35.660
They die.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.280
There's all sorts of things
with the planting season

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.270
that comes and goes.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.840
And everything lives and
dies and is born again stuff.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.386
And I think because
of that, that

00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:46.802
is something that has always
been imbued in the character.

00:05:49.741 --> 00:05:51.157
BRIAN MICHAEL
BENDIS: Marv agrees.

00:05:51.157 --> 00:05:52.558
DAN JURGENS: Yeah.

00:05:52.558 --> 00:05:53.960
SPEAKER 1: Thanks, Brian.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:54.850
You're his assistant.

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.040
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
Yeah, I'm his hype man.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.870
SPEAKER 1: So how
do you understand

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.880
Superman's relationship
with Batman,

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.270
Wonder Woman, and the rest
of the Justice League?

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.060
MARV WOLFMAN: I think it's a
matter of seeing people trying

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.900
to accomplish the same goals,
but watching them do it

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.210
in a different way,
and the realization

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.560
that you can't have people do
everything you want them to.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.570
Everybody has the right
to go their own way.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.720
But their mission is the same.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.520
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.740
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: So
often when you're kids,

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:27.970
you're reading these comics.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.840
And one of the superheroes will
always say, Superman's here.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.230
What are we going to do?

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.980
DAN JURGENS: Yeah.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.146
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: And
so the amount of respect--

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:38.890
like, physical, and emotional,
and spiritual respect

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.660
they have for
Superman-- is enormous.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.735
He is the standard of which they
are all trying to live up to,

00:06:43.735 --> 00:06:46.870
to the point where it's
annoying that he's there,

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.070
because he's constant.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.400
He's always living up to it.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.610
So living up to
that can be immense.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.390
But at the same time, he
seems to respect the others

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.160
in a way they
can't even process.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.260
Like, he goes to Superman--

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.020
I mean, he goes to Batman
and Wonder Woman, and goes,

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.680
I need help with this, or
you know how to do this.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.607
And I always like that
you've all written scenes

00:07:10.607 --> 00:07:12.940
where they've always seemed,
oh, Superman needs my help.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:13.560
Oh.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.370
And I like that.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.140
They genuinely
seem like friends.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:17.470
DAN JURGENS: Yeah.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:17.630
And--

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:18.200
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
They genuinely

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.820
seem to really like each other.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:20.611
DAN JURGENS: Right.

00:07:20.611 --> 00:07:23.771
And Superman never shows
up and says, I'm the guy.

00:07:23.771 --> 00:07:25.270
I think the whole
point is he always

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.430
has this sense of
presence about him.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.410
And they respond
to him as the guy.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.750
But he'd be the last guy
to ever say, I'm the guy,

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.070
if that makes sense.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.000
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
Which makes him the guy.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:34.590
DAN JURGENS: Right, exactly.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:36.673
PAUL DINI: Which makes him
the guy, exactly, yeah.

00:07:36.673 --> 00:07:39.400
MARV WOLFMAN: He's the one
who just his presence inspires

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.540
others.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.180
And whether it's the normal
people in Metropolis,

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.480
or the world, or
other superheroes,

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.010
you want to do well for him.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.650
You wanted to be the
best because of him.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.600
If he's going to
take you someplace,

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.960
you know it's going to be good.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.190
BRIAN MICHAEL
BENDIS: Yeah, I think

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.760
you wrote a scene where the
superheroes are like, ugh,

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.010
I don't want to do this thing.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.270
And they're like, all right.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.209
I mean, you can't
not be your best self

00:08:02.209 --> 00:08:03.250
when he's standing there.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.257
You just have to suck it up.

00:08:05.257 --> 00:08:07.840
PAUL DINI: He's the best leader
because he doesn't necessarily

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.339
lead.

00:08:08.339 --> 00:08:10.973
He allows the others
to come to the fore.

00:08:10.973 --> 00:08:11.720
DAN JURGENS: Yep.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.420
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: He lets
Batman think he's leading.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.086
PAUL DINI: Yeah.

00:08:14.086 --> 00:08:15.690
[CHUCKLING]

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.800
SPEAKER 1: So is Clark Kent
or Superman the disguise?

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.450
What separates
Clark Kent's persona

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:24.340
from the Superman persona?

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.965
MARV WOLFMAN: I think
they're the same.

00:08:25.965 --> 00:08:28.740
DAN JURGENS: I do, too.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.220
MARV WOLFMAN: Superman,
or rather Kal-El,

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.510
came to Earth as an infant.

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:39.789
All of his morality, all of his
viewpoint comes from the Kents.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:41.646
Therefore, he's
the right person.

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:42.520
He's the real person.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.890
Superman doesn't talk about it.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:48.640
But he goes out and implements
what the Kents taught him--

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.280
to be right, to be
good, to try your best.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.380
So I don't see much
of a difference.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:57.910
Clark is just the
character who isn't flashy.

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:00.160
But they're both always
trying to do the best.

00:09:02.774 --> 00:09:05.200
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: I think
about that "Kill Bill" bit

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:05.700
often.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.601
I mean, it gets brought
up to us quite a lot.

00:09:07.601 --> 00:09:09.850
Then people think that that's
a statement on Superman.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.300
And you have to
make a statement.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.830
But my feelings about
it are so different.

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.410
Like even using
the word disguise--

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:19.150
it's like I wouldn't
even use it.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.660
What I'm a little obsessed
with right now writing them

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:27.760
is that Superman was
kind of thrust on him.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.070
Like, his father said,
you are going to do this.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:33.590
And we're going to
send you to do this.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:37.360
The choice that Clark made in
his life was to be a reporter.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.550
Like, everything else
was thrust upon him.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.530
Or he was sent to a place.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:44.480
But he chose to be a reporter.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.860
He said, there's
truth out there.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.470
And there's justice to be
had that Superman can't

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:53.650
get to just punching it, right?

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:54.980
There's another way through it.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.750
And being a writer
to reveal that truth

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.080
is something I'm going to do.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.720
So he chooses to spend
his time doing that.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.210
And I find that
enormously admirable.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:09.380
It makes me love
him all the more.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:14.210
MARV WOLFMAN: And it's something
that all his powers cannot

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.280
alter in any way.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.210
He is a writer.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:18.380
He loves being a writer.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.470
He loves telling the story
that he's going to tell.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:24.800
And all of his powers
means nothing to him.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.530
It's all about getting
those words down and getting

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:28.730
the thoughts down.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.290
And that's pure Clark.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:30.560
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: Yeah.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.351
DAN JURGENS: Mm-hm.

00:10:31.351 --> 00:10:31.970
Right.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:36.140
And I think there's a difference
to be drawn between a character

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.620
that puts on a mask and
goes and does what he does--

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:40.730
or she does--

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:43.370
because they're making
a conscious decision

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:45.500
at that point to have
this other identity.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.480
I think with Superman,
I've always looked at it

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:53.420
as being like someone
who's a police officer,

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.270
or a firefighter, or whatever--

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.116
someone who's in
the military-- where

00:10:58.116 --> 00:10:59.990
this is what they put
on when they wear to go

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.570
do what they do.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.653
But they come home, and
they're still that person.

00:11:02.653 --> 00:11:05.990
And they're not making an effort
to disguise themselves so much.

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:07.940
So I've always
separated Superman out

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.873
from many other
characters that way.

00:11:09.873 --> 00:11:10.860
PAUL DINI: Mm-hm.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:11.705
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: And
for people who don't know--

00:11:11.705 --> 00:11:13.640
and I'm going to embarrass Dan.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.030
So I had been doing an
insane amount of research.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.750
And then all of a sudden--

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:20.510
and I got to know
Dan over the course

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:23.194
of this whole new
chapter in my life.

00:11:23.194 --> 00:11:24.860
And then you start
going back and, like,

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.362
well, the death of Superman
was how many years ago?

00:11:27.362 --> 00:11:28.070
And that wasn't--

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:28.460
DAN JURGENS: Three.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:28.610
[CHUCKLING]

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:29.810
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: And
that wasn't his first Superman

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:30.310
story.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:33.110
He's been with
Superman for as long

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:34.760
as anyone's been
with any character

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:35.900
in the history of comics.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.108
Like, people talking about
Chris Claremont and X-Men.

00:11:38.108 --> 00:11:40.340
But what Dan's
accomplished on Superman

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.980
is equal, if not
greater, because

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.320
of the size of the stories
and what he's accomplished.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.240
So it's quite amazing
what he's done.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.510
And he did it so quietly.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:52.510
Like he got to people.

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:54.440
He kind of just slid in
there and got it done.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.110
But here we are, decades
later, with one of the greatest

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:58.510
achievements with a character.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:11:59.050
So.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.008
DAN JURGENS: Thank you.

00:12:00.008 --> 00:12:01.248
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: Yeah.

00:12:01.248 --> 00:12:03.558
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:04.944 --> 00:12:06.080
SPEAKER 1: You embarrassed?

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:06.240
DAN JURGENS: Yes.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:06.740
[LAUGHS]

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:07.740
PAUL DINI: Little bit.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.420
DAN JURGENS: It doesn't seem
like it's been that long.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:10.169
It really doesn't.

00:12:10.169 --> 00:12:11.250
So, yeah.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.050
SPEAKER 1: So since
you brought it up, Dan,

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:16.664
how did it feel
to kill Superman?

00:12:16.664 --> 00:12:19.080
DAN JURGENS: When we started,
it was just a story to tell.

00:12:21.582 --> 00:12:23.040
And we had talked
about it a couple

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.410
of times before as let's
do the death of Superman

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:28.710
because it was a story
we had read in our youth.

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:30.870
And it had been done
a couple of times.

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.480
And we never had the rest
of the story to go with it.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.530
And it became a story
that was all about trying

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.930
to make a statement
about Superman

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:41.310
by removing him from the book.

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.410
So we had "Death of Superman."

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:47.550
After that, it was essentially
"Funeral for a Friend," which

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:49.530
was the world without Superman.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:51.840
That was the story
we wanted to get to.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.400
Before that, the
death of Superman

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.126
was just this big, fun exercise.

00:12:56.126 --> 00:12:57.750
But what we wanted
to write about later

00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:00.480
was a world with no Superman.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.460
So at first it was just
this cool story idea.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:06.330
But then, as the hype
started to build,

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.530
it really-- as I was writing
and drawing the story,

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:11.812
you become very
aware that this isn't

00:13:11.812 --> 00:13:13.020
going to be the normal thing.

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.750
An awful lot of people are going
to be looking at this book.

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:17.208
And they're going
to be reading it.

00:13:17.208 --> 00:13:18.720
And everybody was
talking about it.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.710
And it became a story
element in terms of news,

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:26.892
even before the book
came out, that it

00:13:26.892 --> 00:13:29.100
felt like there was always
something hanging over me,

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.510
especially as I was
drawing the book,

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.885
because it was all splash
pages and everything like that.

00:13:32.885 --> 00:13:35.645
But it was a fun and
magical experience.

00:13:35.645 --> 00:13:37.770
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: Well,
and I'm from Cleveland.

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:39.690
So when the death of
Superman happened,

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:43.110
I was actually working at a
comic book store in Cleveland,

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:44.370
going to art school.

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:47.220
And the line out the door that
day that Superman died was--

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.470
DAN JURGENS: Oh, it was crazy.

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:49.290
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
--the craziest thing

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:50.280
I'd ever experienced.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.190
We were in a mall in
downtown Cleveland.

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.770
And it was the length
of the mall of people

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.479
just buying Superman comics.

00:13:57.479 --> 00:13:59.520
And the whole point of
working at the comic store

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.995
was not have to work this hard.

00:14:00.995 --> 00:14:02.699
So I was very annoyed by you.

00:14:02.699 --> 00:14:04.740
I wanted to sit and draw
my pages at the counter.

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:05.910
DAN JURGENS: I apologize now.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.600
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
And then I remember being

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.910
completely flustered by this.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:09.930
And the phone rang.

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:11.670
And it was my mother.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:13.549
And she goes, is
Superman really dead?

00:14:13.549 --> 00:14:14.340
And I just hung up.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:15.270
Uh, I've got to go.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:16.936
And it was a crazy day.

00:14:16.936 --> 00:14:19.560
SPEAKER 1: It was the first time
that had ever happened, right?

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.101
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
No, yeah, yeah.

00:14:21.101 --> 00:14:24.750
I have a very definitive
memory of everyone

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:27.050
really believing this
was going to happen.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:28.300
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, now
they come back to life.

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:28.750
But--

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:30.125
BRIAN MICHAEL
BENDIS: Yeah, but--

00:14:30.125 --> 00:14:31.710
SPEAKER 1: --not
back in the day.

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:32.670
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
They fell for it.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:33.240
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, exactly.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.115
DAN JURGENS: Well,
although-- and I've always

00:14:35.115 --> 00:14:38.280
said, at the time, we did
not know when and how we

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.570
were going to bring him back.

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.840
We knew inevitably it
would happen at some point.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.797
But then we also
suspended publication

00:14:44.797 --> 00:14:46.380
for a couple of
months and everything.

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.610
And we did not know.

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:49.110
When we did that
entire story, we

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:51.640
had no idea how it
was going to happen.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.570
We didn't know when exactly
it was going to happen,

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:57.390
just that eventually
it obviously had to.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:58.980
But we didn't know.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.420
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: No, but
you did the perfect thing.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:01.630
It was never about the death.

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:02.670
It was what do
you get out of it?

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:03.550
DAN JURGENS: Right, exactly.

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:05.383
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
And that's the mistake

00:15:05.383 --> 00:15:08.280
when you see other people
doing their death-cycle story,

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.680
they're so obsessed
with selling the death

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.140
that it's really what
do you get out of it?

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.940
Like, what kind of new stories
are you going to get like--

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.720
any superhero, it's
like, Batman dies.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.320
And then you get all the other
players rise to the occasion.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.610
And you get a new story.

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:25.290
And that's what you
guys had for years.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:27.780
DAN JURGENS: Yeah, yeah, we did.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.630
SPEAKER 1: So, Brian,
how did you end up at DC?

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.810
And why did you want to write
Action Comics and Superman?

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.030
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
I ended up at DC--

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:38.040
over the years, they
had been very kind

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.290
and made it clear
that I was invited.

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:44.480
And a few years ago, a
serious offer was made.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.695
But it just wasn't time yet.

00:15:46.695 --> 00:15:48.560
I knew it would
happen eventually.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.690
I just, I knew me well enough
to know, boy, it was just--

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:53.340
but it wasn't time.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:56.070
I didn't feel like I'd finished
what I was doing over there

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:58.480
with "Jessica Jones" and
Miles and some other stuff.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.700
But this time around,
they came at me

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:06.600
with a really decent offer that
was worth turning to my friends

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.190
at Marvel, who I
was friends with--

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:09.709
I'm still friends with.

00:16:09.709 --> 00:16:11.250
And to turn to them
and go, hey, I've

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.890
got to go, it's got to be
enough for them to go, yeah,

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:14.790
you've got to go.

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:17.070
It had to be enough
for them to agree.

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:19.960
And it was.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:24.224
And, yeah, I think
Dan and Jim just--

00:16:24.224 --> 00:16:25.890
I guess everyone walks
in there and says

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:26.848
they want to do Batman.

00:16:26.848 --> 00:16:28.860
I guess that's
what everyone does.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.410
And so they were
braced for that and how

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:33.450
they were going to tell
me I'm not doing Batman.

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:38.700
But I said, if it comes
along that Superman

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:43.266
becomes available, that would
be, I think, where I would go.

00:16:43.266 --> 00:16:44.640
But I don't know
where you're at.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.350
And, again, it's someone's gig.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:48.280
I don't want to
take someone's gig.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:52.500
And then a day later,
he got over the shock

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:58.050
of me saying Superman and
said, actually, Action #1000

00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:59.064
is coming down--

00:16:59.064 --> 00:17:00.480
like, I don't want
to rush things.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.160
But, boy, there's a
real opportunity here.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.520
And I go, all right,
let me think about it.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.859
And then I went
back to Cleveland

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:09.005
for my brother's wedding.

00:17:09.005 --> 00:17:11.130
It just so happened my
brother was getting married.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.223
And sorry you have to
hear this again, Dan.

00:17:13.223 --> 00:17:13.722
And--

00:17:13.722 --> 00:17:15.810
DAN JURGENS: No problem.

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:17.670
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
And at the library

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:21.030
I used to hang out in all
the time, one of my friends

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:21.910
helps run it now.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.880
And he had put together
a Superman exhibit

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.950
at the Cleveland Museum that
connected Cleveland and Judaism

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:32.820
and Superman and me and all this
other-- and I walk in there.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.220
And it was like this maze
I had to walk through.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.830
And by the end of it,
I just texted my wife

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:38.960
and go, close the deal.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.400
I have to do this.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.800
It really felt like someone
had put a show on for me.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.350
It's like, see, you
love all this stuff.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:47.570
You're connected to it.

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:50.160
It's part of your DNA.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.330
And I just flashed.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.880
I remembered I was the
artist for the Superman

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.710
parade in the '80s
when I was in college,

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:57.960
and how connected
it was to my youth.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.540
And, boom, here we are.

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:01.410
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:06.870
So you brought up Action Comics
#1000 which is why we're here.

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:09.960
So, Marv, you have a story
coming up in Action Comics

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.829
#1000 using artwork from
the legendary Curt Swan.

00:18:12.829 --> 00:18:13.620
MARV WOLFMAN: Yeah.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.960
SPEAKER 1: And what was
it like to script a story

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.760
drawn by such an
acclaimed artist that's

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.510
no longer with us?

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:19.968
BRIAN MICHAEL
BENDIS: And where was

00:18:19.968 --> 00:18:21.220
this art for all these years?

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.140
MARV WOLFMAN: I don't know.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:27.950
There were four pages that
they found of something.

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:30.100
Superman's not in it.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.380
They're a fragment.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:32.650
It's not the first page.

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:34.395
There is no last page.

00:18:34.395 --> 00:18:36.060
It was dialogued.

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:39.754
I have a hunch it was a writing
test of just four pages given

00:18:39.754 --> 00:18:40.920
out to writers of something.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:41.628
But I don't know.

00:18:41.628 --> 00:18:43.950
Of course, nobody up there
is aware of what it is.

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:47.940
My assignment was to strip
out the copy, look at it,

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.290
and turn it into a complete
story with a beginning,

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:52.706
middle, and end, even though
there's no beginning, middle,

00:18:52.706 --> 00:18:55.770
and end, and to make
it a Superman story,

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:57.990
even though there's
no Superman in it,

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:02.010
and to create an entire thing.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:05.880
And I used to do this all the
time as an assistant editor

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:06.780
to Joe Kubert.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.196
We would take old stories--

00:19:09.196 --> 00:19:11.070
I don't know why Joe
wanted it done this way.

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:13.530
But we'd take old war stories.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:17.970
And I would rewrite them
as current unknown soldier

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.350
stories.

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:21.030
At Marvel, we did it once.

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:24.690
And I don't remember the
order, but we lost the license

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:30.840
to either "John Carter"
or "Planet of the Apes."

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.150
We had the artwork for
one of those books,

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:35.760
and it had to be
converted to the other.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.500
How you take a
"John Carter" story

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.916
and turn it into a "Planet of
the Apes," I don't remember.

00:19:39.916 --> 00:19:41.670
But anyway, it's a
great, fun thing.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:43.540
Now, I had worked
a lot with Kurt.

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.840
I did Superman for
years with Kurt.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.177
Kurt is wonderful.

00:19:47.177 --> 00:19:48.510
I mean, he's a brilliant artist.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:50.380
I just loved his stuff.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:55.030
So the idea of being able to
take these four isolated pages

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:58.480
and turn it into a
complete Superman story--

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.250
and I threw in a
Superman villain,

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:04.540
who you also don't see, because
the pages were already drawn--

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:05.620
was just wonderful.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.170
It was like working
with Kurt again.

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:10.120
He was a dear, sweet man.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.620
When I was at
Disney, I would hire

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:14.950
him to do short stories for us.

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:17.530
He was one of those
people I grew up with.

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:22.180
And I always wondered why
the covers of "Jimmy Olsen"

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.130
and a couple of the
books were so much better

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:25.340
than the insides.

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.210
And then I discovered all
the covers were done by Kurt.

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:31.900
Great artist, and it was
so much fun to do it.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.480
SPEAKER 1: That's awesome.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:36.680
So, Paul, I wanted to
ask about "Superman"

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.900
the animated series, because it
seems like for a lot of fans,

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.872
he's the definitive
version of Superman.

00:20:42.872 --> 00:20:45.330
So what do you think makes him
distinct from other versions

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:46.820
of the Man of Steel?

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.570
PAUL DINI: Well, with
the animated series,

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:53.100
we were lucky in that we had
such an incredible wealth

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:57.930
and history of material to
draw from, from Superman's

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:02.100
various incarnations, from
comic books, from radio shows,

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:02.940
from comic strips.

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:07.170
Everything that he is in the
public mind we distilled down

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:14.110
into what we felt was a
universal telling of his story.

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:19.080
And we were able to concentrate
on him as Superman and Clark

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:26.760
Kent and also expand his cast
so it included the Kents back

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.310
at the farm, and
Lois, and Jimmy,

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:30.670
and do a take on all of them.

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.780
So it really grew beyond
Superman to being a show

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.780
that you really enjoyed
all his characters and all

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.460
the extended cast.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.260
And it was fun to--

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:43.740
I know there have been
other animated versions.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.820
And those characters were
certainly a part of it.

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:50.160
But in this case, we were really
able to draw from the work that

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:57.010
had gone before and make
Lois and Darkseid and Lana,

00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:01.350
fun versions that, I think, were
unique to the animated series

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:05.070
but also rang true to
the fans in general.

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:07.690
And also, Superman
himself was just--

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:08.620
he was a joy to write.

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:09.810
At first, I was
wondering, how am I

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:11.280
going to write this character?

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.860
Because he doesn't
have the moodiness

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:15.210
and the dark side of Batman.

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:18.810
But he is an incredibly
likable character,

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:21.310
both as Clark and as Superman.

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:26.040
And it's fun, perhaps,
making him maybe

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.530
a little lower on the power
scale than he was in the comics

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:31.780
so that he was able to wrestle
with things a little bit more.

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:36.090
So it was more of a
matter of mind over matter

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:38.370
than just brawn, even though
you can show everything

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:39.390
in a cartoon.

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:41.760
He was a challenge to write,
and it was a lot of fun.

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.162
And I think people
picked up on that fun.

00:22:44.162 --> 00:22:45.620
SPEAKER 1: So now
I want to move on

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:50.310
to my favorite part of the
talk, which is villains.

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:53.070
What do you think are or what
do you think are the most

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:56.022
interesting Superman villains?

00:22:56.022 --> 00:22:57.980
And we have the
obvious, obviously.

00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:59.370
But-- Lex.

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:00.960
[CHUCKLES] That's my favorite.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.330
DAN JURGENS: Yeah,
I like Lex a lot.

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:08.190
I mean, I could do a three-year
Lex Luthor series easily.

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:09.870
I think there is that.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:13.400
I was also always intrigued by
Toyman, for whatever reason,

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.670
just because it was so counter
to who Superman is, right?

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:19.290
I mean, here's this guy--

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.090
and that was always a
problem Superman had,

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:22.260
which was villains.

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.652
I mean, if you look throughout
the history of Superman,

00:23:24.652 --> 00:23:26.860
there was always a problem
with some of the villains.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.610
But I found Toyman to
be strangely intriguing,

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:33.000
just because he was so different
than Superman, which was here's

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.270
a guy who makes toys.

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:37.740
How can he possibly be
a threat to Superman?

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.470
How does that story not
end on page one, right?

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:41.640
Superman shows up.

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:42.790
Boom, you're gone.

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:44.640
The story is over.

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.760
So I was always intrigued
by that level of villain

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:51.045
and how you could possibly
make it work with Superman.

00:23:51.045 --> 00:23:52.670
SPEAKER 1: I didn't
expect that answer.

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:53.100
Thank you.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:53.440
That's great.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:53.610
DAN JURGENS: Sure.

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:54.460
BRIAN MICHAEL
BENDIS: Yeah, Toyman

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:55.804
shows up in my second issue.

00:23:55.804 --> 00:23:56.720
I couldn't believe it.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:56.920
DAN JURGENS: See, you get it.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:57.500
You get it, yeah.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:58.825
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: But I
couldn't believe it, either.

00:23:58.825 --> 00:23:59.741
I couldn't believe it.

00:23:59.741 --> 00:24:03.370
I go, my subconscious put it in.

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:05.604
And as I'm consciously
writing it, I go--

00:24:05.604 --> 00:24:06.270
DAN JURGENS: OK.

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:06.840
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
--it must happen.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.500
We agree.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:07.730
DAN JURGENS: Yeah.

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:08.972
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: Yeah.

00:24:08.972 --> 00:24:09.930
SPEAKER 1: Anyone else?

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:13.050
PAUL DINI: I always liked the--

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:15.630
with Lex Luthor,
there was something

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:18.600
I always found rather poignant
with their relationship

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:24.090
in thinking about the character,
in that Lex is someone who has

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:26.580
basically had to buy affection.

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:30.090
Like, he put himself on
the scale in Metropolis,

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:32.160
where he is beneficence.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:38.310
And he has created all these
great scientific advances.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:41.310
And I'm sure his name is on
a lot of public buildings.

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:44.100
And I'm sure he is
lauded wherever he goes.

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.820
But that wouldn't happen unless
he was paying for it, unless he

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:51.030
was going out there and
buying affection, as it was,

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:54.175
with his inventions and
with the things he does.

00:24:54.175 --> 00:24:56.550
And there is Superman, who
just does it out of his heart.

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:58.590
And people flock to him.

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:03.570
And I think that galls Luthor
on a deeply soulful level.

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:05.940
And it's like, I have
to do all this just

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.860
to get a friendly hello.

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:10.680
And he rescues a cat out of
a tree, and I'm forgotten.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.710
And I think that, in a lot
of ways, spurs on his hatred.

00:25:16.602 --> 00:25:18.060
MARV WOLFMAN: I
like the characters

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.630
who can out-think Superman.

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:23.237
I'm not really into
the big punchy guys

00:25:23.237 --> 00:25:25.320
because you're not going
to be able to defeat him.

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:29.850
The beauty of what you did was
that he was finally meeting

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:31.480
a character who could do that.

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:34.410
But in the past, if Luthor
put on a super suit,

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:35.834
or somebody else
attacked him, he

00:25:35.834 --> 00:25:37.250
could physically
take care of you.

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:38.790
So that's not interesting.

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:42.870
What I like is the characters
who out-think because that's

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:44.700
not Superman's superpower.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:46.830
He's smart, but he's not Luthor.

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:49.920
He's not Brainiac.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:53.160
And those characters, to
me, are far more interesting

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.290
because they match
Superman in ways

00:25:55.290 --> 00:26:00.730
that Superman doesn't
deal with the best.

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:04.440
He has to go out of his
way and find some way

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.770
to deal with them that's
not in his comfort zone.

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:13.585
So to me, Brainiac and Luthor
are the strongest characters.

00:26:13.585 --> 00:26:14.960
BRIAN MICHAEL
BENDIS: And we have

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.780
some new villains coming up.

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:19.790
Starting in Action
#1000, it's the debut

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:22.760
of a big new villain
for Superman,

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.220
because I agree with Dan.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:29.480
As good as the good villains
are, there are good villains.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.500
And then there are some others.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:32.960
But it's not enough.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.420
Compared to, like,
Spider-Man or Batman,

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.150
he doesn't have nearly the
rogues gallery that he should

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:40.760
have, compared to his legacy.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.310
So we're going to be as
additive as possible.

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:45.510
And starting right
away with Action

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:50.660
#1000 is this new villain who
knows something about Superman

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:54.440
and the history of Superman
that Superman does not know.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:59.030
And that's going to really
challenge him, both spiritually

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:00.230
and physically.

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:03.050
And then in the pages
of Action Comics,

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:07.670
we're debuting some criminal
activity in Metropolis

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:10.190
that has been going on
right under Superman's nose.

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:13.340
There is a criminal
who has no ego.

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.530
Like, Lex has a lot of ego.

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:19.740
I need Superman to acknowledge
that I did this, you know?

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:24.710
And imagine a criminal that
is inspired by Lex Luthor

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:28.760
and excited by, yeah, Lex, you
go get Superman's attention

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:29.750
as much as you want.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:31.250
Go get Daddy's attention.

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:33.740
And we're going to run
our business like adults.

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:35.390
And I don't need
Superman's attention.

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:36.770
And I don't need any of it.

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:39.110
And what kind of criminal
empire can you build right

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:40.370
under Superman's nose?

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:43.894
How smart do you have
to be to do this,

00:27:43.894 --> 00:27:46.310
and it's been going on for
years, and he didn't even know?

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:49.435
So that's what we're going to
be doing coming in the future.

00:27:49.435 --> 00:27:50.060
SPEAKER 1: Wow.

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:50.810
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: Yeah.

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:52.650
SPEAKER 1: So you've
got to pick that up.

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:53.420
So no names?

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:54.810
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: That was
my point, if I wasn't clear.

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:55.690
[CHUCKLING]

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:56.570
PAUL DINI: Yeah.

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:58.610
SPEAKER 1: Trying to
sell comics here, guys.

00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:59.600
So no names?

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.040
You can't spoil the name yet?

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.540
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
Well, the name

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:06.320
of the big villain in Action
#1000 is named Rogol Zar.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:12.110
And this is an alien that's
coming to Earth with an agenda.

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:15.110
The first part of the name
is named after my doctor,

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:16.320
who saved my life.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.250
I had a big thing last December.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:20.720
I had a MRSA infection.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.520
And every day, I would hear her.

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.892
This German woman would
come in and work on my face.

00:28:24.892 --> 00:28:25.850
But I couldn't see her.

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:26.660
I was blind.

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:28.640
And I'd hear this
name, Rogol, every day.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.014
And then I'd go,
she's definitely

00:28:30.014 --> 00:28:31.490
going to be the villain.

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:33.860
And I couldn't wait to
tell her as soon as I--

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:36.082
and then I told her when
I was finally awake.

00:28:36.082 --> 00:28:38.540
And I go, I think I'm going to
use your name as the villain

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:40.100
in the new Superman books.

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:41.240
And she went, uh-huh.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.773
And then I realized I never told
her what I did for a living.

00:28:44.773 --> 00:28:47.020
Like, and so it just sounded
like an insane person.

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:49.070
And then she Googled me
and then the next day

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:52.319
came in very excited
that she may actually

00:28:52.319 --> 00:28:53.360
be in the Superman books.

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.070
DAN JURGENS: And
can I just say how

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:57.500
cool it is you work
in a Google plug?

00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:57.770
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: I did.

00:28:57.770 --> 00:28:58.370
DAN JURGENS: Yeah, you did.

00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:59.560
PAUL DINI: Yeah, you
definitely did that.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:00.610
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: Do
I get free Google now?

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:01.360
DAN JURGENS: Yeah.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:01.860
[CHUCKLING]

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.110
SPEAKER 1: I didn't know that.

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:04.370
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: Yeah.

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:05.510
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:09.560
OK, so do you guys prefer
to think about Superman

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.320
as the last survivor
of Krypton or as part

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.940
of an extended
family of survivors

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:18.464
that includes Zod, Supergirl,
his dog Krypto, et cetera?

00:29:18.464 --> 00:29:19.880
DAN JURGENS:
Somewhere in between.

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:20.760
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:24.770
DAN JURGENS: I think that
one of the nicest titles that

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:27.260
can be ascribed to Superman
is last son of Krypton.

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:29.925
I just love that because it
is so heavy with implication.

00:29:29.925 --> 00:29:31.550
MARV WOLFMAN: Yeah,
the responsibility.

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:33.610
DAN JURGENS: Right, exactly.

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:37.340
It describes him and his
background so well, just

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:38.840
last son of Krypton.

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.760
And so I really like that.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.860
And it's like, OK,
Supergirl, fine.

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:44.450
But there comes a
point where it gets

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:47.390
kind of too much because
then that invalidates

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:49.140
the last son of Krypton idea.

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:52.220
So I say it's like in the
middle somewhere, little more

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.600
towards just a handful.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:57.520
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: What would
you label the horse, Streaky--

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.700
Streaky the Super Horse?

00:29:58.700 --> 00:29:59.950
DAN JURGENS: As the
idea that probably

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:00.790
shouldn't be in the book.

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:01.045
MARV WOLFMAN: Comic.

00:30:01.045 --> 00:30:02.010
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
The Super Horse, yeah.

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:02.415
DAN JURGENS: Yeah, comic.

00:30:02.415 --> 00:30:03.270
Streaky's the cat.

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:03.660
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
Streaky's the cat.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:04.880
I apologize.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:05.710
Again, I'm new.

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:06.630
DAN JURGENS: Yeah.

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:07.630
PAUL DINI: Beppo's the monkey.

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:07.930
DAN JURGENS: Yes.

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:09.221
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: Yeah, OK.

00:30:11.031 --> 00:30:12.280
They're Googling it right now.

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.480
Yeah, that's all real stuff.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.000
DAN JURGENS: Yeah.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.150
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: Everything
we just said is real stuff.

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:17.510
SPEAKER 1: There's a couple
of people here, they're like--

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:19.160
true nerds are
like, you got to--

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.820
OK, so, Paul, in "Superman--

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:24.670
Peace on Earth," Superman
confronts the limits of his

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:28.360
powers, not in the form of
an all-powerful super villain

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:31.870
but against a very
real problem--

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:32.830
world hunger.

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:35.620
Why did you choose to
test Superman this way?

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:38.320
PAUL DINI: Well, when
Alex Ross and I came up

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.930
with a story for that,
we wanted to tell

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:43.210
a story that was very
close to Superman's heart

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:44.560
and also to his origins.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:48.490
We didn't really want to do
the ultimate punch-up with Lex

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:50.200
or Brainiac or
anything like that.

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:54.820
We wanted to go back to Superman
at his most human level,

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:58.480
and also do a story that speaks
to his origin as a farmer

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.600
because he goes back
to that at the end,

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:06.520
at least as a touchstone
at the end of that story.

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.190
But it was also kind
of we put ourselves

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:11.830
in the position of what
if we were Superman?

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:13.270
I think everybody
has fantasized,

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:14.353
I want to put on the cape.

00:31:14.353 --> 00:31:18.590
And I want to solve all
of humanity's problems.

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:20.900
And once we looked at it
from that point of view,

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:24.100
it was like, OK, then we're
dealing in a real world,

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:26.230
with real people, with
other countries that

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:28.270
have other agendas.

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:32.750
And the ideals of Superman don't
always work in the real world.

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:37.270
I mean, it gets to be
too human, too selfish.

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:40.370
And what does he do in
a situation like that?

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:42.520
If he goes out to
eliminate that,

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:46.930
then he becomes a god, a
monster, or a dictator.

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:49.300
And he's got to
take a step back.

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:52.840
And even though what he's trying
to do is set a good example

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:55.700
and be altruistic, all
he can do is suggest.

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:57.790
And all he can do is
lead in small ways.

00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:59.890
He can't solve the big problems.

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:02.560
When a dam is busting or when
aliens invade, that's great.

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:06.880
But on a real human level, when
it comes to give and receive,

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.590
he's just as human as all of us.

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:12.940
And that was something
that was really important

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:14.742
for us to touch on that.

00:32:14.742 --> 00:32:16.470
SPEAKER 1: That's great.

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:20.240
Marv, I heard you got
lucky as a young man

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.510
while touring the DC
office and received

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:24.880
an unpublished Superman story.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.170
Can you talk about that?

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:27.670
And is it true that
it's about to be

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:29.800
published for the first
time in "Action Comics--

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.370
80 Years of Superman"?

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:33.850
MARV WOLFMAN:
Yeah, the DC Comics

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:38.440
used to have a tour every
week of the DC offices.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.505
And I went to high
school about four

00:32:40.505 --> 00:32:42.630
or five blocks away-- high
school of art and design

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:45.460
because my intent was
to become an artist.

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.720
So I would run over
there and go on the tours

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:48.610
when I was able to.

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:52.550
One of the times
that I was going

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:57.050
there, Sol Harrison, who was the
production chief at the time--

00:32:57.050 --> 00:33:02.650
later became publisher-- was
wheeling out a post-office

00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:03.350
cart--

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:05.050
one of these things
that's about--

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:10.370
oops-- six, seven feet
wide, six, seven feet long,

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:14.690
four feet wide, four feet
high, filled with artwork

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:18.080
from the 1940s, all of
which was being written off.

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.760
It was never published.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.100
And they were finally
trying to clear space.

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:24.317
And he was taking it
to the incinerators.

00:33:24.317 --> 00:33:25.400
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: Ugh.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.025
SPEAKER 1: Ugh.

00:33:26.025 --> 00:33:28.874
MARV WOLFMAN: Now, you've got
to remember, it's horrifying,

00:33:28.874 --> 00:33:31.040
even the concept of that
and some of the other stuff

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.000
that was done.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.480
But back then, not even the
artist wanted their art back.

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.640
To most of those people,
most of the artists--

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.170
because I've spoken to them--

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:43.190
they wanted to
clear their offices.

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:46.732
It was giant stacks of paper
that had no value, as far

00:33:46.732 --> 00:33:47.690
as they were concerned.

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:51.130
It took the fans-- it
took those of us here

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:54.590
and the fans from my generation
to say this work had value.

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:55.810
This work was special.

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:57.620
Anyway, he's wheeling
this stuff out.

00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:00.620
And there's three or
four people on the tour.

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.480
And he says, if you
kids want anything,

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.540
grab it before I take
it to the incinerator.

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:11.300
Like Uncle Scrooge, we dove
into the money vault, swam

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:14.480
through the pages, grabbed
everything we could.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.190
Did not take the
rest of the tour

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:18.290
because we were weighed
down with artwork.

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:20.389
And this is the 1940s artwork.

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:23.690
So it's a lot larger than
the artwork that most of you

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:27.530
may be familiar with that
you see at conventions.

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:30.460
We rushed downstairs
and started trading.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:34.370
And I noticed that
I had 8 or 9 pages

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:38.239
of a 12-page story that was all
written off a Superman story.

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:43.580
And I started trading multiple
pages to get the last three.

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:45.420
So I walked out of there.

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:49.370
I took a cab at,
like, 13 years old.

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:52.699
I had to get a cab--
because it was so heavy--

00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:54.980
with a complete Superman
story, as well as

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.630
a whole bunch of other stuff.

00:34:56.630 --> 00:35:00.400
And it never saw print.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.820
It never had.

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:05.510
When they were putting
together the "Action Comics--

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:10.367
80 Years of Superman"
Deluxe Edition, Paul Levitz,

00:35:10.367 --> 00:35:12.950
who used to be publisher-- he's
now working with them in other

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:14.120
ways--

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.430
asked if he could print it.

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:17.600
And I said, absolutely.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.040
This is the perfect place.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.442
It's the only place that
I would have said yes to.

00:35:22.442 --> 00:35:23.650
And you'll be able to see it.

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:26.510
They left it in black and white
because it was never published.

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:27.770
It was never colored.

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:29.660
And they didn't want
to color it now.

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:31.576
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
Why wasn't it published?

00:35:31.576 --> 00:35:32.420
Do you know why?

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:36.600
MARV WOLFMAN: They had thousands
of pages of unpublished stuff.

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:43.280
Now, the artwork was done in
1946, written by Jerry Siegel,

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.410
drawn by the Joe
Shuster Studios.

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:49.460
That we know because Paul Levitz
was able to find the bills.

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:51.070
DC has everything.

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:55.450
But they found that.

00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:57.500
Why it wasn't published
back then, I don't know.

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:58.257
But it never was.

00:35:58.257 --> 00:36:00.590
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: Was it,
like, filthy or something?

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:01.045
MARV WOLFMAN: No.

00:36:01.045 --> 00:36:03.545
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: It was
like a completely inappropriate

00:36:03.545 --> 00:36:04.580
Superman.

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:07.730
MARV WOLFMAN: It was as weird
as all the stories from 1940s

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:08.360
were.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:14.970
But two years later,
in 1947 or '48,

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:18.630
we found a new version of
that story, drawn by Wayne

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:21.120
Boring, now a 10-page story.

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.740
So for some reason, they
decided not to publish it

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:26.940
but then reused the script,
only cleaning it up or fixing it

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:27.990
up a little bit better.

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.560
BRIAN MICHAEL
BENDIS: Fascinating.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.480
MARV WOLFMAN: So for
the first time ever,

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.920
the story is going to see print.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.810
And it couldn't be in a
better book than that one.

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:36.230
So I'm really pleased about it.

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.635
PAUL DINI: Right.

00:36:36.635 --> 00:36:37.635
SPEAKER 1: That's great.

00:36:37.635 --> 00:36:38.960
I'm jealous.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.610
So we're, unfortunately,
almost running out of time,

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:43.930
and we want to get some
audience questions going.

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:45.990
So as a last quick
general question,

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:48.930
what are your favorite
Superman stories?

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:49.930
It can be one you wrote.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.300
DAN JURGENS: I am really bad
at issue numbers and everything

00:36:58.300 --> 00:36:58.799
else.

00:36:58.799 --> 00:37:02.230
But there is a story that--
we had earlier mentioned Wayne

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:03.160
Boring--

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.190
where Superman goes
back to Krypton.

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:07.482
And it must've been
a late-'50s story.

00:37:07.482 --> 00:37:08.440
Help me out here, Marv.

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.220
MARV WOLFMAN: Yes, it is.

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:09.370
DAN JURGENS: You know
what the story is.

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:10.390
Yeah, "Superman's
Return to Krypton"

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:11.260
was the title of the story.

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:12.593
MARV WOLFMAN: Go to the old guy.

00:37:12.593 --> 00:37:13.610
DAN JURGENS: Yeah.

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:14.776
MARV WOLFMAN: He'd remember.

00:37:14.776 --> 00:37:15.580
DAN JURGENS: Yeah.

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:17.455
It was called "Superman's
Return to Krypton."

00:37:17.455 --> 00:37:19.000
And I remember
reading it as a kid.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.680
And it just struck me because
it was a very sad story.

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.560
Superman gets to
go back to Krypton.

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:26.200
He sees what a
beautiful place it was.

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.660
And it was also this
story about discovery.

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:32.014
It was stuff that he didn't
know about where he came from.

00:37:32.014 --> 00:37:33.430
And I think,
ultimately, we're all

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:36.130
curious about where we
came from and stories

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:39.340
we never would have heard as a
kid, like your crazy old aunt

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:42.050
never told you until
you were 35 or whatever.

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:44.140
So there was something
about that that I still

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:47.540
find very poignant to this day,
and a story that was really,

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.610
I think, kind of ahead of its
time for when it appeared.

00:37:53.445 --> 00:37:55.820
MARV WOLFMAN: For me, I'd also
go back to about that time

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:59.030
period because I would not
talk about anything I did.

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:03.330
Someone else could, I hope.

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:04.830
SPEAKER 1: No pressure.

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:07.580
MARV WOLFMAN: The original
"Death of Superman,"

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:10.040
which was an amazing story
written by Jerry Siegel,

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:12.960
the creator of
Superman in the '60s--

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.800
late '50s, early
'60s, something--

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.640
where Superman dies.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:21.800
And the story was
amazingly effective

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.926
because he actually dies in it.

00:38:24.926 --> 00:38:26.610
It's a great, great story.

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:27.840
And I remember it as a kid.

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:32.937
And even now, if I read
it, it still is emotional.

00:38:32.937 --> 00:38:34.520
There were a lot of
stories back then.

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:37.850
More modern times,
"All Star Superman"

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:41.780
by Grant Morrison I thought was
a really good Superman story.

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:43.160
Again, from left field--

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.960
those are the type
of stories I like.

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:50.070
And also "Superman for All
Seasons," by Jeph Loeb.

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:51.980
I thought that was a
really solid story that

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:54.830
took you in a different
place for Superman.

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:58.730
There's been so many Superman
stories done over 80 years.

00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:02.647
It's nice when someone finds
a new tack to writing him.

00:39:02.647 --> 00:39:03.355
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:39:03.355 --> 00:39:04.896
PAUL DINI: And I'll
go with "Whatever

00:39:04.896 --> 00:39:06.646
Happened to the Man
of Tomorrow?" by Alan.

00:39:06.646 --> 00:39:07.937
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: Oh, yeah.

00:39:07.937 --> 00:39:09.590
PAUL DINI: All right,
you get that one.

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:11.330
I'll take the first
Mxyzptlk story.

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:13.010
I mean, I love the little jerk.

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:16.820
And looking at that
very first one, where

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:19.790
he's this little weird
Elmer Fudd flying man,

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:23.010
I just thought, this is
the fun side of Superman.

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:25.760
And I loved that story--
not every story with him.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:29.900
But I always liked the
idea that in some way,

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.450
he is to Superman what
Superman is to us.

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:34.280
Superman's an advanced creature.

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.910
Then one step beyond--
a few dimensions beyond

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:39.020
is this strange
godlike creature that

00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:43.790
can either be fun or amusing or
else be absolutely terrifying.

00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:45.350
And then I'm sort of intrigued.

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:46.460
What's beyond him?

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:48.620
What's in the dimensions--
what scares him?

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.994
And I always liked
that relationship.

00:39:51.994 --> 00:39:53.660
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
Mine was "Whatever

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:55.110
Happened to the
Man of Tomorrow?"

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:59.300
which was Alan Moore's, like,
last testament of Superman

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:02.947
but before crisis and you
tearing everything up.

00:40:02.947 --> 00:40:04.280
MARV WOLFMAN: I killed them all.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:07.500
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
And that one was--

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:10.570
I think, the first time, like,
there was genuine emotion.

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:14.210
Like, you felt like
there's loss happening.

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:18.450
And "Superman #400" is
this anniversary issue.

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:21.710
And it's one of these great
moments in comics where they

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:25.670
literally found, like, who would
be the most insane, coolest

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:27.084
people to write
and draw Superman

00:40:27.084 --> 00:40:28.250
that you could ever imagine?

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:31.840
People not even from the world
of traditional superheroes.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:34.540
They have Steve Ditko do
Superman, and Moebius,

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:36.020
and Brian Bolland.

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:39.410
And it's just this celebration
of stories and artwork.

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:40.530
And it rattled me.

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:43.520
And when I was offered,
like, "Action #1000," which

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:48.200
is in the same vein of
that, I was, oh yeah,

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.730
I have to be part of that.

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:52.490
But if you ever get a
chance, it's "Superman #400."

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:54.940
It also comes with a
Superman portfolio.

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.510
So you get, like,
a large version

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:58.790
of all these beautiful
images of Superman.

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:02.000
And it just-- everything you'd
ever want out of the Superman

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.230
experience right there.

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:05.510
And the first Superman
movie, Richard Donner.

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:07.910
Just showed my
5-year-old son the movie,

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:10.190
thinking he wouldn't make
about 10 minutes into it.

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:11.780
Like, I thought he'd bail.

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:12.770
Riveted.

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:15.080
Couldn't take his
eyes off of the movie.

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:17.162
So it's a great experience.

00:41:17.162 --> 00:41:17.870
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:20.936
So who wants to go first?

00:41:20.936 --> 00:41:21.522
Oh.

00:41:21.522 --> 00:41:23.230
I'm going to throw
this to you awkwardly.

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:23.700
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:24.408
I'll [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:24.408 --> 00:41:25.880
SPEAKER 1: So here it goes.

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:26.960
BRIAN MICHAEL
BENDIS: What is that?

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.043
AUDIENCE: That is awkward.

00:41:28.043 --> 00:41:32.450
SPEAKER 1: That is the way we
ask Google questions awkwardly

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:34.220
because we like to
embarrass people.

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.000
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: All right.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.833
AUDIENCE: We like to
really embarrass people

00:41:36.833 --> 00:41:38.090
who can't throw, specifically.

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:38.715
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:41:38.715 --> 00:41:39.860
[CHUCKLES]

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:41.720
AUDIENCE: So my
question for you guys

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:44.330
is, how do you deal
with considering

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:47.570
how long the Superman
comic has been around,

00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:50.000
how do you deal with
keeping it consistent

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.280
and not conflicting
inside of itself?

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.970
Like, did you have to consider
that when you're writing?

00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:59.090
Or is there somebody who
reads it later and says,

00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:01.611
you totally can't say
that because it really

00:42:01.611 --> 00:42:03.110
conflicts with this
other thing that

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:04.700
was said like 30 years ago?

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:06.620
Or does it just
kind of work out?

00:42:09.161 --> 00:42:11.660
DAN JURGENS: Well, I was lucky
because when I first started,

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:15.380
Superman had had a new starting
point, where they just said,

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:17.240
OK, we're starting clean.

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:21.710
And that was John Byrne
and Marv and Jerry Ordway

00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:23.900
who relaunched the franchise.

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:26.120
So I was fortunate enough
to be able to come on

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.950
and say we had a
fairly clean slate.

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:31.300
And I think that's
important to do.

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:34.860
It's only fair because
to strictly adhere

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:37.700
to 80 years of
publishing history

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:41.840
is really, really hard to
do and totally impractical,

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:43.310
I might add, I think.

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:45.320
MARV WOLFMAN: I
think if you worry

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:47.690
about making sure
every story fits

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:55.400
into some place in continuity,
you're not able to expand out.

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:59.030
The box that you're in keeps
getting smaller and smaller.

00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:01.610
I think you have to take
the spirit of the character,

00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:05.360
the idea of the character, and
the approach of what you're

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.490
trying to do to
tell more stories,

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:10.470
and not worry about every
little detail of the past.

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:11.960
It's fiction.

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.870
No one's going to come and
say, that's not what happened.

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:15.370
I was there.

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:15.850
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
Yes, they will.

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:16.530
That's what Twitter [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:16.800
AUDIENCE: Are you sure?

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:17.105
MARV WOLFMAN: Yeah.

00:43:17.105 --> 00:43:17.650
AUDIENCE: I'm pretty sure--

00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:17.960
SPEAKER 1: That's the internet.

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.370
AUDIENCE: --people at
Comic-Con probably would.

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:20.786
BRIAN MICHAEL
BENDIS: Yeah, what I

00:43:20.786 --> 00:43:23.390
do is I ignore everyone else's
work and just barrel ahead

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.890
straight.

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:25.140
And it works out great for me.

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:26.807
MARV WOLFMAN: That's
already on Twitter.

00:43:26.807 --> 00:43:27.931
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: Yeah.

00:43:27.931 --> 00:43:28.440
Honestly--

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:29.570
MARV WOLFMAN: Brian says--

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:30.611
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: No.

00:43:30.611 --> 00:43:31.910
You know what the key is?

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:34.252
You live like how you're living.

00:43:34.252 --> 00:43:35.210
You live in the moment.

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:36.200
You live in the now.

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:38.170
Like you, yourself,
you live in the moment.

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:40.900
You're not sitting there
living your continuity that

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:41.880
brought you to this--

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.490
I'm not sitting here with a big
thought balloon over my head,

00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:46.580
thinking about what happened
to me in the eighth grade that

00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:47.330
led me here.

00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:49.160
It's in the moment.

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.620
And when things happen
that relate to your past,

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:54.360
then you bring them up
when they're appropriate.

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:58.670
But it's a trap that comic book
writers can get sucked into,

00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:00.410
where you think you
have to acknowledge

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:04.070
everything that ever happened to
this character at every moment.

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:08.000
Or if, like I said,
like, if I tell my wife

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.200
I loved her today--

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:09.860
wait a second.

00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:13.210
35 years ago, you told a girl
in high school you loved her.

00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:17.640
Like, that's how comic book
fans sometimes act at you.

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.090
Like, wait a minute.

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:22.150
Like, well, yeah, that was
true then, and it's true here.

00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:23.000
So anyway.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.690
SPEAKER 1: Is that how you
reply to Twitter followers?

00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:27.890
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
No, I ignore it.

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:30.340
No, it's part of the game.

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:33.290
I actually like the
part of the game where

00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:34.490
they go, hey, wait a minute.

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:36.470
I'm the resident
expert of Superman.

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:38.540
And I'm about to tell you
what you've done wrong.

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:40.320
I like being there for them.

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:41.180
[LAUGHING]

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:41.860
No, I do.

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:43.631
Like, I was writing "X-Men."

00:44:43.631 --> 00:44:45.130
And someone who's
read every "X-Men"

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:46.730
wants to come give
me the business--

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:48.244
what a great time
they're having.

00:44:48.244 --> 00:44:50.160
They've read all their
comics, and now they're

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.118
giving me the business.

00:44:51.118 --> 00:44:53.600
Anyway.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.390
AUDIENCE: My question was,
one of my favorite iterations

00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:59.270
of Superman is when he shows up
in a "Justice League America"

00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:01.580
episode where it's
Bizarro World.

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:04.640
And essentially, all of the
Justice League characters

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:08.690
are evil versions of themselves,
or at least morally defunct

00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:10.090
versions of themselves.

00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:13.970
And in that episode, Superman
lobotomizes Darkseid.

00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:16.940
And I guess my
question is, that was

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:18.920
one of my favorite
iterations of Superman

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.590
because it showed
how hope fails.

00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:26.160
Like, hope does diminish
after a period of time.

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:29.390
And that was kind of what that
Bizarro Justice League was

00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:31.280
the amalgamation
of, was their world

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:34.700
had gone to such a dark point
that they just said, screw it.

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:37.550
We're just going to start
lobotomizing the enemy, right?

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:39.590
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: Well, it
depends what you're hoping for.

00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:41.030
Like, if you're
hoping for a lobotomy,

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:42.196
it was a very hopeful story.

00:45:42.196 --> 00:45:43.580
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:46.640
I guess my question is, is like,
that really resonated with me

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:49.760
because as real human
beings dealing with the day

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:52.400
to day, we do lose hope,
even in the small things

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.710
and sometimes very
easily in the big things.

00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:56.210
And so that really
resonated with me

00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:58.400
that, like, somebody as,
like you guys were saying,

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:01.730
a symbol of hope like Superman,
that in that iteration

00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:03.345
of his story, he just quickly--

00:46:03.345 --> 00:46:05.720
and, like, I think it's the
Batman from the regular world

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:06.620
sees that happening.

00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:09.905
And he's like, holy sh-- like,
he's lobotomizing people.

00:46:09.905 --> 00:46:11.780
We really have something
to worry about here.

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:13.470
Like, this is a serious threat.

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:15.380
Do you guys ever see
Superman going back

00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:17.171
in a direction like
that, where his hope is

00:46:17.171 --> 00:46:20.330
so on the hairline,
where he's dealing

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:23.690
with something that the world
itself or, like, the city

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:26.420
or even other superheroes
look to him and worry,

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:29.480
because if he loses hope, not
only is it a symbol of hope

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:31.520
crashing, but he might
really be something

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:32.780
to worry about himself?

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:33.310
PAUL DINI: Well, I think--

00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:34.430
AUDIENCE: And that was
really kind of cool to me.

00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:36.971
PAUL DINI: I think stories like
that are important because it

00:46:36.971 --> 00:46:40.760
gives the heroes from the
real world-- our world--

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:44.510
a mirror to what could happen
if they do cross that line.

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:47.750
And it's like "It's a
Wonderful Life," where

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:52.100
you see what his life
could be like if he did,

00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:53.730
in fact, lose hope.

00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:56.715
I think with Superman, the
challenge is there to make sure

00:46:56.715 --> 00:46:58.340
that he never loses
that because that's

00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:00.740
what makes him different
from everybody else.

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:01.870
That's the ultimate test.

00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:05.930
It's to keep that hope alive for
everybody else and for himself.

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:07.040
MARV WOLFMAN: Yeah.

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:10.900
That's, Paul, one
of a two-part story.

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:13.220
AUDIENCE: I mean, I've
seen [INAUDIBLE] episode.

00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:14.620
But it still was brilliant.

00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:15.729
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
Good answer, by the way.

00:47:15.729 --> 00:47:16.479
DAN JURGENS: Yeah.

00:47:16.479 --> 00:47:18.723
[CHUCKLING]

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:23.330
AUDIENCE: So I
really love Superman.

00:47:23.330 --> 00:47:25.790
He was my first favorite
superhero as a kid.

00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:29.120
So this is a really
cool talk for me.

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:32.450
So my question is, one of
the things that I think

00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:35.600
makes Superman more
challenging in some ways

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:39.440
is that he doesn't have some
of that internal conflict

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:42.710
that you see in a Batman or
a Spider-Man or something,

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:44.750
where he's really,
really struggling

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:48.120
with his own insecurities
in a lot of places.

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:50.780
And I think there have been a
lot of really interesting takes

00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:55.100
on that over the years,
from, Paul, when you brought

00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:57.170
up earlier Superman
confronting, like,

00:47:57.170 --> 00:48:00.260
a real-world situation
where his powers don't apply

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:01.790
or things like that.

00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:06.170
And so I was curious,
without that level

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:12.470
of internal conflict, what
is your favorite way that you

00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:17.810
or somebody else has approached
that kind of thing, of finding

00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:22.310
a conflict, finding a challenge
for Superman that's not related

00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:24.290
to that internal struggle?

00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:28.100
MARV WOLFMAN: Well,
for me, I think

00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:31.070
what you do with Superman
is his internal conflict is

00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:37.080
about what is the best way
of solving this problem?

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.770
How do I do it with the
least collateral damage?

00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:42.560
How do I create a
situation that makes

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:47.480
this work, rather than, oh, Lois
didn't want to date me tonight.

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:49.880
That's a very different
type of thing.

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:54.050
His problems deal
with how to do his job

00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:55.910
and how to do it the
best way possible,

00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:57.920
because he is only a person.

00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:59.160
He may have a lot of powers.

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:00.230
But he's only a person.

00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:02.960
And he's going to have questions
on is he doing the right thing.

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:04.170
How do I do it?

00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:05.780
How do I make it work?

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:10.100
And he's going to keep trying
to find the best way that nobody

00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:13.010
gets hurt in the process.

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:15.170
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
Yeah, I found myself

00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:18.020
looking for my
relatability with Superman.

00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:23.191
And the one internal struggle
I found for myself is I'm

00:49:23.191 --> 00:49:23.690
a father.

00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:24.619
I have four kids.

00:49:24.619 --> 00:49:25.410
I have little kids.

00:49:25.410 --> 00:49:26.450
I have big kids.

00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:30.110
And one of the hardest
things for me for parenting

00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:33.410
is you have to be on
your game all day.

00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:36.301
You can't-- today, I'm going
to just be the worst version

00:49:36.301 --> 00:49:36.800
of myself.

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.758
No, you have to be the
best version of yourself

00:49:38.758 --> 00:49:41.990
like every day, or
at least try, right?

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:43.450
So you're, like, every day.

00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:45.520
And it could be exhausting.

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:46.159
Like--

00:49:46.159 --> 00:49:47.450
AUDIENCE: I have a 9-month-old.

00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:48.840
So I'm starting to
figure that out.

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:49.670
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
Oh, yeah, well,

00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:52.520
when they can walk and talk, and
they're actually watching you,

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:55.430
like, looking for hypocrisy--
like there's an age at, like, 7

00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:57.742
or 8, where they walk around
the house going, well,

00:49:57.742 --> 00:49:58.700
I didn't get any candy.

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:00.700
I'm going to watch and
see if you get any candy.

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:04.525
And so there's,
like, just general--

00:50:04.525 --> 00:50:06.350
and I see Superman
has to do that.

00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:08.750
He has to be Superman every day.

00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:11.810
You can't just-- today, I'm
going to walk around in my robe

00:50:11.810 --> 00:50:15.960
and-- no, I have to, like,
live up to this every day.

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:18.830
And that's the connection
I feel like as adults,

00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:19.890
we have to live up to a
certain responsibility.

00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:20.405
DAN JURGENS: Oh, yeah.

00:50:20.405 --> 00:50:21.290
PAUL DINI: Yeah, absolutely.

00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:23.664
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: And if
we blow it once, we blew it.

00:50:23.664 --> 00:50:24.350
That's it.

00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:27.350
DAN JURGENS: I've
always had this thing

00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:29.570
for a different
Superman story, where,

00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:32.090
like, if there had
never been a Superman,

00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:33.810
how would you do
it kind of thing.

00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:36.500
And it was we pick up on
Superman when he's, like,

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:37.740
42 years old.

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:41.120
And even at then,
he's barely a myth

00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:44.900
because he was someone
throughout that first 25 years

00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:47.840
of him being Superman, never
revealed himself to the public.

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:50.870
He only ever would have come
out like once every three years

00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:52.850
when the world
demanded it somehow.

00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:54.320
And then ultimately,
the conflict

00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:57.620
would have been exactly when
do you choose to get involved?

00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:59.630
Because that, to
me, is something

00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:00.740
we all face every day.

00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:02.990
How often have we
walked down the street

00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:05.240
and seen something
happening across the street

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:07.910
where we wondered, should
we get involved or not?

00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:10.820
That woman-- she's really kind
of being hard on her child.

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:12.200
Should I go say something?

00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:13.880
That's the conflict
for Superman, which

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:15.590
is when do you get involved?

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:17.240
And exactly how far do you go?

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:19.730
And you mentioned
this earlier, which

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:21.830
is Superman doesn't
tell people what to do.

00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:23.750
He hopes to inspire.

00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:26.120
And so you start to
build around that.

00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:29.210
And there are so many stories
that you can pull out of that.

00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:32.450
So, yeah.

00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:33.840
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:35.020
I obviously have a question.

00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:36.490
But before that, I want
to say, thank you all.

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:38.020
Like, you all have
amazing contributions.

00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:39.686
And nobody says thank
you enough to you.

00:51:39.686 --> 00:51:42.820
So, like, thank every one
of you, like, so much.

00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:45.160
My question kind of
pulls from, like,

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:49.300
Dan's recent storyline in
action around "The Oz Effect."

00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:51.850
Do you think we
deserve Superman?

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:02.230
DAN JURGENS: I sort of wrestle
with that all the time,

00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:07.730
because I think that one of
the things about politics

00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:10.790
right now, without
getting into either party,

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:13.640
is more and more
I ask myself, why

00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.860
would any good person do this?

00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:17.520
Because we punish them.

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:20.720
And I think we see that
across-- whoever signs up

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.790
to run for office
basically knows

00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:25.700
they're going to get nuked
by the other side, right?

00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:28.070
And so I ask myself
that all the time.

00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:30.650
When do we find out
that we do or do not

00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:34.050
deserve someone who is trying
to act on behalf of us?

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:36.552
And I think that's a
fascinating theme to play with.

00:52:36.552 --> 00:52:38.290
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
Well, I'd say yes.

00:52:38.290 --> 00:52:39.060
DAN JURGENS: Yeah,
I would hope so.

00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:39.540
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: Yeah.

00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:40.750
We do deserve it.

00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:42.699
We don't deserve the
opposition research.

00:52:42.699 --> 00:52:43.490
DAN JURGENS: Right.

00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:43.990
Yeah.

00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:46.390
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
But, yeah, we do deserve--

00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:48.930
DAN JURGENS: Yeah, but the
question is, who would step up?

00:52:48.930 --> 00:52:49.720
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
No, absolutely.

00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:51.540
Who would step up,
like finding out

00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:52.830
what you found out this week?

00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:53.160
DAN JURGENS: Yeah.

00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:55.159
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
Like with the analyticals?

00:52:55.159 --> 00:52:57.310
I'm sure you guys are
dealing with that.

00:52:57.310 --> 00:53:00.340
Like, who would want to
put yourself under that?

00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:02.610
Like, that that's
even more intense.

00:53:02.610 --> 00:53:04.440
Like, the first
thing was intense.

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:05.730
This is even more intense.

00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:07.140
So, yeah, I don't know.

00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:09.670
But I'd remove that
from the equation.

00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:12.021
And just someone shows
up and goes, screw it.

00:53:12.021 --> 00:53:13.270
This is the right thing to do.

00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:13.820
I'm going to do it.

00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:13.950
Yeah--

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:14.220
DAN JURGENS: Right.

00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:16.011
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
--we do deserve that.

00:53:16.011 --> 00:53:17.050
DAN JURGENS: Yes.

00:53:17.050 --> 00:53:17.950
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
Paul doesn't think so.

00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:18.892
PAUL DINI: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:18.892 --> 00:53:21.100
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: Paul
thinks we deserve to burn.

00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:22.661
He likes to write the Joker.

00:53:22.661 --> 00:53:23.910
PAUL DINI: A little bit, yeah.

00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:25.630
[CHUCKLING]

00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:27.190
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:28.780
SPEAKER 1: Anyone else?

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:29.450
One more?

00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:32.655
We've got time for one more.

00:53:32.655 --> 00:53:34.030
AUDIENCE: I wanted
to say, I love

00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:36.280
hearing how much you
guys have thought

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:39.160
about the story and
about character,

00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:42.430
and just how deeply
you're invested in that.

00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:46.330
I just really loved
watching that.

00:53:46.330 --> 00:53:50.380
Kind of a little
bit related to that,

00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:52.840
one of my personal favorite
Superman stories is "Superman--

00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:56.350
Red Son," which for anybody
who doesn't know about that

00:53:56.350 --> 00:53:59.740
is Superman, instead of his
rocket ship crashing in Kansas,

00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:02.590
it crashes in the Soviet Union.

00:54:02.590 --> 00:54:04.900
And he grows up there
instead, and kind of

00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:07.209
like how that transforms
the character.

00:54:07.209 --> 00:54:09.250
I just wanted to know if
you guys have any, like,

00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:12.550
thoughts about that-- about
how that would change Superman

00:54:12.550 --> 00:54:16.040
and what would stay constant
about the character?

00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:17.860
Because what's of
intrinsic to him

00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:21.360
and what he picked up from the
Kents by being raised by them?

00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:21.790
BRIAN MICHAEL
BENDIS: Well, I think

00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:23.373
that's why the
"Elseworlds" in general

00:54:23.373 --> 00:54:29.200
are such a big thing at DC,
because all the characters can

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:32.499
be shown through these awesome,
like, cracked mirrors and--

00:54:32.499 --> 00:54:33.290
DAN JURGENS: Right.

00:54:33.290 --> 00:54:34.220
BRIAN MICHAEL
BENDIS: Yeah, right?

00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:35.210
You're all done them.

00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:35.440
Yeah.

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:35.740
PAUL DINI: Yeah.

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:37.060
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: Right.

00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:39.460
PAUL DINI: Well, I did
one in the animated series

00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:42.160
where he leads an
invasion on Earth

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:45.190
because he believes that he
was raised on Apocalypse.

00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:50.350
And it was almost like
"The Manchurian Candidate."

00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:51.950
He was attacked in space.

00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:53.920
His memory was
basically blotted out.

00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:55.477
And these other
memories were put

00:54:55.477 --> 00:54:56.935
in that he was the
son of Darkseid,

00:54:56.935 --> 00:55:00.880
that he was found and
brought to Apocalypse.

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:04.030
And he has a whole history
with Darkseid, which only

00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:05.590
goes back, like, about a week.

00:55:05.590 --> 00:55:07.450
And he leads an
invasion on Earth.

00:55:07.450 --> 00:55:10.090
And that is a very natural
thing for him to do.

00:55:10.090 --> 00:55:15.280
And when he returns,
he is himself again.

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:16.630
But he's really mad.

00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:18.140
And he goes after Darkseid.

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:19.720
And Bruce Timm and
I said, this is

00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:22.970
the only time Darkseid will
ever get physical in the show.

00:55:22.970 --> 00:55:25.450
This is the only time
that Superman is so mad

00:55:25.450 --> 00:55:26.770
that he confronts him.

00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:27.340
And he goes.

00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:28.270
And he fights him.

00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:30.700
And Darkseid is forced
to fight physically.

00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:33.480
And Superman beats
him, and he loses.

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:34.810
And he loses his--

00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:39.100
we wanted it to be a
spiritual defeat for him,

00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:41.590
because he takes Darkseid,
throws him into the street,

00:55:41.590 --> 00:55:44.247
and says to the people of
Apocalypse, you're free.

00:55:44.247 --> 00:55:45.330
And they look at Superman.

00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:46.330
They look at Darkseid.

00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:48.970
And they pick him up, and they
put him back on the throne

00:55:48.970 --> 00:55:50.770
because that's what they know.

00:55:50.770 --> 00:55:53.500
And Superman had to lose it.

00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:54.970
And he had to confront him.

00:55:54.970 --> 00:55:57.190
And he actually starts
to go after him again.

00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:59.590
And Supergirl, who's a part
of the story, says, stop.

00:55:59.590 --> 00:56:01.570
If you go after him,
someone's going to die.

00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:03.220
And it won't be Darkseid.

00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:05.450
And he realizes,
I can't do this.

00:56:05.450 --> 00:56:07.660
I cannot be the liberator.

00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:12.370
I cannot be the guy
who takes down tyrants

00:56:12.370 --> 00:56:14.560
because that's what
I'm going to become.

00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:17.020
And it's a very hollow
victory for him.

00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:18.990
And he has to live with that.

00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:19.930
And he has to go back.

00:56:19.930 --> 00:56:21.430
And we imagined
that was going to be

00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:24.940
the last episode of the
series, where if we did more,

00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:27.029
he would have to rebuild
that trust on Earth.

00:56:27.029 --> 00:56:29.320
And the only person who really
believes in him is Lois.

00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:32.620
And we thought, that's a great
place because he sort of lost

00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:33.940
the trust of Earth.

00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:35.736
But he's gained
the love of Lois.

00:56:35.736 --> 00:56:37.360
And we thought, if
we don't do anymore,

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:39.210
this is a good
place to leave it.

00:56:39.210 --> 00:56:39.920
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
Yeah, but I will say,

00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:41.919
you just brought up,
though, some elements we

00:56:41.919 --> 00:56:43.210
didn't get to talk about today.

00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:44.380
We were talking
about how obsessed

00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:45.504
we are with the characters.

00:56:45.504 --> 00:56:46.995
It's Lois and Jimmy and Perry.

00:56:46.995 --> 00:56:47.620
PAUL DINI: Yep.

00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:48.100
DAN JURGENS: Yeah.

00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:49.420
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
Like, it's the cast

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:50.628
that we haven't talked about.

00:56:50.628 --> 00:56:52.070
It's absolutely the best cast.

00:56:52.070 --> 00:56:52.440
PAUL DINI: It is.

00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:52.545
It really is.

00:56:52.545 --> 00:56:53.730
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS:
It's a tremendous cast.

00:56:53.730 --> 00:56:54.481
DAN JURGENS: Yeah.

00:56:54.481 --> 00:56:55.813
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: I'm sorry.

00:56:55.813 --> 00:56:57.820
SPEAKER 1: So we're
going to have-- actually,

00:56:57.820 --> 00:57:00.430
our guest speakers are awesome
and are going to sign some

00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:01.750
great posters--

00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:04.030
beautiful posters--
for us if you guys

00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:05.927
want to start lining
up back there.

00:57:05.927 --> 00:57:07.510
But before you do
that, I want to make

00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:09.700
a couple of announcements
from DC Comics.

00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:13.630

coming out on April 18.

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:18.070
And that is 80 pages for $7.99.

00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:20.050
And then "Action Comics--

00:57:20.050 --> 00:57:23.900

00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:26.740
And that's a
hardcover for $29.99.

00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:28.690
So please visit DC Comics.

00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:29.620
Pick those up.

00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:31.119
I'm pretty excited about it.

00:57:31.119 --> 00:57:32.660
And thank you so
much for being here.

00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:33.257
Thank you, DC.

00:57:33.257 --> 00:57:34.090
And thank you, guys.

00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:34.990
DAN JURGENS: Yeah,
thanks for coming.

00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:35.590
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: Thank you.

00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:36.490
It's been a pleasure.

00:57:36.490 --> 00:57:39.540
[APPLAUSE]
