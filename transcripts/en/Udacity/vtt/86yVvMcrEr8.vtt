00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.743
This is a pretty involved lesson. And I don't expect you to absorb it all at

00:00:03.743 --> 00:00:07.918
once. But I do want you to at least heard of the idea. I know it's taken me

00:00:07.918 --> 00:00:12.152
about 20 years to really grasp this whole concept. Let's get started. In

00:00:12.152 --> 00:00:15.568
previous lessons we've seen that the order of transforms for an object is

00:00:15.568 --> 00:00:19.640
usually rotate and then translate. For example, we start with the letter F, at

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.892
the origin. If we rotate it negative 45 degrees, we get a tilted F. We then

00:00:24.892 --> 00:00:29.477
translate it by one unit vertically, and it moves up. This we write out as TR,

00:00:29.477 --> 00:00:33.954
with the matrices applied in reverse order. However, we're now able to use

00:00:33.954 --> 00:00:38.358
matrices which ever way we want. So say we reverse the order. If instead we

00:00:38.358 --> 00:00:43.881
first translate up a unit, then rotate, we get this, the notation RT. Clearly

00:00:43.881 --> 00:00:48.408
different, with T changing the origin we then rotate around. Here is another way

00:00:48.408 --> 00:00:53.503
to look at it. Say we first just rotate the F. We express this by the notation

00:00:53.503 --> 00:00:58.302
R. We could add a translation matrix before or after this rotation. If we add it

00:00:58.302 --> 00:01:02.654
before the R this means we translate the object after the rotation and so move

00:01:02.654 --> 00:01:07.257
it with respect to the world. Whatever happens before this translation was

00:01:07.257 --> 00:01:11.472
applied is said and done. The object is in whatever orientation that has already

00:01:11.472 --> 00:01:17.096
been set. Ancient history, so TR is this top case as before. If we put the T

00:01:17.096 --> 00:01:21.884
after the R, it says to apply the translation first so everything is rotated

00:01:21.884 --> 00:01:26.464
around the origin. So finally I haven't said anything new. However, another way

00:01:26.464 --> 00:01:29.866
to look at all this is you're changing the frame of reference by each of these

00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:34.336
transforms. Instead of rotating or translating the object, we can think about it

00:01:34.336 --> 00:01:38.752
as changing this frame of reference. By taking this new path, we can think of

00:01:38.752 --> 00:01:43.238
the transforms in these terms. First the rotation changes the frame of reference

00:01:43.238 --> 00:01:48.126
that any transforms to the right of it will use. Then the translation moves the

00:01:48.126 --> 00:01:52.312
object with respect to this new frame of reference. Any point of space is given

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:56.238
some x y z coordinate only with respect to something. We started off by thinking

00:01:56.238 --> 00:01:59.748
of this something as world space, but notice that we have actually been making

00:01:59.748 --> 00:02:03.484
things in what we call model space, and then transforming them to world space.

00:02:03.485 --> 00:02:07.676
For example, when we have a parent child relationship, the child is oriented

00:02:07.676 --> 00:02:11.860
with respect for the parent, not the world. So it's all about respect. Just a

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.660
little bit. When we put the T matrix after the R, we're saying to translate with

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.515
respect to the view of the world of the R matrix. So putting the T here, moves

00:02:21.515 --> 00:02:26.610
the objects with the respect to the R matrices frame of reference. That is, the

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.380
translation is done with respect to the R's y axis. Putting the T in front of

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.220
the R means that the translation is not done in the R's frame of reference, but

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.202
in the world's frame of reference. The R itself is now influenced by the T's

00:02:39.202 --> 00:02:43.168
frame of reference. Another way to say this is that the first matrix to the

00:02:43.168 --> 00:02:47.328
right of some given set of matrices is transforming the object with respect to

00:02:47.328 --> 00:02:51.344
that set. In other words, everything to the left of it. For example, on the top

00:02:51.344 --> 00:02:56.360
here, the rotation is transforming the F with respect to the frame of reference

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.436
of the T translation to its left. This all may sound obtuse, but think of

00:03:00.436 --> 00:03:04.468
someone looking at a hubcap in your model, he wants to know where it's located

00:03:04.468 --> 00:03:08.816
and what angle it's at. You might describe it as well, I moved the hubcap so

00:03:08.816 --> 00:03:13.541
it'd be properly attached to the wheel, and then I moved the wheel so that. But

00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:17.808
he cuts you off, I don't care how it got there, where is it now. When you

00:03:17.808 --> 00:03:22.096
position the hubcap you weren't really moving the hubcap to its position you are

00:03:22.096 --> 00:03:26.043
positioning it with respect to wheel's frame of reference. And then you are

00:03:26.043 --> 00:03:29.462
positioning the wheel with respect to the car's frame of reference. It's more

00:03:29.462 --> 00:03:33.554
like the car's location and the wheel's location were maps for where the hubcap

00:03:33.554 --> 00:03:37.578
should go. Different frames of reference are just like you might use latitude

00:03:37.578 --> 00:03:41.070
and longitude to fly somewhere. Then use a street map, a different frame of

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.720
reference, to get from the airport to the office. Then use a map of the building

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.334
to find the room you want. Each frame of reference takes you to the next.
