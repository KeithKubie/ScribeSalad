00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.320
For quantitative traits like height we can't use

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.280
concordance because it's not a simple yes no matching

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.370
for height. Remember, concordance means there's agreement between

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.570
our categories. So we've got brown, blue, green and

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.210
we're looking for matching between our twins. But

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.580
quantitative traits don't have these categories, so instead what

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.210
we're doing is we're measuring over a range of

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.200
possibilities. And so we're going to actually make what's called

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.340
a correlation rather than a concordance. A correlation

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.820
is a statistical term referring to an observable relationship

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.430
between any paired values. Well what does that mean

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.140
exactly? What it means is that if we have

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.980
a pair of twins where, one twin has a

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.480
height that's almost the same as the height of

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.130
the other twin, we would say that these are

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.607
correlated. Twin one and twin two both had roughly

00:00:50.607 --> 00:00:54.340
the same height. If across many pairs of twins, the height

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.925
of twin one is very similar to the height of twin

00:00:56.925 --> 00:01:00.820
two, then this results in what we call a strong correlation.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.906
But if instead you see that the height measurements between twin

00:01:03.906 --> 00:01:07.490
one and twin two are very different, then we would say

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.530
that there is a weak or no correlation at all. Now

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.110
most of the time we don't look at these kinds of

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.300
numbers in table format. We look at them in graph form.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.510
Take a look at these four graphs right here

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.730
comparing twin height between twin one and twin two. Essentially

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.730
what we've done, is we measured the twin height

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.850
for twin one, and then we go up and plot

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.880
a point where we get to the twin height of twin two. And we do this for a huge

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.480
number of twins, and we have four different results. I

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.510
want you to rate the graphs from strongest correlation with

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.690
the number one to the weakest weakest correlation with

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.934
the number four. Put the numbers 1, 2, 3,

00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:49.840
and 4 in the text boxes you see here,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.358
ranking each graph in order of strongest to weakest correlation.

00:01:54.358 --> 00:01:55.710
Now this could be a little more difficult if

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.390
you don't have any experience with statistics or looking

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.720
at correlation graphs before, but I still want you

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.100
to give it a shot and see how you do.
