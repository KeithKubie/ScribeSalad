00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:09.240
&gt;&gt;Well the world situation is not in the best
shape right now. I think we have major problems

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.440
in every aspect of our human activities. And
the economy is going down the drain. There

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.620
is a major rift between different parts of
the world. That we have number of wars going

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:30.370
on. The humanitarian situation in many places
like Darfur like Gaza is, is blocked from

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:36.680
our conscience. And I think we are here to
pick up the pieces. I have a lot of hope.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:44.410
That was, [second pause] that Obama Administration
that things will change. We know we have the

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.650
financial crisis and we have to do a lot to
fix the financial crisis, but a lot that we

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.160
can do in the political arena does not require
money. Reaching out to each other, engaging

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:03.420
in a dialogue, build a system that is rooted
in equity. Where I cannot see how we are ever

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.429
going to have security where we have one-third
of the world population live on less than

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:15.170
two dollars a day. We have places like Darfur
where people are dying by the hundreds every

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.749
day and we continue to wring our hands. So
we need to strengthen our financial, our international

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:28.270
institutions. We need to have a robust system
to prevent conflict, to manage conflict. We

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:35.209
need to deal with this whole new state ranging
from moving towards nuclear disarmorment,for

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:40.829
the weapons state to create the environment
that nuclear weapon does not bring power,and

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.869
prestige, and influence,but we need a system
that does not depend on nuclear weapons. We

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.780
need to deal with a specific concern: North
Korea, Iran. We need to multi-nationalize

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.420
the fuel cycle so no one country have the
technology to develop nuclear weapon in short

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.889
span of time, and of course we need to address
the most serious concern of all, Which is

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:08.899
nuclear terrorism. The possibilities that
extremist groups will get their hands on nuclear

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.120
weapon. If they do that they will obviously
use it and a good part of our civilization

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.040
would be lost. So there's a lot of challenge,
but there are also a lot of opportunities.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:27.349
It's all a question of mindset, what kind
of values we would like to live by and as

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:33.849
I keep mentioning here in Davos, for the first
time I have hope that we are in a position

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:41.209
to establish a saner, a safer, a more humane
world. With the new administration a system

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:48.340
that is based on inclusiveness that are not
exclusiveness. A system that is based on talking

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.900
to our enemies before we talk to our friends,
and respect each other simply as human beings

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:01.170
irrespective to our ethnicity, or religion,or
color. So it is a new beginning and every

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.780
one of us has a responsibility and every one
has to do what they can in spirit of activity

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.859
to create finding a world when we all believe
that we are one part of a one human family

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:21.090
and if we want to succeed we're going to succeed
together and if not we are also going to fail

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.060
together.
