Now that we've got that quackery out of the way, there's one serious topic I

00:00:03.824 --> 00:00:07.482
need to discuss, which is multiple inheritance. And that's the answer to the

00:00:07.482 --> 00:00:10.750
question of whether a class can have more than one base class. The answer

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.465
depends on the programming language. In Python the answer is yes. Other

00:00:14.465 --> 00:00:18.170
languages don't allow this. For example, Java only allows a single base for a

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.138
class and works out other mechanisms to solve some of the problems that we saw

00:00:22.138 --> 00:00:26.343
with multiple inheritance. In Python a class can have multiple bass classes and

00:00:26.343 --> 00:00:30.304
this is both very useful and potentially quite dangerous. So here's an example,

00:00:30.304 --> 00:00:34.000
so remember what we did before. We had a Discerning Bear, which was a subclass

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.840
of Grizzly Bear and it overrode the eat method of bear to be discerning and not

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.952
eat humans named Dave. So what shall we do if we want both discerning Grizzly

00:00:41.952 --> 00:00:46.084
Bears and Discerning Black Bears? Well, one solution would be to add a new

00:00:46.084 --> 00:00:50.959
subclass that would be a Discerning Black Bear that would also override the ID

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:55.180
method and that would be a subclass of Black Bear. This seems like a bad thing.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.840
We've got a lot of duplication and we've mixed up our notions of whether a

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.618
bear's discerning and whether it can climb or knock down trees. So here's what

00:01:02.618 --> 00:01:06.473
we're going to do instead. We'll define a new Discerning Bear class, which is a

00:01:06.473 --> 00:01:11.016
subclass of bear and overrides the eat method. Then we can create a Discerning

00:01:11.016 --> 00:01:15.340
Grizzly Bear, which is a subclass of both a Grizzly Bear and a Discerning Bear.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.244
That means it will inherit the knock down method from Grizzly Bear and the eat

00:01:19.244 --> 00:01:23.380
method from Discerning Bear. And we could also define a Discerning Black Bear

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.220
class which would inherit the climb method from Black Bear and the eat method

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.059
from Discerning Bear. Here's what the code looks like, its the same discerning

00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:34.764
bear class we had before except for we have changed the base class which was the

00:01:34.764 --> 00:01:38.921
Grizzly Bear, now its just the bear. To define the discerning Grizzly Bear class

00:01:38.921 --> 00:01:42.953
all we need to do is inherit from two base classes, the Discerning Bear and the

00:01:42.953 --> 00:01:46.923
Grizzly Bear. We don't need to define any new attributes. We've got the

00:01:46.923 --> 00:01:50.840
behaviors we need by combining those two. Similarly for the Discerning Black

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.312
Bear all we need to do is inherit from the Discerning Bear and the Black Bear

00:01:54.312 --> 00:01:57.811
and we have everything we need. So this is pretty neat and can be very useful,

00:01:57.811 --> 00:02:00.852
but also can be a little tricky. So now we're going to have a quiz.
