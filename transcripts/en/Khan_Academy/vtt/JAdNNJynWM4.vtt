00:00:00.272 --> 00:00:01.200
- [Voiceover] So we're asked,

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.250
Is the expression x minus three,

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.362
is this a factor of this
fourth degree polynomial?

00:00:06.362 --> 00:00:09.055
And you could solve this by
doing algebraic long division

00:00:09.055 --> 00:00:10.354
by taking all of this business

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.422
and dividing it by x minus three

00:00:12.422 --> 00:00:14.371
and figuring out if you have a remainder.

00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:16.091
If you do end up with a remainder

00:00:16.091 --> 00:00:19.093
then this is not a factor of this.

00:00:19.093 --> 00:00:21.083
But if you don't have a
remainder then that means

00:00:21.083 --> 00:00:23.444
that this divides fully
into this right over here

00:00:23.444 --> 00:00:25.772
without a remainder which
means it is a factor.

00:00:25.772 --> 00:00:28.234
So if the remainder is equal to zero,

00:00:28.234 --> 00:00:29.812
the remainder is equal to zero,

00:00:29.812 --> 00:00:31.160
if and only if,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.437
it's a factor.

00:00:32.437 --> 00:00:34.689
It is a factor.

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:36.407
And we know a very fast way

00:00:36.407 --> 00:00:38.497
of calculating the remainder

00:00:38.497 --> 00:00:40.486
of when you take some polynomial

00:00:40.486 --> 00:00:44.325
and you divide it by a first
degree expression like this.

00:00:44.325 --> 00:00:45.369
I guess you could say when you divide it

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:47.946
by a first degree polynomial like this.

00:00:47.946 --> 00:00:49.967
The polynomial remainder theorem,

00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:52.359
the polynomial remainder theorem tells us

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:57.359
that if we take some polynomial, p of x

00:00:57.653 --> 00:01:02.133
and we were to divide it by some x minus a

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:06.358
then the remainder is
just going to be equal to

00:01:06.358 --> 00:01:10.144
our polynomial evaluated at

00:01:10.144 --> 00:01:12.247
our polynomial evaluated at a.

00:01:12.247 --> 00:01:14.671
So let's just see what's a in this case.

00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:17.761
Well in this case our a is positive three.

00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:21.778
So let's just evaluate our
polynomial at x equals 3,

00:01:21.778 --> 00:01:23.844
if what we get is equal to zero

00:01:23.844 --> 00:01:25.237
that means our remainder is zero

00:01:25.237 --> 00:01:27.745
and that means that x
minus three is a factor.

00:01:27.745 --> 00:01:28.952
If we get some other remainder

00:01:28.952 --> 00:01:30.531
that means well we have
a non-zero remainder

00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:33.549
and this isn't a factor,
so let's try it out.

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.568
So, we're gonna have,

00:01:36.568 --> 00:01:39.122
so I'm just gonna do it all in magenta.

00:01:39.122 --> 00:01:40.701
It might be a little
computationally intensive.

00:01:40.701 --> 00:01:44.415
So it's going to be two times
three to the fourth power,

00:01:44.415 --> 00:01:46.734
three to the fourth, three
to (mumbles), that's 81.

00:01:46.734 --> 00:01:48.572
81.

00:01:48.572 --> 00:01:50.523
Minus 11

00:01:50.523 --> 00:01:53.209
Yeah, this is gonna get a
little computationally intensive

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:55.492
but let's see if we can power through it.

00:01:55.492 --> 00:01:58.348
11 times 27,

00:01:58.348 --> 00:01:59.925
I probably should have
picked a simpler example,

00:01:59.925 --> 00:02:01.250
but let's just keep going.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.826
Plus 15 times nine.

00:02:04.826 --> 00:02:07.728
Plus four times three is 12.

00:02:07.728 --> 00:02:08.799
Minus 12

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.929
So lucky for us, at least those
last two terms cancel out.

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:14.067
And so this is going to be

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:16.273
the rest from here is arithmetic.

00:02:16.273 --> 00:02:20.260
Two times 81 is 162.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.615
Now let's think about what 27 times 11 is.

00:02:23.615 --> 00:02:27.832
So let's see, 27 times
10 is going to be 270.

00:02:27.832 --> 00:02:32.828
270 plus another 27 is minus 297.

00:02:32.828 --> 00:02:36.171
297, did I do that, yeah, 270

00:02:36.171 --> 00:02:40.260
So 27 times 10 is 270 plus 27, 297

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.581
Yep, that's right.

00:02:41.581 --> 00:02:44.214
And then we have,

00:02:44.214 --> 00:02:46.357
I'm prone to make careless errors here,

00:02:46.357 --> 00:02:49.871
see 90 plus 45 is 135.

00:02:49.871 --> 00:02:53.516
So plus 135.

00:02:53.516 --> 00:02:54.515
And let's see,

00:02:54.515 --> 00:02:56.094
if I were to take

00:02:56.094 --> 00:02:59.413
if I were to take 162 and 135,

00:02:59.413 --> 00:03:03.193
that's going to give me 297

00:03:03.193 --> 00:03:05.713
minus 297.

00:03:05.713 --> 00:03:08.864
Minus 200, we do it in that green color,

00:03:08.864 --> 00:03:11.684
minus 297.

00:03:11.684 --> 00:03:14.244
And we do indeed equal zero.

00:03:14.244 --> 00:03:15.954
So the remainder,

00:03:15.954 --> 00:03:18.030
if I were to divide this by this,

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.244
is equal to zero.

00:03:19.244 --> 00:03:21.704
So x minus three is indeed a factor

00:03:21.704 --> 00:03:25.055
of all of this business.
