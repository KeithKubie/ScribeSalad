00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.400
As promised, let's do a couple
of simple Snell's law examples.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.530
So let's say, that
I have two media-- I

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.180
guess the plural of mediums.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.620
So let's say I have
air right here.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.219
And then right here
is the surface.

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:23.010
Let me do that in a
more appropriate color.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.455
That is the surface
of the water.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.040
And I know that I have a light
ray, coming in with an incident

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:49.640
angle of-- so relative to the
perpendicular-- 35 degrees.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.580
And what I want to know is
what the angle of refraction

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.560
will be.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.780
So it will refract a little bit.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.280
It will bend inwards
a little bit,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.780
since this outside's going to
be in the air a little longer,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.410
if you buy into my car
travelling into the mud

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.080
analogy.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.840
So it will then
bend a little bit.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.140
And I want to figure out
what this new angle will be.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.830
I want to figure out
the angle of refraction.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.460
I'll call that theta 2.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.060
What is this?

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.950
This is just straight
up applying Snell's law.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.500
And I'm going to use the
version using the refraction

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.420
indices, since we
have a table here

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.510
from the ck12.org FlexBook
on the refraction indices--

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.850
and you can go get it
for free if you like.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.010
And that just tells
us that the refraction

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.250
index for the
first medium-- that

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.250
is air-- times the sine of the
incident angle, in this case

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.280
is 35 degrees, is going to
be equal to the refraction

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:56.310
index for water, times the
sine of this angle right

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.750
over here-- times
the sine of theta 2.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.700
And we know what the refraction
index for air and for water is,

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.650
and then we just have
to solve for theta 2.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.640
So let's just do that.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.770
The refraction index for
air is this number right

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.100
over here, 1.00029.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:23.010
So it's going to be, there's
three 0's, 1.00029 times

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.830
the sine of 35 degrees, is going
to be equal to the refraction

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.400
index for water, which is 1.33.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.540
So it's 1.33 times
sine of theta 2.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:46.000
Now we can divide both sides
of this equation by 1.33.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.750
On this side, we're just left
with the sine of theta 2.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.190
On the left-hand side, let's
get our calculator out for this.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.810
So let me get the
handy calculator.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.230
And so we want to
calculate-- and I made sure

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:05.300
my calculator is in degree
mode-- 1.00029 times

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.390
the sine of 35
degrees, so that's

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.320
the numerator of
this expression right

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.280
here-- the green part--
that's 0.5737 divided by 1.33.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.160
I'm just dividing by
the numerator here.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.647
When you just
divide this answer,

00:03:19.647 --> 00:03:20.730
it means your last answer.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.180
That's the numerator up here
divided by that denominator.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.890
And so I get 0.4314.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.970
I'll just round a little bit.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.760
So I'll get-- I'll
switch colors--

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:39.300
0.4314 is equal to
sine of theta 2.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.760
And now to solve
for theta, you just

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.410
have to take the inverse
sine of both sides of this.

00:03:47.442 --> 00:03:49.150
This doesn't mean sine
to the negative 1.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.940
You could also use the arcsine.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.180
The sine inverse
of 0.4314 is going

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.610
to be equal to-- the inverse
sine of sine is just the angle

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.630
itself or, I guess
when we're dealing

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.240
with angles in a
normal range, it's

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.520
going to be the angle itself.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.950
And that's going to be the
case with this right over here.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.340
And if any of that
is confusing you

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.652
might want to review the
videos on the inverse sine

00:04:13.652 --> 00:04:15.110
and the inverse
cosine, and they're

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.550
in the Trigonometry playlist.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.160
But we can very
easily figure out

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.579
the inverse sine for
this right over here.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.250
You literally, you
have sine here,

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.720
when you press Second
you get the inverse sine.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.430
So it's the inverse
sine, or the arcsine

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.047
of that number right over there.

00:04:29.047 --> 00:04:30.630
And instead of
retyping it, I can just

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.984
put Second, and then Answer.

00:04:32.984 --> 00:04:34.900
So I'm taking the inverse
sine of that number.

00:04:37.864 --> 00:04:39.155
And that will give me an angle.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:48.660
And I get 25.55, or I'll
round it, 25.6 degrees.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:56.900
So this theta 2,
is equal to 25.6,

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.840
or I'll say approximately
equal to some 25.6 degrees.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.780
So Snell's law goes
with our little car

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.396
driving in to the mud analogy.

00:05:05.396 --> 00:05:06.770
It's going to be
a narrow degree.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.450
It's going to come inwards a
little bit closer to vertical.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:15.110
And theta 2 is equal
to 25.6 degrees.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.910
And you could do the other way.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.330
Let's do another example.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:26.470
Let's say that we have,
just to make things simpler,

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.660
that I have some
surface right over here.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.180
So this is some
unknown material.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.620
And we're traveling in space,
we're on the space shuttle,

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.965
and so this is a vacuum.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.520
Or pretty darn
close to a vacuum.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.910
And I have light coming in at
some angle, just like that.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.570
Let me drop a vertical.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.349
So it's coming in at some angle.

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:53.890
Actually, let me
make it interesting.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.590
Let me make the light go
from the slower medium

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.755
to the faster medium, just
because the last time we

00:05:57.755 --> 00:05:59.470
went from the faster
to the slower.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.610
So it's in a vacuum.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:06.690
So let's say I have some
light traveling like this.

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.460
And once again, just to get
the "get" of whether it's

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.020
going to bend inward
or bend outward,

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.940
the left side is going
to get out first,

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.890
so is going to
travel faster first.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.970
So it will bend inwards when it
goes into the faster material.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.550
So this is some unknown.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.130
This is some unknown material,
where light travels slower.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:32.560
And let's say we were able
to measure, the angles.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.430
So let me drop a
vertical right here.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:44.840
And so let's say that this
right here, is 30 degrees.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.360
And let's say we're
able to measure

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.690
the angle of refraction.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.940
And the angle of
refraction over here

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.880
is, let's say that
this is 40 degrees.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.880
So given that we're able
to measure the incident

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.030
angle, and the
angle of refraction,

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.714
can we figure out the refraction
index for this material?

00:07:01.714 --> 00:07:03.880
Or even better, can we
figure out the speed of light

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.660
in that material?

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.618
So let's figure out the
refraction index first.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.810
So we know the refraction index
for this questionable material

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.440
times the sine of
30 degrees is going

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.364
to be equal to the refraction
index for a vacuum.

00:07:20.364 --> 00:07:22.030
Well, that's just the
ratio of the speed

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.488
of light in the vacuum to the
speed of light in the vacuum.

00:07:24.488 --> 00:07:26.755
So that's just going to be 1.

00:07:26.755 --> 00:07:30.500
This is the same thing
as n for a vacuum--

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.270
and I'll just write a 1 there--
times the sine of 40 degrees.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.020
Or If we wanted to solve for
this unknown refraction index,

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.270
we just divide both sides of
the equation by sine of 30.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.392
So our unknown
refraction index is

00:07:44.392 --> 00:07:46.100
going to be-- this is
just the sine of 40

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:52.005
degrees-- over this-- over
the sine of 30 degrees.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.320
So we can get our
handy calculator out.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:05.280
And so we have the
sine of 40 divided

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:10.320
by the sine of 30 degrees.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.390
Make sure you're in degree
mode, if you try this.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:16.420
And you get, let's
just round it, 1.29.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.720
So this is approximately equal
to-- so our unknown refraction

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.830
index for our material
is equal to 1.29.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.710
So we were able to figure out
the unknown refraction index.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.460
And we can actually
use this to figure out

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.100
the velocity of light
in this material.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.990
Because remember, this
unknown refraction index

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.220
is equal to the
velocity of light

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:43.360
in a vacuum, which is 300
million meters per second,

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.780
divided by the velocity in this
material, the unknown material.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.780
So we know that 1.29 is equal
to the velocity of light

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:52.480
in a vacuum.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:58.360
So we could write
300 million meters

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.780
per second, divided by
the unknown velocity

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:02.680
in this material.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.380
I'll put a question mark.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.040
And so we can
multiply both sides

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.502
times our unknown velocity.

00:09:07.502 --> 00:09:08.960
I'm running out of
space over here,

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.840
I have other stuff
written over here.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.990
So I could multiply
both sides by this v

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:18.720
and I'll get 1.29 times
this v with a question mark,

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:24.560
is going to be equal to 300
million meters per second.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.360
And then I could divide
both sides by 1.29.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:33.920
v question mark is going to be
this whole thing, 300 million

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.380
divided by 1.29.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:38.910
Or another way to
think of it is,

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.830
light travels 1.29
times faster in a vacuum

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:43.750
than it does in this
material right over here.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.790
But let's figure
out it's velocity.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:49.420
So in this material,
light will travel a slow--

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:56.840
so the 300 million
divided by 1.29.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:03.370
Light will travel a super slow
232 million meters per second.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:08.850
So this is approximately,
just to round off,

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:16.485
232 million meters per second.

00:10:16.485 --> 00:10:18.360
And if we had to guess
what this material is,

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.200
let's see-- I just
made up these numbers--

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.533
but let's see if there's
something that has a refraction

00:10:22.533 --> 00:10:23.950
index close to 1.29.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:25.920
So that's pretty
close to 1.29 here.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.610
So maybe this is some
type of interface

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:29.640
with water in a vacuum,
where the water somehow

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.070
isn't actually
evaporating because

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:32.070
of the lack of pressure.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.486
Or maybe it's some
other material.

00:10:33.486 --> 00:10:35.600
Let's keep it that
way, maybe it's

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.794
some type of solid material.

00:10:36.794 --> 00:10:38.210
But anyway, those
were, hopefully,

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.690
two fairly straightforward
Snell's law problems.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.930
In the next video, I'll do a
slightly more involved one.
