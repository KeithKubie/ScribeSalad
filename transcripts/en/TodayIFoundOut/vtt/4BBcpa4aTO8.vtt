00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.820
Think back to when you were a child visiting
your grandparent’s home.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.890
Do you recall a distinct scent when you walked
through the door?

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.440
Many people do and it turns out, it’s not
just in your head.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.580
Gerontologist and author of A New Wrinkle:
What I Learned from Older People Who Never

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.970
Acted Their Age, Dr. Eric Shapira, says it
is difficult to pinpoint the cause or one

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.980
main reason for the smell; it is a process
of what happens to the body as we age.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.110
Many studies show that the body’s chemistry
changes from within as we get older producing

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.670
a certain scent.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.649
Some may describe it as musty.

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.010
Some may call it stale.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.960
Maybe a bit medicinal.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.340
Here’s the surprising part: Grandma or Grandpa
may smell different.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.370
But, they don’t smell BAD.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.890
A recent research study done by Johan Lundström
of the Monell Chemical Senses Center published

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.190
in PLOS ONE tested the odors from the underarms
of middle-aged adults and the elderly.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.280
The result?

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.120
Middle-aged men smelled the worst, according
to those surveyed.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.120
The good news?

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.080
Grandpa was considered second-best, and actually
pleasant smelling.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.970
Middle-aged women came out on top of the list
of most-enjoyable body odors.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.250
The study was conducted by attaching absorbent
pads to the lining of the armpits of shirts.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.060
The shirts were then worn by volunteers of
various ages for five consecutive nights while

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.060
they slept.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.400
In order for other smells not to seep when
the shirts weren’t being worn, they were

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.130
stored in sealed plastic bags during the day.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.790
The volunteers were also required to use scentless
soaps and shampoos during the experiment and

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.770
not to eat or expose themselves to strong
smelling external things like perfume or cigarette

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:36.770
smoke.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.110
After the five days were up, the pads were
collected and placed in sealed jars ready

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.960
to be opened and sniffed by other volunteers
to judge the smelliness and to see if people

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.670
could correctly identify the general age of
the person who wore the pad (young, middle-age,

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.670
and old-age).

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.010
The results?

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.630
The volunteers were able to correctly identify
which pads were worn by old people most of

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.770
the time, though that was about the extent
of the accuracy.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.920
While they did also detect a distinct difference
between the middle-aged and young, they were

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.359
not able to accurately identify which was
which in most cases.

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:10.590
So what exactly is thought to be causing this
change in smell as we age?

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.280
It’s still somewhat up for debate, but it
is thought that there are many factors involved.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.550
One factor, according to the aforementioned
physician, Eric Shapira, is simple dehydration.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.450
Older people tend to be less thirsty, which
results in them being predominately more dehydrated

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.360
and shedding more dry skin.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.590
Dead skin cells can carry a musty smell.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.080
In addition, Shapira notes that older people
see a decline in oral hygiene over the years

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.230
due to less efficient brushing.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.910
Oral hygiene, of course, can also affect one’s
scent.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.570
A more scientific approach to this question
was taken by a team of Japanese researchers

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.710
in 2000.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.500
They discovered that a concentration of the
chemical 2-nonenal, which is an odoriferous

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.040
substance found in sweat and on your skin,
increased as people aged, with people in their

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.110
70s having as much as three times as much
of it as middle-aged individuals.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.500
It’s thought that the extra 2-nonenal is
coming from the breakdown of more prevalent

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.420
omega-7 fatty acids on our skin as we age.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.030
(Interestingly, besides being perhaps a major
culprit in the smell of an elderly individual,

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.710
2-nonenal is also a key component in the smell
of beer.)

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.020
An elderly person’s living environment is
also thought to be a factor.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.420
How many of us know a relative who keeps,
or hoards, everything from years gone by?

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.620
Brenda Thompson of Tri-Country Home Nursing
says,

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.010
All those old books and papers, old linens
and clothes — they all harbor dust and dampness

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.540
and give off a musty odor that can pervade
the whole house.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.750
If you moved into that house in 1945, those
books may have been there for 60 years.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.210
I’ve seen drapes that have been there that
long, too.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.630
Here’s another odd thing about the changing
of how we smell as we age: as we grow older,

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.570
nearing age 80, males tend to smell more and
more like women, with this change thought

00:03:46.570 --> 00:04:07.920
by some to be hormonal based, though exactly
what’s going on isn’t yet perfectly clear.
