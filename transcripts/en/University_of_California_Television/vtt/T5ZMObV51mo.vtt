00:00:05.327 --> 00:00:07.827
(piano music)

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.460
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.923
Bipedal, naked, large-brained.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.630
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.903
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.863
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.683
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.243
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.450
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.790
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.693
understanding of the past.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.160
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.703
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.960
An exploration made possible

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.713
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:15.084 --> 00:01:17.751
(upbeat jingle)

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:23.184
(upbeat music)

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.223
- Good afternoon.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.343
Imagination makes huge
demands on the brain.

00:01:42.824 --> 00:01:45.563
And when we use imagination,

00:01:45.563 --> 00:01:48.540
there's neural connectivity that occurs

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.803
between many areas of the brain.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.500
But not all brains are equal,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.580
so people who have high creativity brains

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.053
have different networks
from those who don't.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.760
This means that the study of imagination

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.033
and the study of brains
is not a linear thing.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.170
Face recognition in objects

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.430
requires a certain
proportion of brain power

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.980
that we call the face recognition area

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.610
and when people are thinking about faces,

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.230
this is what is activated.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.210
Now, archeologists, and
I'm an archeologist,

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.540
can't access brains.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.310
All we can do is to have a look at items

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.440
of material culture as proxies

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.883
for imagination in the deep past.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.153
But how far back can we go?

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.630
And it's perhaps important or relevant

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.969
in a group like this to
say once upon a time.

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:01.130
(audience laughing)

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.803
Three million years ago,
at Makapan in South Africa,

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.140
this little jaspilite pebble was found

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.910
and the question of course is,

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.660
did Australopithecus
have a face-recognition

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.063
part of the brain?

00:03:20.731 --> 00:03:23.064
And about 300,000 years ago,

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.520
this flint hand-ax, with
a shell in its center,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.313
was found in the UK.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.732
And here, the question
is, was the fossil shell

00:03:35.732 --> 00:03:39.373
perhaps more important
than the tool itself?

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.903
Did it spark imagination?

00:03:44.168 --> 00:03:48.530
And about 300,000 years ago in Israel,

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.630
at Berekhat Ram, this little object

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.430
that some people think
was a figurine was found

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.430
and the use-wear traces
on it were analyzed

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.940
by Francesca d'Errico and April Nowell

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.310
and they discovered that it had,

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.060
in fact, been purposely modified.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.560
It had been ground

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.883
and there were some nick
marks around the neck.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.120
What they also found,
however, was that red powder

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.070
tends to come off when this is ground

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.820
and so maybe it wasn't
a symbolic artifact,

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.980
even though it had been
purposefully modified.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.410
Now, the important point about all three

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.729
of these objects that I've shown you

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.290
is that they represent outliers,

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.780
not regular patterned behavior.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.980
And if we're thinking about
imagination and symbolism,

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.493
we need to know that
this is shared behavior.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.023
So all of these objects
could be accidental.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.690
There, of course, they
give us a very nice clue

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.953
as to her early imagination
may have arisen.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.030
Proxies for imagination appear

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.140
very regularly in the last 100,000 years.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.120
So there's no problem about
recognizing them then.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.843
And they tend to multiply
exponentially after that.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.662
So the first ones I'm going to show you

00:05:26.662 --> 00:05:30.053
are from Diepkloof in South Africa.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.850
The oldest of these engraved egg shells

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.990
is 100,000 years old

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.790
and they were found up 'til
about 60,000 years ago.

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.620
We know that they're water bottles

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.460
because some of the openings,

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.243
down on the the bottom right there,

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.580
have the ground openings
just like the ones

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.650
in the Kalahari today, where you see

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.600
a woman pouring water
into this water bottle.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.460
You can see that her water bottle

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.800
is a little decorated there
too, whereas the older ones,

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.710
in fact, have much greater variety

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.170
of decoration on them

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.253
and perhaps engaged more imagination.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.093
Refitting suggests that the Diepkloof

00:06:21.093 --> 00:06:24.110
water bottles were highly decorated.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.093
You can see that the patterning
was all over them there.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.608
What I think is really important

00:06:32.608 --> 00:06:37.050
is that the engraved eggshell
occurs at many sites.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.660
So we see it here at Klipdrift

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.730
and at sites up in, Namibian.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.850
There, you see a pathway
up towards the west

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.270
that has engraved eggshell,

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.590
whereas the perforated marine shells

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.830
that I'm about to show you have a pathway

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.100
that goes up the eastern
part of Southern Africa.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.740
They don't only occur in the eastern part

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.980
of Southern Africa, they go right

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.350
the way up to North Africa
and into Israel as well.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.360
So let's have a look at those.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.820
These perforated marine
shells that are probably beads

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.910
are 72,000 years old

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.133
and yet, the ones further
north are even older.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.060
Some experimental work by Marian Vanhaeren

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.590
has suggested that people imaginatively

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:35.743
strung these together in different ways.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.090
The oldest ones, at the top,

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.163
were strung together in
little pairs like that.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.823
The ones in the middle
were strung back to back.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.640
And then the younger beads were strung

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.423
in even a different way.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.223
Again, using imagination.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.260
I think it's important that shell beads

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.372
are also found at Sibudu

00:08:01.372 --> 00:08:04.260
and Klasies River in South Africa.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.913
So once again, we have an
established behavioral pattern.

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:12.830
The Sibudu ones are 72,000 years old.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.713
The Klasies ones, a similar age.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.320
But there's much other technology

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.310
that occurs in the last 100,000 years,

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:28.500
that demonstrates the imagination
of people at the time.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.600
You've already seen the
Blombos engraved piece of ochre

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.860
that is 72,000 years old.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.680
There's other engraved
ochre from Blombos too.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.750
So, once again, we see a pattern there.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:45.770
There is engraved ochre at Klasies River

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.363
and at several other South African sites.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:51.793
At 100,000 years ago at Blombos,

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.540
paint was manufactured in an abalone shell

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.050
and this was red ochre mixed with a number

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:03.200
of ingredients including
an unknown liquid.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.773
We don't know what the paint was used for,

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.570
but we do know that it was a compound,

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.833
complex mixture.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.713
At Sibudu, there's also paint.

00:09:19.039 --> 00:09:20.740
It was found on this flake here

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.230
and this paint was made out
of ground red ochre powder,

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:30.250
mixed with casein, casein
being a milk product.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:33.194
Was this perhaps the first tempera paint

00:09:33.194 --> 00:09:35.210
that was ever used in the world?

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:36.773
I think it may have been.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:42.090
At Sibudu, there are also
many imaginative adhesives,

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:46.340
made out of things like
red ochre and resin

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:50.330
or red ochre mixed with graphite,

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.180
mixed with other products, sometimes fat,

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.903
a whole variety of adhesive recipes.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:04.500
Also at Sibudu, this
time at 77,000 years ago,

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.250
people imagined how they
could get rid of insects

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.940
that buzzed around their
bedding, annoyingly, at night.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.885
And so they placed aromatic leaves,

00:10:14.885 --> 00:10:19.400
in this case, Cryptocarya,
on top of the sedge bedding

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.810
and these aromatic leaves
are slightly poisonous

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.323
and probably kept the mosquitoes away.

00:10:30.671 --> 00:10:33.970
Burial, something that has only briefly

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:35.913
been mentioned up until now,

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:39.943
allows our imagination in a different way,

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:42.930
because when we see a burial,

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.680
we know that people were
imagining ancestors.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.570
They were thinking about the after-people,

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.643
as well as the afterlife.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:58.040
The earliest burial that
we know about so far,

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:02.573
comes from Israel, at Skhul and Qafzeh.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.120
And here, the burials, which are repeated,

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.550
as many as 10 at a time,

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:13.220
have been buried with shell
beads, perforated marine shell

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.003
and red ochre as grave goods.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:22.180
Then, at Border Cave in
the Lebombo Mountains

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:25.890
of South Africa, at 72,000 years ago,

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:29.390
an infant was buried
with this conus shell,

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:33.200
which had been perforated,
perhaps as a pendant.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.140
The little sketches over on the left

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.303
were from the excavation in the 1940s.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.430
Through time, burials
became much more complex.

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:49.910
And here in Russia, at 34,000 years ago,

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.190
we see one of the most beautiful

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:57.070
burials that has come to light so far.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:58.740
It's a young man on the left,

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.130
that's the archeological example,

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:05.100
covered with 3,000 mammoth ivory beads

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:10.100
with fox canines and bangles made of ivory

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:12.090
and the reconstruction on the right

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:15.800
suggests that these decorative items

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.290
may have been stitched onto the clothing

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:19.603
that he was buried in.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:24.630
But when we think of imagination,

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.493
we can hardly separate it from fantasy.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.779
And probably the earliest secure

00:12:30.779 --> 00:12:34.080
archeological evidence for fantasy

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.600
is the Lion-Man from Germany,

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.003
32,000 years ago.

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:43.010
This is an ivory figurine,

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:47.173
the figurine of a human
figure with a lion head.

00:12:48.259 --> 00:12:50.490
This kind of therianthrope,

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:54.910
because the mixture of
animal and human features

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.743
defines a therianthrope,

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:02.680
it's a manifestation
of an abstract concept

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.780
but it really is the first evidence

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:09.650
that we have of true fantasy.

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:11.751
It's not the only one, though.

00:13:11.751 --> 00:13:14.150
And at Apollo 11 in Namibia,

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:17.140
27,000 years ago,

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:21.080
the motif of a feline is used again.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:25.900
Here on the painted slab, you
see half-human, half-feline.

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:29.293
The head is a feline and
the back legs are human.

00:13:31.367 --> 00:13:34.340
And this slab was buried
in the little cave

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.923
that you see up on the top left there.

00:13:40.672 --> 00:13:44.320
Now, all the evidence that
we have for imagination

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.560
and highly developed technology,

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.680
some of which I've shown you,

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:53.560
can be used to imply that
we had complex cognition

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:57.960
and modern brains way before

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.020
any of this evidence that I've shown you,

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:04.260
right back to 300,000 years ago,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.670
when homo sapiens first arrived

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:09.783
in the archeological evidence.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:17.510
But for once, let's turn this
idea on its head and say,

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:21.610
material culture itself is not passive.

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:25.060
And so when people manipulate items,

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.850
when they work on material culture,

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:30.700
this is stimulating their imagination

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.070
and their cognition.

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:36.370
And by doing, we develop
the brains even more,

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.830
we develop imagination further

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:42.250
and it's this kind of thing that leads

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:46.110
to increased technological

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.010
development through time,

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:51.583
increased imagination,
increased creativity.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.830
And thus, we can say that technology

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:58.340
and cognition and imagination

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.740
engage with each other reflectively

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.293
and reflexively.

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.210
And the reflexivity that we see

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:12.565
between the technology and
the cognition and imagination

00:15:12.565 --> 00:15:16.150
gave rise to what I've
demonstrated to you,

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:19.280
the exponential growth of material

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.473
culture by 100,000 years ago.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.580
So all of the things that I've shown you,

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:30.990
beads, paint, art, engraved ochre,

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:34.653
engraved ostrich egg
shell, adhesive recipes,

00:15:34.653 --> 00:15:37.410
bow and arrow, that I haven't mentioned,

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:40.490
new tool classes and burial,

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.201
all of these appear very rapidly

00:15:43.201 --> 00:15:46.400
by 100,000 years ago.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.690
We may have had the humble beginnings

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:50.683
of this earlier than that,

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:55.220
but certainly, we get definitive evidence

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.146
by 100,000 years ago.

00:15:58.146 --> 00:15:58.993
Thank you.

00:15:58.993 --> 00:16:02.160
(audience applauding)

00:16:05.601 --> 00:16:08.184
(upbeat music)
