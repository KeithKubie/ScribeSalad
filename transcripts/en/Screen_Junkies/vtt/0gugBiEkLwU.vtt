00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.820
Based on the terrible books from one of the
sh*ttiest authors of all time,

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.980
comes a movie adaptation for teenage girls
who aren't smart enough for The Hunger

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:16.840
Games.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.470
You'll be on the edge of your seat as voice-over
describes everything.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.369
"I would miss my harebrained mother."

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.910
"I used to spend two weeks there almost every
summer."

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.859
"My first day at a new school."

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:28.900
Kind of like a book, actually.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.240
"My dad's Charlie."

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.120
This catatonic teenager will fall for the
world's gayest vampire.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.290
A film that teaches young girls that the only
thing that matters is finding a man...

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.940
a 100 year old man.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.890
"So, how long have you been like this?"

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.629
"Since 1918."

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.110
But don't worry, it's not pedophilia because
he looks 17.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.960
Together, they will have the romance of a
lifetime

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.960
expressed entirely in stares.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.530
[dramatic music]

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.600
And even more stares.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.600
[dramatic music]

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.090
A love challenged by the fact that he might
accidentally f*ck her to death,

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.700
this special effect,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.859
and her inability to pour ketchup.

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:46.950
A film that conditioned a generation of girls
to think that love is keeping tabs on

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.319
each other every waking moment.

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:50.869
"Did you follow me?"

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.840
"I feel protective of you."

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.710
And even non-waking moments.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.929
"I like watching you sleep."

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.789
"Do you do that a lot?"

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.439
"Just the past couple of months."

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.799
I know this looks creepy, but it's really
romantic in the movie.

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:06.979
I promise.

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:07.689
Starring...

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:08.720
Vanilla

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.229
Shovel Face

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.670
and Troy Polamalu.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.320
Twilight: it's just a metaphor for abstinence.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.550
Seriously, look it up.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.700
Get ready for an hour and a half of people
standing in semi-circles,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.720
council meetings,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.190
different council meetings,

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.590
and sitting

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.640
just to get to 5 minutes of cool stuff.
