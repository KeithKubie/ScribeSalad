00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.530
Earlier in the course we saw how object oriented analysis can give you

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.950
a better understanding of the problem you are trying to solve.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.780
The results is a set of diagrams, interface specifications, expressed in OCL,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.640
and a list of non-functional requirements and

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.222
constraints. Then the architectural design process can help you determine

00:00:20.222 --> 00:00:24.317
appropriate subcomponents. Understand the tradeoffs among the constraints.

00:00:24.317 --> 00:00:28.324
Select appropriate methods for satisfying the nonfunctional requirements. And

00:00:28.324 --> 00:00:31.970
choose a suitable architectural style. The eventual target is to

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.070
produce a program written in some object oriented language like Java.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.550
The purpose of this lesson is to introduce you to Object Oriented Design,

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.320
OOD. The process of getting you from your analysis and

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.380
intended architecture to the point where you can write the target program.
