00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World
History, and today we're going to return to

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.680
our old friend, the rise of the west.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.280
Ugh, Mr Green, we know. The west rose, we've
talked about this a million times.

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.469
Yeah, me from the past, I'm sympathetic to
your position, but the thing is, this is a

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.209
big deal in world history circles and today,
we are going to talk about the rise of the

00:00:19.209 --> 00:00:22.289
west from the perspective of people who don't
live there.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.660
So today, we're going to look at how some
people who experienced the rise of the West

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.320
firsthand responded to it. We're going to
focus on East Asia and also the Middle East,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.480
which is also Asia. Anyway, both of these
communities dealt with European imperialism

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.460
in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.210
So, just a quick note here, European imperialism
affected millions of people, including agricultural

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.860
and industrial workers, very few of whom left
records of their experience. So we end up

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.010
relying on the words of people who wrote things
down, intellectuals. Now, many of those people

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.580
were European, but in this case, most of what
we'll be examining today is covered by a fascinating

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.320
book by Pankaj Mishra, called "The Ruins of
Empire: The Revolt Against the West and the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.860
Remaking of Asia." Mishra's book draws heavily
from the perspectives of three Asian thinkers,

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.250
and I will remind you, mispronouncing things
is my thing. He looks at Middle Easterner

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.610
Sayyid Jamal Ad-Din Al-Afghani, Liang Qichao
from China, and Rabindranath Tagore from India.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.090
Through their eyes we can see that Asians
did recognize the coming dominance of Europe,

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.979
but they also developed ideas about imperialism
that provided a counterweight to Western dominance

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.420
and gave them a way of imagining their role
in this new world.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.100
Alright, let's go straight to the Thought
Bubble.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.090
Although we tend to equate European imperialism
with the late 19th century, especially the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.440
carving up of Africa after the Berlin Conference
of 1884, for many Asians, the disaster began

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.979
earlier. In China, the Opium Wars began a
train of humiliations, most memorable of which

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.279
occurred with the destructed of the Summer Palace
in 1860. And imperialism wasn't great for the Muslim

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.220
world either. By 1896, Al-Afghani described Muslims
under European imperialism this way:

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.960
"The foreigners chain up Muslims, put around
their necks a yoke of servitude, debase them,

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.740
humiliate their lineage, and they do not mention
their name but with insult. Sometimes, they

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:16.969
call them savages and sometimes regard them
as hard-hearted and cruel and finally consider

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:20.079
them insane animals. What a disaster!"

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.090
Just like today's historians, Asian intellectuals
were quick to recognize that the reason Europeans

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.670
were able to dominate and humiliate them was
Europe's superior industrial technology and

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.359
organization, one early response was to say,
"well, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em, or

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:37.829
at least, try to follow their models of military
organization and education." We see this in

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:42.150
attempts at reform, like the Tanzimat in the
Ottoman Empire, Al-Afghani initially echoed

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.129
these calls to study more science and philosophy,
but his comparison of philosophers with prophets

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.549
was too radical for the Ottomans and he ended
up being expelled from Istanbul.

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.029
Chinese intellectuals responded similarly
to the humiliation of the Opium Wars, with

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:58.959
calls for self-strengthening, a phrase coined
by its biggest supporter, Feng Guifen. Given

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.189
China's almost 2,000 year history of an education
system based on Confucian values and classical

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:08.139
texts, which, to be fair, had worked pretty
well for them for most of that time, adopting

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:13.329
Western models of education and organization
was gonna be a tough sell, as Yan Fu, a Chinese

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:14.969
writer and translator put it,

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:20.049
"China governs the realm through filial piety,
while Westerners govern the realm with impartiality.

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.889
China values the sovereign, while Westerners
esteem the people. China prizes the one way,

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:29.779
while Westerners prefer diversity. In learning,
Chinese praise breadth of wisdom, while Westerners

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:31.219
rely on human strength."

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.439
One Chinese reformer, Kang Youwei, took up
the challenge of blending Western and Chinese

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:39.939
ideas of governance by attempting to update
Confucianism for the modern world and arguing

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:44.989
that political reform and mass mobilization
were central concerns for Confucius himself.

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.129
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So all of that gets
to a big question, imperialism was a disaster

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.219
for a lot of people, but there were things
about what the West was doing to control much

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:57.790
of the world that were obviously working.
So the question for people outside the West

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.900
became: What, if anything, do we take from this and try
to borrow and integrate into our own communities?

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.760
Well, in addition to education and military
reforms, many Asian intellectuals felt that

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.930
Europe's strength was rooted in its political
organization, into nation-states. That sounds

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.349
a lot like today's historians and also economists.
Everyone's crazy about nation-states. Except

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:17.509
the Mongols.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.400
And, you know what, I stand with the Mongols
on that. I think empire is underrated. I would

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.760
make an excellent emperor, for instance. You
know what they'd call me, Stan? Genghis John.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.880
Anybody? Yeah?

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.240
I hate myself.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.720
But anyway, some of these intellectuals became
proponents of nationalism, like, by 1879,

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.509
Al-Afghani was advocating that Muslims begin
to think of themselves as a nation, in the

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:43.580
sense of a culturally unified people. Here
he is in words that recall the German nationalists

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.460
of the time: "There is no happiness except
through nationality and no nationality except

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.849
through language...a people without unity
and a people without literature are a people

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:57.819
without language. A people without history
are a people without glory, and a people will

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:03.500
lack history if authorities do not rise among
them to protect and revivify the memory of

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.610
their historical heroes so that they may follow
and emulate...all this depends on a national

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.030
education, which begins with the fatherland,
the environment of which is the fatherland,

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.850
and the end of which is the fatherland."

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.060
Are you sure that wasn't a German nationalist,
Stan, because that was a lot of fatherlands?

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.780
Maybe it was translated by a German.

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:27.139
And then there's India. As the most thoroughly
colonized Asian territory, India's feelings

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:31.870
about nationalism were very complicated. Some
Indians wanted to create a European style

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.509
state organized around Hinduism. But of course,
India had a large Muslim minority and also,

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:40.819
Hinduism, with its caste divisions, wasn't
great for creating political unity. Others,

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:44.900
like Aurobindo Ghose were critical of adopting
too many European ideas, worrying that India,

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.770
quote, "was in danger of losing its soul by
an insensate surrender to the aberrations

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.370
of European materialism."

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.850
Aberrations of European materialism? I don't
know what you're talking about.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.620
Oh, that is delicious. Hold on, I gotta play Floppy Bird
for a second.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.159
But many Asians considering adopting European
models of nationalism look to one of its biggest

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:04.930
success stories: Japan.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.210
For Europeans, Japan became kind of a confirmation
of a modernization program, industrialization,

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.810
centralization, and to a lesser degree, liberal
constitutionalism, could work. And this was

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.849
also true to some extent for Asian intellectuals,
including Liang Qichao and Rabindranath Tagore,

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:23.939
both of whom visited Japan. But ultimately,
Japan didn't provide a great model for other

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:28.819
Asians attempting to reform their own states,
especially because Japan embarked on its own

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:30.169
imperial expansion.

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:35.509
It's almost as if, in addition to industrialization
and centralization and et cetera, imperialism

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:37.960
was just part of building a strong nation-state.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.930
So by the early 20th century, many Asian intellectuals
were looking beyond Western models. Some,

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.780
like Liang Qichao and Al-Afghani, considered
supranational movements, like pan-Asianism

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.360
and pan-Arabism. They envisioned these huge
political conglomerates that could transcend

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.379
Europe's dominance, but eventually, both they
and Tagore turned to their own traditions

00:06:57.379 --> 00:07:01.749
as a source of strength. And what they all
had in common was a loss of faith in liberal

00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:06.430
democracy as a source of strength, especially
after the Versailles Treaty in 1919. Like

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.409
after flirting with Pan-Arabism and being
expelled from a different Ottoman city, this

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:13.369
time Cairo, Al-Afghani became convinced that,
quote,

00:07:13.369 --> 00:07:18.159
"Modernization hadn't secured the Ottomans
against infidels. On the contrary, it had

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:19.800
made them more dependent."

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.920
He embraced the idea that the best defense
against the West was Islam. Mishra says of this,

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:29.449
"As he saw it, attacking religion risked undermining
the moral basis of society altogether and

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:35.110
weakened the bonds that held communities together,
precisely the weakening that had plunged Muslims

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.919
everywhere into crisis."

00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:40.460
Now, this doesn't mean that he became what
we today think of as an "Islamist radical"

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:45.340
or an "Anti-Modernist." Instead, he believed
that the Qur'an contained its own calls for

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.840
reform, and that Islam could be a catalyst
for change. Ultimately, Al-Afghani believed

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.370
that the transformation of Islamic society
had to come from within. Like his favorite

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.749
Qur'anic injunction was:

00:07:55.749 --> 00:08:00.110
"God does not change the condition of a people
until they change their own condition."

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:04.539
In China, Liang Qichao came up with a different
source of reform, the strong state. After

00:08:04.539 --> 00:08:09.199
the failure of the Boxer Rebellion in 1901,
he wrote his awesomely titled, "On The New

00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:13.169
Rules For Destroying Countries." This was
a critique of European imperialism, but it

00:08:13.169 --> 00:08:18.639
was also a call for a strong, somewhat authoritarian
state that could stand up to the West.

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:22.899
Nah, China would never do that. Oh, wait.
Wait a second. They did!

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.440
Eventually he came to the conclusion that
the Chinese people must now accept authoritarian

00:08:27.449 --> 00:08:30.669
rule. They cannot enjoy freedom. Well, that's
pretty extreme.

00:08:30.669 --> 00:08:34.720
Ohhh, it's time for the Open Letter. But first,
let's see what's in the globe today. Oh, look,

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.880
it's some underappreciated authoritarian rulers.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.760
An Open Letter to Authoritarianism:

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.700
Dear Authoritarianism: Listen, I am all for
democracy, but the tyranny of the majority

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.700
is no joke. And there have been many times
when democratically elected governments were

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:53.280
less pluralistic than authoritarian ones.
Not only that, if you can keep corruption

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.690
out of it, there is an astonishing efficiency
to doing it your way. Like, who's gonna make

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:02.290
this decision. Oh, I know, the Queen! It's
always the Queen, no need for exploratory

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:06.520
committees or different houses of Congress,
the Queen can do it! Maybe I'm just a little

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:11.280
frustrated with Congressional gridlock, authoritarianism,
but I kind of think you're underrated.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.880
Best wishes, John Green

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.510
p.s. Just wanna confirm that I am not advocating
for authoritarian rule in the United States.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:21.040
So Liang also visited the United States, which
made him more convinced that liberal democracies

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:26.660
did not provide an answer, especially because
they discriminated so much against Asians.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:31.130
And then, World War I and the insane map-drawing
spree of the Treaty of Versailles just further

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:35.570
confirmed all of it. I mean, despite the lofty
rhetoric of Woodrow Wilson's 14 points and

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:39.760
the League of Nations and everything, the
result of the war looked suspiciously like

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.880
the pre-war imperialism that many Asians believed
was a cause of the war in the first place.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.280
But perhaps no one was more skeptical of the
"if you can't fight 'em, emulate 'em" strategy

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.780
of dealing with imperialism than Indians.
Gandhi, for instance, went very far in his

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:58.860
critique of the West's modernism, saying that
it lacked spiritual freedom and social harmony,

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:03.800
even rejecting many aspects of the industrial
revolution itself. I mean, this was a person

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.230
who sewed his own clothes.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:09.740
And interestingly, one of the most vocal Indian
critics of the West was the one who was perhaps

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:14.570
most positively received there. Tagore won
the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913 for

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:19.790
a body of work that essentially said "you guys
are terrible at everything." To quote Mishra,

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:24.370
Tagore's message to the West was that "their modern
civilization built upon the cult of money and

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:29.360
power was inherently destructive and needed to be
tempered by the spiritual wisdom of the East."

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:33.290
Now, he didn't reject industrialization completely,
and he acknowledged that, quote,

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:38.350
"the age belongs to the West and humanity
must be grateful to you for your science,"

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.960
but cautioned an audience in New York that,
quote,

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.800
"you have exploited those who are helpless
and humiliated those who are unfortunate."

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:50.620
So, as we've talked about before, our perspective
on events really colors our version of the

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:55.690
truth. Living as we do, in an age dominated
by more or less liberal nation-states with

00:10:55.690 --> 00:11:00.050
varying degrees of market freedom, it can
be tempting to consider their development

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.180
as both inevitable and good.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:06.120
And I'm certainly not going to throw rocks
at both a political system and a nation-state

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:10.810
that allows and enables me to put up videos
like this and provides a space for millions

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:12.440
of you to agree and disagree.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.860
But when we look at responses to imperialism,
I mean, after we get beyond the obvious criticism

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:22.570
that imperialism generally is bad, we start
to focus on the responses to it that confirm

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:27.370
this deep down feeling we have. You know,
that it was bad to extract all of those resources,

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:32.920
but ultimately, we spread tolerance and pluralism
and the nation-state and those all worked

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:37.740
out. So I worry that we look at self-strengthening
in China or the Ottoman reforms as examples

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.880
of where Asians were on the right track, and
then we see the failure of those reforms as

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:47.500
confirmation that Asians were somehow just
unready or unfit for the benefits that the

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.190
West had so generously offered.

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:54.310
But if you look at the actual words and actions
of Asians who experienced imperialism first-hand,

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:58.860
you get a very different picture. Asians thinkers
were critical of the West from the very earliest

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.930
stages of new imperialism. Looking back at
the evolution of the intellectuals we've talked

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:08.300
about today reminds us that Asians were not
simply victims of imperialism's ideology.

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:12.620
In fact, they've continued to influence ideas
about the West today, and not only outside

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:18.040
the West. When we in the West lament our insensate
surrender to the aberrations of European materialism,

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:22.880
we should recognize that that criticism didn't
necessarily originate from within.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.680
Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.
