JEREMY WALKER: Welcome to
YouTube Developers Live.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.600
We have special guests Vidyard
here today, all the way from

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.210
Waterloo, Canada.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.890
We actually have
Cody and Tyler.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.614
Say hi, guys.

00:00:17.614 --> 00:00:18.520
TYLER CAMPAIGNE:
Hey, I'm Tyler.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.400
CODY WRIGHT: I'm Cody.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.780
JEREMY WALKER: And they were
nice enough to join us.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.730
So if you haven't heard of
Vidyard, it's actually a video

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.410
player for marketers.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.320
And rather than talk through
it too much, I thought we'd

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.600
just dive into the history
and then we'll go

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.760
right into a demo.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.820
So why don't you guys tell us a
little bit about the history

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.690
of Vidyard, how it came about
and the product itself, and

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.310
then we'll go into
a nice demo?

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.700
TYLER CAMPAIGNE: Sure.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.060
So Vidyard actually started
out as a company that was

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.140
producing minute-long

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.770
explainer-type videos for companies.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.630
And we would give these
videos to our clients.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.970
And then they'd ask us, so what
do we do with the video

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.760
now that we have it?

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.780
And so from that we grew into
making a platform that

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.310
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.848
the answer for what to do with
you video afterwards.

00:01:08.848 --> 00:01:12.904
And that means giving them the
tools to analyze how their

00:01:12.904 --> 00:01:15.600
video is doing, how much
people are watching it.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.250
As well as integrated into all
sorts of other platforms that

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.730
share the video analytics
with them.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.580
JEREMY WALKER: OK, great.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.270
That's kind of funny.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.930
So you're making the video
marketing stuff first, and

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.860
then they were like well,
what do we do with it?

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.776
So you built a player
tool for them?

00:01:32.776 --> 00:01:33.704
TYLER CAMPAIGNE: Exactly.

00:01:33.704 --> 00:01:34.170
JEREMY WALKER: Awesome.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.890
Great.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.760
Well, let's jump
into the demo.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.080
I had a couple questions because
I know some people

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.580
aren't quite sure what that
means to have a video player

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.410
for marketers.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.760
But it's pretty clear once
you see the demo.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.226
So why don't we jump
into that?

00:01:49.226 --> 00:01:50.180
TYLER CAMPAIGNE: Sure.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.112
So I'll just take
over the screen.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:13.050
So here's just the main
dashboard of our platform with

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.260
a very simple analytics view
here, different things for

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.510
your account wide.

00:02:22.682 --> 00:02:29.990
So if I hop inside of a specific
player here, in here

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.870
you'll have all sorts of tools
for creating stuff like a call

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.270
to action at the end
of your video.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.890
So it's got a simple builder
where you can set up a form so

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.515
that you can capture
people's emails.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.310
JEREMY WALKER: I saw
this on your demo.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.660
It's a pretty nice feature.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.530
Basically it comes out the side
and asks for information.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.980
It's not too intrusive.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.720
It was kind of a nice feature.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.810
I can see how marketers would
really love that.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:02.560
TYLER CAMPAIGNE:
Yeah, exactly.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.740
So we're all about giving
marketers these sorts of tools

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.990
to do what they need to do.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.970
As well as from that, there's an
A/B split testing area for

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.560
your slash screens.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.510
And here you can see the one
that we have set up on our

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.730
homepage right now, which is
using these two thumbnails.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.550
Are then we give the analytics
for each of those three

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.130
thumbnails.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.240
And you can see that the
one is at almost 10%

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.090
clickthrough rate.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.830
Meanwhile, the other two
are more on 7-1/2%.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.810
So right now we have a clear
winner of which one's the best

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.040
out of those three.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.560
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah, this is a
really neat feature I liked in

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.360
your product.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.420
So a thumbnail really does
impact clickthrough rate.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.160
So like they said, what they did
is they basically take a

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.720
bunch, let you set up a bunch,
and you even let them set up

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.060
their percentage for when
it shows up, right?

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.420
Like, 10% here, 20% on this one,
so then you can get an

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.260
idea of the clickthrough
rate, right?

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.980
TYLER CAMPAIGNE: Oh, yeah.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.320
You can fully distribute
it however you want.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.745
So if you have one that you
think won't do that well but

00:04:09.745 --> 00:04:11.980
you want to try it anyway, you
can give it a very small

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.560
percent so that it doesn't
influence the overall traffic

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.970
all that much but you can still
test how well it does.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:19.399
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:20.950
And you guys were talking
a little bit about

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.610
general best practices.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.540
So I know from what you were
saying, it really is different

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.670
depending on the scenario.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.370
But at least for a general side
you were saying something

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.910
about there's a difference
between if it's not front and

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.420
center and it's off
to the side.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.250
Would you mind telling
the audience a

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.830
little bit about that?

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:42.520
TYLER CAMPAIGNE: For sure.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.200
So if you have a smaller player
off to the side of a

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.120
page, then it makes much more
sense to have a thumbnail

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.770
that's brighter and
stands out more.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.680
Because that way people will
actually notice it off to the

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.980
side and then click
it and watch it.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.900
Versus if it's something big
and center in the page

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.230
already, then you want something
more engaging and

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.550
personable so that they're more
curious as to what that

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.040
could be and that would lead
them to actually watching it.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.440
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.040
And you guys were a
little surprised

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.630
with this one, right?

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.660
The guy on the beach ended
up doing the best.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:20.860
Did you think one of
the other ones

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.142
would be a winner instead?

00:05:23.142 --> 00:05:23.510
TYLER CAMPAIGNE: Yeah.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.910
I think we thought the one
with the girl on the

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.180
sandcastle and the dog would be
better, because that's more

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.060
things going on.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.090
But I guess people like
the guy on the beach.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.470
JEREMY WALKER: So the important
thing is general

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.110
practices we went over.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.020
But if you're going to test it,
even ones that you don't

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.590
think will win may end
up doing really well.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.440
TYLER CAMPAIGNE: It depends
entirely on your audience and

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.160
what they like or don't like.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.210
And that's the point of
A/B split testing is

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.460
to figure that out.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.810
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.130
Well, you guys do a lot of
analytics as well to help

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.410
these marketers out, right?

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:01.680
TYLER CAMPAIGNE: Yeah.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.940
So we have a whole page
dedicated to that Analytics

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:12.180
Center, which gives a very
easy way to view all your

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:17.960
general views, devices and
browsers, where your videos

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.360
are being embedded, geography.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.550
As well as all of these graphs
can then be further limited by

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.760
the actual player so we can get
that home page, narrow it

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.010
down from there.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.195
So it's all about just giving
marketers all the information

00:06:38.195 --> 00:06:41.150
and all the statistics they
need to make the decisions

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.860
they need to make.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:43.340
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.260
And one thing I like about you
guys is you really want

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.070
marketers to get the most
bang for their buck.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.280
So you allow them to export to
YouTube, and then you pull all

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.010
the analytics from there so that
they can have their own

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.040
customized player on
their own page.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.520
But then they push that content
out to YouTube to get

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.400
more views.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.480
TYLER CAMPAIGNE:
Yeah, exactly.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:08.800
Because YouTube is such an
invaluable force of people.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.170
So we are always going to fully
support pushing your

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.810
video to YouTube.

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.260
So the general flow for that
is upload to Vidyard.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.905
Then we can do all sorts of our
more advanced analytics,

00:07:19.905 --> 00:07:22.470
but then push that video to
your YouTube channels and

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.030
market it through
there as well.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.900
And then here in the Analytics
Center, you can see how well

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.280
it's doing and compare
it to how it's doing

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.530
on your home page.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.730
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:39.810
Thanks for giving us that little
taste of the product.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:44.180
And obviously you can see a more
detailed demo of things

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.670
on their site, vidyard.com.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.680
Why don't we talk a little bit
about the technical section?

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.310
So I wanted you to talk for
the developers out there.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.520
How did you implement this?

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.710
And what programming language
did you use and why?

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:07.468
CODY WRIGHT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:07.468 --> 00:08:10.620
Ruby, but as a Sinatra
application instead.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.000
And so we haven't
mixed this up.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.150
It'll interact with YouTube
[INAUDIBLE] working in Ruby

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.350
and also working in Sinatra
through the Google API client

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:19.160
[INAUDIBLE].

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:24.892
And we're running data through
the D3 Data API, as well as

00:08:24.892 --> 00:08:26.260
[INAUDIBLE].

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.000
JEREMY WALKER: OK, great.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.460
You cut off there
for a second.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.123
I think you said you
were using Ruby?

00:08:31.123 --> 00:08:32.730
CODY WRIGHT: Yeah.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:35.460
We're Ruby with some Rails,
as well as a Sinatra

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:36.880
application as well.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.755
And interfaced with the Google
stuff through the Google API

00:08:40.755 --> 00:08:42.580
client [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:42.840
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.490
And it sounds like you guys
are already using the new

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.440
version 3.0 of the Data API?

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:48.860
CODY WRIGHT: Correct.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:49.910
Yes, we are.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:50.740
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.522
Thumbs up.

00:08:53.522 --> 00:08:56.220
CODY WRIGHT: Yeah, we made a
switch about four months.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:01.040
Before we were using another
RubyGem that did most of the

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.620
YouTube stuff for us.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.356
We just decided to write our
own stuff that does more

00:09:07.356 --> 00:09:10.225
specific the type of thing
you can do with YouTube.

00:09:10.225 --> 00:09:12.670
And it's gone really
well thus far.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.200
TYLER CAMPAIGNE: Especially
the analytics.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.655
Because D3 is much better at
being able to break down by

00:09:17.655 --> 00:09:19.860
geography and stuff like that.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.530
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah, our new
Analytics API is pretty

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.580
helpful, rather than
the large zip file.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.880
So was there anything that
came that surprised you a

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.120
little bit when you
were integrating

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.010
with the YouTube APIs?

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.090
CODY WRIGHT: The only thing that
we've been a little bit

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.821
surprised by is the way the
tokens work. and sometimes

00:09:38.821 --> 00:09:40.800
getting tokens that expired.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.650
But beyond that, the guides are
really helpful and it's

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.530
worked out really well for us.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:47.830
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.020
Well, any features you'd like
to see in the product in the

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.400
near future?

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.210
CODY WRIGHT: The only thing
that we've had a lot of

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:58.667
clients ask for and we haven't
been able to do is uploading

00:09:58.667 --> 00:10:02.643
and choosing custom thumbnails
on YouTube through the API.

00:10:02.643 --> 00:10:06.730
Now I know that's available to
content providers, but you

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:08.400
can't do it for just
general users.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.060
And that's something we get
asked for all the time.

00:10:15.885 --> 00:10:18.840
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah, we do
have the video thing.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.660
We're opening that up more,
so keep an eye on that.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.900
But as you said, we do have one
right now, we're just a

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.620
little bit limited for access.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:29.290
Well, great.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.290
Any other thing you'd tell a
developer that's getting

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:33.540
started with the APIs?

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:36.450
CODY WRIGHT: No.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:40.014
I think just looking through
that YouTube API doc site is

00:10:40.014 --> 00:10:40.760
really good.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:45.345
And there's some good code
examples on there, and it

00:10:45.345 --> 00:10:46.910
seems to work really well.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:48.580
TYLER CAMPAIGNE: Definitely
Stack Overflow's a very good

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.040
resource, and you guys are
very active on it.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.110
So any questions you have,
just go to Stack

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:54.470
Overflow and ask.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:55.860
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah,
definitely.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.610
We do have a keyword
YouTube-API.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:01.290
My team actually monitors
that, so make sure

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:03.400
you check it out.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.060
Great.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.750
Well, I think that wraps
up our show.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.900
As always, we're always looking
to hire if you're

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.410
interested in developer
relations.

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:14.140
Check out
developers.google.com/jobs.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.520
We have some openings,
so check it out.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:23.050
And a big thanks to Vidyard
for coming all the way

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:26.020
virtually from Waterloo,
and jumping on to

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.180
hang out with us.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:31.000
Again, check out Vidyard.com and
their new video, the one

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.920
with the guy on the beach.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.910
I actually watched it,
it's pretty funny.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.540
So check it out.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.470
And thanks again guys
for joining us.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:39.416
And we'll see you next week.

00:11:39.416 --> 00:11:39.912
TYLER CAMPAIGNE: Good.

00:11:39.912 --> 00:11:40.410
Thanks for having us.

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:41.350
CODY WRIGHT: Thank you.

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:42.600
JEREMY WALKER: Thanks.
