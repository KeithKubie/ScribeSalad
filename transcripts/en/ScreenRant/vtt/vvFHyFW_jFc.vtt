00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.970
A plot twist is an effective way of keeping
audiences on the edge of their seats, but

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.950
not every surprise comes completely out of
the blue.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.231
Filmmakers just can’t help leaving a hint
or two for all to see – even if it’s just

00:00:17.231 --> 00:00:20.380
the viewers paying the closest attention who
catch them.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:29.650
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Best Movie Clues
You Missed.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.600
Back to the Future – Twin Pines Mall

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.620
The first Back to the Future ends with a bit
of a twist, revealing that the life Marty

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.570
McFly leaves behind in 1985 is not the same
he returns to.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.250
His actions in the past have caused his entire
family history to change for the better - but

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.370
you don’t have to wait until the final sequence
for that surprise.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.810
When Marty rushes to the parking lot of Twin
Pines Mall to save Doc before he’s killed,

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.990
it’s revealed to have changed its name to
Lone Pine Mall, a result of Marty running

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.500
over one of Farmer Peabody’s prized pines
when he first arrived in 1955, and the first

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.770
clue that he altered the timeline, instead
of preserving it.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.820
21 Jump Street – A Familiar Flavor

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.469
Undercover officers Schmidt and Jenko are
given a simple mission: infiltrate and bring

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:12.690
down a high school designer drug ring.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.120
Finding the dealer is simple enough, but finding
his supplier and kingpin proves more challenging.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.420
But it didn’t have to be.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.320
After the two first take the drug while at
school, Jenko notes that “it tastes like

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.050
cool ranch”.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.240
Just a few moments later, Coach Walters appears
snacking on – you guessed it - Cool Ranch

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.240
Doritos.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.140
Walters is revealed to be the operation’s
mastermind, explaining where that flavor came

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.140
from.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.760
The officers may have spotted the clue, if
they weren’t too distracted by their own

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:47.490
tongues.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.759
Reservoir Dogs – Big Tippers

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.960
After a jewel heist goes horribly wrong, Quentin
Tarantino’s cast of thieves are convinced

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.150
that there’s a rat in their midst, with
the survivors left to find out which one of

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.040
their team may be working with the police.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.579
A collection of bottles hints that Mr. Orange
isn’t on the same side as Mr. White or Pink,

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.920
but the undercover LAPD officer actually lets
his secret slip in the very first scene.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.790
First, he changes his mind to fit in with
his colleague.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.340
Then when the group is asked who didn’t
tip for their breakfast, Orange immediately

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:24.000
squeals, showing he doesn’t subscribe to
the same code as his partners.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.920
If only they’d caught it, the movie’s
ending might have been a lot less messy.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.680
Fight Club – Flashes of Tyler

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.450
When the Narrator learns that he and Tyler
Durden are actually the same person, it blows

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.959
his mind - but eagle eyed viewers weren’t
caught completely by surprise.

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.000
In the film’s first act, the Narrator begins
to see quick glimpses of Tyler as he battles

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.090
his insomnia, suggesting he’s simply a figment
of his imagination begging to be unleashed.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.990
If that wasn’t enough, Tyler later calls
the Narrator on a pay phone that doesn’t

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:00.190
accept incoming calls.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.030
Saving the big twist from eagle-eyed viewers
was obviously not a priority for director

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.030
David Fincher.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.390
“He is Jack’s Spoiler Alert.”

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.430
The Sixth Sense – An Unfriendly Ghost

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.620
Discovering that Bruce Willis’s character
was dead the whole time is one of the greatest

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.380
twists in cinematic history, immediately warranting
a second viewing, where viewers learn the

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.620
twist wasn’t necessarily a total surprise.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.709
It makes sense for Crowe to spend plenty of
time with his patient Cole, but it is a little

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.710
strange that he doesn’t address any other
human after the opening scene, at one point

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.340
arriving late for an anniversary dinner, with
his wife not even acknowledging his presence.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.489
The clues are subtle enough to go unnoticed
the first time, but on repeat viewings, they’re

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.730
impossible to miss.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.569
Shutter Island – A Glass Half Full

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.930
The movie’s story of a Federal Marshall
pursuing a killer in a remote mental hospital

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.440
is turned on its head in Shutter Island, when
hero Teddy Daniels is revealed to be a patient

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.140
acting out an elaborate fantasy.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.879
It’s a shocking twist, but viewers should
have known that Teddy’s experience was less

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:06.060
than reliable.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.840
When a patient requests a drink during her
interview, the glass she drinks from is non-existent,

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.090
returning only when it has been completely
drained.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.829
Teddy’s fear of water may be actively censoring
what he does, and doesn’t see, but regardless,

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.550
it’s just one of the clues that show the
investigation is not what it seems.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.499
The Usual Suspects – The Truth is Golden

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:29.910
Everyone was floored to learn the unassuming
Verbal Kint was really the criminal mastermind

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.719
Keyser Soze, but hints were sprinkled throughout
this mysterious crime drama.

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:37.930
In the film’s opening scene, the faceless
Keyser lights a cigarette with a gold lighter

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.360
before setting a fiery blaze.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.210
Later on when Verbal leaves the police station,
one of his belongings is a gold cigarette

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:51.289
lighter - the same one used in that first
sequence.

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.409
It’s a minor detail before the far larger
twists are revealed, meaning deductive viewers

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:58.719
realized the truth before the characters in
the story.

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:01.789
The Big Lebowski – No Strike, He’s Out

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:07.539
Since the film’s starring duo spends most
of their time dismissing their fellow bowler,

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:13.119
Donnie, viewers might not notice that every
time he’s shown bowling, he gets a strike

00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:15.490
– until his final game.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.559
He seems as confused as anyone when he leaves
pins standing, but exits the bowling alley

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:27.639
to face off against a group of violent nihilists,
where he succumbs to a heart attack and dies.

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.990
Turns out, his last bowl was an ominous piece
of foreshadowing.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.300
What would have happened if he’d thrown
a gutter ball?

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.289
The Prestige – Look to The Birds

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.810
A single trick lies at the heart of this tale
of rival magicians, with Hugh Jackman’s

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.539
character desperately trying to learn how
Christian Bale’s Borden can transport between

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:46.279
two points instantly.

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:50.580
He eventually recreates the trick by copying
himself, drowning each time as his new copy

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.610
appears to wow audiences.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:58.229
In the end, Borden’s explanation is a twin
brother, not actual magic – a secret discovered

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:01.560
early on by a young boy unconvinced by a ‘disappearing
bird’ trick.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.159
The boy sees what the audience doesn’t,
but even his rival’s horrifying loop of

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:10.770
suicide is explained using the same dead bird.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.960
The Dark Knight Rises - The League’s Mark

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.999
The third of Christopher Nolan’s Batman
films finds Bruce Wayne surprised and devastated,

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:26.340
discovering his corporate ally and lover “Miranda
Tate” is actually Talia al Ghul, daughter

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.089
of Batman Begins villain Ra’s al Ghul.

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:31.979
But her membership in the League of Shadows
is foreshadowed long before she confesses

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:32.979
it.

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:36.879
Bruce makes a note of a triangular scar on
her back which is never explained, but are

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:40.029
similar to those covering Bane’s head, implying
a link between the two.

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:44.069
Some have argued that the scar resembles the
brand of the League seen in Batman Begins,

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:47.810
but whatever the case, having a villain covered
in scars suggested there was more to “Miranda”

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.439
than met the eye.

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:52.150
Those are our picks for great clues hidden
in the background of movies.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.819
