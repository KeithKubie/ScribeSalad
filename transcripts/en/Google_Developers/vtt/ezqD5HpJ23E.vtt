LOUIS GRAY: Welcome to Google
Developers Weekly for

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.260
September 9, 2013.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.630
I'm Louis Gray, and this is our
highlight reel of what's

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.580
happening in the world
of Google Developers

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.440
on the set and off.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.860
This week in our GDL studios
was another big one

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.290
internationally and also another
big one for our root

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.640
access series.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.240
Martin Omander and Don Dodge
returned to our set for two

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.925
separate episodes.

00:00:26.925 --> 00:00:29.430
The first, to encourage startups
to stop finding

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.500
excuses and break down barriers
to make their ideas

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.670
successful.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.520
And later, touching on the hot
trend of indoor location

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.070
services, which is great news
for parents just like me who

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.420
have to know exactly where to
find bathrooms when we take

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.460
our kids to the mall.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.310
Startups also find their start
in places well beyond Silicon

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.630
Valley, of course.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.890
From Berlin, Martin Gorner
invited Nacho Coloma, author

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.400
of Simple DS and CTO of Koliseo
to help you make an

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.490
informed decision between
SQL and no SQL.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.820
Koliseo, a ticketing platform
built on App Engine, scales is

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.870
offering to meet peak demands
and Nacho wants

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.690
you to do the same.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.620
From Milan, Italy, Google
Developers expert Sandro

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.550
Paganotti demonstrated two key
features of HTML5, the

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.700
template and Shadow DOM.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.300
As we often say here at the
Googleplex, when talking about

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.160
the Shadow DOM, there really is
no better way to teach your

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.440
browser to include a subtree
of DOM elements.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.970
Moving from DOMs to documents,
and from Milan to the Big

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.360
Apple in New York City, Ibrahim
Ulukaya told those of

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.660
us who work on the YouTube API
the best way to get help and

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.320
find documents to make
our code even better.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.820
As you can imagine, beyond the
documents, what I need, tips

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.780
for my apps to get smart, I
turn to GDL and YouTube.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.740
From Buenos Aires, Nick
Bortolotti hosted developers

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.570
on the Google Maps team who
presented how you can connect

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.320
people to places using
the Places API.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.090
Nick speaks quickly, but he
means every single word.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.690
And finally, from our Tokyo
studio, Eiji Kitamura

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.080
discussed the Web Audio API,
which enables Chrome to

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.970
process and synthesize sound.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.479
Outside of our GDL studios, the
big news in both Android

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.570
and candy world's this week was
the announcement of Kit

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.650
Kat as the name of our next
version of Android.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.815
In news with more substance
and less chocolate,

00:02:16.815 --> 00:02:17.170
[BELL RINGING]

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.380
we announced that Android
has passed one

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.170
billion activations worldwide.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.240
Speaking of big numbers, coders
love a good challenge

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.050
and we have a great
one for you.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.690
The Google Cloud Platform
Developer Challenge is looking

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.370
for people to build locally
relevant web applications that

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.410
solve real world problems.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.850
And what's a challenge
without some prizes?

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.130
This one has cache awards.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.280
So check it out!

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.200
Speaking of the Cloud, this
week we launched Pearson

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.550
correlation, a new feature in
Big Query enabling you to

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.990
compare data and look for
insights that you might not be

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.670
able to see otherwise.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.570
Correlation also allows you to
test assumptions that you

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.640
might think be right
but you want to see

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.370
data to back you up.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.680
Your intuition plus Big
Query correlation

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.820
makes a powerful team.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.180
Now that you're exploring Big
Query, be sure to tune in

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.920
later today and watch Michael
Manoochehri and Felipe Hoffa

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.080
discuss Big Query correlation
and how you can use it to help

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.900
predict your future.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.260
Our data predicts another great
week here on Google

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.940
Developers Live.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.760
To make sure that you never miss
a thing from the world of

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.660
Google Developers, subscribe
