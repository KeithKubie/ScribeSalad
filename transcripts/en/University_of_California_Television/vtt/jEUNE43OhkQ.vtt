00:00:13.716 --> 00:00:16.549
(whimsical music)

00:00:21.852 --> 00:00:24.129
- I am gonna talk today about identifying

00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:27.967
the genetic underpinning of
autism spectrum disorders

00:00:27.967 --> 00:00:31.138
and then really wanna
talk about that as really

00:00:31.138 --> 00:00:33.289
the foundation for beginning
to understand not only

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:36.909
the biology of these disorders
but also something about

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:40.198
this complex interplay of
environment and biology

00:00:40.198 --> 00:00:42.165
that you've been hearing
about throughout much

00:00:42.165 --> 00:00:43.727
of the day today.

00:00:43.727 --> 00:00:45.706
I'm gonna start by just showing a video

00:00:45.706 --> 00:00:47.983
of a child with autism.

00:00:47.983 --> 00:00:49.016
Don't worry about the sound.

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:52.026
In fact, it's very hard to
hear but not having the sound,

00:00:52.026 --> 00:00:54.344
hopefully, also makes a point.

00:00:54.344 --> 00:00:57.511
You don't need clinical
training I don't think

00:00:57.511 --> 00:01:00.454
to be able to identify really
what is the sine qua non

00:01:00.454 --> 00:01:02.996
of the diagnosis of autism which
is a fundamental impairment

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:05.740
in reciprocal social communication.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.962
So I think you can tell
that this is a young man

00:01:08.962 --> 00:01:13.582
who is certainly not typically
developed in that regard.

00:01:13.582 --> 00:01:16.274
In a moment, he'll sit
down and start using

00:01:16.274 --> 00:01:18.128
a picture board to communicate

00:01:18.128 --> 00:01:22.707
and has very little useful
language which is also a hallmark

00:01:22.707 --> 00:01:25.071
of those social communication deficits

00:01:25.071 --> 00:01:27.482
that is particularly prevalent

00:01:27.482 --> 00:01:30.827
in more severe cases of autism.

00:01:30.827 --> 00:01:33.475
Also, at the beginning you
saw I believe that he flapped

00:01:33.475 --> 00:01:36.750
his hands in the second
domain for the diagnoses.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.380
Those kinds of repetitive behaviors

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.894
are highly restricted interest.

00:01:40.894 --> 00:01:43.805
So understanding the
genetics of this syndrome,

00:01:43.805 --> 00:01:46.260
despite the fact that we've
known for several decades

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.613
that autism does run in families,

00:01:49.613 --> 00:01:51.688
has been extremely difficult.

00:01:51.688 --> 00:01:53.507
We spent much of the
early part of my career

00:01:53.507 --> 00:01:56.286
spending more time arguing
about why we couldn't get

00:01:56.286 --> 00:01:57.889
the same answer than we
did in being able to lay

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:59.373
a strong foundation for understanding

00:01:59.373 --> 00:02:00.867
the neurobiology of the disorder.

00:02:00.867 --> 00:02:03.849
Want to talk to you about the
strategy that my lab chose

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:05.839
to pursue, a number of other labs as well,

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:10.006
which was understanding that
there was this very complex set

00:02:11.507 --> 00:02:16.121
of levels of analysis
potentially to try to address

00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:18.289
from molecule all the
way to complex behavior,

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:21.025
that our thought was that
if there was a possibility

00:02:21.025 --> 00:02:23.853
that we could go from the
complex behavior directly

00:02:23.853 --> 00:02:25.957
to the molecule, meaning
to get us directly to DNA,

00:02:25.957 --> 00:02:29.178
that that could be valuable in
laying sort of the foundation

00:02:29.178 --> 00:02:32.273
then to pull on that thread
to be able to get to more

00:02:32.273 --> 00:02:34.336
and more complex levels of analysis

00:02:34.336 --> 00:02:36.443
and really the whole idea behind this,

00:02:36.443 --> 00:02:39.055
I don't think I could've had
a day that had better set up

00:02:39.055 --> 00:02:41.774
for sort of laying out
why this was a hypothesis

00:02:41.774 --> 00:02:44.280
but the notion that if we could understand

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.943
the detailed biology of autism

00:02:45.943 --> 00:02:48.065
and other neurodevelopmental disorders,

00:02:48.065 --> 00:02:49.901
this could give us the
kind of opportunities

00:02:49.901 --> 00:02:51.822
that you've heard about today
with regard to amblyopia

00:02:51.822 --> 00:02:54.231
and neurodegenerative
disorders, et cetera.

00:02:54.231 --> 00:02:56.877
So, there are many reasons
why we thought that this might

00:02:56.877 --> 00:02:58.606
be a reasonable strategy.

00:02:58.606 --> 00:03:01.071
Among them is that in some ways,

00:03:01.071 --> 00:03:03.768
we had the sense that this was
really the simplest approach

00:03:03.768 --> 00:03:05.415
to try to begin to understand something

00:03:05.415 --> 00:03:06.416
as complex as autism.

00:03:06.416 --> 00:03:09.097
Not a trivial undertaking to try to find

00:03:09.097 --> 00:03:12.155
which individual changes
among three billion bases

00:03:12.155 --> 00:03:16.088
in the human genome present in
every cell that has a nucleus

00:03:16.088 --> 00:03:19.516
in the nucleus but orders
of magnitude less complex,

00:03:19.516 --> 00:03:21.895
in my view when I was starting my lab,

00:03:21.895 --> 00:03:24.014
than the 100 billion neurons that make up

00:03:24.014 --> 00:03:25.810
the human central nervous system

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.979
and orders of magnitude still
less complex than trying

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:32.832
to understand the hundred
trillion connections

00:03:32.832 --> 00:03:35.137
and you've heard a lot
about synapses today.

00:03:35.137 --> 00:03:38.238
So we decided to take this approach.

00:03:38.238 --> 00:03:40.752
You could call it really
a reductionist approach

00:03:40.752 --> 00:03:43.155
to trying to, as I said,

00:03:43.155 --> 00:03:44.689
get at the simplest part of the problem

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:46.293
and then move forward.

00:03:46.293 --> 00:03:49.841
We did that starting about
10 years ago by focusing

00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:51.891
on something called De Novo mutation.

00:03:51.891 --> 00:03:54.160
So when people think about genetics,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.430
they often sort of think
about that as synonymous

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.438
with the transmission of genetic risk

00:03:59.438 --> 00:04:00.437
from one generation to the other,

00:04:00.437 --> 00:04:02.213
from grandparents to parents to children,

00:04:02.213 --> 00:04:04.093
but it's also the case as the small amount

00:04:04.093 --> 00:04:06.625
of genetic variation is
introduced into the genome

00:04:06.625 --> 00:04:08.383
in each generation.

00:04:08.383 --> 00:04:11.964
So there is quite a bit of
variation in the human genome.

00:04:11.964 --> 00:04:13.595
If you turn to your left or your right,

00:04:13.595 --> 00:04:17.014
you are 99% identical to the
person sitting next to you,

00:04:17.014 --> 00:04:18.085
level of your genome.

00:04:18.085 --> 00:04:19.333
So I hope you got a good seat.

00:04:19.333 --> 00:04:21.281
I enjoyed (laughs),

00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:22.270
(audience laughs)

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.409
I enjoyed mine

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:27.409
but within that, even
though it's about 1%,

00:04:28.272 --> 00:04:31.322
that's still 30 million
differences that you have

00:04:31.322 --> 00:04:32.926
between you and the person
sitting next to you.

00:04:32.926 --> 00:04:36.287
We were interested in de novo
mutation for several reasons.

00:04:36.287 --> 00:04:38.415
So the first is that, if a de novo,

00:04:38.415 --> 00:04:40.662
if a new mutation which is
introduced at a low rate

00:04:40.662 --> 00:04:42.714
into the genome in every
generation is connected

00:04:42.714 --> 00:04:46.118
with something like a
neurodevelopmental disorder

00:04:46.118 --> 00:04:49.111
to the extent that it
has a significant effect,

00:04:49.111 --> 00:04:52.260
over time it will be
eliminated from the genome

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.498
by natural selection.

00:04:53.498 --> 00:04:55.550
But for de novo mutation,

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.428
natural selection has
very little time to act.

00:04:57.428 --> 00:05:00.461
So unless the mutation is
lethal in the generation

00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:01.641
in which it's present,

00:05:01.641 --> 00:05:04.270
you can have genetic
variations, mutations,

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.431
that have very large
biological effects and still,

00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:08.283
if you can find the de novo mutation,

00:05:08.283 --> 00:05:12.450
you're able then to be able to
use that as a starting point

00:05:14.587 --> 00:05:15.420
and if you're interested in genetics,

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.127
as a way to understand
neurobiology starting

00:05:18.127 --> 00:05:21.324
with something that has many,
many fold increase in risk

00:05:21.324 --> 00:05:23.472
versus a small percentage
increase in risk.

00:05:23.472 --> 00:05:24.920
Seemed like a smart strategy.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.452
This also comported with
a clinical observation

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:29.518
for many years that many families come

00:05:29.518 --> 00:05:30.595
to clinical attention,

00:05:30.595 --> 00:05:32.573
I'm a child psychiatrist and can tell you

00:05:32.573 --> 00:05:35.193
that it was observations
in our clinic as well,

00:05:35.193 --> 00:05:38.222
that a substantial portion
come in where there doesn't

00:05:38.222 --> 00:05:39.633
appear to be any strong family history,

00:05:39.633 --> 00:05:42.117
suggesting that those
families in particular

00:05:42.117 --> 00:05:45.239
might have been vulnerable to
the spontaneous new mutations,

00:05:45.239 --> 00:05:46.641
de novo mutations,

00:05:46.641 --> 00:05:48.726
contributing to their
disorder and then there were

00:05:48.726 --> 00:05:51.401
two key papers in 2007 and 2008,

00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:55.568
I think the most relevant one
and truly seminal paper was,

00:05:58.274 --> 00:06:00.264
the lead author was Jonathan Sebat

00:06:00.264 --> 00:06:01.576
who's a professor here at UCSD,

00:06:01.576 --> 00:06:05.153
showing that de novo mutations
in fine chromosomal structure

00:06:05.153 --> 00:06:09.131
were much more frequent in
kids with autism if they came

00:06:09.131 --> 00:06:10.887
from a family without a family history

00:06:10.887 --> 00:06:13.408
than any other group
that they compared to.

00:06:13.408 --> 00:06:16.153
We then got very lucky
and were able to study

00:06:16.153 --> 00:06:19.267
a group of kids in the
Simons Simplex collection

00:06:19.267 --> 00:06:22.217
that was designed to
try to help us promote

00:06:22.217 --> 00:06:25.458
these kinds of mutations and
this diagram shows really

00:06:25.458 --> 00:06:27.839
the experimental design
which is to find families

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:30.289
that look essentially like they'd been hit

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.755
by a bolt of lightning where
the blue represents unaffected

00:06:32.755 --> 00:06:34.033
and red affected.

00:06:34.033 --> 00:06:36.524
So to have unaffected parents
and if there were siblings,

00:06:36.524 --> 00:06:39.512
to have them be unaffected
as well and only be able

00:06:39.512 --> 00:06:42.390
to have a single affected
member in the family

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.876
in order to be able to
participate in this cohort

00:06:44.876 --> 00:06:48.313
and then what we were able
to do then is to take a look

00:06:48.313 --> 00:06:51.354
and compare the parents to
the children and anything

00:06:51.354 --> 00:06:53.831
that was present in the
children that was not present

00:06:53.831 --> 00:06:56.243
in the parents was either a
mistake or a de novo mutation

00:06:56.243 --> 00:06:59.541
and the second thing that
we were able to do is then

00:06:59.541 --> 00:07:02.268
to compare affected children
to their unaffected siblings.

00:07:02.268 --> 00:07:04.640
So a beautifully controlled
experiment that allows us

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.998
to ask the same question
again that Jonathan Sebat

00:07:06.998 --> 00:07:09.598
and Mike Wiggler asked.

00:07:09.598 --> 00:07:12.333
I wanna give you two other
kind of senses about why

00:07:12.333 --> 00:07:14.580
de novo mutation can be
so powerful to the extent

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.153
that it contributes to disease.

00:07:16.153 --> 00:07:18.157
The first is that I've
already told you that there

00:07:18.157 --> 00:07:20.110
are about 30 million
differences between you

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.937
and the person sitting next
to you so you can think

00:07:21.937 --> 00:07:24.710
about that as a forest of
genetic variation and, in fact,

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.974
with de novo mutation,

00:07:26.974 --> 00:07:29.088
I love this picture because
it really represents

00:07:29.088 --> 00:07:31.595
about one de novo mutation per generation

00:07:31.595 --> 00:07:34.643
in the human genome so out of,

00:07:34.643 --> 00:07:37.134
in a section of that,
that codes for genes.

00:07:37.134 --> 00:07:39.590
So it gives you very strong
signal-to-noise properties.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.948
You can really identify where that is

00:07:41.948 --> 00:07:44.196
and you're counting to very
low numbers and since I,

00:07:44.196 --> 00:07:46.679
like Jay apparently, am
mathematically challenged,

00:07:46.679 --> 00:07:49.414
counting to one is something
that we've been able to do

00:07:49.414 --> 00:07:50.417
in the laboratory.

00:07:50.417 --> 00:07:51.949
(audience laughs)

00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:54.441
Now the second think is that
this is a big, a large area,

00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:56.487
this forest and we have very few events

00:07:56.487 --> 00:07:59.665
so we could also leverage an approach

00:07:59.665 --> 00:08:02.065
to statistical analysis
that allowed us really

00:08:02.065 --> 00:08:03.973
to just ask the question,

00:08:03.973 --> 00:08:06.108
if we saw kind of de novo
mutations per particular spot

00:08:06.108 --> 00:08:07.106
in the genome,

00:08:07.106 --> 00:08:08.554
if we looked at an unrelated child,

00:08:08.554 --> 00:08:11.128
could we see lightning striking twice?

00:08:11.128 --> 00:08:12.409
So we put those two things together.

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:16.306
This good signal-to-noise ratio
and this idea of recurrence

00:08:16.306 --> 00:08:19.526
of these very rare
spontaneous events in order

00:08:19.526 --> 00:08:21.946
to identify genes contributing to ASD.

00:08:21.946 --> 00:08:24.995
One of the first findings
that we published in 2011,

00:08:24.995 --> 00:08:28.845
first replicated what
Jonathan Sebat and Mike Wigler

00:08:28.845 --> 00:08:31.450
had done with about 10
times the sample size,

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.747
which was an enormous relief, I imagine,

00:08:33.747 --> 00:08:35.927
to the entire field given
that psychiatric genetics

00:08:35.927 --> 00:08:38.589
had spent many years as I
said arguing with each other

00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:40.369
about why we could not replicate.

00:08:40.369 --> 00:08:42.826
So replication was kind
of a pop the cork moment

00:08:42.826 --> 00:08:45.759
but this finding in particular,
in addition to that,

00:08:45.759 --> 00:08:48.930
we were able to identify a
new small region of the genome

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.098
contributing to ASD,
Autism Spectrum Disorders,

00:08:51.098 --> 00:08:53.842
and that was on chromosome 7

00:08:53.842 --> 00:08:56.552
and we found that if you had an extra copy

00:08:56.552 --> 00:09:00.496
of the small number of genes
within this chromosomal region,

00:09:00.496 --> 00:09:02.040
there are about 25 that reside there,

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.641
that you would have
classically defined autism

00:09:04.641 --> 00:09:06.565
and look very much like
the child that I showed you

00:09:06.565 --> 00:09:07.647
in the first video.

00:09:07.647 --> 00:09:10.461
We also knew though that
there was another syndrome

00:09:10.461 --> 00:09:14.580
that had previously been
described that was the consequence

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.399
of the loss of exactly the same gene.

00:09:17.399 --> 00:09:20.085
So autism, there were additional copies,

00:09:20.085 --> 00:09:21.190
and in this case, there was a loss

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:22.875
and I'm gonna show you another video.

00:09:22.875 --> 00:09:24.708
Here we do need sound.

00:09:25.688 --> 00:09:26.912
- Hello, buddy.

00:09:26.912 --> 00:09:28.393
How are you?

00:09:28.393 --> 00:09:29.565
- I really watch you on ABC news.

00:09:29.565 --> 00:09:30.583
- Oh, thank you.

00:09:30.583 --> 00:09:31.743
Thank you.

00:09:31.743 --> 00:09:33.283
- What's your favorite color

00:09:33.283 --> 00:09:35.008
and what's your favorite TV show?

00:09:35.008 --> 00:09:36.975
- [Narrator] Kids love to
ask questions but not as much

00:09:36.975 --> 00:09:38.602
as these kids.

00:09:38.602 --> 00:09:39.741
- My favorite color is blue.

00:09:39.741 --> 00:09:42.594
I have met Barney the Dinosaur.

00:09:42.594 --> 00:09:44.867
(group cheers)

00:09:44.867 --> 00:09:45.885
- Where do you live?

00:09:45.885 --> 00:09:47.316
- I live in New York City.

00:09:47.316 --> 00:09:48.885
- [Male] Do you have
any sons or daughters?

00:09:48.885 --> 00:09:50.282
- I do.

00:09:50.282 --> 00:09:51.627
I have two daughters and a son.

00:09:51.627 --> 00:09:52.707
- [Male] Wow!

00:09:52.707 --> 00:09:53.741
- [Narrator] And kids love to make friends

00:09:53.741 --> 00:09:55.133
but not like these kids.

00:09:55.133 --> 00:09:56.369
- [Male] What nationality are you?

00:09:56.369 --> 00:09:57.838
- I'm Italian.

00:09:57.838 --> 00:09:59.426
- [Male] Ciao to you, buddy.

00:09:59.426 --> 00:10:02.743
- So that is William Syndrome.

00:10:02.743 --> 00:10:04.778
Fascinating syndrome.

00:10:04.778 --> 00:10:07.027
We could spend the rest of the talk here

00:10:07.027 --> 00:10:08.612
and probably several others telling you

00:10:08.612 --> 00:10:10.131
about how interesting that syndrome is

00:10:10.131 --> 00:10:11.449
but for the sake of this talk,

00:10:11.449 --> 00:10:13.362
what I wanted to point out is that, again,

00:10:13.362 --> 00:10:14.872
you don't need any
clinical training to see

00:10:14.872 --> 00:10:17.358
the profound differences and
interest in social relations

00:10:17.358 --> 00:10:20.791
in affiliation in this
group of kids versus kind

00:10:20.791 --> 00:10:23.326
of the example that I gave
you of the first child

00:10:23.326 --> 00:10:25.669
where the core deficit is a failure

00:10:25.669 --> 00:10:28.675
of that reciprocal social communication.

00:10:28.675 --> 00:10:31.720
So when you think about this,

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.665
so what we laid out was a
hypothesis that you could go

00:10:34.665 --> 00:10:36.419
from a complex behavioral phenotype,

00:10:36.419 --> 00:10:38.794
go to the genome and
then work your way back

00:10:38.794 --> 00:10:41.206
and I think it would be
reasonable to be skeptical about.

00:10:41.206 --> 00:10:44.868
That's a long distance between
a change and a small section

00:10:44.868 --> 00:10:49.269
of the genome going through
molecules, cells, circuits,

00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:53.324
behavior and brain and
invoking additional things

00:10:53.324 --> 00:10:54.493
like environment and experience

00:10:54.493 --> 00:10:58.555
but this gave us, I think, a
shot in the arm about thinking

00:10:58.555 --> 00:11:00.047
that at least in some cases,

00:11:00.047 --> 00:11:01.574
this was a viable approach

00:11:01.574 --> 00:11:03.311
because if you do the thought experiment,

00:11:03.311 --> 00:11:07.061
if we could understand what
it was about these 25 genes

00:11:07.061 --> 00:11:09.158
in the genome or the subset of them

00:11:09.158 --> 00:11:10.688
that we're contributing
to this difference,

00:11:10.688 --> 00:11:13.621
that you're looking at a
powerful rheostat of something

00:11:13.621 --> 00:11:16.974
as complex as social affiliation.

00:11:16.974 --> 00:11:19.326
As genomic tools advance,

00:11:19.326 --> 00:11:22.105
we're able to move from looking
at segments of the genome,

00:11:22.105 --> 00:11:23.506
this fine structure of chromosomes,

00:11:23.506 --> 00:11:27.179
to do the same experiments
again at much higher resolution,

00:11:27.179 --> 00:11:29.360
now to the single letter
of the genetic code

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.181
in all the genes of the
genome simultaneously

00:11:32.181 --> 00:11:34.798
and what you're looking at
here is a summary from 2015

00:11:34.798 --> 00:11:39.032
that's giving you now a picture
of all of the reliable genes

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:40.932
that we've been able to
identify that are contributing

00:11:40.932 --> 00:11:42.321
to autism spectrum disorders,

00:11:42.321 --> 00:11:46.096
again with a substantial portion
of these conferring many,

00:11:46.096 --> 00:11:48.248
many fold increases in risk.

00:11:48.248 --> 00:11:50.680
They're individually rare
in people but in the person

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.087
that they exist,

00:11:52.087 --> 00:11:54.573
they are having profound
biological effects.

00:11:54.573 --> 00:11:56.279
This is Stephan Sanders on the right.

00:11:56.279 --> 00:11:58.320
He was a post doc at the time in the lab,

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.491
now a junior faculty at UCSF,

00:11:59.491 --> 00:12:03.800
brilliant young guy who
led several of the studies

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.729
that led to this kind of summary statement

00:12:05.729 --> 00:12:07.985
that includes not only our
work but work of laboratories

00:12:07.985 --> 00:12:11.612
around the world that have replicated both

00:12:11.612 --> 00:12:15.695
the initial observations
around de novo mutations

00:12:17.068 --> 00:12:18.989
as well as the specific gene shown here.

00:12:18.989 --> 00:12:21.234
So where does that leave us?

00:12:21.234 --> 00:12:25.118
Now, we've gone from a situation where,

00:12:25.118 --> 00:12:27.661
at least for the first
15 years of my career,

00:12:27.661 --> 00:12:29.698
it was like wandering in the desert.

00:12:29.698 --> 00:12:32.651
I would've given anything
to find a single gene

00:12:32.651 --> 00:12:35.135
associated with autism
spectrum disorder that I felt

00:12:35.135 --> 00:12:39.119
I knew reliably and now
we have a series of genes.

00:12:39.119 --> 00:12:43.607
There are 60 genes that were
represented in that picture

00:12:43.607 --> 00:12:46.215
as well as a number of
chromosomal segments.

00:12:46.215 --> 00:12:49.986
So, and that reflects only
a small number of the genes

00:12:49.986 --> 00:12:52.064
that we now predict are going to be found

00:12:52.064 --> 00:12:54.558
that can contribute to
autism spectrum disorders.

00:12:54.558 --> 00:12:58.374
This is a version of a diagram
actually that we put together

00:12:58.374 --> 00:13:02.084
with Pat Levitt before the
advances that I've described

00:13:02.084 --> 00:13:04.380
for you because they
have been fairly recent

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.902
and at the time was aspirational
but has turned out to be

00:13:06.902 --> 00:13:09.799
actually I think a pretty
good representation of sort of

00:13:09.799 --> 00:13:11.708
where we are and where we're heading.

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:14.760
So the diagram is supposed
to show the same kind

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.364
of progression where we have
genes and there are many

00:13:18.364 --> 00:13:21.009
of them distributed across
the genome that then underlie

00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:24.661
some biology and we hypothesized
before we found the genes

00:13:24.661 --> 00:13:27.039
that they would not be
randomly associated but,

00:13:27.039 --> 00:13:29.479
in fact, would point us to
specific biological processes

00:13:29.479 --> 00:13:30.963
and that has turned out to be the case.

00:13:30.963 --> 00:13:32.859
One of the strongest signals that we have

00:13:32.859 --> 00:13:36.199
is that these mutations
preferentially target genes

00:13:36.199 --> 00:13:38.421
that are involved in synaptic
formation and function.

00:13:38.421 --> 00:13:41.096
There are other broad areas of
biology but it's turned out,

00:13:41.096 --> 00:13:43.307
you've heard all day about
the importance of synapses

00:13:43.307 --> 00:13:45.470
and it turns out that
they are quite important

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:46.501
for autism as well.

00:13:46.501 --> 00:13:50.240
That somehow that's mediated
through the developing brain,

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.699
this is a picture of the
brain developing in a circle

00:13:53.699 --> 00:13:55.736
from embryo all the
way to the adult brain.

00:13:55.736 --> 00:13:58.749
Just to remind you that
while we found some biology,

00:13:58.749 --> 00:14:02.740
that that biology's being
expressed across development

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.262
in the brain and that we
don't go directly from genes

00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:09.536
to behavior and that
we know that we're now

00:14:09.536 --> 00:14:11.922
about to find genes that
dramatically increase

00:14:11.922 --> 00:14:12.944
the risk for autism.

00:14:12.944 --> 00:14:16.177
There's some additional
complexities here and one of them

00:14:16.177 --> 00:14:17.010
that we found right off the bat

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:18.469
is that while we were finding genes

00:14:18.469 --> 00:14:21.211
that were very reliably associated with

00:14:21.211 --> 00:14:23.578
a dramatically increased risk for autism,

00:14:23.578 --> 00:14:25.765
our colleagues studying
intellectual disability, epilepsy,

00:14:25.765 --> 00:14:27.917
and schizophrenia were finding some

00:14:27.917 --> 00:14:29.753
of the exact same regions of the genome.

00:14:29.753 --> 00:14:32.718
So this presents an important but I think

00:14:32.718 --> 00:14:36.885
a not only challenging but
optimistic kind of concept

00:14:39.565 --> 00:14:42.686
because you've heard about this notion

00:14:42.686 --> 00:14:47.520
of the potential plasticity
and what this tells us

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.707
is that even if you have a gene
that it profoundly increases

00:14:50.707 --> 00:14:51.713
the risk for autism,

00:14:51.713 --> 00:14:55.788
that for some people, you
see nothing for the first 15,

00:14:55.788 --> 00:14:59.544
18 years of life suggesting
that genes are not fate

00:14:59.544 --> 00:15:02.837
even ones that carry large
risk but somehow that all

00:15:02.837 --> 00:15:05.070
the things that we're talking
about today could potentially

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.215
be important in determining
how these play out over time

00:15:08.215 --> 00:15:11.387
and this diagram shows at
the bottom there that there

00:15:11.387 --> 00:15:14.429
are a variety of things
that you could hypothesize

00:15:14.429 --> 00:15:15.494
might be involved in that,

00:15:15.494 --> 00:15:18.423
epigenetics involvement of the kind

00:15:18.423 --> 00:15:20.381
of cellular molecular environment,

00:15:20.381 --> 00:15:23.065
other kind of genetic variance
that have smaller effect

00:15:23.065 --> 00:15:26.042
but help dictate how these
large genetic risks play out

00:15:26.042 --> 00:15:29.035
and potentially for some individuals' luck

00:15:29.035 --> 00:15:31.383
but it does also open up this notion

00:15:31.383 --> 00:15:33.299
of potential plasticity.

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:36.305
Something I also, that
Mark did a beautiful job

00:15:36.305 --> 00:15:39.208
of laying out the three
hypotheses about the development

00:15:39.208 --> 00:15:41.746
of neurodevelopmental disorders,

00:15:41.746 --> 00:15:43.972
the pessimistic one
and the optimistic one,

00:15:43.972 --> 00:15:47.379
and I think it's important
to keep that in mind,

00:15:47.379 --> 00:15:48.212
particularly in autism,

00:15:48.212 --> 00:15:49.557
something where there's a
large genetic complement

00:15:49.557 --> 00:15:52.144
and you see this playing out in very life.

00:15:52.144 --> 00:15:55.173
It is also the case that
despite the fact that we are not

00:15:55.173 --> 00:15:57.442
anywhere near satisfied
with the treatments

00:15:57.442 --> 00:15:59.009
that we're able to provide,

00:15:59.009 --> 00:16:00.806
that kids do improve
with early intervention.

00:16:00.806 --> 00:16:02.584
Again, I think pointing
to the fact that genes

00:16:02.584 --> 00:16:05.215
are not fate and that
beginning to use this body

00:16:05.215 --> 00:16:08.841
of knowledge to understand how
this genetic risk plays out

00:16:08.841 --> 00:16:12.353
over time leading either to
multiple disorders or not

00:16:12.353 --> 00:16:16.520
or improving over time is
something that is quite important.

00:16:18.327 --> 00:16:19.441
So I think where we end is that,

00:16:19.441 --> 00:16:23.242
this talk at least but hopefully
not in the field (laughs),

00:16:23.242 --> 00:16:25.695
is that on the left side of the diagram,

00:16:25.695 --> 00:16:28.736
we now have made significant
progress not only

00:16:28.736 --> 00:16:30.854
in understanding the genetic substrate

00:16:30.854 --> 00:16:32.523
but beginning to define what
the biological processes

00:16:32.523 --> 00:16:35.431
are and many labs using the kinds of tools

00:16:35.431 --> 00:16:38.321
that you heard about all
day today are now beginning

00:16:38.321 --> 00:16:40.723
to place in a developmental
context to understand

00:16:40.723 --> 00:16:44.697
the timing of the genetic risk
and how that's playing out.

00:16:44.697 --> 00:16:47.655
I think that leads to, we hope,

00:16:47.655 --> 00:16:52.155
the substrate to begin to
attack these problems in the way

00:16:52.155 --> 00:16:53.607
that you've been hearing
all day that we're attacking

00:16:53.607 --> 00:16:56.721
other complex disorders
where the underlying biology

00:16:56.721 --> 00:16:59.657
has been more clear than
it's been for complex

00:16:59.657 --> 00:17:03.542
neuropsychiatric disorders
and so I want to end by,

00:17:03.542 --> 00:17:06.096
as with everyone else, you know,

00:17:06.096 --> 00:17:08.449
I get to stand up and give
the talk and have a list

00:17:08.449 --> 00:17:09.993
of people who did all the heavy lifting

00:17:09.993 --> 00:17:12.346
and particularly want to
point to Stephan Sanders

00:17:12.346 --> 00:17:14.714
for the remarkable work that
he's done on gene discovery

00:17:14.714 --> 00:17:17.697
and my collaborators
really around the country

00:17:17.697 --> 00:17:19.853
who've made this work possible

00:17:19.853 --> 00:17:24.235
and can't end without also
thanking not only the funders

00:17:24.235 --> 00:17:27.220
but most importantly the
families that contributed

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.658
to the Simons Simplex
collection that we were able

00:17:29.658 --> 00:17:32.272
to study so productively
for the last decade or so.

00:17:32.272 --> 00:17:33.105
Thanks very much.

00:17:33.105 --> 00:17:36.105
(audience applause)

00:17:44.608 --> 00:17:47.441
(whimsical music)
