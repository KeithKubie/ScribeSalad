00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.890
So in a recent video we
did on radical openness,

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.670
we talked about the
importance of technology

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.480
as something that creates new
possibilities in the world.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.900
Technology acts as a kind
of cognitive scaffolding

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.320
that extends the
reach of our agency.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.610
It extends our
possibilities outwards,

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.570
beyond the biological
skin tissue.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.420
And it also unearths
new modalities

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.820
of artistry, new languages
of human subjectivity.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.290
New ways to narrate human
becoming, the becoming

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.260
of the imagination, of the
subjective perspective.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.420
Imagine how
impoverished the world

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.145
would have been if we didn't
have the technology of oil

00:00:50.145 --> 00:00:53.534
painting in time for Van
Gogh's genius to unfurl,

00:00:53.534 --> 00:00:55.950
or how impoverished the world
would have been if we didn't

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.480
have the musical instrument
technology in time

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.030
for Beethoven's genius,
Beethoven's voice

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.120
to be burst through that prism.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.280
New technologies, new
modalities, new possibilities.
