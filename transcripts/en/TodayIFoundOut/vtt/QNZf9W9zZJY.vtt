00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.850
Hello I'm Daven Hiskey and you're watching
the Today I Found Out youtube channel.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.501
In the video today we're looking at how the
practice of saying I'm Going to Disneyland

00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:12.179
after winning a major sporting event got started,
and whether any of these athletes actually

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.420
go to Disneyland after.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.570
In January of 1987, CEO of Disney, Michael
Eisner, and his wife were having dinner with

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.580
Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.880
Rutan and Yeager had just recently become
the first to fly an aircraft around the world

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.530
without re-fueling or stopping.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.090
At a certain point in the dinner, Eisner's
wife, Jane, asked Rutan and Yeager what they

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.220
were going to do now that they'd achieved
this momentous milestone.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.870
The response she got was, "Well, we're going
to Disneyland."

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.970
Jane Eisner thought this would make a great
slogan in an advertising campaign and suggested

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.230
it to her husband, Michael.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.600
Michael Eisner liked it and decided that Disney
would use this slogan in a commercial following

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.780
Super Bowl XXI, in 1987 in which the New York
Giants defeated the Denver Broncos 39-20.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.980
The athlete they got to star in this commercial
was the quarterback for the Giants, Phil Simms.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.890
During the game, Simms completed one of the
better performances by a quarterback in Super

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.750
Bowl history, going 22 for 25 in pass completions
for a total of 268 yards.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.860
Even more remarkable was the fact that two
of the three incomplete passes were good throws,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.200
simply dropped by the receivers.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.250
He also set the record for most consecutive
pass completions in a Super Bowl game.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.010
For this outstanding performance, Simms was
named the MVP of Super Bowl XXI and offered

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:32.330
$75,000 (about $160,000 today) by Disney to
appear in their commercial, with his part

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.220
filmed directly after the game.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.900
During this, he was to say "I'm gonna go to
Disney World!" with alternate takes having

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.510
him say "Disneyland" instead of "Disney World".

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.390
Disney then followed this up with making three
more such commercials in 1987, following other

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.110
major sporting championships.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.420
These included hiring: yachtsman Dennis Conner,
after winning the America's Cup; NBA star

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.340
Magic Johnson, after the Lakers won the NBA
Finals, and Major League Baseball player Frank

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.970
Viola, after the Twins won the World Series
that year.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.900
So at this point you may be wondering if the
people paid to utter these words actually

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.620
end up going to Disneyland or Disney World
after filming the ad spot.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.500
It turns out, that yes, many do.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.280
You see, Disney gives them an "MVP" all-expense
paid trip, flying them on a private jet to

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.030
Disneyland or Disney World and then further
puts their family up in a luxory suite for

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.610
the duration of their vacation.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.330
They also are made the Grand Marshall of a
parade and take part in various events for

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.720
Disney during their stay.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.620
Bonus Facts:

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.370
If you’re wondering why American Football
is called that and so-called “European”

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.430
Football is called “Soccer” in America,
Soccer was a popular name for Football in

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.530
Britain in the sport’s earliest days.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.900
When the rules for the sport were first being
defined, it was named “Association Football”

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.650
to distinguish it from the many other forms
of football commonly played.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.860
Within a year of its inception, this got slurred
down to “Assoccer,” after the common practice

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.379
of adding “-er” to nicknames at the time
in Britain.

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.400
Very shortly after this, “Assoccer” became
“Soccer,” which remained a semi-popular

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.640
nickname for the sport in Britain until about
a half century ago, along with just calling

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.640
it “Football.”

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.640
The game initially spread throughout the world
primarily known as “Football.”

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.400
However, in countries where other forms of
football already were dominate, the nickname

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.760
“Soccer” was, and in some cases still
is, the preferred name to avoid confusion.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.220
The average NFL game is about 3 hours and
11 minutes long.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.489
However, only about 11 minutes of that span
features actual game play.

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.280
Championship Football games are called “bowls”
thanks to a stadium designed by Myron Hunt,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.280
Rose Bowl.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.069
Rose Bowl was modeled after the design of
Yale’s stadium, Yale Bowl, which got its

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.270
name from the fact that it resembled a bowl.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.519
Gradually other cities and universities with
Football teams saw the money making opportunities

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.569
and promotional value of these tournament
games, like the Rose Bowl, and began creating

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.879
their own “bowl” games, even though many
of these games were not played in bowl shaped

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:43.879
stadiums.

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:54.940
The NFL eventually borrowed this terminology
when they created the Pro Bowl 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:05.840
in 1951, and later, of course, the Super Bowl.
