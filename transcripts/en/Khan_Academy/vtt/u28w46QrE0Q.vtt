00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.030
Let's solve some more
rational equations.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:11.640
So let's say I have x plus
1/x is equal to 2.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.635
Once again, we have an x in a
denominator over here, it

00:00:14.635 --> 00:00:16.100
looks kind of bizarre.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.660
But you just have to remember,
if we multiply every term in

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.210
this equation by this
denominator, right here, by

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.980
this x, right there, then
essentially, you'll have x

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.540
times 1/x and the x will
disappear out of the

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.130
denominator.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.920
So let's do that.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.860
So we have to multiply every
term by that, you can't just

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.230
multiply one term.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.840
So multiply this term times
x, this term times x,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.300
and the 2 times x.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.320
We're just multiplying both
sides of this equation by this

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.300
denominator.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.640
So what do we get?

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:54.860
We get x times x is x squared
plus x times 1/x is just 1.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.890
x's cancel out.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.540
And then that's going
to be equal to 2x.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.269
And this is starting
to look like our

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.400
standard quadratic equations.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.650
We just have to subtract
2x from both sides.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.650
And if we do that-- so let me
subtract 2x from there,

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.060
subtract 2x from there-- the
left-hand side of our equation

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.160
becomes x squared
minus 2x plus 1.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.850
And the right-hand side
is equal to 0.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.800
And we know how to solve
an equation like this.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.410
We could either factor or use
the quadratic formula.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.050
This actually seems pretty
straightforward to factor.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.120
Negative 1 times negative
1 is 1.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.580
Negative 1 plus negative
1 is negative 2.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:47.140
So this is x minus 1 times
x minus 1 is equal to 0.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.170
And we know, if two numbers,
when you multiply them, they

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.050
equal 0, that means one or both
of those numbers have to

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.310
be equal to 0.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.470
In this situation, the number
is the same, right?

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.310
This is x minus 1 squared
is equal to 0, right?

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.700
So we know that x minus 1
has to be equal to 0.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.243
Add 1 to both sides of this
equation and we get

00:02:10.243 --> 00:02:13.840
x is equal to 1.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.870
And you can verify it.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.080
Verify that this works.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.680
1 plus 1/1 does, indeed,
equal 2.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.340
So it definitely does work.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.470
Let's do a more involved one
now, now that we're warmed up.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:44.150
Let's say I have 2 over x
squared plus 4x plus 3 is

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:54.960
equal to 2 plus x minus
2 over x minus 3.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.270
So just like we've done in the
last problem and in all of the

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.880
other ones, we want to get all
of these x's out of the

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.510
denominator.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.380
And the best way to do it is to
multiply every term in this

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.790
equation by-- you can view it
as the least common multiple

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.140
of the denominator.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.940
So let me show you what
I'm talking about.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.100
The first thing we might want
to do is factor this, to see

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.620
if this guy and this guy have
anything in common.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.880
So let's see if we
can factor it.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.050
What two numbers when you
multiply them equal 3 and when

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.240
you add them equal 4?

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.710
Well, 3 and 1, right?

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:33.710
So this right here, I can
rewrite it as x plus 3 and--

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.580
and really this is a plus
over there, too.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.760
I wrote the original
problem wrong.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.820
That is a [? product. ?]

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:46.010
So this over here on the left
is x plus 3 times x plus 1.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.420
And so, what can we multiply
both sides of this equation by

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.305
to get rid of the x plus 3 and
an x plus 1 here, and an x

00:03:53.305 --> 00:03:54.990
plus 3 over there?

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.830
Well, we multiply everything
by x plus 3 and

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.530
then by x plus 1.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.320
So this expression right here is
actually divisible by this.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.180
So the least common multiple of
x plus 3 and x squared plus

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.290
4x plus 3 is actually x squared
plus 4x plus 3,

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.580
because this is a multiple
of that.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.140
It's divisible by it.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.290
So let's multiply both sides
of the equation by this

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.250
expression, right here.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.550
So we're going to get-- let me
just rewrite it-- x plus 3

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.050
times x plus 1-- and then we
have this term over here--

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:40.933
times 2 over x plus 3 times x
plus 1 is going to be equal to

00:04:40.933 --> 00:04:49.470
x plus 3 times x plus 1 times
this 2 times that 2, over

00:04:49.470 --> 00:05:01.585
there, plus x plus 3 times x
plus 1 times this term-- times

00:05:01.585 --> 00:05:06.220
x minus 2 over x plus 3.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.470
Now, the whole reason why we did
that is because that will

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.790
cancel with that.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.680
The left-hand side of our
equation will just be a 2.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.320
And 2 will be equal to-- well,
2 times this-- we know what

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.400
this is equal to-- x plus 3
times x plus 1 is x squared

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.880
plus 4x plus 3.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.310
We know that.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.310
We actually went
the other way.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.450
We factored it.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.010
So it's going to be 2 times x
squared plus 4x plus 3, which

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.380
is 2 times x squared is-- I'm
going to do it in that green

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.420
color so you know we're
dealing with

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.390
this 2 right here.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.970
So this term right here is going
to be 2 times x squared.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:51.250
So it's 2x squared plus 2
times 4x plus 8x plus 2

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.120
times 3 plus 6.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.320
And now this term.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.190
We have an x plus 3
in the numerator.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.260
Or it would be, if I multiplied
it times this

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.440
fraction or this rational
expression.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.530
That x plus 3 will cancel
with that x plus 3.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.840
So we're just left with an x
plus 1 times an x minus 2.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.750
An x plus 1 times x minus 2--
let me just focus in on this

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.070
expression right here.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.790
I'll just box the whole thing.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:27.420
x plus 1 times x minus 2 is,
let's just say it's x times x,

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.796
which is x squared.

00:06:29.796 --> 00:06:33.960
x times negative 2, which
is negative 2x.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.800
And then you have 1 times x, so
plus x, and then you have 1

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.940
times negative 2, so
you have minus 2.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.790
And now we can simplify it.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.830
So once again, the left-hand
side of this

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.970
equation is still 2.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.350
Now on the right-hand side,
let's look at the x squared

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.420
terms. We have a 2x squared,
and we have an x squared.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.260
Add them together, you
get 3x squared.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:05.930
Then we have an 8x, and we
have a minus 2x plus x.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:06.940
So what's that going to be?

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.180
This is an 8x, and then when
you add these together, you

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.260
just get a minus-- you just
get a negative x.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.020
So when you add everything
together, you're going

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.926
to get a plus 7x.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.280
Those are the x terms. And then
finally, you have a-- no,

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.890
I already used the orange--
you have a 6 and you

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.280
have a minus 2.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.980
So that's going to be plus 4.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.470
And now let's subtract 2 from
both sides of this equation.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.920
Let's subtract 2 from
both sides.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:46.890
And we are left with 0 is equal
to 3x squared plus 7x.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:51.520
We are subtracting 2 from both
sides, so 4 minus 2 is plus 2.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.870
So we've stumbled, then we've
turned this bizarre-looking

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.890
thing into kind of
a standard, plain

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.010
vanilla quadratic equation.

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:02.310
We have a non-zero coefficient
out here.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:03.930
We might-- well, we just
want to solve for it.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:05.420
We actually don't even
have to factor it.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.240
So we might as well just use
the quadratic formula.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.820
That's the easiest way to solve,
especially a quadratic

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.850
equation that has a non-one
coefficient on

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:17.390
the x squared term.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.320
So our solutions, using the
quadratic formula. x is going

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.070
to be equal to negative b--
which is negative 7-- plus or

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:29.060
minus the square root of b
squared-- that's 7 squared--

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:34.820
which is 49 minus 4 times
a-- which is 3--

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.990
times c, which is 2.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:44.280
All of that over 2 times
a, over 2 times 3 is 6.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.120
So what does this equal to?

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.600
4 times 3 is 12 times 2 is 24.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.350
So that, right there, is 24.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.630
What's 49 minus 24?

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:59.240
It's 25.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.190
So I don't want to make
that too messy, so

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.960
let me rewrite it.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:11.110
So x is equal to negative 7 plus
or minus the square root

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:20.490
of 49 minus 24 is 25 over 6,
which is equal to negative 7

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:24.960
plus or minus 5-- the square
root of 25-- over 6.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.170
And let's see, if we were to add
5, that would be negative

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:32.550
7 plus 5 is negative
2 over 6, which is

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.530
equal to negative 1/3.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.520
That is one solution.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:42.170
And then if I do negative 7
minus 5, that is negative 12

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:46.060
over 6, which is equal
to negative 2.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:51.620
So those are our two solutions
to this original rational

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:55.340
equation right up here.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.510
Hopefully you enjoyed that.
