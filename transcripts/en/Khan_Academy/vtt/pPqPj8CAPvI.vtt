00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:06.220
Welcome to the second
set of presentations

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.640
on age word problems.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.200
I have one typed out here.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.240
Let's see what it says.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.530
It says, Salman- that's
me- is 108 years old.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.500
And so this is clearly at some
vast time in the future.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.380
And this'll only happen if my
caloric restriction works out.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.370
But Salman is 108 years old.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.220
Jonathan is 24 years old.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.210
How many years will it take
for Salman to be exactly 4

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.930
times as old as Jonathan?

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.720
Well, let's figure
this one out.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.240
What we're trying to solve for
is how many years will it take.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.740
So let's use the
variable y, for years.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:53.880
So y equals years until, let's
just say Sal, for short.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.275
Sal is 4 times Jonathan's age.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.275
Well, if today, I, or Sal, if
Salman, it's hard to speak

00:01:09.275 --> 00:01:10.430
in the third person.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.840
If Salman is 100 years old
today, in y years, Salman

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:25.950
will be 108 plus y is
equal to Sal in y years.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.920
We'll say y years.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.670
Sal in y years is going
to be 108 plus y.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.330
And then Jonathan in y
years, that's pretty easy.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.720
He's going to be 24 plus y.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.690
So that's, I'll say
Jon for short.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.440
In y years.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.870
Not years.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.180
y years.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.260
And what else does
the problem say?

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.760
It says, in how many years
would take for Salman to be

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.610
exactly-- I should put that in
another color for emphasis--

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.900
Exactly 4 times as
old as Jonathan?

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.770
Well, and the exactly
is important.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.220
Because Salman is already
more than 4 times

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.340
as old as Jonathan.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.590
But they want to figure out
exactly when is Salman going to

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.890
be 4 times as old as Jonathan.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.450
Well, in y years Salman is
going to be 108 plus y.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.190
So we know that.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.810
108 plus y.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.490
And after y years, he's
going to be 4 times

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:29.680
as old as Jonathan.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.460
Exactly 4 times.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.740
And Jonathan's going to
be 24 plus y years old.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.690
And now we just
solve the equation.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.510
Get 108 plus y is
equal to 4 times 24.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.300
Well, 4 times 25 is 100.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.670
And we can subtract
4 from there.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.120
So it's 96.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.390
Plus 4y.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.030
And now we just solve
this equation.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.820
We get 3.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.990
3, I'm going to skip some
steps, because I think this

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.390
part is easy for you.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.910
3y will equal 108 minus 96.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:13.950
So we get 3y is equal to,
what is that, 12, right?

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.780
So y is equal to 4.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.635
So our algebra has told us that
in 4 years Salman is going

00:03:21.635 --> 00:03:24.260
to be exactly 4 times
as old as Jonathan.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.630
Let's see if that's true.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.480
Well, if Salman is 108
right now, in 4 years

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.780
he's going to be 112.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.900
And if Jonathan is 24 right
now, in 4 years he's

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.610
going to be 28.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:37.540
And let's see.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.780
28 times 4 is 80 plus 32.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.730
Yep, exactly.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.990
He'll be 112.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.780
Looks like that problem worked.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.920
Excellent.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.035
Let's do another one.

00:03:50.035 --> 00:03:53.520
Hope you didn't hear that,
it was my stomach growling.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.240
See how hard I work
on this site?

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.220
Don't even eat properly.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.800
Let's do another problem.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.540
I'll type it in
green this time.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:23.670
Tarush is 5 times as old as
Arman is today, 85 years ago.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.620
We're dealing with
huge swathes of time.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.920
85 years ago.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:39.190
Tarush was 10 times
as old as Arman.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:45.730
How old is Arman today?

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.970
Let's see if we can tackle
this quite interesting

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.090
problem, I think.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.640
Settings.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.970
Pen tool on.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.320
OK.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.380
Well, I think this might be
useful to do one of those

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.030
charts like we did in the
first video presentation.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.980
Well, we're trying to solve
for how old is Arman today's.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.750
So let's say Arman.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.700
And we're going to have today.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.600
And we're going to have,
what's the other time

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.470
period we're dealing with.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.020
We're dealing with
85 years ago.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.096
So, let's say.

00:05:19.096 --> 00:05:23.054
85 years ago.

00:05:23.054 --> 00:05:27.880
In a galaxy far, far away.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:34.890
OK, Arman and Tarush.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.970
Well, we're trying to solve
for how old is Arman today's.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.280
So let's just make that
x, for simplicity.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.150
It says Tarush is 5 times
as old as Arman today.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.550
So let me underline that.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.310
Tarush is 5 times as
old as Arman today.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.900
So if Arman is x, that tells us
that Tarush is going to be 5x.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.330
85 years ago.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:03.210
So, 85 years ago, well, Arman
is x today, then 85 years ago,

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.980
Arman would have
been x minus 85.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:16.230
And if Tarush is 5x today, then
Tarush would be 5x minus 85.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.150
I just subtracted 85
from the current age.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.630
Because we're going 85
years in the past.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.480
And now we have this extra
piece of information.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.500
Which tells us that 85
years ago, Tarush was 10

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.420
times as old as Arman.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.940
So this number is going to be
10 times more than this number.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.340
That's what that
sentence tells us.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.040
85 years ago, we're
in this situation.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.330
Tarush, which is this, was
10 times older than Arman.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.580
We just write that
out algebraically.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:54.230
85 years ago, Tarush
is 5x minus 85.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.370
And the sentence tells us that
he was 10 times older than

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.620
Arman, who is x minus 85.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.390
Now we just solve the equation.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:14.900
We get 5x minus 85 is
equal to 10x minus 850.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.900
And then you get-- and I'm
going to do this, skip some

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:24.830
steps, just to confuse you-- 5x
is equal too-- well, I think

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.370
I just confused myself.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:34.790
5x is equal to 850 minus 85.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.400
Let's see, what's 850 minus 85.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.230
It'll be 35 less than 800.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:46.500
So we could say that
5x-- 35 less than 800.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.250
30 less than 800 gets 770.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.070
So 765.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.590
And then x is equal
to, let me see.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:58.520
5 goes into 70.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.140
1 times 5.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.260
26.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:08.230
5 times 5 is 25.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:09.586
15.

00:08:09.586 --> 00:08:13.810
So x is equal to 153.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.250
We have some
long-lifespanned people.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:22.000
So we get the solution that
Arman is 153 years old.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.190
Today.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.000
Let's see if that makes sense.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.300
Well, if he's 153, then,
no, that can't be right.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.370
Because then he's 5.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:34.220
Huh.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.900
Well, actually I'm
almost out of time.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.190
Let me see where I might
have messed up on this.

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:43.320
If Arman is x, Tarush is 5x.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.820
That makes sense.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.010
Oh, right, right, right.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:47.740
I think this could make sense.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.220
So, I thought that Tarush had
to be younger than Arman.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.110
But no, Tarush is 5 times 153.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:57.630
So Tarush is actually
765 years old.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.400
We should call him Methuselah.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:04.190
So, Tarush is 765 years old.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:09.120
And then if we go 85 years into
the past, Tarush would have

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.040
been-- what did we say?

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.760
If we go 85 years into the
past, so let's write this down.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.820
This is equal to, I'm about to
run out of time, so you might

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.112
have to check this yourself.

00:09:20.112 --> 00:09:26.010
If that's equal to 153,
then 5x is equal to 765.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:27.430
These numbers are big.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:30.700
And then 153 minus 85.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:35.710
Well, 155 minus 85 would be 73.

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:39.840
So this would be 72.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.250
And then Tarush, 85 years ago.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.550
No, I think I messed
up someplace.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:51.150
Well, actually, I only have
ten seconds before YouTube

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:52.130
won't let me upload it.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.450
So we'll have to stop there.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:55.950
Thank you.
