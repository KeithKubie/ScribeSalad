Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab,

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.580
the podcast and a this week on the podcast we did a collaborative thing with our

3
00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:10.200
friends at on the media,

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.840
a wonderful show produced here at Wny c we decided to give them a headache when

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.650
I was a very provocative idea brought to us by Jonah Lehrer,

6
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.950
one of our regular contributors and we just couldn't get it out of our heads.

7
00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:25.200
It was such spooky. Yes.

8
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:29.160
It begins with the work of a psychology professor, Jonathan Schooler,

9
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.560
who many years ago to great acclaim,

10
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.270
got a bunch of people in a room together and he had them watch a video basically

11
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.480
watch this bank robber walk into a bank and he hands a note to the Clark and he

12
00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:44.730
says, don't press the alarm and you won't get hurt.

13
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.590
Clerk then hands him some money and he exits and these people watching the

14
00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:53.160
video, do they get a good look at the guy you got a straight on look at the bank

15
00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:56.520
robber. Absolutely. And here is the test. After everybody watched this thing,

16
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.260
he had half the subjects only half right down in as much detail for five

17
00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:04.680
minutes. Everything they could remember about the appearance of the bank robber.

18
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.400
So they'd write, you know, really brown hair, mustache, thick glasses,

19
00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:11.070
whatever it was. They just described the guy that they just seen.

20
00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:14.550
Now only half of them did this, the other half did nothing.

21
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.820
And then later he had all the subjects.

22
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.310
Look at a police lineup and try and identify the robber, pick the bank robbers,

23
00:01:22.311 --> 00:01:23.430
see if you can pick them. Yeah, no,

24
00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:27.330
you would think that the people who had to describe the guy right after seeing

25
00:01:27.331 --> 00:01:30.000
him the first time, they would do really well at this. You know,

26
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:33.600
cause they had kinda set the memory. Yeah. That's not what they found.

27
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.890
We found those people who had been asked to describe the face in great detail,

28
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.130
they were actually less good at recognizing the face than if they didn't engage

29
00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:47.100
in any description at all. Not just a little less good.

30
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.090
They were like 30 or 40% less good. So it was pretty whopping.

31
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.060
Whopping in just odd. Yeah.

32
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.370
Even more odd is that as he did more studies,

33
00:01:56.371 --> 00:01:58.110
he found it wasn't just a face thing.

34
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.360
It happens when you try to remember all kinds of stuff.

35
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.010
He found the effect with colors.

36
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.490
We found it later on with tastes choices.

37
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.720
The effect was so strong and in so many different places that he gave it a name.

38
00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:14.070
Verbal overshadowing, verbal. The words overshadow the truth. Yeah.

39
00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:18.630
So there's some association here is when you talked about it, you get it wrong.

40
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.180
Exactly. So we should say these studies, uh,

41
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.590
made schooler into kind of a rock star. Yeah, I did get it. Got Some press, uh,

42
00:02:25.591 --> 00:02:30.270
at the time and he appeared everywhere really including on a little show called

43
00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:31.830
radio lab. He was even here.

44
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.250
And this is where our story really begins because just as people like us were

45
00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:40.110
getting very excited about his work, the data began to go a little funny on him.

46
00:02:40.111 --> 00:02:40.530
That's right.

47
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.810
And it all began when he tried to replicate that original experiment. Yes.

48
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.000
As you kept doing it. What happened? Well, uh, over the years,

49
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:52.680
over the next five or six years, when I attempted to do it again,

50
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.270
I would get the effect, but not to the same degree that I did initially.

51
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.980
And this is, this is a little troubling for him.

52
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.070
That's Jonah Lehrer science writer, one of our contributing editors.

53
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:05.320
He turned us onto this story and it went like this.

54
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:09.190
He says the first time school or tries to replicate that study, that effect

55
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.220
<v 1>falls by 30%. And so he tried it again and again.</v>

56
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.860
And as we kept trying to replicate this study,

57
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.950
the effect size got smaller and smaller and smaller,

58
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.490
<v 0>meaning that big difference between the people who wrote about the bank robber</v>

59
00:03:22.491 --> 00:03:25.120
and got it wrong. And people who didn't write about the bank, they right,

60
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.800
and they got it right. That big difference began to decline.

61
00:03:27.801 --> 00:03:29.990
This slow downward trajectory

62
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.890
<v 1>did sort of gradually get smaller. It wasn't as if all of a sudden it,</v>

63
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.863
it just

64
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.410
<v 0>here now, it's still significant. It's still publishable,</v>

65
00:03:39.411 --> 00:03:42.770
but it's not nearly as exciting as it was that first time.

66
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.220
So, as you can imagine,

67
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.100
Jonathan schoolers sitting in in his office and he was like,

68
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.240
what is happening here? I mean, it was so good the first time,

69
00:03:54.241 --> 00:03:56.890
and then it started to phase a very good experimental psychologist.

70
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.760
He's not sloppy or anything. No. So He's thinking what's happening here?

71
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.880
And the first theory he has to really wrestle with is something known as

72
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.760
regression to the mean. I mean, those are three of the most uninstall. Yeah.

73
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.560
Byard words put together there words though.

74
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.870
It's to mean, but Jonah, can you make it concrete for us? Sure.

75
00:04:15.871 --> 00:04:19.020
So you flip a coin, right? Let's say you'll flip a coin 10 times.

76
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.640
You may get eight heads in details, and you may say, oh my gosh,

77
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.990
I've discovered a new law of coin flipping. When I flip coins in this room.

78
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.640
They are almost always heads. But if you kept on flipping that coin for say,

79
00:04:32.641 --> 00:04:35.910
a thousand times, your data would show almost certainly,

80
00:04:35.911 --> 00:04:39.120
unless you really had discovered something very peculiar about that room,

81
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.080
the results would get closer to the true result, which is about 50%.

82
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.410
The results would regress to the mean. Hmm,

83
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.720
sorry. Any case. His first thought was maybe that's what's going on here. Yeah.

84
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.990
<v 1>Meaning when we first did the study for whatever reason we got lucky or unlucky</v>

85
00:04:57.241 --> 00:04:58.074
as the case may be

86
00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.470
<v 0>you, you saw an outlier. Exactly. That reality is full of quirky surprises.</v>

87
00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:04.240
We can't explain, but over time,

88
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:06.910
and this is the miracle of the scientific process, you,

89
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.950
you regressed to the true effect size.

90
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.110
<v 1>But one thing about the regression to the mean account is it doesn't really</v>

91
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:22.111
explain why the effects gradually get smaller regression to the mean you predict

92
00:05:22.181 --> 00:05:27.181
one big effect and then it should basically totter around the actual value.

93
00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:31.870
This gradual decline doesn't naturally fall out of the regression to the mean

94
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:34.120
account. Yeah, I mean the effect could just go away.

95
00:05:34.121 --> 00:05:38.830
In which case you knew you were wrong, but why would it sudden slowly get worse?

96
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:39.280
Well,

97
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.280
one possible explanation is that there was some aspect to the procedure that was

98
00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:49.120
important that we never really realized was important and somehow we were

99
00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:53.710
gradually not including whatever that secret ingredient was.

100
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.910
<v 0>Meaning you as a scientist when you try and do an experiment,</v>

101
00:05:56.911 --> 00:06:00.440
you try and do it the same way every time down to the,

102
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.220
to the floss that you floss your teeth with before you did the experiment,

103
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:08.050
but the too many things that you may not pay attention to it.

104
00:06:08.051 --> 00:06:10.490
It may be some little thing off into the side that you're not even thinking

105
00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:13.580
about. It could have been the color of the room in which he was conducting the

106
00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:16.730
experiments. It could of been how charming his Grad student was.

107
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.090
Who was actually asking the students to describe the bank robber.

108
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.150
Totally making up the story here. Let's say that Gretchen was so charming,

109
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:26.690
so good looking, so charismatic that he distracted the students.

110
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.280
Then the Grad student goes off,

111
00:06:28.281 --> 00:06:31.330
leaves the lab and has got a much less exciting Grad students on Eylea as

112
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.300
distracting and now the effect size of verbal overshadowing has gone down.

113
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.030
But the only problem with that is that that little sound that Jen and I made

114
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.580
means that you have to have your terming grad student at the beginning and your

115
00:06:43.581 --> 00:06:46.580
less charming Grad student in the middle, and you're even less grad student.

116
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.150
Yeah. They have to get slowly less charming. That's right.

117
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.310
And so if you're thinking something is changing here, what is it?

118
00:06:55.311 --> 00:06:55.971
What is it? What is it?

119
00:06:55.971 --> 00:07:00.170
Did you go on some kind of math search to figure out what you might be doing

120
00:07:00.171 --> 00:07:04.970
differently? We tried lots, a lot of different things. And in the end,

121
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.910
I just moved to another area of research.

122
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.000
We got out of town and apparently one of schoolers,

123
00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:15.980
colleagues told him, don't worry about it.

124
00:07:15.981 --> 00:07:19.760
The only mistake you made was trying to replicate it in the first place. Yeah.

125
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.490
But, uh, here's the problem.

126
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.930
Turns out it's not just me who has experienced this peculiar decline effect.

127
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:28.250
As he started to look around,

128
00:07:28.251 --> 00:07:31.880
he realized what was happening to him was happening all over the place. Oh,

129
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.850
are scientists in all kinds of other sciences?

130
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.690
We're having the exact same problem in biology. There was a uh,

131
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.490
Meta analysis of many different biological findings showing there are a ton of

132
00:07:43.491 --> 00:07:44.990
examples. These has, and here's one.

133
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.620
In the 90s there were a bunch of studies about uh,

134
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.470
animals using symmetry to find mates like birds,

135
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:52.730
females and female birds,

136
00:07:52.731 --> 00:07:57.560
choosing their sexual partners based on how even the males tail feathers were.

137
00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:02.540
It was a very exciting idea and the first year there were eight tests of it and

138
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.880
all eight found the, Yep. Fluctuating asymmetry.

139
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:08.390
That's what the phenomenon is called is real. We also got an effect size,

140
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:09.710
so it seemed true. Yeah.

141
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:12.050
They're all over the world and all of these different species,

142
00:08:12.051 --> 00:08:16.880
females had evolved this unconscious tendency to prefer symmetrical males.

143
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:22.160
The next year it's tested 12 times and nine of the 12 confirm it and then things

144
00:08:22.161 --> 00:08:23.210
start to fall apart.

145
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.800
You can make the sound effect the exactly until by the end of the nineties

146
00:08:27.801 --> 00:08:32.801
you're going one for 13 one for 13 one one for 13 now of course these studies

147
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.830
were not black and white. Yes, no studies. There's some gradation,

148
00:08:36.831 --> 00:08:39.080
but this was the basic trend that Jonah's saw.

149
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.880
And just in case birds seem a little distant.

150
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:44.650
Here's another example and I think this is for me the most troubling, um,

151
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.250
area that decline effect. Um,

152
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.350
cause you see like second generation antipsychotics,

153
00:08:48.351 --> 00:08:50.300
second generation anti-psychotic,

154
00:08:50.301 --> 00:08:54.410
these are drugs used to treat people with schizophrenia. Bipolar,

155
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.990
when they first came out in the late eighties, early nineties,

156
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.470
some studies found that they were about twice as effective than first generation

157
00:09:01.471 --> 00:09:02.700
antipsychotics. Um,

158
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:07.470
and then what happened is the standard story of the decline effect Q,

159
00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:08.700
the sound effect, um,

160
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.570
which is clinical trial after clinical trial,

161
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:16.500
the effect size just slowly started to fall apart. And, uh, that's not all.

162
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.980
You see a similar decline with things like Prozac. Um,

163
00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:23.550
and instead of precedence, the effect of the drugs have gotten weaker,

164
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.360
but the placebo effect has also gotten stronger. Um,

165
00:09:27.361 --> 00:09:31.380
I was talking to one guy to drug company who he was kind of interesting.

166
00:09:31.381 --> 00:09:33.540
He blamed that on drug advertising.

167
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:37.800
He said that they started to see their placebo effect go up in the late nineties

168
00:09:37.801 --> 00:09:39.750
when these drug companies started advertising.

169
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:45.350
Wouldn't that actually offer an explanation for this decline thing because you

170
00:09:45.421 --> 00:09:48.180
know some, if you know about what this drug is supposed to do,

171
00:09:48.181 --> 00:09:49.480
maybe it works differently. Some of them,

172
00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:54.540
certainly there are areas of psychology where that can change the outcome and in

173
00:09:54.901 --> 00:09:56.360
one way or another, but uh,

174
00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:00.390
it's very unlikely that you know and say these female preferences for a

175
00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:02.850
symmetrical feathers that the, you know,

176
00:10:02.851 --> 00:10:07.190
the birds got wind of the symmetry finding and now all of a sudden they've not

177
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.480
got into it anymore. I don't know.

178
00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.110
You haven't been around chickadee conversation weird,

179
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:15.990
fast as quickly amongst the chickadees. And so does that mean that you,

180
00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:21.170
can you explain why what you found at the beginning is not what you find now and

181
00:10:21.901 --> 00:10:26.790
why it is why it gradually went away? The gradually is still puzzling.

182
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.460
I tell you, I find it very puzzling to,

183
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.010
I'm personally baffled.

184
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:36.270
It's tough to come up with an all purpose explanation or some easy fix.

185
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.930
It could be a lot of different things bundled together into one phenomenon.

186
00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:40.471
He says, you know,

187
00:10:40.471 --> 00:10:44.310
maybe in some cases it really is statistics rushing to the mean is almost sure

188
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:47.430
to be a part of it. And maybe in some cases it's, you know,

189
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:51.750
this gradual change in the procedure and something that we just don't know what

190
00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:53.490
it was that happened. Can't rule it out.

191
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:58.520
But I would probably be less shocked than most people if something

192
00:11:01.021 --> 00:11:03.330
unconventional was actually involved in this as well.

193
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:11.120
Unconventional. Like, like I say this, uh, with, uh,

194
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.320
some trepidation,

195
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:17.160
but I think we can't rule out the possibility that there could be some way in

196
00:11:17.161 --> 00:11:22.161
which the act of observation is actually changing the nature of reality.

197
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:30.030
That somehow in the process of observing effects,

198
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:35.130
we changed the nature of those effects. Ah, you're in real trouble.

199
00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:37.390
Yeah.

200
00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:40.860
Essentially what he's saying we think is that when he discovered that thing with

201
00:11:40.861 --> 00:11:42.030
the bank robber experiment,

202
00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:47.450
maybe the discovery itself somehow sit in motion a series of events that made

203
00:11:47.881 --> 00:11:52.830
the thing he discovered start to sort of run away. Well, I'm not your,

204
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.130
I'm going to say that. I'm

205
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.610
<v 1>certainly not going to say that there's some sort of intentionality to these</v>

206
00:11:57.611 --> 00:12:01.720
effects a disappearing more that it's almost, and again,

207
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:05.290
this is just a speculation, some sort of habituation,

208
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:08.050
so just as when you put your hand on your leg, you feel it,

209
00:12:08.051 --> 00:12:12.640
and then as you leave it there, it becomes less and less noticeable somehow.

210
00:12:12.641 --> 00:12:17.470
There may be some kind of habituation that happens in with respect to these

211
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.240
findings.

212
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.140
<v 0>What is the hand and what is the leg in, in, in, in this?</v>

213
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.850
<v 1>Well, in in the, in this most radical conjecture,</v>

214
00:12:24.851 --> 00:12:28.960
there could be some sort of collective consciousness that's habituating. Again,

215
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:30.650
radical speculation.

216
00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:37.510
Keep in mind the notion that the laws of reality are unchangeable is an

217
00:12:39.771 --> 00:12:43.580
assumption. It's a reasonable assumption, but we don't know it for a fact.

218
00:12:43.581 --> 00:12:48.581
In there have been a physicists who have even speculated that perhaps the rules

219
00:12:48.831 --> 00:12:50.630
change as time goes on.

220
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:52.623
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

221
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:54.950
<v 0>the problem with this idea is if you really believe it,</v>

222
00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:57.500
<v 1>then you can never really know anything.</v>

223
00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:01.790
We're sliding into that creditor door like you know by this logic,

224
00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.910
you could never really know for sure. Yes.

225
00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:09.410
Because reality could change based upon the observers,

226
00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:13.520
position, habits, biases, information, whatever.

227
00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:18.170
So far we have not really seen these types of things in the domain of,

228
00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:22.760
of physics, but you know, and aspirin might not do what it used to. Huh.

229
00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.060
There's a question that you haven't asked, which is,

230
00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:31.120
let's say that we were to do a study and demonstrate this decline effect,

231
00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:37.130
that when you keep running experiments that they get smaller. Well,

232
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:40.550
what happens when you try to replicate that effect? Does it decline, effect,

233
00:13:40.551 --> 00:13:43.460
decline? Yeah, that's a good question.

234
00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.920
Maybe we could just get rid of the decline effect by studying it,

235
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:52.793
<v 0>but then</v>

236
00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:59.300
if you were to study the decline of the decline effect than it would on decline

237
00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.450
and it would come back. You can see what I'm saying. I see what you're saying.

238
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.540
You're just stuck forever in the great seesaw of the universe.

239
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:09.390
We should thank our, uh, our friends at, on the media,

240
00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.530
on the media as a show that analyzes, you know, the media as I'm sure you know.

241
00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.930
And it's an amazing show. I mean, it's an amazing show. Uh,

242
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.620
Brooke and Bob who hosts the show are, are funny,

243
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.260
hysterically funny and brilliantly smart,

244
00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:24.870
and it's the kind of show that it's just kind of essential.

245
00:14:24.871 --> 00:14:28.770
It's one of those shows. I could not recommend it more on the media.org.

246
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.680
All one word on the media.org check it out.

247
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:36.660
They're going to do an entire hour on the subject of data and we have sort of

248
00:14:36.661 --> 00:14:39.600
snuck this issue that we've just talked about into the middle of that show.

249
00:14:39.601 --> 00:14:43.680
So it's a, it's the same thing, but in a very different context than you can.

250
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:48.780
You can go to their podcast on Friday the 13th of May and there it,

251
00:14:48.781 --> 00:14:52.170
and we felt that until it, and we declined. Yup. Into oblivion.

252
00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.860
I'm Jad Abumrad I was and will continue to be, I hope for the moment.

253
00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:56.980
Robert Foley back.
