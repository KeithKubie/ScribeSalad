00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.170
A good screenplay should have an airtight
plot, with no holes or mistakes to ruin the

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.590
audience’s appreciation of it.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.200
But even the best screenplays go through studio
notes, re-writes, re-shoots and serious editing

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.950
before they get put in theatres, and it’s
sometimes a wonder movies make any sense at

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:21.950
all.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.070
Even in some great movies, not every little
detail makes sense, and the movies on this

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.570
list are no exception.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.720
This is Screen Rant’s list of 10 Famous
Movie Plot Holes That Need To Be Explained.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.500
And we should warn you, there WILL be spoilers.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.870
Star Wars
The story of the Star Wars saga goes that

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.649
once Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader,
a committed crony of Emperor Palpatine, his

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.940
children are hidden away from him for their
own protection.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.620
Leia is raised by Senator Organa on the planet
of planet of Alderaan while Luke is raised

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.100
by Anakin’s step-brother, “Uncle” Owen
on Anakin’s home planet of Tatooine.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.989
But does that really make any sense?

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.269
The Star Wars universe is a vast and varied
place, so if Obi-Wan and Yoda really wanted

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:58.559
to keep Luke safe, wouldn’t they keep him
far away from Tatooine and his old family?

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.079
Wouldn’t they also change his last name
to anything but “Skywalker”?

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.339
If Darth Vader ever decided to check in on
his old family, this tactic would prove to

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.070
be an awful mistake.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.890
Zootopia
Before the otter florist Emmitt Otterton goes

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.320
missing in Disney’s smash hit Zootopia,
his black panther chauffeur mentions that

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.659
he was yelling about the “night howlers,”
leading police rabbit Judy Hopps to assume

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.920
that he’s referring to the pack of wolves
that kidnapped him.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.530
But later on, it’s revealed that “night
howlers” are actually toxic flower bulbs

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.740
with psychotropic effects, and that explains
why several of Zootopia’s “predators”

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.189
have been behaving aggressively.

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:29.970
But how did no one recognize the symptoms
of “night howlers”?

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.869
Judy’s foxy friend Gideon Grey recognizes
the flowers immediately, and they’re stocked

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.470
in the city’s flower shops, so they must
be pretty common.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.590
Yet neither Dr. Madge Honey Badger nor anyone
else can identify the flowers or their effects

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.250
for almost the entire movie.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.329
Toy Story
OK, we might be nitpicking about the plot

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.240
hole in this Pixar classic, but we’re going
to tell you about it anyway.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.759
When Buzz Lightyear arrives in Andy’s room
for the first time, he is utterly unaware

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.159
that he is actually a toy, and not a space
ranger.

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.939
So why is it that when Andy enters the room,
Buzz freezes and stops moving, just like the

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:58.939
rest of the toys?

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.820
If Buzz doesn’t think he’s a toy, then
he shouldn’t act like one!

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.020
If he does know he’s a toy, then he’s
just lying to the other toys.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.880
Either way, colour us confused!

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.310
The Matrix
When Neo and his pals need to enter “The

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.870
Matrix”, they have to sit down on an adapted
dentist’s chair and “plug in”, always

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.340
with a supervisor watching over them at the
computer terminal.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.970
So how is it that Cypher -- the traitor of
the group -- is able to plug into the Matrix

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.000
and meet with the nefarious Agent Smith without
the knowledge of the others?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.370
In an old interview, the Wachowskis claim
that, earlier in the film, Cypher set up an

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.610
automated system to enter the Matrix on his
own.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.170
Still, it doesn’t explain the larger question
about The Matrix: Why bother “unplugging”

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.170
at all?

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.700
Red pill or not, living inside of The Matrix
certainly seems more pleasant than eating

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.290
goop and wearing rags in the “real world”.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.330
Iron Man 3
You knew at least one Marvel movie would have

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.260
to make the list, so we’re pointing out
the most obvious plot hole in the entire MCU.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.940
When Tony Stark finds himself in a tight spot
at the end of Iron Man 3, he initiates the

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.540
“House Party” protocol, and J.A.R.V.I.S.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.370
summons several remote-controlled Iron Man
suits, all of which come equipped with the

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.080
same powers as Iron Man himself.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.990
Only, why didn’t he do that before?

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.090
Like when the Mandarin attacked and destroyed
his house?

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.370
Or when he’s stuck in rural Tennessee recharging
his suit with a car battery?

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.430
If screenwriters have to rely on deus ex machina
to resolve their plots, they could at least

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.530
put a little more work into it than this.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.740
Ocean’s Eleven
The appeal of Ocean’s Eleven is in watching

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.600
all your favorite movie stars hanging out
with each other and being their charming selves.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.620
But if you look at the heist movie closely,
does it really make sense?

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.450
First, Danny Ocean tricks casino owner Benedict
into transferring all of his money into some

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.120
vans waiting outside (by threatening to blow
up the vault).

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.930
But then Terry Benedict has his men intercept
the vans before they get out of town, only

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.500
to find out they’re actually full of X-rated
fliers.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.520
But: when did Ocean and his crew make the
switch?

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.040
In a DVD commentary, director Steven Soderbergh
claims there is no explanation, meaning it

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.850
was either an oversight, or we’re supposed
to believe there’s some movie magic at play.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.980
The Lost World: Jurassic Park
At the end of this dino-blockbuster, a Tyrannausaurus

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.480
Rex makes it off the self-contained island
and wreaks havoc on the streets of San Diego.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.510
But we have some questions about how he got
there.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.130
When the boat containing the T-Rex docks at
the mainland, Nick boards to find that the

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.870
crew has been slaughtered, when a guard accidentally
opens the cargo hold, freeing the T-Rex into

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:01.870
the real world.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.810
But if the Rex was locked in the cargo hold,
how did it kill the boat crew?

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.870
Well, in the original script, a group of velociraptors
were on board as well, and they were responsible

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.710
for the slaughter, but in the movie, it’s
a major plot hole.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.540
The Santa Clause
Obviously, The Santa Clause takes place in

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.140
a world where Santa Claus exists.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.959
That’s why Tim Allen gets turned into the
jolly old giftgiver when he kills the previous

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:20.959
Santa.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.870
So how is it that before that fateful event,
the adults of the movie behave as though Santa

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:24.870
doesn’t exist?

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.980
Obviously, he’s been delivering presents
to their children every year, meaning there

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.410
is material proof that somebody is sneaking
into their house every Christmas Eve.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.070
Why does Tim Allen have to literally transform
into ol’ Saint Nick for this to make any

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.070
sense?

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.450
Colour us confused!

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.330
Signs
In M. Night Shyamalan’s Signs, aliens invade

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.790
Earth and begin to take over.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.790
But at the end of the movie, little Bo Hess
discovers the aliens’ weakness: water.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.740
When a glass of water falls on an alien, it
burns its skin like acid, so the Hess family

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.760
uses H2O to fight back against the extra-terrestrials.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.690
Only, why would the aliens invade a planet
that’s surface is 71% water?

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.320
Why would they invade a planet where rain
could come down at any time?

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.780
More importantly, when they’re running through
a dew-covered cornfield earlier in the film,

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.350
why doesn’t the water affect them?

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.130
Obviously, the twist at the end of Signs could
have used a little more thought.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.540
Furious 7
We need to talk about The Rock.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.920
We’re all glad that Dwayne Johnson makes
an appearance in the seventh Fast and Furious

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.380
film, but not everything his character does
makes sense.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.480
While he’s lying in a hospital bed, wearing
a cast, Hobbs realizes he needs to help the

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.620
team, but has zero information about their
whereabouts or what they’re doing.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.560
Nonetheless, he finds an ambulance and launches
it off a broken overpass at exactly the right

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.300
time to prevent another vehicle from killing
Lettie and Ramsay.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.530
Then, he grabs a machine gun and somehow walks
across town, ready to help Dominic Toretto

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.000
shoot down a helicopter in his battle with
Deckard Shaw.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.220
Not a lot of this makes sense.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.860
But we have to admit, if you have to write
a superhuman into your script to make it make

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.210
sense, it probably helps if the superhuman
is played by The Rock.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.389
So what do you think of our list?

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:49.170
Did we miss any huge plot holes that you want
everyone to know about?
