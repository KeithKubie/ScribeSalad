00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.480
&gt;&gt; So why would someone like me get involved
with a campaign to end

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.949
female genital mutilation?
I, first of all, became a freelancer but then

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.070
went off and did VSO
with -- firstly in Cambodia and last year

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.050
I'd went to Ethiopia.
I had got this impression of Africa that I'd

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.420
seen in the movies.
And -- which was full of joyous women.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:42.260
I suppose very stereotypical.
And Ethiopia was just -- so different.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:53.450
There were so many confusing mixed messages.
So yes, women were incredibly beautiful and

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:59.390
amazing awesome dignity,
but that joyousness I didn't find and I sort

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.670
of expected to.
And so I started asking around a bit more

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.390
about women's issues.
I learned a little bit of Amharic, so I was

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.280
able to interact with women
a little bit.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.950
But a women took me to one side one day and
you said, you do realize

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:26.380
women in Ethiopia are cut.
And that euphemism meant nothing to me.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.680
No, I didn't realize.
And I started to explore a bit more and that

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.400
was when I discovered
really what "cut" meant, which means that

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.630
their external genitals are
cut out basically.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.110
That was one moment I remember very clearly
in my journey.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.530
The second moment was meeting an amazing woman
 -- who's been

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:54.020
campaigning for 60 years on this -- and asking
her, do I have a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.830
mandate to do this?
Because I was getting scared.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:04.040
As a woman from the West, you know, what right
do I have to basically

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.020
practice what is known everywhere was cultural
imperialism.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.340
Cultural relativism, putting my view onto
whole entire countries and

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.861
communities.
And she sat me down and looked at me and she

00:02:17.861 --> 00:02:19.910
said, would you campaign
against torture?

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:28.430
And I said, well, yeah.
She said, well can a white man campaign against

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.430
torture of black women?
And I said yes, of course.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:40.090
And she said, well, that's what you're doing.
This voice needs to be heard.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:49.989
You've got to be heard.
And in that moment, it was if I had a blessing,

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:56.260
as if I had a sanction
from someone who was right in the thick of

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.870
this debate.
As if she said go forth and do what you can,

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.489
bring this issue out in
the open, break the taboo, break the silence.

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.020
And do something about it.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.670
