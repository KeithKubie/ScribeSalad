00:00:00.125 --> 00:00:01.315
- [Voiceover] So I've
taken some screenshots

00:00:01.315 --> 00:00:04.966
of the Khan Academy exercise
"Interpreting Rate of Change

00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:08.577
"for Exponential Models
in Terms of Change"

00:00:08.577 --> 00:00:10.427
Maybe they're going to change the title.

00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:12.036
It seems a little bit too long.

00:00:12.036 --> 00:00:14.286
But anyway, let's actually
just tackle these together.

00:00:14.286 --> 00:00:16.832
So the first of spring an entire field

00:00:16.832 --> 00:00:19.167
of flowering trees blossoms.

00:00:19.167 --> 00:00:22.120
The population of locusts
consuming these flowers

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.324
rapidly increases as the trees blossom.

00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:28.773
The relationship between
the elapsed time t

00:00:28.773 --> 00:00:31.228
in days since the beginning of spring

00:00:31.228 --> 00:00:34.557
and the total number of locusts L of t,

00:00:34.557 --> 00:00:36.239
so the number of locusts
is going to be a function

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.055
of the number of days that have elapsed

00:00:39.055 --> 00:00:40.623
since the beginning of spring,

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:42.919
is modeled by the following function.

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:46.520
So locusts as a function
of time is going to be 750

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.892
times 1.85 to the "t"th power.

00:00:50.892 --> 00:00:53.230
Complete the following sentence about

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.474
the daily rate of change
of the locust population.

00:00:56.474 --> 00:00:59.386
Every day the locust population, well,

00:00:59.386 --> 00:01:01.435
every day think about
what's going to happen.

00:01:01.435 --> 00:01:03.117
I'll draw a little table, just to make it

00:01:03.117 --> 00:01:04.914
hopefully a little bit clearer.

00:01:04.914 --> 00:01:08.974
So, we draw a little bit of a table.

00:01:08.974 --> 00:01:13.077
So we'll put t and L of t.

00:01:13.077 --> 00:01:17.795
So when t is zero, so when
zero days have elapsed,

00:01:17.795 --> 00:01:20.126
well that's going to be
1.85 to the 0th power,

00:01:20.126 --> 00:01:21.357
that's just going to be one.

00:01:21.357 --> 00:01:25.790
So you're going to have 750
locusts right from the get go.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.818
Then when t equals one,
what's going to happen?

00:01:28.818 --> 00:01:31.032
Well then this is going to be 750

00:01:32.272 --> 00:01:35.328
times 1.85 to the 1st power.

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:37.994
So it's going to be times 1.85.

00:01:37.994 --> 00:01:42.387
When t is equal to two, what's L of t?

00:01:42.387 --> 00:01:45.541
It's going to be 750

00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:48.902
times 1.85 squared.

00:01:48.902 --> 00:01:50.107
Well that's the same thing as

00:01:50.107 --> 00:01:54.917
1.85 times 1.85.

00:01:54.917 --> 00:01:56.237
So notice.

00:01:56.237 --> 00:01:58.117
And this is just comes out of

00:01:58.117 --> 00:01:59.552
this being an exponential function.

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:02.388
Every day you have 1.85 times

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:04.962
as many as you had the day before.

00:02:04.962 --> 00:02:05.892
1.85

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:07.589
We essentially take what
we had the day before

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:10.182
and we multiply it by 1.85.

00:02:10.182 --> 00:02:12.920
And since 1.85 is larger than one,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.554
that's going to grow the
number of locusts we have.

00:02:15.554 --> 00:02:17.530
So this is going to grow.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.602
I'm actually not using, I'm
not on the website right now

00:02:20.602 --> 00:02:22.693
so that's why, normally there
would be a dropdown here.

00:02:22.693 --> 00:02:24.829
So I'm going to grow by a factor of,

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.575
well I'm going to grow by
a factor of 1.85 every day.

00:02:29.575 --> 00:02:31.415
Let's do another one of these.

00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:33.607
All right.

00:02:33.607 --> 00:02:38.236
So this one tells us
that Vera is an ecologist

00:02:38.236 --> 00:02:39.714
who studies the rate of change

00:02:39.714 --> 00:02:43.038
in the bear population
of Siberia over time.

00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:46.369
The relationship between
the elapsed time t in years

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:48.750
since Vera began studying the population

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.331
and the total number of bears N of t

00:02:51.331 --> 00:02:53.712
is modeled by the following function.

00:02:53.712 --> 00:02:55.269
All right, fair enough.

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.021
We've got an exponential thing going on.

00:02:58.021 --> 00:03:00.401
Complete the following sentence about

00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:02.861
the yearly rate of change
of the bear population.

00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:04.502
Let's just thing about it.

00:03:04.502 --> 00:03:06.543
Every year that passes, t as in years now,

00:03:06.543 --> 00:03:07.891
every years that passes is going to be

00:03:07.891 --> 00:03:09.694
two thirds times the year before.

00:03:09.694 --> 00:03:11.744
I could do that same table that I just did

00:03:11.744 --> 00:03:14.906
just to make that clear,
so let me do that.

00:03:14.906 --> 00:03:16.166
Whoops.

00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:19.567
Let me, let me make this clear.

00:03:19.567 --> 00:03:22.477
So, table.

00:03:22.477 --> 00:03:25.855
So this is t and this is N of t.

00:03:25.855 --> 00:03:30.855
When t is zero, N of t you're
going to have 2187 bears.

00:03:30.982 --> 00:03:33.505
So that's the first year that she

00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:35.262
began studying that population.

00:03:35.262 --> 00:03:38.093
Zero years since Vera began
studying the population.

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:41.621
The first year is going to be 2187

00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:45.634
times two thirds to the first
power, so times two thirds.

00:03:45.634 --> 00:03:50.047
The second year is going to be 2187

00:03:50.047 --> 00:03:51.895
times two thirds to the second power.

00:03:51.895 --> 00:03:55.208
So that's just two
thirds times two thirds.

00:03:55.208 --> 00:03:57.084
So each successive year
you're going to have

00:03:57.084 --> 00:04:00.006
two thirds the bear
population of the year before.

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:02.712
You're multiplying the
year before by two thirds.

00:04:02.712 --> 00:04:05.450
So every year the bear population shrinks,

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.009
shrinks by a factor of,

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:13.743
by a factor of two thirds.

00:04:13.743 --> 00:04:15.589
All right, let's do one more of these.

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:19.353
So they tell us that
Akiba started studying

00:04:19.353 --> 00:04:23.086
how the number of branches
on his tree change over time.

00:04:23.086 --> 00:04:24.278
All right.

00:04:24.278 --> 00:04:27.431
The relationship between
the elapsed time t in years

00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:29.768
since Akiba started studying his tree

00:04:29.768 --> 00:04:32.562
and the total number
of its branches N of t

00:04:32.562 --> 00:04:34.571
is modeled by the following function.

00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:36.374
Compete the following sentence

00:04:36.374 --> 00:04:39.696
about the yearly percent change
in the number of branches.

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:42.683
Every year, blank percent of branches

00:04:42.683 --> 00:04:45.058
are added or subtracted from
the total number of branches.

00:04:45.058 --> 00:04:47.400
Well I'll draw another table,

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.383
although you might get used to

00:04:48.383 --> 00:04:49.610
just being able to look at this and say

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:50.881
well look, each year you're going to have

00:04:50.881 --> 00:04:55.016
1.75 times the number branches
you had the year before.

00:04:55.016 --> 00:04:57.109
And so we have 1.75 times

00:04:57.109 --> 00:04:58.992
the number of branches the year before,

00:04:58.992 --> 00:05:01.691
you have grown by 75%,

00:05:01.691 --> 00:05:02.966
and I'll make that a little bit clearer.

00:05:02.966 --> 00:05:06.253
So 75%, every year 75% percent of branches

00:05:06.253 --> 00:05:09.693
are added to the total number of branches.

00:05:09.693 --> 00:05:11.291
And I'll just draw that table again

00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:13.254
like I've done in the last two examples

00:05:13.254 --> 00:05:15.361
to make that hopefully clear.

00:05:15.361 --> 00:05:20.361
Okay, so this is t and this is N of t.

00:05:20.663 --> 00:05:23.946
So t equals zero, you have 42 branches.

00:05:23.946 --> 00:05:28.946
T equals one, it's going
to be 42 times 1.75.

00:05:30.511 --> 00:05:32.200
Times 1.75.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.910
When t equals two, it's going
to be 42 times 1.75 squared.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.425
42 times 1.75

00:05:39.425 --> 00:05:42.056
times 1.75.

00:05:42.056 --> 00:05:44.768
So every year you are multiplying

00:05:44.768 --> 00:05:49.285
times 1.75 so times 1.75,

00:05:49.285 --> 00:05:51.784
something funky is happening
with my pen right over there.

00:05:51.784 --> 00:05:53.665
But if you're multiplying by 1.75,

00:05:53.665 --> 00:05:55.765
if you're growing by a factor of 1.75,

00:05:55.765 --> 00:06:00.765
this is the same thing as adding 75%.

00:06:00.851 --> 00:06:05.258
Once again, you are adding 75%.

00:06:05.258 --> 00:06:06.283
Think about it this way.

00:06:06.283 --> 00:06:08.414
If you just grew by a factor of one,

00:06:08.414 --> 00:06:09.930
then you're not adding anything.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.252
You're staying constant.

00:06:11.252 --> 00:06:14.004
If you grow by 10%, then you're

00:06:14.004 --> 00:06:16.462
going to be 1.1 times as large.

00:06:16.462 --> 00:06:18.842
If you grow by 200% then you're

00:06:18.842 --> 00:06:21.429
going to be two times as large.

00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:23.153
So this right over here?

00:06:23.153 --> 00:06:27.615
This right over here is, is, is.

00:06:27.615 --> 00:06:31.310
If you, let me be very
careful, what I just said.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.620
I think I just mistake that.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.103
If you grow by 200%, you are going to be

00:06:36.103 --> 00:06:39.456
three times as large as you were before.

00:06:39.456 --> 00:06:42.522
One is constant, and then another 200%

00:06:42.522 --> 00:06:44.694
would be another two-fold so that

00:06:44.694 --> 00:06:46.255
would make you three times as large.

00:06:46.255 --> 00:06:47.246
Don't want to confuse you.

00:06:47.246 --> 00:06:48.679
My brain recognized that I said

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:50.395
something weird right at that end.

00:06:50.395 --> 00:06:51.947
All right, hopefully you enjoyed that.
