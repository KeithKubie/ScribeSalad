through a binder clip the binder clip is

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259
through a binder clip the binder clip is
 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.230
through a binder clip the binder clip is
carrying a passenger underneath let's

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240
carrying a passenger underneath let's
 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.700
carrying a passenger underneath let's
say that which is the top of the

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710
say that which is the top of the
 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.620
say that which is the top of the
mountain and we are designing a

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630
mountain and we are designing a
 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.299
mountain and we are designing a
funicular I wanted to carry this

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309
funicular I wanted to carry this
 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.669

passenger up to the top of the mountain

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679
passenger up to the top of the mountain
 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.200

summit of the mountain how can you do

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210
summit of the mountain how can you do
 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.560
summit of the mountain how can you do
this one solution is to just lie down

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570
this one solution is to just lie down
 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.330
this one solution is to just lie down
the stream with a crease and then make

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340
the stream with a crease and then make
 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.460
the stream with a crease and then make
the whole thing go up load but I don't

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470
the whole thing go up load but I don't
 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.689
the whole thing go up load but I don't
think the engineers will accept this

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699
think the engineers will accept this
 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.320
think the engineers will accept this
solution so what we do is to keep those

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330
solution so what we do is to keep those
 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.839
solution so what we do is to keep those
two strings absolutely parallel

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849
two strings absolutely parallel

two strings absolutely parallel
no cheating but then plugging them in

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730
no cheating but then plugging them in

you are just looking at the visioning in

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950
you are just looking at the visioning in

one hand

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760
one hand
 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.000
one hand
what I'm doing is up and down up and

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010
what I'm doing is up and down up and
 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.490
what I'm doing is up and down up and
down and it's a purely symmetric motion

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500
down and it's a purely symmetric motion
 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.380
down and it's a purely symmetric motion
up and down up and down so there's no

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390
up and down up and down so there's no
 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.540
up and down up and down so there's no
directionality and if anything gravity

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550
directionality and if anything gravity
 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.500
directionality and if anything gravity
is pointing downward

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510
is pointing downward
 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.540
is pointing downward
I mean this should keep coming down but

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550
I mean this should keep coming down but
 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.510
I mean this should keep coming down but
instead by doing a completely symmetric

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520
instead by doing a completely symmetric
 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.820
instead by doing a completely symmetric
up and down motion I can take this thing

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830
up and down motion I can take this thing
 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.550
up and down motion I can take this thing
upward in a way that breaks the symmetry

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560
upward in a way that breaks the symmetry
 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.670
upward in a way that breaks the symmetry
and it prefer to go up and not come down

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680
and it prefer to go up and not come down
 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.700
and it prefer to go up and not come down
so that is rather strange and the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710
so that is rather strange and the
 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.080
so that is rather strange and the
wonderful thing about this is the zip

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090
wonderful thing about this is the zip
 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.580
wonderful thing about this is the zip
work even if you're not paying attention

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590
work even if you're not paying attention
 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.440
work even if you're not paying attention
you know it's a really simple device and

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450
you know it's a really simple device and
 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.749
you know it's a really simple device and
even if you are not paying attention and

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759
even if you are not paying attention and
 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.429
even if you are not paying attention and
being distracted by so it's not my

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439
being distracted by so it's not my
 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.130
being distracted by so it's not my
friend ready there I can just do this

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140
friend ready there I can just do this
 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.160
friend ready there I can just do this
and then we're going to be coming down

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170
and then we're going to be coming down
 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.069
and then we're going to be coming down
instead so that's that's wrong so I'm

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079
instead so that's that's wrong so I'm
 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.719
instead so that's that's wrong so I'm
just watching the same thing

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729
just watching the same thing
 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.640
just watching the same thing
no no it's coming down it's not going up

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650
no no it's coming down it's not going up
 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.219
no no it's coming down it's not going up
to what is going but you know if I am

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229
to what is going but you know if I am
 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.999
to what is going but you know if I am
paying attention and okay so this is

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009
paying attention and okay so this is
 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.310
paying attention and okay so this is
this device and if I'm repeating paying

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320
this device and if I'm repeating paying
 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.929
this device and if I'm repeating paying
attention I'm not being distracted

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939

that means you see that this string is

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930
that means you see that this string is
 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.020
that means you see that this string is
touching the left part of the clip only

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030

will be with a clip so this produces

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580
will be with a clip so this produces
 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.610
will be with a clip so this produces
more friction and in fact a static

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620
more friction and in fact a static
 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.470
more friction and in fact a static
friction where this can slide and that

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480
friction where this can slide and that
 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.030
friction where this can slide and that
the dynamic friction and we discussed

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040
the dynamic friction and we discussed
 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.470
the dynamic friction and we discussed
the dynamic friction is slightly smaller

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480
the dynamic friction is slightly smaller
 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.770
the dynamic friction is slightly smaller
than static friction when I do this this

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780
than static friction when I do this this
 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.470

sliding friction wants to pull the clip

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480
sliding friction wants to pull the clip
 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.949
sliding friction wants to pull the clip
down and this friction wants to push the

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959
down and this friction wants to push the
 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.400
down and this friction wants to push the
clip up but because the right friction

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410
clip up but because the right friction
 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.580
clip up but because the right friction
is the static and entangled friction and

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590
is the static and entangled friction and
 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.770
is the static and entangled friction and
the left one is a sliding and free

the left one is a sliding and free
friction and this push up is stronger

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500
friction and this push up is stronger
 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.830
friction and this push up is stronger
than this pull down that's like in this

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840
than this pull down that's like in this

now it twists like this left one gets

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580
now it twists like this left one gets
 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.880
now it twists like this left one gets
pulled up by the stronger friction where
