00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:34.620
Imagine- 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.690
your wife begins to think you’re a closet
alcoholic, so she purchases a breathalyzer

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.699
to test your blood alcohol content (BAC) throughout
the day.

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.570
Your doctors concur with her assessment, thinking
you’re sneaking off into dark corners to

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.090
imbibe without the judging eyes of the world
to condemn you.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.430
The only problem, you really haven’t been
drinking.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.899
All of the begging and pleading in the world
won’t convince anyone.

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.090
After all, you’re constantly drunk.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.400
That’s exactly what happened to a 61 year
old man from Texas.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.040
After going to a local emergency room to complain
of dizziness, he was told he was just drunk.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.780
His BAC was 0.37- nearly 5 times the legal
limit to drive.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.440
The mystery lay in the fact that he hadn’t
been drinking.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.060
So how do you get drunk without drinking or
otherwise putting any alcohol into your body?

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.530
This is where gastroenterologist Dr. Justin
McCarthy, from Lubbock Texas, stepped in to

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.220
try and figure out the curious case of the
drunk man who drank no alcohol.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.540
What they found was that this man had experienced
a set of circumstances that allowed alcohol

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.170
to be fermented within his own stomach and
intestines.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.300
Yes, you can brew alcohol in your stomach.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.540
Endogenous Ethanol production, or Auto-brewery
Syndrome, was first described in medicine

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.120
in 1972 in Japan.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.950
Very few cases are ever reported, presumably
because the syndrome requires an unusual set

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.020
of circumstances to cause noticeable symptoms.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.276
In all of the known cases, some type of yeast
(in this man’s case Saccharomyces cerecisiae,

00:02:09.276 --> 00:02:13.200
or brewer’s yeast) ferments the sugars coming
from carbohydrates or any sugary foods into

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.200
ethanol (ethyl alcohol).

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.640
Should enough ethanol be produced, you get
drunk.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.090
Brewer’s yeast is found in many different
types of foods like breads, wine, and beer.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.689
It’s also sold as a nutritional supplement
due its high levels of selenium, protein,

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:28.379
and B-complex vitamins.

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.159
Unlike other types of baking yeasts, it’s
high in chromium, an essential mineral that

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.719
helps with maintaining our blood sugar levels.

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:41.870
So why is it that such a common food additive,
ingested by people the world over, only creates

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.040
auto-brewery syndrome in such a small number
of people?

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.059
The truth is that the phenomenon of different
types of yeast producing ethanol in our digestive

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:53.050
tracts is very common.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.760
One study of people suspected of having auto-brewery
syndrome showed 61% of people had an increase

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.359
in their blood alcohol level when given oral
glucose (sugar).

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.370
Another study done in the United Arab Emirates
showed that while this alcohol production

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.220
was common, the production was “too low
to have any forensic significance”.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.959
Basically, people don’t complain because
the amount of alcohol produced didn’t give

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.010
them any symptoms.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.809
(Although, that same study noted that the
average blood alcohol level of the participants

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:26.419
was approximately .034%- almost half the legal
limit to drive in most US states.)

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:30.730
That being said, auto-brewery syndrome leading
to problems such as the above man from Texas

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.329
had is rare enough that there haven’t been
many studies performed that can isolate who

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.459
is most at risk of contracting the problem-
unless of course you think getting drunk on

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.319
bread and candy isn’t a problem.

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:43.319
🙂

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.260
One documented case involved a girl who had
a short bowel.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.779
When contents from her shortened bowel began
to grow certain types of yeast (Candida glabrata

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:52.489
and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), those yeasts
fermented any carbohydrates the girl consumed

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.049
and she would become intoxicated.

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.019
Japan has the highest number of cases reported.

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.689
Why do Japanese people have this problem more
than others?

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:01.139
It comes down to enzymes.

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:06.150
About 50% of Japanese people have a mutated
gene that leaves the liver unable to properly

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.469
filter alcohol.

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:11.439
The result leads to them being unable to quickly
get rid of the alcohol in their system, which

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:13.809
in turn means they also remain drunk longer.

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:18.200
So, essentially, smaller amounts of alcohol
produced over time build up to make them drunk

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.750
where others’ bodies might simply be able
to filter out the alcohol quick enough that

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.170
no noticeable symptoms occur.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.620
WARNING: Ultra Nerdy Science Details Right
Ahead: Specifically, many Japanese people

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.620
lack an enzyme called aldehyde dehydrogenase
(ALDH).

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.840
This enzyme would normally convert a byproduct
of ethanol being processed by the liver (acetaldehyde)

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.220
in to a harmless acetate.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.009
Due to the fact they have no ALDH, when they
consume alcohol, or their bodies produce natural

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:45.009
ethanol (remember approximately 61% of suspected
cases have been shown to produce it at low

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.770
levels), it leaves them with a build up of
acetaldehyde in their system.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.009
That excess causes numerous unwanted symptoms
and can also produce more ethanol, thereby

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:56.159
giving them a higher BAC than would normally
be.

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:57.159
/Ultra-Nerdery

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:00.680
As you can see, the circumstances around all
known cases are somewhat different and no

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.970
known definitive test exists that can confirm
diagnosis.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.419
Instead, doctors need to figure out each unique
situation based on the person’s medical

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:09.419
history.

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.860
In all cases, the underlying mechanism of
the syndrome is an overgrowth of yeast in

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.470
the digestive tract that ferments carbohydrates
into ethanol.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.090
The curious case of this 61 year old is no
exception.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.370
His story began in 2004 when he broke his
foot.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.430
After a surgery to repair it, he was given
antibiotics to control the infection.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.090
Directly after that, he became excessively
drunk after only 2 beers, and would even sometimes

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.500
get drunk after not having drunk at all.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.659
What was unusual about this case was that
the gentlemen in question would not become

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:44.050
drunk for sometimes up to 24 hours after ingestion
of carbohydrates.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.580
After several frustrating years, he presented
himself before Dr. McCarthy in 2010 and his

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.039
problem was revealed.

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:54.099
The antibiotics killed off some of the bacteria
in his digestive tract.

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:59.270
The resulting loss allowed a growth of brewer’s
yeast to take hold in his gut.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.430
Drunken sandwiches were on the menu from there
on out!

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.860
His treatment is the same as most people who
have this disorder.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.830
He was given anti-fungal medication (Diflucan)
to kill the yeast, followed by a course of

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.939
Acidophilus (a type of gut bacteria) to recolonize
his digestive tract with appropriate amounts

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:14.840
of gas producing microbes!

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.620
In the end, it is possible to brew beer in
your stomach.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.909
If you want to start avoiding all those liquor
taxes, take a high dose of antibiotics to

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:27.409
kill all your gut bacteria, eat a bunch of
brewer’s yeast and take your date to the

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:28.409
Olive Garden.

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:32.319
Eat all the salad and bread-sticks you want
because you’re not paying for the drinks!

00:06:32.319 --> 00:07:23.139
Who said there aren’t legal ways to avoid
paying taxes…

00:07:23.139 --> 00:08:08.869
Of course… don’t actually 
do that.
