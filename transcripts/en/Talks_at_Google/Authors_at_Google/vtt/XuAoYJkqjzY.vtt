DANA HAN-KLEIN: Hi everyone.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.310
Welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.976
My name's Dana
Han-Klein, and today it's

00:00:05.976 --> 00:00:09.550
my pleasure to introduce Eisner
Award-winning author, Jeffrey

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:10.530
Brown.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.950
He's here with his latest book,
"Darth Vader and Friends."

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:13.480
Welcome.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.087
JEFFREY BROWN: Thank you.

00:00:15.087 --> 00:00:15.586
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:15.586 --> 00:00:17.282
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah.

00:00:17.282 --> 00:00:19.740
So you're going to tell us a
little bit about your process,

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.020
right?

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:20.760
JEFFREY BROWN: Yeah.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.260
Yeah.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.840
Apologies to these people who
are apparently the dark side.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.920
And these must be
the light side.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.238
So a few years ago-- I guess I
won't tell the-- are you going

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:38.821
to ask about--

00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:39.005
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I was, but--

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:39.800
JEFFREY BROWN: --the back story?

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.245
DANA HAN-KLEIN: --you can
start with the back story.

00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:41.340
JEFFREY BROWN: I'll wait
with the back story.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.210
DANA HAN-KLEIN: You can
do the crawl right now.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.740
JEFFREY BROWN: But this was a
book I did three years ago now

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.200
called "Darth Vader and
Son" and the concept

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.140
is Luke Skywalker
being four years old

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.840
and Darth Vader having to
raise him as a single dad.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.690
And I followed that
with a book, which

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.336
I realized after I
was on the way here,

00:01:04.336 --> 00:01:05.960
I should have included
the other books.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.020
But there's a sequel,
"Vader's Little Princess"

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.400
where, of course
Princess Leia needs

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.270
to be the rebellious teenager.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.560
And then I found out
that lots of parents

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.930
were reading these books
to their kids at nighttime,

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.110
and they're
humor-gag books which

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.960
didn't seem like a proper
nighttime bedtime book.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.140
So then I did a book called
"Goodnight, Darth Vader"

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.800
that was more just
specifically for kids.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.310
And after that I kind of
used up a lot of material.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.520
I try to use all real scenes
and quotes from the films.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.980
But I had this idea of doing
a book about R2 and C-3PO

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.000
and how they're friends,
and I had the title LOL

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.260
R2-D2, C-3PO BFF.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.480
And then to pitch
it to Lucas Film

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.560
I came up with a few ideas.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.570
My editor at Chronicle Books,
Steve Bacchus said, "You know,

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.750
are you really going to
be able to sustain C-3PO

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.210
and R2-D2 for an entire book?"

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.990
And I was like, "Oh, I don't
know if I can, actually."

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.620
And part of the problem is that
they're kind of comic relief

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.144
in the movies
anyway, so I used up

00:02:23.144 --> 00:02:25.310
all the jokes that I could
make that weren't already

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.860
jokes in the films.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.410
But he pointed out the
theme of friendship runs

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.040
throughout the
"Star Wars" films,

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.090
and you have Han Solo and
Chewbacca, and Lando and Lobot,

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.360
and the ranker and
the ranker keeper.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.690
You have all these
great friendships.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.195
And so maybe by
expanding the concept out

00:02:49.195 --> 00:02:51.030
it could include all
these other characters,

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.863
which sounded great.

00:02:51.863 --> 00:02:54.570
So I added some more
sketches with some

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.210
of the other characters and
we pitched that to Lucas Film.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.240
And there was a pause
while they waited figured

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.110
out what they wanted to do
with the new movie coming out

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.682
later this year, but in the
end they liked it enough

00:03:07.682 --> 00:03:09.890
and they were like, yeah,
let's go ahead and do this.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.190
So one of the first things
to work on was the cover.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.050
And so these are some
of the cover sketches,

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.230
and trying to capture the feel
of the book, and the theme,

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.940
and hit all the characters.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.300
But in the end, the
sketch that they liked

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.070
was actually one of the ideas
I had for an interior page,

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.890
and it was just Luke, Leia
and Han climbing on Vader

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:47.170
and using the famous "yippee"
line from Episode one.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.790
And so from there,
the cover process

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.640
is usually you do
a bunch of sketches

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.640
and then you get feedback
and you narrow it

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.520
down to the concept
you like, and then

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.880
start working on more and
more finished sketches.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.340
So I did three versions
in color with kind

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.940
of various combinations
of characters.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.230
And they liked
this one, but they

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.110
liked Lando holding the
stormtrooper helmet,

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.959
and they asked about
having R2 and 3PO.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.589
And I was trying
to figure out how

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:28.870
to fit 3PO in the composition
and not have it be too crowded.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.160
So eventually ended
up with this sketch.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.540
And from there came up
with the finished art.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.680
And so there's the cover.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.220
But the hard part for
this book was actually

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.270
the interior pages.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:51.830
And so the books are 64 pages
and there's a copyright page

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:52.710
and a title page.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.540
So there's about 60-- I needed
to come up with about 60 ideas.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.520
So for this book I
came up-- in order

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.950
to get to 60 ideas for the book,
I came up with around 140 ideas

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.020
that I sketched out.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:14.840
And so some of them are
based on my own experiences

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.760
with friends.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.120
You know, losing your best
friend to someone else,

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.062
as Lobot did.

00:05:22.062 --> 00:05:24.270
He doesn't even get to show
up and return to the Jedi

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.890
because [INAUDIBLE] is
Lando's new best friend.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:30.650
This is an idea.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.670
I wanted to do something
with the X-wing pilots,

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.460
and you can see I'll put
notes to myself about things

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.940
that I might switch out later.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.950
And this is all
these friends who

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.860
are X-wing pilots had just
worked out their problems

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.720
and buried their
hatchets and then

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.690
they're going on the I'll get
killed in the Death Star run.

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:58.740
One of the other things that I
had the chance do in this book

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.180
was try and fit some
jokes about the prequel.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.120
So here you have
Captain Typho, who

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.350
of course is the seeing eye.

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:14.060
And he sees Anakin and
[INAUDIBLE] and the other guy

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.790
says, "didn't see
that coming, did you?"

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:16.616
Get it?

00:06:16.616 --> 00:06:17.990
This was probably
my favorite one

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.880
that didn't end up
making it into the book.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:26.390
That's and younger
Anakin and Qui-Gon,

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.850
or it's Qui-Gon and
young Obi Wan Kenobi

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.556
talking about midi-chlorians.

00:06:33.556 --> 00:06:36.332
"This midi-chlorian
reading is off the charts.

00:06:36.332 --> 00:06:37.790
Not even Yoda has
a count his high.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.120
No Jedi has-- Do you
know what that means?

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.620
Huh?

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.490
What, what?

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.410
Sorry, I kind of zoned out
when you said midi-chlorian."

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.330
And then there's young Anakin
throwing a fit because he

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.646
can't be in the Jedi Council.

00:06:50.646 --> 00:06:52.020
This is another
one that I really

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:58.009
liked that was just maybe a
little too violent or implying

00:06:58.009 --> 00:06:59.300
too much violence for the book.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.560
So it's little Luke,
and he's wondering

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.520
what this button
does as the ranker is

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.570
standing under the gate.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.780
So I wrote these
books for adults,

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.110
but when I started I wanted
to make them kid-friendly.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.990
So there's some jokes like this
that just don't make the cut.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.280
This is another joke
that I've actually

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.780
pitched for various books.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:27.950
So the idea of putting
C-3PO back and it's

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.770
like when you get together as a
family to put puzzles together.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.460
And then I also pitched
it as Christmas morning

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.250
when you get the bicycle
and then you have

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.100
to put the bicycle together.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.370
Instead it's C-3PO, and
Vader has to figure out--

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.536
he's trying to figure out
how to put C-3PO together.

00:07:43.536 --> 00:07:45.749
But the process is
going back and forth

00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:48.290
with the editor at Lucas Film,
the editor at Chronicle Books,

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.020
and we all kind of
go back and forth

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.645
about which ones
we like the most

00:07:51.645 --> 00:07:53.500
and which ones we'd
like to include.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:08:00.170
And I was the only one who ever
was voting for this concept.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.740
But there it is.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:07.239
I also, I didn't get
Boba Fett into the book

00:08:07.239 --> 00:08:09.780
as much as I wanted, and so this
is one of my Boba Fett jokes

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.320
that maybe needed to be
developed a little more.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.560
And it's just all the
guys at Java's Palace

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.020
think Boba Fett's so cool,
and they're like "Stay.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.800
Hang out with us."

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.070
Boba says, "I guess
it can't hurt."

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.346
Because-- this is a
spoiler, but if you

00:08:25.346 --> 00:08:27.220
haven't seen "Return of
the Jedi," Boba Fett,

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.886
he stays at the palace
and then he dies.

00:08:31.623 --> 00:08:32.789
And then here's another one.

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:36.299
This is one that I-- so some
of the jokes and ideas I'll

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:39.142
sketch out I know won't
be used in the books,

00:08:39.142 --> 00:08:40.725
but I just do it for
my own amusement.

00:08:40.725 --> 00:08:44.039
So of course this is Luke at
Han Solo trying to buy beer.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:46.265
And you don't need to
see our identification.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.670
And this is another idea
that I really liked,

00:08:53.670 --> 00:09:01.982
and it's the battle droids,
and the lead battle droid is

00:09:01.982 --> 00:09:03.190
like "You guys are the best."

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.523
And then they go out and
they're just getting massacred,

00:09:05.523 --> 00:09:07.310
and like, "You guys suck."

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:08.750
And then he's like, "I'm sorry.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:09.583
I didn't mean that."

00:09:09.583 --> 00:09:14.800
Because in the end,
they're all in it together.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:20.270
So I did the pencils and
the feedback on this one

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:23.332
was there was just
too much going on

00:09:23.332 --> 00:09:26.390
or the joke wasn't
getting across.

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:30.100
So I redid another
two-panel version,

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:33.880
and even that one, the response
was that it was too much.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.150
And so then I just
simplified it down.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:40.350
It's just a little sweeter
and more straightforward.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:45.200
But it's still funny.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:50.790
And then sometimes I would
get an idea from other people,

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.500
so this is an idea from my
editor at Lucas Films who

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.450
was J.W. Rinzler.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.090
I don't know if any of you
have read the big coffee table

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:59.130
making of Star Wars books.

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:02.350
But he wrote those, but
he's also worked with me

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.300
on all my Vader books.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:08.700
And he said, how
about doing something

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.100
based on the Annie Hall scene.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.600
So if you've seen the movie
"Annie Hall" with Woody Allen,

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.490
and there's a scene
where they're driving

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:19.210
and Annie is just driving
crazy and Woody Allen's

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:19.905
just terrified.

00:10:19.905 --> 00:10:22.285
And then he is reaching
down for something

00:10:22.285 --> 00:10:24.850
and he finds a sandwich.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:31.480
So the initial idea was to
have it be Anakin and Obi-Wan

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.740
on [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:37.760
And it just didn't seem to
fit with the rest of the book.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:42.630
And I realized it
would make more sense

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:47.030
to have it be Obi-Wan riding
in Luke's landspeeder.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:55.850
So for all the images I
would pencil up the full page

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:59.570
and Lucas Film would
approve all the pencils.

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:01.890
And once the pencils
are approved,

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.840
then we'd work on the final art.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.700
One of the things I liked being
able to include in the book

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.360
is just the imperial
officers who

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:19.130
are just-- I think they
don't get enough screen

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:20.170
time to be funny.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:28.630
And I managed to fit in
my original high-fiving R2

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:33.410
and C-3PO, as well as
2-1B is the medical droid,

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:34.850
one of my favorite droids.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:44.350
If you watched college
football or any sporting event

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:48.570
where there's a band, they
all know the Imperial March.

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:54.080
And I decided it seems like
people play that whenever

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:54.880
they have a chance.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.410
And so I thought
it would make sense

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:00.360
if anywhere Vader
showed up, there'd

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.900
just be a band
there playing that.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:03.526
Yeah.

00:12:03.526 --> 00:12:04.900
This was just from
a page where I

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.109
tried to fit in every
creature and character

00:12:07.109 --> 00:12:09.150
that I hadn't been able
to fit in somewhere else.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.429
And so Luke's line,
"I grew up here.

00:12:15.429 --> 00:12:16.720
There's nothing really to see."

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.030
Then of course it's just
all these fantastic aliens

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.850
and creatures.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:23.620
And then this is the
final page of the book,

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.721
and it's a twist
on a line that's

00:12:25.721 --> 00:12:28.220
in every film, which is "I've
got a bad feeling about this."

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.050
And then it just kind
of wraps up the book,

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:34.090
"I've got a good
feeling about this."

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:39.740
Maybe a little sappy and
sweet, but I think that's OK.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:43.319
We'll save that for, or
should I do that now?

00:12:43.319 --> 00:12:44.110
DANA HAN-KLEIN: OK.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:47.000
JEFFREY BROWN: So
I thought I would--

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.200
you might think that it's really
difficult to draw Darth Vader,

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.830
but it's actually really simple.

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:54.870
So I'm going to
walk you through-- I

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:56.910
just realized I need a big pen.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.260
So this is how to
draw Darth Vader.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:04.980
So first you draw
the half circle,

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:08.480
which is coincidentally how you
start to draw the Death Star.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.820
Draw a line down the middle.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:18.905
You might want take your time
and make those more even,

00:13:18.905 --> 00:13:22.885
or else people will think Vader
is just questioning everything.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.820
I, however, being an
experienced artist

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.730
know that when
you make mistakes,

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:31.760
you can just fix them.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.687
So draw the crescent moon.

00:13:38.687 --> 00:13:40.395
And then you can start
drawing triangles.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.950
Draw a bunch of triangles.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.840
More triangles.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.350
It's really all triangles.

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:57.610
Vader needs to breathe, and
so you just add your lines.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.060
So there's Vader.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.640
So Vader's helmet is
just this static thing,

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.890
and you can't
really-- in the movies

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.681
it's all body language and
dialogue that gives him

00:14:11.681 --> 00:14:12.180
emotion.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.830
But in comics you
can play around

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:17.486
with physics a little more.

00:14:17.486 --> 00:14:18.362
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:18.362 --> 00:14:21.215
You can kind of change
his helmet a little bit.

00:14:21.215 --> 00:14:22.590
So if you look at
the book, there

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.890
are times when I'll
change things subtly

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:30.885
in his helmet to give him a
little wider range of emotion.

00:14:30.885 --> 00:14:33.010
One thing I learned when
I was doing the first book

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:35.400
was that you can't
make Vader too dark.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.010
And in fact, the
first book you'll see

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:40.600
is like a little inconsistent
about how dark Vader ends up

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.180
being.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.640
So you can't color him in
too black and that's easy.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.090
So that's how you draw Vader.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:51.907
And so now I guess I'll
answer-- well, we'll talk

00:14:51.907 --> 00:14:53.365
and then we'll take
some questions?

00:14:53.365 --> 00:14:54.240
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.357
JEFFREY BROWN: Or I don't know
how long that just took me.

00:14:57.357 --> 00:15:00.339
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I
think you're good.

00:15:00.339 --> 00:15:02.472
Not a problem.

00:15:02.472 --> 00:15:04.430
I think my first question
reads, how many times

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:06.657
have you seen "Star Wars?"

00:15:06.657 --> 00:15:08.865
JEFFREY BROWN: You know I
was looking at my computer,

00:15:08.865 --> 00:15:12.230
and it said I'd only watched
"Empire Strikes Back"

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:16.990
six times, and I hadn't
watched the other ones at all.

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:20.380
So I think iTunes might
be wrong about that.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:25.040
But probably like
hundreds of times,

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:30.300
at least for the first original
trilogy, and the prequels

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:31.840
maybe 20 times [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.290
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Do
you find yourself

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:34.630
watching it every time
you're writing a new book?

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.010
I assume you know
much of it by memory.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:38.160
JEFFREY BROWN: Yeah.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.960
Definitely the first few books,
and then the last book just

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:45.290
a little less.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.200
But then I'll go back when
I'm working with drawings

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:53.110
I'll use a combination of
watching the films and pausing,

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:57.122
and then also lots of
reference books and things.

00:15:57.122 --> 00:15:59.580
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I think the
question I'm probably obligated

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:03.220
to ask is so this idea actually
came from a scratch Google

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:03.864
Doodle idea.

00:16:03.864 --> 00:16:04.780
JEFFREY BROWN: It did.

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.950
It started here.

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:13.260
So I had met Ryan Germich who
runs the Google Doodle team.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.200
And they had come
up with an idea

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:21.540
about doing something with
Vader for Father's Day.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:27.330
And their idea was how awkward
an everyday father-son moment

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:30.430
would have if Luke came
home for Thanksgiving

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:33.050
and they were having
Thanksgiving dinner

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.740
with Luke and Vader.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:39.000
And I was a father
at that point,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.890
and I had met
Ryan, in fact, when

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:44.607
I was started out doing
autobiographical comics, which

00:16:44.607 --> 00:16:46.190
all my autobiographical
comics are all

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:48.250
about awkward everyday moments.

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.434
And I'd also done humorous
science fiction parity stuff.

00:16:51.434 --> 00:16:52.850
So he thought I'd
be a good person

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:55.120
to bring in and see if
I could do something.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.385
So my son was four at the time,
so I basically turned Luke

00:16:58.385 --> 00:16:59.260
into a four-year-old.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.593
I thought that would be perfect.

00:17:00.593 --> 00:17:04.480
And then put Vader in
my shoes as a parent.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:09.640
And then, yeah, they ended
up using a different concept.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.750
And I was really
bummed at first,

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.530
and then I realized
I could take the idea

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:16.619
and I could do more with
it, and I could actually

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:18.200
turn it into a book.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.535
So it actually worked out--

00:17:19.535 --> 00:17:21.409
DANA HAN-KLEIN: It worked
out better for you.

00:17:21.409 --> 00:17:23.159
JEFFREY BROWN: really,
really well for me.

00:17:23.159 --> 00:17:25.030
We might have missed
out on that one.

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:29.300
Yeah, so you've mentioned
your previous works are really

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.270
emotional, kind of you
as being a young adult

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.300
or being in the early
stage of adulthood.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.640
And now you're exploring
being a father.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.350
And what's the
next step for you?

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:41.266
JEFFREY BROWN: Dying.

00:17:41.266 --> 00:17:41.752
DANA HAN-KLEIN: OK.

00:17:41.752 --> 00:17:42.252
All right.

00:17:42.252 --> 00:17:43.085
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:43.085 --> 00:17:43.835
JEFFREY BROWN: No.

00:17:43.835 --> 00:17:45.668
DANA HAN-KLEIN: That's
the end of a trilogy.

00:17:47.607 --> 00:17:49.815
JEFFREY BROWN: You're young
and then you fall in love

00:17:49.815 --> 00:17:51.481
and then you have
kids and then you die.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.530
Yeah, I think as far
as autobiographical,

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.860
the Vader books are
autobiographical in a way

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:04.620
because it's about parenting
and being a parent.

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.310
I draw on my own experiences.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:07.810
And I did another
"Star Wars" series

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:10.070
called "Jedi Academy," which is
middle school set in the "Star

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.710
Wars" universe.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:12.410
And there's lots
of things in there

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:18.320
that are straight out of my own
experiences from middle school.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:23.040
So autobiographical, I feel like
I've covered everything that's

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.010
happened in my life up to now.

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:28.510
So you need to wait
till I do more stuff.

00:18:31.125 --> 00:18:32.500
So right now I'm
actually working

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.070
on a book about Neanderthals.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:38.100
I'm just trying to go as
far opposite from science

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.350
fiction, "Star Wars" as I can.

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:40.910
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Far
in the [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:42.660
JEFFREY BROWN: So I
wanted to do something

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.490
about cavemen that was based
on actual research more

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:50.600
than the traditional
media portrayals for kids

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.767
where it's "Flintstones"
where they're driving--

00:18:52.767 --> 00:18:53.850
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Dinosaurs.

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:54.890
They're pulling cars.

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:56.630
JEFFREY BROWN: --dinosaur cars.

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:57.720
Or "Captain Caveman."

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.260
I don't know if anyone
remembers "Captain Caveman,"

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.755
but he's this hairy guy and
he'll pull telephones out

00:19:03.755 --> 00:19:06.880
of his hair.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.404
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Look forward
to the revival of that.

00:19:09.404 --> 00:19:11.070
So who are some of
your influences then?

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.060
JEFFREY BROWN: Jeez,
where to start.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.720
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Well, I
assume the writing part

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.957
and the illustration part
have different influences.

00:19:20.957 --> 00:19:22.790
JEFFREY BROWN: Well,
they do and they don't.

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:24.750
I mean there's lots
of cartoonists.

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:29.460
So there's some
autobiographical cartoonists

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.930
who were big influences.

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:35.070
Julie Doucet is a Canadian
artist who doesn't really

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:36.360
do comics as much anymore.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:40.840
But her work was
really influential.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.690
Chris Ware and Dan
Clowes are guys

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:47.960
that were big influences on me.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:52.321
But I feel like as an artist
you try and draw influences

00:19:52.321 --> 00:19:52.820
from many.

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:58.210
So music is a big
influence for me.

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:01.540
So just the idea of
song writing and writing

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.240
a song that can have some
kind of emotional impact.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:08.090
So when I hear a song
that does that for me,

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.460
then it makes me want
to draw comics that

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:13.990
can do that for someone else.

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:16.030
And "Star Wars,"
I mean "Star Wars"

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:17.520
was a big influence growing up.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.619
So I grew up with the
movies and the trading cards

00:20:19.619 --> 00:20:22.160
and everything, but there's a
book called "The Empire Strikes

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.960
Back Notebook," which had a
lot of the production art.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:30.280
And seeing that was something
that I found really inspiring

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:35.820
as a kid, and realizing there's
people doing all these drawings

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:40.130
before the movie gets made, and
that seemed like a lot of fun

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.177
to me.

00:20:42.177 --> 00:20:43.760
DANA HAN-KLEIN: In
what order will you

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:47.470
let your children watch
the "Star Wars" movie?

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:50.416
Will you let them watch all
six or nine by the time that

00:20:50.416 --> 00:20:51.230
we're--

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:52.896
JEFFREY BROWN: So my
older son is eight,

00:20:52.896 --> 00:20:54.447
and so far he's
watched "Star Wars"

00:20:54.447 --> 00:20:57.030
and "Empire Strikes Back," or
"A New Hope" and "Empire Strikes

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:58.470
Back" in that order.

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:01.260
And our younger
son is two and he

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.400
started to watch--
he watched "New Hope"

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.525
and then he started to
watch "Empire Strikes Back."

00:21:05.525 --> 00:21:07.640
Because I figured
the second kid,

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.020
you just let them do whatever.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.390
So I figured he was old enough.

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:13.390
He didn't need to
wait any longer.

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:15.910
I saw "Star Wars"
when I was two,

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:17.160
and I'm the youngest of three.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.805
So it made sense.

00:21:18.805 --> 00:21:19.680
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.660
It paid off for you.

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:27.077
JEFFREY BROWN: So do
that, then the prequels.

00:21:27.077 --> 00:21:29.660
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Now everything
is supposed to be canon, right?

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:33.580
So does that mean that
four-year-old Luke is actually

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:35.630
part of the "Star
Wars" canon officially?

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:37.656
JEFFREY BROWN: No, I think
that still operates--

00:21:37.656 --> 00:21:38.580
DANA HAN-KLEIN: You
guys have go to pass on.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.413
JEFFREY BROWN: Yeah.

00:21:39.413 --> 00:21:42.520
I think it's a weird thing.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:46.750
It's not parity, it's
not satire exactly.

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:49.910
And that was one of the reasons
why I want it to be officially

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:51.650
Lucas Film license
was I didn't want

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:57.440
to have to make it
dark father lord

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.370
and then make up
dialogue and everything,

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:04.305
and just have it seem like a
slightly funny cheap knockoff.

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:12.600
And so yeah, I don't
know where it fits in.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:17.720
Personally, I think that
maybe, especially comic book

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:22.170
companies, but also in cases
like "Star Wars," people

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:26.300
worry too much about
continuity and canon.

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:30.020
For me, George Lucas,
his rule was always

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.330
that if the films are
canon then everything else

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:33.819
is something else.

00:22:33.819 --> 00:22:35.110
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Extended, yeah.

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:36.690
JEFFREY BROWN: And
I like the idea

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:40.720
of being able to do different
things with the characters.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.760
It's great to be able to
make your own characters

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.140
and stories, and
there's a certain kind

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.420
of creative process
that that brings.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.860
But when you have
characters that

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.510
have such a weighted
history, you

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:56.770
can do different
things a lot easier

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.790
and you can use that
history with them

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:02.460
in ways that would take
too much time to build up

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.470
with your own material.

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:09.930
But yeah, I don't really
worry where they'll fit in.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:13.160
I mean I figure as long as
I'm having fun drawing them,

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.350
that's my concern.

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:17.600
DANA HAN-KLEIN: What are
some of your favorite moments

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.300
from the movies that
got incorporated

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.244
in kind of your own spin, way.

00:23:22.244 --> 00:23:23.910
Because when I read
the books and I hear

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:25.868
Darth Vader's voice in
my head saying the line,

00:23:25.868 --> 00:23:27.770
but it's in a totally
different situation.

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:29.520
JEFFREY BROWN: I think
one of my favorites

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:37.610
is in "Vader's Little Princess,"
there's the scene where

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:40.230
Leia and Hansel are kissing
and then you have Vader going,

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:41.002
"No!"

00:23:41.002 --> 00:23:42.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.430
And I thought it
was a really fun way

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:51.400
to poke fun at the whole "no"
controversy, but also just

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.830
a really funny joke on its own.

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:58.126
I did have an alternate version
of Leia and Luke kissing,

00:23:58.126 --> 00:23:59.058
and Vader, "No!"

00:23:59.058 --> 00:24:00.724
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Maybe
a little too dark.

00:24:00.724 --> 00:24:02.390
JEFFREY BROWN: Yeah,
it seemed like that

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:03.920
was going too far maybe.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.170
DANA HAN-KLEIN: The explanation
required for that one.

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:08.610
I also loved when
Darth Vader leads

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:10.490
Han to the carbonite
chamber after,

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.710
being a seventh grade
interpretation on that.

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:15.710
JEFFREY BROWN: Yeah, I
wondered how much of that

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:16.500
was subconscious.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.700
He's like, "That guy."

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.820
I'm just picking him
at random, but yeah.

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:22.480
DANA HAN KLEIN: There's
something about him

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.140
I don't like.

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:27.870
What color light
saber would you have?

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:29.200
JEFFREY BROWN: Blue.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.660
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Wookies or ewoks?

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:34.152
JEFFREY BROWN: Ewoks.

00:24:34.152 --> 00:24:35.860
DANA HAN-KLEIN: What
piece of "Star Wars"

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:37.826
memorabilia would
you love to have?

00:24:37.826 --> 00:24:39.200
JEFFREY BROWN:
Oh, I mean I would

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.605
love to have one of
the storyboard drawings

00:24:42.605 --> 00:24:48.270
by Joe Johnston or any
of that production art

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:49.860
would be really cool
to have I think.

00:24:52.855 --> 00:24:54.980
DANA HAN-KLEIN: If you were
hosting a dinner party,

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.920
you can have three characters
from "Star Wars" universe

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:57.270
there.

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:57.936
Who do you want?

00:24:57.936 --> 00:25:00.080
It's just rapid
fire nerd question.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.380
JEFFREY BROWN: So Yoda,
because he's my favorite.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.520
He's funny.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.740
R2-D2 because then he
could bring drinks.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:10.052
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Good answer.

00:25:10.052 --> 00:25:13.720
JEFFREY BROWN: I
don't know, a tauntaun

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.834
to provide drive home randomly.

00:25:15.834 --> 00:25:18.250
Does that count as a character
or is that like a creature?

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:19.125
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah.

00:25:19.125 --> 00:25:20.860
It could be a character.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:24.490
So you've mentioned you're
going to work on Neanderthals.

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:26.597
Are there any other
franchises you might explore?

00:25:26.597 --> 00:25:28.222
You mentioned "Lord
of the Rings" a lot

00:25:28.222 --> 00:25:29.013
in your other work.

00:25:29.013 --> 00:25:31.010
JEFFREY BROWN: Yeah.

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:33.330
I grew up reading a
lot of fantasy also,

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:36.220
and was a big Tolkien fan.

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.325
That would be a lot of
fun to do at some point.

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:43.420
I'm not as big a
"Star Trek" fan,

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:45.540
but especially the
original series

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:51.370
and the Captain Kirk movies I
think have a lot of potential.

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:53.870
That would be fun to do
something with those.

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:57.809
And lately, I like watching
"Game of Thrones" a lot.

00:25:57.809 --> 00:25:59.975
And I was like oh, "Game
of Thrones." what could you

00:25:59.975 --> 00:26:01.070
do with "Game of Thrones?"

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:03.270
DANA HAN-KLEIN: A lot.

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:05.995
JEFFREY BROWN: There's no
end to the possibilities.

00:26:05.995 --> 00:26:06.870
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Cool.

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:10.240
So what are you
reading right now?

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.290
JEFFREY BROWN: What am
I reading right now?

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:15.505
What did I just read?

00:26:15.505 --> 00:26:16.415
I don't know.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:24.450
Well, I'll talk about what I'm
looking forward to reading.

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:28.680
Haruki Murakami has
his first two novellas

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:31.940
are coming out in English
for the first time.

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.590
Well, in America.

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:37.130
And I had actually read them
because a friend had copies

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.840
that he got in Japan
that were in English.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.891
So I'm looking forward
to reading that when

00:26:41.891 --> 00:26:43.765
it comes out because I
haven't read it since.

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:50.770
So honestly, right now I'm
reading this "You Might Be A

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:55.267
Zombie Book" that's a collection
of craked.com humor stuff.

00:26:55.267 --> 00:26:56.550
DANA HAN-KLEIN: [LAUGH]

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:57.400
JEFFREY BROWN: Sorry,
it's really [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.980
DANA HAN-KLEIN: That's
not a bad answer.

00:26:58.980 --> 00:26:59.980
JEFFREY BROWN: It's honesty.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:00.270
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah.

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:01.789
That's what we want here.

00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:04.330
What are some of the best books
that you've discovered having

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.288
your own kids, and have
those ever influenced--

00:27:06.288 --> 00:27:10.030
I mean obviously, "Goodnight
Darth Vader" is kind of a--

00:27:11.824 --> 00:27:13.240
JEFFREY BROWN: I
mean I don't know

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:16.600
if it's so much as I've
discover-- I mean I

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.960
guess I have discovered a lot.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.585
But a lot of it's
re-discovering books.

00:27:19.585 --> 00:27:22.530
So my mom saves everything,
so she had all my books

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:25.630
from when I was a kid in a box.

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:32.050
And so they've just
been incorporated

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:34.170
into my kids' libraries.

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:37.530
And so "Goodnight
Moon" is a classic.

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:41.490
And then just reading other
Margaret Wise Brown books

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:43.930
that I haven't read when
I was a kid, or at least I

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:47.132
don't remember reading.

00:27:47.132 --> 00:27:48.840
There's a book called
"Bagel's Lucky Hat"

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.370
that's out-of-print
unfortunately,

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:55.510
but it's actually
a kids book that

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:58.600
was written under a
pseudonym by a guy Dave

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:02.650
Cooper who's a cartoonist who's
another influence of mine.

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:07.720
And then yeah, one of the
big books for me growing up

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:11.780
was a book called "Small in the
Saddle" by Mark Alan Stamaty.

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:17.673
And after having our first
son, and I went and got

00:28:17.673 --> 00:28:19.920
all these other kids books.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.530
So the one that's
widely available

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:25.260
now is "Who Needs
Donuts?" which is also

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:28.385
a lot of fun, a lot of crazy
really intricate drawings.

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:33.900
DANA HAN-KLEIN: If you could
go back in time 15 years, what

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:34.990
would you tell yourself.

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:36.100
JEFFREY BROWN: 15 years.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:37.558
DANA HAN-KLEIN: 10
years, 15 years.

00:28:37.558 --> 00:28:40.485
JEFFREY BROWN: What was I doing?

00:28:40.485 --> 00:28:42.370
I wouldn't tell myself anything.

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:44.420
I probably couldn't
even look at myself.

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:45.939
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:45.939 --> 00:28:46.730
DANA HAN-KLEIN: OK.

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:54.635
JEFFREY BROWN: I mean I turned
out relatively OK, but--

00:28:54.635 --> 00:28:56.510
DANA HAN-KLEIN: There's
no looking backwards.

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:58.786
JEFFREY BROWN: Yeah,
those early 20s, ugh.

00:28:58.786 --> 00:29:01.160
DANA HAN-KLEIN: You've kind
of documented a lot of your--

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.030
JEFFREY BROWN: Yeah.

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:03.342
If you read them you'll see.

00:29:03.342 --> 00:29:04.300
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I have.

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:05.420
I've read them.

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:06.830
JEFFREY BROWN:
I've relived that.

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:08.246
There's nothing I
can tell myself.

00:29:08.246 --> 00:29:09.540
I was beyond help.

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:11.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:14.040
Just needed to go through it.

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.659
Get the crying over with.

00:29:16.659 --> 00:29:18.700
DANA HAN-KLEIN: OK, so my
last question before we

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:19.912
turn to audience
questions, and you

00:29:19.912 --> 00:29:22.270
don't have to, but what is
your either best Darth Vader

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:24.010
or wookie impression?

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:24.760
JEFFREY BROWN: Oh.

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:30.280
I do wookie impressions
for my kids.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.570
But it's not something
I would pull out here.

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:37.621
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:37.621 --> 00:29:41.020
[DARTH VADER VOICE]
All too easy.

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:43.040
It's better with a microphone.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:43.540
[BREATHING]

00:29:47.002 --> 00:29:49.450
DANA HAN-KLEIN: There we go.

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:49.950
Cool.

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:51.783
So we have time for
some audience questions.

00:29:51.783 --> 00:29:56.522
If anyone has any,
now's your chance.

00:29:56.522 --> 00:29:59.020
AUDIENCE: So who
gets final cuts when

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:00.478
some of the stuff
that you're doing

00:30:00.478 --> 00:30:05.565
pushes on Lucas's idea
of I guess a brand?

00:30:05.565 --> 00:30:06.690
JEFFREY BROWN: Lucas Films.

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:07.760
They have the final cut.

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:14.440
But strangely, it's been
super smooth process.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:20.510
And part of it is I kind of
know what they would cut anyway,

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:24.710
and so I don't push it too much.

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:27.410
But also I think the nature of
the books, especially the Vader

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:30.610
books where they are kind
of sweet and wanting them

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:34.650
to kind of be something
that is good for both

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:37.919
the parents and the kids.

00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:38.460
I don't know.

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:42.000
It's just always ended up in a
space where there's never been

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.750
anything where they're like no.

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:48.960
At least nothing that I was
like no, it has to be like this.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:53.610
So there's things I push back
on that they were like, OK.

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:58.030
But I don't think-- I mean like
some of the sketches in there,

00:30:58.030 --> 00:30:59.920
and I had others
for the other books,

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.640
like jokes about Luke's hand
getting cut off and things.

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:05.330
I kind of knew that those
weren't going to make it,

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:09.825
but I was also OK with that.

00:31:09.825 --> 00:31:12.310
AUDIENCE: Do you notice
any kind of difference

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:14.298
from pre and post [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:17.251 --> 00:31:19.250
JEFFREY BROWN: I if there's
more of a difference

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:21.930
for the publishers and
working out their licensing

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:23.440
deals than there's been for me.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.320
I mean I'm working with
the same people in general

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:29.410
that I was working with before.

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:32.839
The biggest thing was right when
the acquisition happened they

00:31:32.839 --> 00:31:34.130
kind of put everything on hold.

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:37.890
So I'd actually pitched the
"Goodnight Darth Vader book

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:45.064
and what became "Darth Vader and
Friends" right around the time

00:31:45.064 --> 00:31:46.480
the acquisition
happened, and they

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.880
were like we need to
just wait and see.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:53.660
And same with, at that point,
"Jedi Academy One" was out.

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:57.380
And we thought it
could become a trilogy,

00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:00.500
and they were like we don't
know if we can do more just yet.

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:03.770
And so that was the
only difference for me

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:05.040
at that point.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:09.570
But creatively, it's really
been the same process.

00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:15.320
Maybe some of the feedback
takes a little bit longer

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:21.929
to hear back from them,
but not a huge amount.

00:32:21.929 --> 00:32:24.220
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Well, thank
you so much for joining us.

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:25.880
It was fun to have you here.

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.730
Give him a round of applause.
