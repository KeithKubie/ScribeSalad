00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.420
Let's get started.
A couple of announcements.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.850
A remember about the Periodic Table
test which will be added next week

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.280
on the 23rd. You can see the
website if you want to download a

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.710
copy of this to practice on it.
You are required only to put the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.140
one or two-letter chemical
abbreviation, the symbol.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.570
Some people ask me if I want you to
know the molecular weights and so on,

00:00:46.570 --> 00:01:04.540
and I thought that
was bit excessive.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:57.440
So I think if you just know the
symbols for the ones that are up

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.880
there, that would be just dandy.
Here is the lady's scarf, very hot,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:10.330
black. See, trim lines, blue and
gold, and it has elements on it.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.770
Very hot. And there is a necktie,
comparable fabric, comparable

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.300
pattern. It is not geeky.
This is very hot.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.920
You need this. Let's get on with
the lesson. Last day we looked at

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.530
Rutherford, Geiger,
Marsden and the experiment that they

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.150
conducted on the gold foil.
And out of that came the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.760
recognition that Thompson's plum
pudding model is not sustainable in

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.380
the light of this evidence.
And in its stead Rutherford

00:01:45.380 --> 00:02:03.760
proposed something akin
to a planetary system.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:54.710
And there is something I would like
you to be tuned into here.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.420
People to this day are looking for
a theory of everything.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.140
And there is something very
appealing about the notion that the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.850
rules that govern the motion of
heavenly bodies might be applicable

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.570
down at atomic dimensions.
This is very cosmic. There is a

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.280
gestalt here. We ended the day with
Bohr's model of the atom,

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:37.160
which derived from the
conceptualization of Rutherford.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:27.150
And this model is quantitative.
And I think I put up the postulates.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.300
And what I am going to do today is
go in some detail through the Bohr

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.460
model, so let's do that.
I am going to put up the most

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.610
primitive version.
It is a one electron atom.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.760
It has a nucleus at the center
charged positively.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.920
This is where most of the mass
resides and the positive

00:02:47.920 --> 00:03:07.106
charge resides.
And orbiting around this is a lone

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
electron out at some distance r.
And I don't have to worry about

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
these relative dimensions because we
know from Marsden's calculations

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
that, on the length scale that I
have shown here,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
these would be just tiny little dots.
It is about 10,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
00 to one, the ratio of the nuclear
dimension to the entire atomic

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
dimension. And so we have a
positive charge in the nucleus which

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
is given by the number of protons.
This is a one electron atom.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:24.140
It could be hydrogen,
it could be helium plus,

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.280
it could be lithium double plus and
so on. These are all one electron

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.420
atoms, and they are gas,
a single atom. This will be Z times

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.560
the elementary charge.
Remember, e represents the

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.710
elementary charge,
not the charge on the electron.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.850
The charge on the electron is minus
e. This is Z times e in the center.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:04:05.233
And out here we have the charge on
the electron as simply equal to e.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:53.660
I am going to highlight this by
calling this q1,

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.330
lower case q being the charge here
on the nucleus.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.990
And lower case q sub 2 is the
charge on the electron.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.660
And that is given by minus e.
And so the other thing that we

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.330
consider is the nucleus as being
stationary. We have an orbiting

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.990
electron but a stationary nucleus.
And Rutherford, who I have already

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:21.660
described to you as being a little
bit colorful in his language,

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.880
backed up Bohr on this.
He said when an elephant has fleas

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.640
it is the fleas that do the jumping.
That is why we don't worry about

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.410
the motion of the nucleus because
the ratio of mass is about 2,

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.170
00 to one. What I am going to do is
use these postulates and go through

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.930
the basis for the Bohr model.
The first thing we are going to do

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.700
is describe the energy of the system.
The total energy of the system,

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.460
which we are going to get from
postulate number four,

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.230
which says the energy of the
electron, which is the energy of the

00:04:52.230 --> 00:05:12.326
system, is the sum of the kinetic
and the potential energy.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:59.420
Let's write that.
And, as I reminded you at the end

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.850
of last day, the only reason I am
doing this for you right now is I

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.280
want to elucidate the principles.
It is not because I favor

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.710
derivations in class.
I've been teaching long enough to

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.140
know that doing derivations in class
is equivalent to pouring ice water

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.570
on the proceedings,
so I do this sparingly.

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:36.806
It is a Newtonian system from the
mechanical standpoint.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:24.260
This is going to have one-half mv
squared where this is the mass of

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.530
the electron. And then the
potential energy,

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.790
the energy is stored here due to the
coulombic force of attraction

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.060
between the electron and the nucleus.
So, in the most general form,

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.330
Coulomb's law is the product of the
charge, q1q2 divided by their

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.590
separation, which is r.
And, in order to rationalize

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.860
electrostatic units with mechanical
units, we have to put

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.540
a factor in here.
Otherwise, the units that come out

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.630
of this calculation won't dovetail
with the units that come out of this

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.720
calculation. And that factor is 4
pi times epsilon zero.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.810
Epsilon zero is the permittivity of
vacuum. And now we can plug in q1

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.900
and q2. We know that we have
one-half mv squared.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:32.266
And then q1 is plus qe,
q2 is minus e.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:24.850
So then that will give us a net
minus Z times the square of the

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:29.710
elementary charge over 4 pi epsilon
zero r. And I am going to label

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.560
this as equation one.
And so this is really a mechanical

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.420
term, if you like,
and this is electrostatic or

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:44.280
coulombic. I am going to use
different words for that.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.140
And where do we find these things?
You can find values of all of these

00:06:49.140 --> 00:07:06.813
if you look at your
Table of Constants.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:58.460
This is the table of constants in
its entirety. If you look up really

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.920
close, there is the elementary
charge e. There is the mass of the

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.380
electron. All of these are given
here. This is 9.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.840
1 times 10 to the minus 31 kilograms.
It is 1.6 times 10 to minus 19

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.300
coulombs. There is the permittivity
vacuum. It is all up there.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.760
So you have these at your disposal.
Now let's do the next step which is

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.380
a force balance.
That comes out of postulate three.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:30.150
Out of postulate three it says
Newtonian mechanics applicable.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:34.920
Let's put a force balance. I am
going to say if that electron is to

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.690
stay in its orbit,
that is to say it doesn't flee the

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:44.460
atom, it doesn't collapse under the
nucleus then the sum of the forces

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:49.230
on the electron must be zero.
No net force. And so that will be

00:07:49.230 --> 00:08:07.660
the sum of a dynamic force
plus an electrostatic.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:57.710
Or just to be pluralistic in our
language, coulombic force.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:01.420
And so, you know from your
Newtonian mechanics,

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:05.140
as you were learning in 8.
1, the dynamic force here is mv

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.850
squared over r.
Again, m is the mass of the

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:12.570
electron. And now the force,
in its most general term is q1q2

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:16.280
over 4 pi epsilon zero,
which is the conversion factor r

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:35.293
squared. Force goes as
one over r squared.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:23.840
Energy goes as one over r.
And, if you ever get confused,

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.690
the way to remember these is that
you know energy is the integral of a

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:31.530
force moving through a distance.
Energy is the integral of force

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:35.380
moving through a distance.
So the integral of one over r

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:39.230
squared gives you one over r.
If you get them backwards, you will

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:43.070
integrate one over r and will get
log r. That makes no sense.

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:47.420
So there we are.
And we plug in our values and end up

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:52.280
with mv squared over r minus Ze
squared over 4 pi epsilon zero r

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:57.140
squared. And I am going to call
this equation two.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:01.990
That is our force balance.
And then, for the next piece of

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:06.850
information, I am going to go to
postulate number five.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:11.710
And postulate number five is some
of Bohr's early genius.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:16.570
Bohr says that the energy is
quantized through its

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:21.330
angular momentum.
He is talking about the energy of an

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:25.990
electron. No one,
until this time, had suggested that

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:30.660
a system would be subjected to
quantization except for light.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:35.330
Planck had already enunciated back
in 1900 this e equals h nu.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:39.990
In other words, that the photon has
a quantum of energy h nu.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:44.660
So quantization of radiation was
already established

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:49.350
as of about 1900.
But no one dared say we have this

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:54.050
little planetary model,
I've got an electron orbiting a

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:58.760
central nucleus and I am going to
endow that electron with quantized

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:03.460
states. That was a big leap and
that was Bohr in postulate five.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:08.170
Postulate five I am just going to
reproduce. That is mvr,

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:12.880
which is its angular momentum,
does not take continuous values.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:17.580
It takes discrete values, multiples
of some integer n,

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:22.290
and the multiplication factor is the
ratio of the Planck constant divided

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:40.713
by 2 pi where n takes one,
two, three and so on.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And I am going to call this one
equation three.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
So I have three equations and three
unknowns. And I am not going to

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
take the time to solve it because I
think that is a waste of class time,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
but those are the three unknowns.
The radius of the orbit,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
the energy of the system and the
velocity of the electron,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
I am just going to present you the
solutions. Let's look first of all

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:55.250
at the radius of the orbit.
If you solve for r,

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:59.750
you will end up with this.
This is the permittivity of vacuum.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:04.250
Square of the Planck constant times
pi mass of the electron.

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:08.750
I am going to stop putting
subscript e. It is the mass of the

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:13.250
electron. Times the square of the
elementary charge times n squared

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:17.750
over Z. Z is the proton number,
number of protons in the nucleus.

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:22.300
What do I see?
I see that r takes on discrete

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:26.920
values. R is a function of n and
takes on discrete values.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:31.530
And, in fact, the functionality is
that of the square of this number

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:36.150
times a constant.
So this tells us that the radius of

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:40.760
the electron orbit,
first of all, there is more than one

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:45.380
radius. There is a plurality of
values. Secondly,

00:11:45.380 --> 00:12:04.093
that those values are discrete.
They are quantized.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And, third, it is nonlinear.
If I look at something that goes as

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
n squared, if this is the edge of
the nucleus here and if this is r1,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
it says when n goes to two the
radius goes to four.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Let's say this is r1,
this is r2 and then this will be r3

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and this will be r4.
And even that is not to scale.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
The higher the n number the greater
the radius by far.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:26.180
And this applies to all one electron
atoms. Let's look at the simplest

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:32.360
case. Suppose we look at elemental
hydrogen. In the case of elemental

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:38.540
hydrogen, Z will equal one.
And then let's look at the lowest

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:44.720
orbit, n equals one.
That is the electron in its lowest

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:50.900
orbit to the nucleus of atomic
hydrogen. And this lowest orbit is

00:12:50.900 --> 00:13:09.233
termed the ground state.
First floor. If we put one here and

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:41.500
one here, the value is simply given
by this constant.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:46.500
And if you evaluate the constant
you get that r1 is equal to 5.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:51.500
9 times 10 to the minus 11 meters or
0.529 angstroms.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:56.500
I like the angstrom.
It is 10 to the minus 10 meters.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:01.500
It is not an SI unit because it is
not a multiple of 10 to the 3rd,

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:26.270
but I like the angstrom.
I don't like the nanometer.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:30.810
I like the angstrom because atomic
dimensions are conveniently measured

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:35.360
by angstroms. And this is given a
special symbol A nought.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:39.900
It is the value of the radius of
the ground state electron orbit in

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:44.450
atomic hydrogen.
And this quantity is termed the

00:13:44.450 --> 00:14:03.233
Bohr radius. And you don't even
have to look it up.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:53.470
Because it, too,
is given on your Table of Constants.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:57.940
There is the Planck Constant,
number five. There is the Bohr

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:02.410
radius down there,
number 24. So you just look that up.

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:06.880
And anything else is going to be
some multiple of it.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.350
The other thing I would like to
draw your attention to is this.

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:15.820
I can simplify this in the
following manner and say that r n,

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:20.290
now that I have a Bohr radius for
this bracketed quantity,

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:24.760
I can write that as the product of
the Bohr radius for the value of the

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:29.440
orbit in any one electron atom.
Specify the quantum number n and

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:34.330
divide by Z. That is this rewritten
in a much more compact notation

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:39.220
because you have the value of this.
And note that as Z increases, as

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:44.110
the proton number increases the
radius decreases for a given n

00:14:44.110 --> 00:15:03.620
number. If you look at the ground
state in two different systems --

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:52.710
If you look at the ground state
which is n equals one,

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:56.420
think about this, if I increase the
proton charge,

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.140
the Coulombic force of attraction is
greater. And so,

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.850
therefore, all other things being
equal, the first orbit should be at

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:07.570
a smaller distance.
So this is making physical sense.

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:11.280
Now let's look at energy. Let's
quantify the energy value.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:31.960
If you go through and solve for
energy, you will get this equation.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:20.380
E is equal to minus mass of the
electron times the elementary charge

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:25.760
raised to the fourth power divided
by e times the square of the

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:31.150
permittivity of vacuum times the
square of the Planck constant times

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:36.530
Z squared over n squared.
Again, we see that e is a function

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:41.920
of n. You see,
the quantum condition,

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:47.300
by putting quantization into the
angular momentum it is propagated

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:52.410
through the entire system.
Orbit dimensions are quantized.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:57.240
Energy is quantized. Velocity is
quantized. Everything is quantized.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:02.080
Energy is quantized. It has a
different n dependence.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.910
If I lump all of this together in
some constant,

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:11.740
I can then represent that formula as
minus K times Z squared over n

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:16.580
squared where n again chooses
integer values one, two,

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:21.250
three and so on.
And we can go through and calculate

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:25.750
the value of this quantity in
parenthesis. And,

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:30.250
when we do so, we get the value 2.
8 times 10 to the minus 18 joules.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:34.750
This is 10 to the minus 18 joules
for this one atom.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:39.250
I am going to draw attention to
this. It is joules per atom.

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:43.750
Or, if you multiply by Avogadro's
number then you will

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:48.280
get joules per mole.
And if you do so,

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:52.850
you will end up with 1.
12 mega joules per mole for this

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:57.420
quantity K. And you can find that
one, too. That is on your chart.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:01.990
If you multiply entry 23, which is
13.6 electron volts,

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:06.560
I will show you what the electron
volt is in a few minutes.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:11.140
We will just put it up here
prematurely. But that is given in

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:15.710
your chart. And then the conversion
of joules to electron

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:20.210
volts is entry 42.
If you multiply those two together

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:24.640
you will end up with this quantity.
And so let's take a look at what

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:29.070
that does in terms of graphical
representation.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:33.490
I tried to give you a simple
graphical representation.

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:37.920
That was Cartesian space.
When I plot r as a distance out

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:42.350
from the nucleus that is sort of our
simple-minded planetary model.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:46.780
Now let's look at energy. I am
going to put energy in

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:50.930
the following manner.
It is a conservative system so all

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:54.790
the energies are negative.
That quantity in parenthesis,

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:58.660
I have a mass which is a positive
number. Something raised to the

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:02.530
fourth power has got to be positive.
Something raised to the second

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:06.390
power has got to be positive.
Everything inside the parenthesis

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:10.260
is positive, so minus a positive
number. All the energies are

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:14.130
negative because it is a bound
system. I start up here with n

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:33.860
equals one. And over here this is
the value of minus K.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:23.630
And then, if we go to n equals two,
what happens? We go to n equals two

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:29.270
for a fixed value of Z.
Let's make this Z equals one.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:34.900
We will do it for atomic hydrogen.
It is K over four. And then we go

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:40.540
to n equals three.
And this is not to scale.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:46.180
And so on. This is what the energy
level diagram looks like.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:51.070
This is for atomic hydrogen gas.
And I am going to put on here "not

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:55.210
to scale." There are some relative,
the notion that the energy gap

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:59.350
between n equals one and n equals
two is greater than that for n

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:03.490
equals two to n equals three.
That is correctly represented.

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:07.630
These are definitely not equally
spaced, but they should be even more

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:11.780
disproportionate than I have shown
it. And finally up here we have n

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:15.920
equals infinity.
When n equals infinity,

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.210
r equals infinity.
And so the energy is zero because

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:24.640
the electron is no longer bound.
It is free. The electron has been

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:29.070
liberated. This represents the free
electron. It is no longer tethered

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:33.490
to the nucleus so there is no energy
stored in the system.

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:37.920
And the closer it gets to the
nucleus the greater the amount of

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:42.350
energy, which means that you see
this in the following manner.

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:46.780
This is called the ground state,
n equals one. I already mentioned

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:51.140
that. It's like the ground floor.
I know some of you come from Europe

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:55.420
and other parts of the world where
the ground floor is rez-de-chaussée

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:59.710
or some silly thing like this and
you push a button on the elevator to

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:03.990
one and you go up to the first floor.
You are in American now,

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:08.280
and the International Chemical
Community calls the ground state n

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.570
equals one, not n equals zero.
Please observe the traditions of

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:16.850
the International Union of Pure and
Applied Chemistry, not

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:22.110
to mention Niels Bohr.
So this is ground state,

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:28.330
these are the excited states and
free electron at n equals infinity.

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:34.550
And, at this point, we say that the
atom has become ionized.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:40.770
That is to say an electron has been
ejected. And so now we have net

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:57.873
charge. And we can calculate the
ionization energy.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:51.750
The ionization energy must then be
nothing more than,

00:20:51.750 --> 00:21:11.133
that is the energy to go from the
ground state here to n equals

00:20:36.500 --> 00:21:01.250
infinity, so that would be the
energy at state infinity minus the

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:20.366
energy of the ground state.
Well, the energy at infinity is

00:20:46.000 --> 00:21:10.750
zero and the energy in the ground
state is minus K.

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:29.733
So minus minus K is plus K.
K, in fact, is the ionization

00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:20.250
energy. And, in fact,
if you go to the chart,

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:38.233
to your Periodic Table indeed there
it is.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
This is a slightly different version
from the one you have,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
but it is the same order.
If you look on the Periodic Table

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
this is atomic hydrogen.
And, sure enough, there is 13.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
98, which is this number here in
electron volts.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
That is the ground state energy of
atomic hydrogen.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
The other thing to note is look at
the dependence upon Z.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Suppose instead of hydrogen we
considered lithium 2plus.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:57.260
Lithium 2plus is a one electron atom.
Lithium has three electrons.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:01.530
If it loses two one remains. What
is this formula telling us?

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:05.790
It is telling us that the ground
state in lithium would be Z squared.

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:10.060
It would be nine times more intense.
It would be nine times less.

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:14.330
That is to say minus nine is less
than minus one.

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:18.590
And that makes sense,
too, because the positive three

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:22.860
pulling on minus one has a tighter
binding energy than positive one

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:39.486
pulling on minus one.
So this drops by the square,

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:18.500
whereas, you saw how the orbit goes.
Just picking up on this ionization

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:27.500
energy. The ionization energy we
can define, this is the minimum

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:36.500
energy to remove an electron from
the ground state of an

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:43.700
atom in the gas phase.
All the things we are talking about

00:22:43.700 --> 00:23:09.100
here are with reference to the gas
phase. Gas phase single atom.

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:28.100
So we don't have to deal with work
function or any kind of energies

00:22:54.500 --> 00:23:19.900
associated with some condensed form
of matter. So we are really looking

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:25.290
at this reaction here for ionization.
It is H gas neutral goes to H plus

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:29.900
in the gas phase plus the electron.
And, furthermore,

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:33.720
we can have multiple ionization
energies. If you have multiple

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:37.540
electrons we can lose them in
sequence. For example,

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:41.360
I could look at the ionization of
lithium. Again,

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:45.180
lithium gas loses an electron to
become lithium ion plus electron.

00:23:45.180 --> 00:24:05.426
I can then subsequently lose an
electron from the lithium ion.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:53.420
Lithium ion loses an electron to
become lithium 2plus.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:57.850
And then a lithium 2plus still has
an electron. Let's denude lithium

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:02.280
2plus. So lithium 2plus loses its
electron. This is the analogy to

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:06.710
the alpha particle.
The alpha particle was the helium

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:11.140
nucleus. This is the lithium
nucleus plus electron.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:15.560
We call these first, second,
third ionization energies in

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:34.120
sequence. This is the first
ionization energy.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:24.830
This is the second ionization energy.
That is to say the ionization

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:29.660
energy of the second most electron.
And this is the third ionization

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:34.490
energy. Now, where do we find these
values? Well,

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:39.330
if we look on the chart,
the first ionization energy is what

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:44.160
is reported in your Periodic Table.
The first ionization energy of

00:24:44.160 --> 00:25:02.253
lithium is about 5.4 electron
volts per atom.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:54.160
We can get this from the Periodic
Table, so reported is Periodic Table.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:59.330
And this is determined by
measurement. This one here,

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:04.490
I cannot do anything for you.
You will have to look that one up.

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:09.660
What about this one? This one is
calculable by the Bohr model because

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:14.830
lithium 2plus is a one electron
system. I just go through these

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:32.993
equations, but be careful to put in
Z equals three.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:26.440
And I can calculate this from Bohr
model. Let's say calculable by Bohr

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:32.880
model. And then remember Z equals
three. I am showing some

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:39.330
versatility here.
And, let's see, we've talked about

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:45.770
radius, we've talked about energy.
Let's talk about velocity just for

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:58.540
completeness.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:59.090
So the velocity is given by this
product of the quantum number n

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:04.180
Planck constant 2 pi mass of the
electron times the radius of the

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:09.270
orbit, which itself is a function of
n. We can make some substitutions

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:14.360
here using some of the derivation on
the previous board which will give

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:19.450
us the Planck constant divided by 2
pi mass of the electron

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:24.070
times the Bohr radius.
All of this times the ratio of Z

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:28.210
over n where n equals one,
two, three and so on

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:32.350
**v=hZ/(2*pi*m*a0*n)**.
And we rarely look at velocity

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:36.490
because, as you will learn very
quickly in 3.091,

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:40.630
we are going to abandon this strict
adherence to a planetary model

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:44.780
pretty soon. But it is interesting.
Let's just, for an order of

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:48.920
magnitude say what happens for
ground state electron

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:53.900
in atomic hydrogen?
So we are going to put atomic

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:59.720
hydrogen Z equals one,
ground state n equals one.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:05.540
That is just this quantity here.
So let's find out. V1 in atomic

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:11.360
hydrogen, is it fast?
Is it slow? What is the number?

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:17.180
Plug in the values. You get 2.18
times 10 to the plus 6 meters per

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:35.360
second, which is about 1% of the
value of the speed of light.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:27.140
By the way, c,
the value of speed of light,

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:31.280
in case you cannot remember it,
is the number one entry in your

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:35.420
Table of Constants.
So 1% the speed of light.

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:39.560
I would say that is relatively fast.
That is a pun.

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.710
I think about this as relatively
fast. You people have no sense of

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:47.850
humor, no sense of joy,
no sense of joie de vivre.

00:27:47.850 --> 00:28:07.900
You are so young. You've only been
here a week and are so jaded.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:56.300
You've got four years to go.
So where does c come from? How

00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:00.610
come the speed of light has the
symbol c? Where is the symbol c?

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:04.920
It comes from the Latin word
celeritas which means swiftness.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:09.230
We get the English word accelerate
from the same root word.

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:13.530
That is why we have one.
That's why we have c. We are in

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:17.840
pretty good shape here.
We have a Bohr model, which is

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:22.130
quantitative.
It makes predictions that can be

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:26.390
tested. We have energies.
We have radii. Is there any

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:30.660
experimental evidence that can put
this to the test?

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:34.930
And the answer is yes.
In the early 1850s, Angstrom,

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:39.190
up at the University of Uppsala in
Sweden was conducting experiments on

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:43.460
atomic hydrogen.
He was doing experiments in a gas

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:47.730
discharge tube.
He had a tube with electrodes

00:28:47.730 --> 00:29:06.126
potted in it filled with
atomic hydrogen.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
And by applying a voltage,
he was able to get the gas to glow.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
And then he analyzed the components
of that radiation and this is what

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000
he found. First of all,
let's take a look at his experiment.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
There it is. He used the prism
spectrograph to analyze his results.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
So what do we have here? Here is
the gas discharge tube.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
This is the diagram taken right
from your text,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
there are the two electrodes coming
in and this is atomic hydrogen

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
in the gas tube.
And so if he gets the voltage high

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
enough, this gas discharge tube will
glow. And the light will be going

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
in all directions,
obviously. It is a glass tube.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
He wants to narrow the light so he
puts a couple of slits here.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
And then he just takes that narrow
column of light and he admits it to

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
a prism. And what the prism does is
takes a tiny, tiny difference in

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
wavelength and refracts it through a
different angle.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:51.550
And if the prism is of sufficient
dimension that angle can be

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:55.100
magnified. And then further you put
some recording device,

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:58.660
which in those days was a
photographic plate,

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:02.220
far across a room. So you take a
tiny, tiny angle and you go far

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:05.770
enough across the room.
And now you get separation on the

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:09.330
order of centimeters.
And we record here. And this is

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:12.880
the blowup of what is on that
photographic plate.

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.440
And this was painstaking work.
What you have here is the

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:35.613
photographic plate demonstrating
a spread.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000
First of all, the glow is made up of
constituents. There are distinct

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.000
lines here. What appears to the
naked eye to be just glowing is

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:18.000
actually superposition of different
lines of distinct frequency.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:24.000
So, you see, this is quantized.
And so he published his results

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000
around 1853. And so
they lay. 1853.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:37.500
Let's get Angstrom up on the board
here since he did the work.

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:45.000
He was Uppsala, in Sweden. He
measured the line spectra of atomic

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:52.500
hydrogen. By the way,
your text has a glaring error.

00:30:52.500 --> 00:31:00.000
The label above this figure refers
to H2.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:24.610
Take the fattest marking pen you
have, scratch that out and replace

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:29.220
it with atomic hydrogen.
You do not get this line from

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:33.840
molecular hydrogen.
We have the line spectra lying out

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:38.460
there in the literature,
and people read the literature.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:43.070
They read. And one of the people
that was reading this literature was

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:47.690
a high school teacher who was
teaching mathematics in

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:52.530
Basil, Switzerland.
This man also had the initials J.

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:57.610
. as in J.J. Thompson. This is J.
. Balmer. And J.J. Balmer in 1885

00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:02.690
playing with the numbers associated
with the lines there,

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:07.760
you notice how the lines are colored?
Your book isn't colored.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:12.840
See, I colored them for you.
I care about you. I wanted to

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:17.920
illustrate that this is representing
different wavelengths in the visible.

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:37.440
And the doctor told me it is good
for me to express my creative urges.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:28.230
So I got out my pen and I did that.
Where was I? What Balmer did, all

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:33.460
he has is those four numbers.
He has the wavelengths of those

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:38.690
four numbers. And he is playing
with those numbers.

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:43.920
He is determined to make sense of
those four numbers in some kind of a

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:49.150
sequence, and this is what he came
up with finally.

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:54.380
He came up with the relationship
that nu bar, which is

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:59.590
called wave number --
He found the reciprocal.

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:04.790
What he did was coined this.
But he found that by taking the

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:09.990
reciprocal of the wavelengths,
you have four numbers, he took the

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:15.190
reciprocals of those wavelengths and
found that they fit a numerical

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:20.390
sequence. One over two squared
minus one over n squared where n

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:38.380
takes values three, four, five, six.
And there is a constant out here.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:15.000
And the constant, if we redo it in
modern SI units,

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:23.000
would take on the value of 1.
times 10 to the 7th reciprocal

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:31.000
meters. How does this support
the Bohr model?

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:55.300
Well, in order to answer that
question, I have to give you a

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:59.610
little more background information.
The first thing I have to do is

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:03.920
give you the understanding of the
physics of the gas discharge tube.

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:08.230
Let's take a look inside that tube.
Let me redraw it. I am going to

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:12.530
redraw it horizontally.
This is a glass tube. There are

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:16.840
some feedthroughs here to allow
electrodes to be potted.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:21.380
These are gas-tight feedthroughs.
And these electrodes are then

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:26.150
connected to a variable voltage
power supply. And it is possible to

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:30.920
change the voltage on the plates.
And the way I have this configured,

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:35.690
the left electrode is going to be
charged negatively and the right

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:40.450
electrode is going to be charged
positively. So the left electrode

00:34:40.450 --> 00:34:45.220
will be the cathode as I have
configured it,

00:34:45.220 --> 00:35:02.906
and the right electrode will be
anode.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:55.330
And what is inside the gas discharge
tube is gas at low pressure.

00:34:55.330 --> 00:35:00.660
As we increase the voltage, we get
to a critical value at which it is

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:05.990
possible to actually draw electrons
across the gap.

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:11.330
Electrons will actually boil off
the cathode and accelerate across.

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:16.660
You have a positive electrode here
and the electron is charged

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:34.920
negatively. It will be drawn to the
positive electrode.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:26.260
So it will accelerate from rest and
crash into the anode.

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:30.530
If we have nothing here,
we see nothing. If we have too much

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:34.790
gas in here, in other words,
if the gas is at too high a pressure,

00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:39.060
the collisions with the gas
molecules will consume the energy of

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:43.330
the electrons and,
again, we will see nothing.

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:47.590
If we get the pressure in there
just right, we will allow for gas

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:51.860
electron collisions and then we get
the glow that ultimately was sent

00:35:51.860 --> 00:36:10.553
through the slits.
That is the operation of the gas

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:41.500
discharge tube.
Now let's look at the physics.

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:46.500
What is the energy of the electron,
the energy of this electron

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:51.500
accelerating from rest and crashing
into the anode here?

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:56.500
Well, it is going to be mechanical.
One-half mv squared. And how about

00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:21.330
potential energy? It is not bound.
It is a free electron so there is no

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:25.990
potential energy to be accounted for.
So it is simply one-half mv squared.

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:30.660
But I can equate the amount of
mechanical energy in the electron to

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:35.330
the amount of electrical energy that
was imparted through the electrodes.

00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:39.990
And the electrical energy is the
product of the charge on the

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:44.660
electron times the voltage which is
the potential difference through

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:49.190
which the electron was accelerated.
And so this allows me to,

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:53.590
by increasing the voltage,
increase the energy on the electron.

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:57.990
You can see low voltage, low energy,
high voltage, high energy.

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:02.390
It is a linear function. And how
about order of magnitude?

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:06.790
Let's see. Let's do everything
unit. That is a good way.

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:11.190
What is the unit charge? The
smallest charge I could put here

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:15.590
would be 1.6 times 10 to the minus
19 coulombs. And what if I took a

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:35.180
unit charge and I multiplied it
times unit voltage, one volt?

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
Unit charge times unit voltage then
would give me what?

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
If I multiply these two,
what is the coulomb times a volt?

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Here is the value of using SI units.
SI units means everything goes in,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000
in SI, everything comes out in SI.
What is the energy unit in SI?

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000
The joule. What is the unit of
charge in SI? Coulomb.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000
What is the unit of potential
difference? Volt.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:53.760
With impunity.
If I use coulombs here and volts

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:57.520
here, I don't even think.
I write 1.0 times 1.6. Even that I

00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:01.290
can do in my head.
That is 1.6 times 10 to the minus

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:05.050
19 and I write joules.
That is the power of having a

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:08.820
rationalized system of units.
That is the good news. The bad

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:12.580
news is I hate this number.
Look it. 1.6 times 10 to the minus

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:16.350
18, excuse me,
we have 1.6 times 10 to the minus 19,

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:20.110
2.18 times 10 to the minus 18,
etc. Cannot we get simple numbers

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:24.330
like three and seven?
Whatever happened to good-old

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:28.990
numbers? I have an idea.
Why don't we define a new unit of

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:33.660
energy that is nearer to what we
have to measure?

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:38.330
And that was done.
What people did is they said let's

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:42.990
define a unit of energy that
represents a unit charge accelerated

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:47.660
across a unit potential difference,
and let's call that the electron

00:38:47.660 --> 00:39:07.220
volt. That is one electron volt.
The electron volt is not a unit of

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:37.500
potential difference.
It is a unit of energy.

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:42.500
Now, this is 1.0 eV. Now you can
see 2.18 times 10 to the minus 18

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:47.500
joules can be 13.
eV. Now, I don't have to fill my

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:52.500
head with 2.18 times 10 to the minus
18. 13.6, that's a cool number.

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:57.500
I can remember that. That is how
that works. By the way,

00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:22.350
this is the cathode.
And we have a beam.

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:27.070
It is an electron beam.
In the 1890s, the latter part of

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:31.780
the 19th century a very fashionable
word was "ray."

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:36.490
Because it came from optics,
you know, rays of sunlight and so on.

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:41.210
And, in fact,
even when we first started pulling

00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:45.920
synthetic fiber,
the first synthetic fiber cellulose

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:50.640
was referred to as rayon because it
looked like a ray that

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:55.150
was being pulled.
So rather than calling this an

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:59.460
electron beam,
this was called a cathode ray.

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:03.760
And this was a tube at low pressure.
And if I evacuate it,

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:08.070
I have a cathode ray tube.
And, in fact, instead of having

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:12.380
just an electrode here,
what I could do is I could have an

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:16.690
electrode that is hollow.
And then I could put a flat end

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:34.780
here and I could put
phosphorus here.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.500
And then I could put a couple of
plates and I could raster the beam

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:10.000
so that when I am looking here the
beam goes back and forth about 80

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.500
times a second.
And the phosphorus glow.

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:19.000
And I can be watching a science
documentary.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:52.720
All right. The other thing I have

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:58.180
to teach you is matter-energy
interaction so that we can see how

00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:03.630
the Balmer series validates the Bohr
model. So there is one more thing

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:09.080
you need to know.
And I am going to put up this

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:14.540
energy level diagram again.
This is infinity. Let's call this

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:33.613
3, 2, 1. This is E1 ground state,
E2, E3 and so on. And this is zero.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:26.660
Let's look at the energetics of one
of those electrons crashing into a

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:33.330
hydrogen atom inside the gas tube.
Here is an electron. And I am

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:39.990
going to let this arrow somehow
indicate the value of the incident

00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:46.660
energy. And I am saying electron,
but more generally it applies to any

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:52.300
incident particle.
Later on we could do this with a

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:56.920
proton. We could do it with a
neutron. Rutherford used alpha

00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:01.530
particles. We could use argon ion.
There are all kinds of different

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:06.150
ways of bombarding,
in this case, hydrogen gas.

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:10.760
Now, if this incident energy is
great enough it will take an

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:15.380
electron out of the ground state and
promote it. But the electron cannot

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:34.426
reside anywhere except in one of
these quantized states.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:25.090
Suppose the E incident is greater
than the energy in the transition

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:30.180
going from ground state to n equals
two. What will happen?

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:35.270
That energy will be absorbed by the
hydrogen atom,

00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:40.360
the electron will rise from n equals
one to n equals two.

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:45.450
And that amount of energy will be
subtracted. And then over here this

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:50.380
electron will continue.
And I have purposely made the arrow

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:55.150
shorter to indicate that it has been
slowed because we are going to argue

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:59.920
its mass didn't change,
so the only way to change its energy

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:04.690
is to change its velocity.
This will we call scattered now.

00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:09.450
It's interacted. This is the
scattered particle.

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:14.220
But it doesn't end there.
So how much energy is there?

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:33.440
Let this represent the total energy
of the incident electron.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:22.640
And if that is the energy to go from
n equals one to n equals two then

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:26.290
this is the amount of energy that
has to be left as kinetic energy of

00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:29.930
the electron. It is like an elastic
collision between billiard balls.

00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:33.580
You've seen these things. But it
doesn't end there because the

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:37.230
electron is sitting up here at n
equals two very nervous because

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:40.870
there is a lower energy state and
there is a coulombic attraction to

00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:44.520
the nucleus. So what happens almost
instantaneously after the collision,

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:48.170
the electron up here falls back down.
And when it falls back down that

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:53.660
energy is given off.
And it is given off in the form of a

00:43:53.660 --> 00:44:00.990
photon. And what is the energy of
that photon? Well,

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:08.330
the energy of the photon,
we know from Planck, is h nu,

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:15.660
which is hc over lambda. Now I have
lambdas associated with transitions

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:30.986
between energy levels
in atomic hydrogen.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:29.440
Gee, I wonder if I could come up
with a set of transitions occurring

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:35.880
inside atomic hydrogen that just
might match what Angstrom measured

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:42.330
back in 1853. That is going to be
the challenge.

00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:48.770
The interesting thing here is that
I can change the incident

00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:54.230
velocity continuously.
This is continuously variable

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:58.690
because I can vary voltage
continuously. Change the voltage,

00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:03.150
I change the incident energy. What
about the energy of the emitted

00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:07.610
photons? Are they continuously
variable? No,

00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:12.070
they are discrete.
They are discrete.

00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:16.530
And, furthermore, they are
characteristic of the target gas

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:36.326
element. Let's say I got up late
and I am racing to get to class.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.000
I just burst in now,
I look up there and go that's atomic

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000
hydrogen. Because only atomic
hydrogen has that set of lines which

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:16.000
means I could then take the spectra
of gas phase species and use that

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.000
information to identify.
This is now a technique of analysis.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.000
I could take an unknown gas and put
it in and measure it and then say,

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:31.000
wow, those are the lines that are
characteristic of sodium.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:55.900
Gee, have you ever wondered how they
know the composition of stars that

00:45:55.900 --> 00:46:00.810
are light-years away?
Do they get sample bottles coming

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:05.720
in? How do they get that
information? What is a star,

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:10.630
if not just a giant gas bottle,
containerless? It is glowing. And

00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:15.540
why is it glowing?
It is glowing because electrons are

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:33.813
excited.
And they are excited and they are

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000
jumping up and down and they are
emitting. But they are just not

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
emitting anything.
I mean, why are some stars this

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
color and some stars that color?
Did somebody paint them that way?

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000
They are different because they
have different compositions.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
So you could use this in order to
identify the contents of stars.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000
All of this. What did Bohr do?
I want to tell you a couple more

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Bohr stories. The guy was great.
Here is what happens. Here is a

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:51.920
story.
Capstone of Bohr's work on the

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:55.780
Balmer formula.
Let me simply tell you that in time

00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:59.640
I am going to show you that this
formula is inconsistent with the

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:03.490
Bohr model. You will see that at
the beginning of next lecture.

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:07.350
In 1896, Charles Pickering from
Harvard found a series of lines in

00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:11.210
starlight which he attributed to
hydrogen, even though they did not

00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:15.070
fit Balmer. They were off by a
factor of four.

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:19.350
Now, what do you know about energy?
Already from this class,

00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:24.070
if I told you that I gave you
energies in some spectrum but they

00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:28.780
were off by a factor of four,
what would you think? Maybe the Z

00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:33.490
is wrong. So,
even though the lines were wrong,

00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:38.210
he says, no, that is hydrogen. Bohr
says, no, that is not hydrogen.

00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:42.920
It is helium. That star has
ionized helium,

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:47.640
helium plus. Z equals two.
Energy will be four times more

00:47:47.640 --> 00:48:06.080
intense.
Pickering was a nasty SOB and said

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000
you are wrong.
Because, in fact,

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
it is 4.0016. And the 0.
016 is greater than what I would

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000
have as experimental error,
so your theory is wrong. Bohr says

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000
oh, yeah? He goes back and redoes
the calculation,

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000
only in this case he says what I am
going to do is I am going to redo

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000
the calculation for helium,
but I am going to consider not just

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000
the mass of the electron but the
reduced mass of the system.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000
So I will take into account that
there is some contribution of both

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000
the nucleus and the electron.
And he gets, you are absolutely

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:15.000
right, it is not 4.
, it is 4.00163. Take that.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.000
What you have is with a simple
calculation five significant figures.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:25.000
That shut him up.
Now, just to show it doesn't end,

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:30.000
more nonsense at Harvard. This is
Cecilia Payne.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:53.260
First woman graduate student in
astronomy. First PhD in astronomy.

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:56.520
First woman to receive tenure at
Harvard. She was awarded tenure in

00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:59.780
1938, denied a professorship for 18
years, and when she presented her Ph.

00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:03.040
thesis she was the one that
determined that the sun is made

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:06.310
dominantly of hydrogen,
not ion, the way most of the old

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:09.570
goats thought.
Because the earth is made of iron,

00:49:09.570 --> 00:49:12.830
heaven knows everything is made of
the same stuff,

00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:16.100
all heavenly bodies.
Even though the sun is glowing and

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:19.360
the earth isn't,
but they must be made of the same

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:37.120
thing.
And, after all,

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.000
we are Harvard so we know.
Here is what she did. She was

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.000
fastidious. Look at this.
What do you see there? Well,

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000
you see iron. But this is
misspelled. You would make an

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.000
excuse and say the detector isn't
working. This is a noisy system.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000
That is what everybody else is
doing. But what Cecilia is doing is

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000
saying I have got to keep looking.
I need a consistent picture. This

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:51.900
is what spectroscopy is.
Spectroscopy is how you go and look

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:57.720
at patterns, not just individual
lines. When she defended her thesis,

00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:03.540
she was forced to put this phrase in
her thesis. "The enormous abundance

00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:09.360
of hydrogen is almost certainly not
real." This is the way science

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:15.180
welcomes newcomers.
This is the way science on some

00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:32.760
occasions welcomes new findings.
Just up the street.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:26.270
And I am not talking about the 1600s.
This was in the ‘30s.

00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:31.540
This is a painting of her.
Dudley Herschbach, a Harvard

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:36.810
chemistry professor who has a Nobel
prize had this painting hung at one

00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:42.080
of the halls. And it is obviously
referential to Vermeer's "The

00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:47.360
Astronomer." We have come a long
way from the gas discharge

00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:52.250
tube to the heavens.
But it shows you that with a little

00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:56.750
bit of understanding of quantization
you can go a long way.

00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:58.550
OK, we will see you Friday.
