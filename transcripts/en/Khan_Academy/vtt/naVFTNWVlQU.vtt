00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.800
Use the cards below to create
a list of steps in order

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.980
that will solve the
following equation.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.020
3 times x plus 6
squared is equal to 75.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.340
And I encourage you to
pause this video now and try

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.609
to figure it out on your own.

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:15.650
Figure out which of these
steps and in what order

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.290
you would do to
solve for x here.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.452
So I'm assuming
you've given it a go.

00:00:21.452 --> 00:00:23.160
So let's try to work
through it together.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.050
And first, let me just
rewrite the equation.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.820
So we have 3 times the
quantity x plus 6 squared

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.080
is equal to 75.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.350
So what I want to do is I want
to isolate the x plus 6 squared

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.390
on the left-hand side.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.931
Or another way of
thinking about it--

00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:41.000
I don't want this
3 here anymore.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.670
So how would I
get rid of that 3?

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.060
Well, I could divide
the left-hand side by 3.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.877
But if I do that to only
one side of the equation,

00:00:48.877 --> 00:00:49.960
it won't be equal anymore.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.260
These two things in yellow
were equal to each other.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.274
If I want the equalities
to hold, anything

00:00:54.274 --> 00:00:55.690
that I do to the
left-hand side, I

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.740
have to do the right-hand side.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.140
So let me divide
that by 3 as well.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.130
And so on the
left-hand side, I am

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:09.840
left with x plus 6 squared
is equal to 75 divided by 3.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.067
So 75 divided by 3 is 25.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.100
So actually, let me just
pick out the first one I did.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.200
I divided both sides by 3.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.780
So that was my first step then.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.280
Let me write that
in a darker color.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.395
So that was my first
step right over there.

00:01:29.395 --> 00:01:31.020
Now let's think about
what we're doing.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.690
We're saying that something
squared is equal to 25.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.890
So this something could be
the positive or negative

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.530
square root of 25.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.900
So we could write
this as x plus 6

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.076
is equal to the plus or
minus square root of 25.

00:01:55.076 --> 00:01:57.200
So I'm essentially taking
the positive and negative

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.870
square root of both sides.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.690
So, let's see.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.820
This looks like this step.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.770
I took the square
root of both sides.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.690
That's step number two.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.120
And so, let me
just rewrite this.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.190
This is the same thing as x plus
6 is equal to plus or minus 5.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.010
And now I want to just have
an x on the left-hand side.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.502
I want to solve for x.

00:02:17.502 --> 00:02:18.960
That's the goal
from the beginning.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.862
So I would like to
get rid of this 6.

00:02:22.862 --> 00:02:24.320
Well, the easiest
way to do that is

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.200
to subtract 6 from
the left-hand side.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.750
But just like
before, I can't just

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.350
do it from one side
of an equation.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.150
Then the equality
wouldn't be true.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.820
We're literally
saying that x plus 6

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.870
is equal to plus or minus 5.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.710
So x plus 6 minus
6 is going to be

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.790
equal to plus or
minus 5 minus 6.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.900
Or actually, let me
write it this way.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.350
So let me subtract
6 from both sides.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.410
On the left-hand side,
I'm left with an x.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.170
And on the right-hand side,
I could write it this way.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.810
Let me do it in
that green color.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:02.340
I have negative 6
plus or minus 5.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.160
So what are the
possible values of x?

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.780
Or actually, I keep forgetting.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.247
We don't have to actually
give the value for x.

00:03:08.247 --> 00:03:09.830
We just have to say
what steps we did.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:10.621
So then, let's see.

00:03:10.621 --> 00:03:12.640
After we took the square
root of both sides,

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.210
we then subtracted
6 from both sides.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.090
So that was step three
right over there.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.670
Then that got us to essentially
the two possible x's

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.500
that would satisfy this
equation right over here.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.460
And just for fun, let's
actually solve it all the way.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.200
So if we solve it all the way,
so x is equal to negative 6

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.690
plus 5 is negative 1, or x is
equal to negative 6 minus 5

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.650
is negative 11.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.595
And you could verify
that both of these work.

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:42.970
If you put either of them in
here-- if you put negative 1

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.210
here, you get negative 1
plus 6 squared is 5 squared.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.850
If you put negative 11 here,
it's negative 11 plus 6

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:49.960
is negative 5 squared.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.530
Obviously either plus or minus
5 squared is going to be 25.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.492
25 times 3 is 75.

00:03:56.492 --> 00:03:57.700
So these are our three steps.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.160
We divided both sides by 3.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.970
Then we took the square
root of both sides.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.990
Then we subtracted
6 from both sides.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.760
And then we were
essentially done.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.430
So let's input those steps.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.650
So the first thing we did,
we divide both sides by 3.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.610
That's the first thing we did.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.470
And then we took the
square root of both sides.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.820
And then we subtracted
6 from both sides.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.276
We got it right.
