00:00:02.222 --> 00:00:03.930
MALE SPEAKER: Good
afternoon to everybody

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:04.846
here in Mountain View.

00:00:04.846 --> 00:00:05.790
Thanks for coming out.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.970
And to our Googlers tuning in
at offices around the world,

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:09.470
hello.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.180
Good day to you as well.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.170
We have a really exciting
hour ahead of us.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.630
We're here with Ashlee
Vance, as you guys know.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.492
So Ashlee's a
featured journalist

00:00:18.492 --> 00:00:19.700
for Bloomberg "Businessweek."

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.158
He's written a
bunch-- I think over

00:00:21.158 --> 00:00:24.130
a dozen now-- feature and
cover stories for Bloomberg.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.197
And we're here today to
talk about his new book.

00:00:26.197 --> 00:00:27.280
I think it was out in May?

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:27.810
ASHLEE VANCE: Yep.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.518
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:00:28.518 --> 00:00:29.950
It's "Elon Musk."

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.680
And so you call yourself-- you
can call yourself an Elon Musk

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.140
biographer now.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.500
Very exciting stuff.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.990
And is the book-- I think I
read it's a "New York Times"

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.700
bestseller now?

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.170
ASHLEE VANCE: It's been
on the bestseller list

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.796
just about since it
came out, 12 weeks.

00:00:41.796 --> 00:00:42.795
MALE SPEAKER: Very cool.

00:00:42.795 --> 00:00:43.550
Congratulations.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.520
And its rightfully so.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.660
It's a fascinating read.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.110
If you haven't
checked it out yet,

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.500
I highly encourage you to do so.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.510
So we've got about 30 or 40
minutes of facilitated Q&amp;A

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.654
we're going to do.

00:00:53.654 --> 00:00:55.070
And then we have
a mic in the back

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.760
to pass around for audience
question-and-answer as well.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.850
So to begin, so Ashlee,
before Bloomberg, you

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.760
were with "New York Times," "The
Economist," a few other places.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.580
How'd you get into
tech journalism?

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.220
And specifically,
how did you decide

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.990
to write a book about Elon?

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.615
ASHLEE VANCE: Well, I guess it's
sorts of two different things.

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:16.000
I mean, I kind of stumbled
into tech journalism.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.140
I was a philosophy
major at college.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.700
So I had to find a
way to feed myself.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.249
And I had always
wanted to be a writer,

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:25.290
but I'd never really
thought of being a reporter.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.702
And I had graduated
during the dot-com boom.

00:01:28.702 --> 00:01:30.150
And there were tons of jobs.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.650
I wanted to live
in San Francisco.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.610
And there were tons
of reporter jobs

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.840
open for anyone who wanted to be
paid very little and work hard.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.890
So I did that.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.220
And I ended up liking it.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.800
I got thrown into covering
semiconductors and networking

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.300
equipment.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.610
I was working for a trade
publication, basically,

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.767
and knew nothing about
any of the stuff.

00:01:49.767 --> 00:01:54.920
So I downloaded Unix, started
learning about RISC chips,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.220
and then off I went.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.880
The Elon thing, I
mean, I guess it

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.560
does sort of come out
from that a little bit.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.480
I was never the person that
covered consumer tech stuff

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.734
and was never like
really into the-- I mean,

00:02:11.734 --> 00:02:13.150
I was into the
web, but not-- it's

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.316
just never the area that I
really wrote about a lot.

00:02:15.316 --> 00:02:18.790
I always wrote about companies
that actually made things

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.900
and that had factories.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.050
And I don't know why.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.760
That's just kind of when
I gravitated towards.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.879
And so I was not like that
into Elon until about 2012

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.170
and I did a cover story on him.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.780
And when I saw Tesla's
factories and SpaceX factories--

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.412
especially SpaceX-- I decided
that's what I had to do.

00:02:36.412 --> 00:02:37.120
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.690
Fair enough.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.420
So was Elon on board
from the beginning?

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.370
How did that go?

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.270
ASHLEE VANCE: So in 2012, I did
a "Businessweek" cover story

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.140
on Elon.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.140
And we got along pretty well.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.776
I got to spend a bunch
of time with him,

00:02:52.776 --> 00:02:54.150
going through the
SpaceX factory.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.592
We went to movie premieres
and all this stuff.

00:02:56.592 --> 00:03:00.840
And the companies
were very interesting.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.640
And Elon was much
more interesting

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.930
than I'd given him credit
for before the story.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.270
I'd sort of pegged him as just
like a one-note techno-utopian

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.900
kind of guy.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.640
And he turned out to be
this great interview.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.370
He didn't have PR
handlers around him.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.920
So you had access to him.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.300
And he would answer just
about anything you asked him.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.732
And so I decided
then, this is a guy

00:03:25.732 --> 00:03:26.940
I really want to write about.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.810
And I'd been looking
for a book to do.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.880
And so after I did the story,
a couple months went by.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.680
And then I started to feel
Elon out about doing a book.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.950
And I think I either
sent him an email

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.650
or called him on the phone.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.250
And I said, this is
what I want to do.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.749
And he said, look,
a bunch of people

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:47.987
have asked me in the past,
and I'm not going to do it.

00:03:47.987 --> 00:03:49.570
I'm not going to
help you do the book.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.310
And then I went to New York,
and I sold the book anyway.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.390
And I thought I would sort of
force his hand a little bit.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.664
And then I arranged
another meeting with him.

00:03:59.664 --> 00:04:00.580
And I'll never forget.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.670
It was on a Saturday at Tesla.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.309
And I came in.

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:04.850
I was like, look,
I've sold the book.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.690
And he said, I'm still not
going to cooperate with you.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.160
And so I spent 18
months interviewing

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.010
hundreds of people.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.670
I found all these SpaceX and
Tesla employees, most of whom

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:18.170
had left.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.779
All the Zip2, Paypal people
that he'd worked with,

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.470
his ex-girlfriends,
his childhood friends,

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.620
and all that stuff.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.020
And then a lot of those
people would call back to Elon

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.920
and say, should I
speak to him or not?

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.590
And he was a pretty
good sport about it.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.550
There's nobody that
he told not to.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.630
And so I think that
happened enough times

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.120
that after about 18 months
of doing it, I was at home.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.045
It was like 6:30 at
night on a weekday,

00:04:44.045 --> 00:04:48.110
and up on my caller
ID, it was Elon Musk.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.960
And I picked up the phone.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.199
And he said, look, I
can basically-- this

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:54.490
is going to go one of two ways.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.490
I can shut down all
these people that call me

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.020
and ask whether I should
let them talk to you,

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.250
or I could cooperate
with the book.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.240
I was like, obviously, you
should choose option b.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.305
And then we set up a
meeting to talk about it.

00:05:12.305 --> 00:05:15.420
He wanted to be able
to-- he wanted to have

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.540
some control over it initially.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.160
He wanted to be able to read
the book before it came out.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.160
And then he wanted to put
footnotes in the book.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.930
And if you know
anything about Elon,

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.520
that would mean the footnotes
would be longer than the book

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.190
and that the book would
probably never be published.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.860
And so I kind of pushed
back on him on that.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.430
I had this huge speech prepared.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.730
And I got five minutes into
it, and he just said, OK.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.690
Yeah, to his credit,
after that, he gave me

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.220
access to everybody I wanted.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.137
And then he agreed to have a
meeting with me once a month,

00:05:49.137 --> 00:05:50.470
he said, for as long as it took.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.020
It ended up being
about eight months.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.950
And we would have three-,
four-, five-hour dinners.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:55.700
MALE SPEAKER: Wow.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.908
So the book, I have to say,
especially the beginning,

00:05:57.908 --> 00:05:59.350
it reads like a
suspense thriller,

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.670
even though it's nonfiction
because-- I don't

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.936
want to give too much
away, but it opens with you

00:06:03.936 --> 00:06:06.060
kind of showing up a little
early for this meeting,

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.140
sitting down with a drink,
waiting for Elon to show up,

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.410
knowing full well that this is
kind of a make-or-break moment.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.150
And it goes well, like you said.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.740
I can't believe you didn't agree
to his two demands, by the way.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.680
They seemed reasonable, but--

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.096
ASHLEE VANCE: There
was part of me

00:06:22.096 --> 00:06:24.340
that-- so Elon's got this
very unique writing style.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.923
I mean, part of me,
I thought it would

00:06:25.923 --> 00:06:31.736
be like a novelty to actually
see his thinking of some

00:06:31.736 --> 00:06:34.130
of this stuff.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.680
And there was like a moment in
time where if he had really,

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.090
really pushed on that, maybe.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.964
But honestly, I could
see stuff in the book

00:06:42.964 --> 00:06:45.380
where it's like, oh, he had a
turkey sandwich on this day.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.955
And then it would be five
pages about why he could not

00:06:47.955 --> 00:06:49.080
have had a turkey sandwich.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.700
And it had to be a ham
sandwich because he--

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.087
And it was just
going to be a mess.

00:06:54.087 --> 00:06:55.170
MALE SPEAKER: Fair enough.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:56.660
So how does this
conversation end?

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:57.576
You get what you want.

00:06:57.576 --> 00:06:58.650
How does it end?

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.080
ASHLEE VANCE:
Well, it was weird.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.230
I mean, the dinner went on.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.310
I feel like that first one
was like two or three hours.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.720
And it was all over the place.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.370
We walked about Larry
Page a bit and AI.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.300
And then we had
these other things.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.890
It was very Elon.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.980
He's kind of like, I'm
looking for a PR person.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:18.440
And they'd say, who's the
best PR person in the world?

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.250
And the conversation went
all these different ways.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:26.240
And then, I'd thought he agreed
to participate in the book.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.400
And then right at the end,
he's kind of getting up.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.210
And he stood up from
the table first.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.219
And then he came back and he
put both his hands on the table.

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:35.510
And he looked at me in the eye.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:39.590
And then he said, do
you think I'm insane?

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.740
I'd already been through
this whole huge test.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.360
My brain is going, is this
the last sort of riddle?

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.610
What does that mean?

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.240
How am I supposed to
answer this question?

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.730
Is this the final test to
see if he'll cooperate?

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:54.460
And I remember all this stuff
was going through my brain

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.540
so fast while he's still
looking at you in the eyes.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.580
And I think I just
mumbled out something

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:05.570
about-- it was like, no, I mean,
I don't think you're crazy.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:08.230
I think some of the stuff you
do could be perceived that way.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.864
But no, I mean, I'm like
at least into the companies

00:08:11.864 --> 00:08:13.030
or I wouldn't be doing this.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:16.825
But ultimately I
came to just think--

00:08:16.825 --> 00:08:18.960
I don't think anything I
said would have mattered.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.790
I think he was having
this one last gut

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:26.517
check of whether I could
be at least quasi trusted.

00:08:26.517 --> 00:08:27.600
MALE SPEAKER: Trusted, OK.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.439
So if you said yes,
I think you're crazy,

00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:30.730
you think he still would have--

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:31.350
ASHLEE VANCE:
Yeah, I don't know.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:32.850
I think it was a
looking into my eye

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:35.480
to sort of see what happened.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.030
Or maybe, I also thought
he'd already made up his mind

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:42.096
and he was just asking
himself a little bit.

00:08:42.096 --> 00:08:42.929
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:43.909
I understand.

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:45.240
So what was the process like?

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.710
You mentioned about eight
months, once a month,

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:47.540
you get together.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.490
What is it like to spend
a few hours a month

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:52.200
interviewing Elon Musk?

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.740
ASHLEE VANCE: It was really fun.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.065
At the beginning, it was
nerve-wracking because I never

00:08:57.065 --> 00:08:58.440
knew how many of
these interviews

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.790
I would actually get.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.720
Even though he had
agreed to it, I always

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.685
figured that he
might do one and they

00:09:05.685 --> 00:09:07.330
he'd be like, OK, that's enough.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.890
And then I thought he might
get sick of it after a while

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:11.740
and just cut me off.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:16.130
So each one felt like
an accomplishment.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.440
But then it was frustrating
because the first four,

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.200
I really didn't-- I was
getting lots of useful stuff,

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.040
but nothing that was-- I could
tell he was still holding back

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:25.540
a bit.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.074
And he was repeating
a lot of stories,

00:09:28.074 --> 00:09:31.830
if you watch Elon's
speeches and other talks,

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.460
that you would
have heard before.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.510
And so that was frustrating.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.630
And then I'm still not
sure exactly what happened,

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.956
but around the
fourth meeting-- we

00:09:40.956 --> 00:09:42.330
used to always do
the same thing.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:43.730
We would get there.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:44.620
He eats really late.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.830
So it'd be like 8:30,
9 o'clock at night.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:50.725
And we would go a few times
'til just everybody had left.

00:09:50.725 --> 00:09:52.350
And it was kind of
one of those things.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.110
There was like
hardly anybody there.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.755
And he just-- it was like a
flip-- the switch flipped.

00:09:57.755 --> 00:10:03.360
I think he had really
committed to doing it.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.110
And he became much more
relaxed and easygoing.

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:09.290
But on the whole, it's
like what I looked forward

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:09.970
to every month.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:10.720
It was really fun.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:15.680
I mean, if you consider the
idea that he might actually

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.710
be the first guy on
Mars, it was weird to be

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:20.040
having dinner with this
guy over and over again,

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.004
and getting to ask him
whatever you wanted.

00:10:22.004 --> 00:10:23.295
MALE SPEAKER: Very interesting.

00:10:23.295 --> 00:10:25.970
So we'll talk a little bit
about his childhood upbringing

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:26.470
in a moment.

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.386
But something that
stuck out for me

00:10:28.386 --> 00:10:29.760
when I was reading
the beginning,

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.570
you mentioned something
from his youth.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.260
I think he's in
Canada at this point.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.740
He's not even in college yet.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:37.970
I'm not sure if he is.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.520
And he's having
a birthday party.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.110
And it's the first time where
romance appears in the book.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.700
And he's sitting on this
couch with a young woman.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:49.090
And one of the first
things he says to her is,

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:51.230
if I didn't have
to eat, I wouldn't.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:54.850
If I could just
get rid of eating

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.370
and just work all the
time, I would just do that.

00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:58.970
And I'm thinking,
this is the '90s.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:01.480
This is way before
Soylent or anything.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:05.700
So what is it like to eat
with Elon Musk at 8:30?

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.700
ASHLEE VANCE: Dinner with
Elon is an experience.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.750
It's--

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:09.020
MALE SPEAKER: Really?

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:09.811
ASHLEE VANCE: Yeah.

00:11:09.811 --> 00:11:13.212
I've never been-- the
actual act of eating.

00:11:13.212 --> 00:11:14.170
MALE SPEAKER: I get it.

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:14.830
OK, how so?

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.840
ASHLEE VANCE: I've
never seen anyone

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.260
who eats as fast as Elon does.

00:11:23.011 --> 00:11:25.360
In that first meeting,
I didn't know how long

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.430
I would have him there.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:29.445
And so I have my
tape recorder on.

00:11:29.445 --> 00:11:31.800
And I have my computer
on the side as well.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.470
I always take notes even
though I'm recording.

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:37.410
It helps me to remember
stuff and things.

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:40.330
And we're going along.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:41.900
We ordered appetizer.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.260
First of all, Elon
has to-- it takes

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.670
him a while to figure
out what he wants to eat.

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:52.740
I think he's used to having
a lot of this stuff taken

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:53.790
care of for him.

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.740
His assistant, when I
would be at the office,

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.300
she would just bring him food.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.810
And he would just scarf it down.

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:01.950
And didn't even seem like
he was paying attention

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:03.230
to what he was eating at all.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.580
And when we'd go to
these restaurants,

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.090
it was like, what
do you want to eat?

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:08.920
I don't know.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.350
And we would never get anywhere.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:11.850
So I would make all
these decisions.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.454
And we ordered a
ton of appetizers.

00:12:14.454 --> 00:12:16.870
Instead of just getting one
or two, then he would be like,

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.520
let's just order
like six things.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.400
And then I'm asking questions.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.400
And he's talking.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.645
So he's doing most of
talking, and he's still--

00:12:25.645 --> 00:12:27.270
they're just like
all disappearing, one

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:27.980
after the other.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.750
And I'm like, this is
going way too'fast.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.890
I have to have this dinner
last as long as possible.

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:37.340
And they're all just-- I
would look down at my computer

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:41.010
for a second and entire
things would just

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:42.100
vanish with the plate.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.996
And then the main courses came.

00:12:43.996 --> 00:12:45.620
And the same thing
was happening again.

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.390
And I knew I was
really on the clock.

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:51.800
And so he had gotten
some sort of seafood.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.890
I think it was octopus
or squid in black ink.

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.500
And then I-- Oh, no,
it was lobster, fried,

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:58.760
with black squid ink.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.390
And then I got a steak.

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:02.362
And he'd already
finished his dinner.

00:13:02.362 --> 00:13:03.570
And I was only two questions.

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:07.494
And so I cut off half my
steak and put it on his plate.

00:13:07.494 --> 00:13:08.910
And I thought,
this will hold him.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:09.970
It was like two bites.

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:11.567
And that was gone.

00:13:11.567 --> 00:13:13.400
And then this repeated
itself over and over.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.679
I mean, I think for him
food really is just fuel.

00:13:17.679 --> 00:13:18.720
MALE SPEAKER: I see that.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.640
OK.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.530
I promise we're going
to leave this dinner

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:22.366
after this question.

00:13:22.366 --> 00:13:23.490
But one more thing came up.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.850
You mentioned, I think,
when we were talking before,

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:28.572
that a few of these
dinners, rambling,

00:13:28.572 --> 00:13:30.280
all sorts of subjects,
but one thing that

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.670
comes up occasionally is
Elon's greatest mortal

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:33.670
fear in the world.

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:37.590
And I wonder if you'd
share that with us.

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:41.615
ASHLEE VANCE: These days,
it's AI and you guys, I think.

00:13:41.615 --> 00:13:43.740
I mean, it's funny because
he's friends with Larry.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.406
But OK, so at this
first dinner, there's

00:13:45.406 --> 00:13:48.960
also like no small
talk with Elon.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.880
So I'm coming into
this thing, it's

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.380
like my whole life feels
like it's on the line.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.800
I've made this huge
gamble on this book.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.665
And I have to convince
him to participate.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.100
So I had to have a gin
and tonic to try to settle

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:05.380
my nerves before he got there.

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:09.600
And then he's sitting
down and you just say,

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.910
hey, how's it going?

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:12.930
And before his butt
even hit the seat,

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:15.260
he's like-- How's it going?

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.700
My greatest-- He's like, well,
I'm just consumed by this fear

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.600
that Google is going
to destroy mankind.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.060
That's like what he
says as he's like he's

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.160
getting into the chair.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.220
And he's friends with Larry.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.600
Elon doesn't have-- he splits
his time between LA and Silicon

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.850
Valley, but he doesn't have
a house in Silicon Valley.

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:37.000
And so he either
stays at a hotel or he

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.119
couch surfs-- or villa surfs--
at this group of four people.

00:14:42.119 --> 00:14:43.660
And Larry's one of
those four people.

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.580
So he's like a
really close friend.

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:49.172
And so that, yeah,
it sort of threw me.

00:14:49.172 --> 00:14:51.255
I'm like, but you don't
like sort of fundamentally

00:14:51.255 --> 00:14:52.231
think Larry's evil.

00:14:52.231 --> 00:14:52.980
He's like, no, no.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:54.063
It's kind of the opposite.

00:14:54.063 --> 00:14:56.360
He's kind of naively nice.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.860
And I think he
felt like Larry had

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:04.900
a-- where Elon has a cynical
take on where AI's heading,

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.680
he feels like Larry's too
optimistic about where

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.240
it's heading.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.625
And it was funny
because this was 2012.

00:15:11.625 --> 00:15:13.750
And it felt like it was
like the early days of Elon

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:18.480
starting just to really
become top of mind for him.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.950
And ever since then, now
he's writing papers about it.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:23.400
He's calling out
Google and stuff.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.733
So I don't know what it's
like when they're at the house

00:15:25.733 --> 00:15:26.247
together.

00:15:26.247 --> 00:15:27.330
MALE SPEAKER: Fair enough.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:27.830
Fair enough.

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:28.510
I understand.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:31.340
So for somebody who's involved
with so many potentially

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.550
world- and
humanity-changing endeavors,

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:36.385
does Elon have a
world view or does

00:15:36.385 --> 00:15:39.027
he have a sole focus
or goal or mission?

00:15:39.027 --> 00:15:40.860
And maybe if you could
talk about where that

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.424
might come from, if he has one.

00:15:43.424 --> 00:15:45.340
ASHLEE VANCE: I guess
there's a couple levels.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:52.070
His driving purpose these days
is to have a colony on Mars--

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:56.700
and not like five people,
like a million people.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:01.630
And I think it comes with
his very logical-- he's hyper

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:02.130
rational.

00:16:04.806 --> 00:16:06.180
And it probably
makes more sense,

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.780
I think, maybe to a lot of
people in Silicon Valley.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:09.446
I think to people
outside of the Valley,

00:16:09.446 --> 00:16:11.020
it's a weird life's goal.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:15.089
But I think he thinks that
something horrible could

00:16:15.089 --> 00:16:16.130
happen to the human race.

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.690
And we kind of
need a backup plan.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:22.870
And nobody else is really
actively working on that.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:25.620
I mean, some people are,
but not at the scale he is.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.220
And that he's going
to be the guy that

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.800
makes this backup plan.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.910
I've had a couple software
developers who read the book

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:34.580
and they're like, yes,
I totally identify

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:36.610
with the dude for this.

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:41.052
And so that is like
absolutely what he wakes up

00:16:41.052 --> 00:16:42.260
in the morning wanting to do.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.470
And I think stuff like
Tesla and SolarCity,

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:51.430
it's kind of on the
way to this journey.

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:52.930
And setting up this
thing, let's try

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.487
to make Earth sort of
function a little bit better

00:16:55.487 --> 00:16:56.070
along the way.

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:57.110
MALE SPEAKER: OK, I see that.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:58.526
In the book, you
mention-- I think

00:16:58.526 --> 00:17:01.200
it's a quote from Elon
when he says that he read

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.280
too many comic books as a kid.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.980
Do you feel like he has
that "the Earth needs

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.759
to be saved" mentality?

00:17:09.759 --> 00:17:11.050
ASHLEE VANCE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:14.079
I mean, there's a couple
of bits and pieces to it.

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:18.300
Near the end of the book,
I put forward a theory

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.359
that I think he is--
there's a clinical term

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:23.599
that psychologists use
called profoundly gifted.

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:27.079
And it sounds abstract
and fluffy and vague.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:30.300
But it's like a
specific group of people

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.930
who are obviously very, very
intelligent, off the chart IQ

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:34.520
scale.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.970
And they tend to
exhibit similar traits.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:41.540
And one of them is a--
it's like this feeling

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:46.240
that something is wrong in the
world that needs to be fixed.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.700
And it's like a compulsion
to want to fix it.

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:53.790
And I think-- I'm totally
convinced Elon fits

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:55.370
into this category of people.

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:59.960
And I also am convinced that
he read probably-- I mean,

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:03.030
he may have read every
science fiction book known

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:05.290
to man before he was about 14.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.947
At least he was
probably getting close.

00:18:07.947 --> 00:18:08.780
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:09.450
ASHLEE VANCE: And I think--

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:10.210
MALE SPEAKER: A
few encyclopedias,

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:10.750
too, it seemed like.

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:11.583
ASHLEE VANCE: Right.

00:18:11.583 --> 00:18:16.020
I mean, he read out every
bookstore in his neighborhood

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.440
and every library.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.190
MALE SPEAKER: Wow.

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:18.970
ASHLEE VANCE: And
then his parents

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:20.950
were-- he would just
get encyclopedias

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:22.910
and he would pour through those.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:26.490
And I think he took
that stuff-- I think

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:28.830
he took the sci-fi
stuff really-- I mean,

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:31.560
I think it resonated with him.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.600
And once he made enough
money to go pursue something

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.790
like building a rocket ship,
that was right up his alley.

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:38.850
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:39.350
Very cool.

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.470
So one thing that I also
enjoyed about the book is

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.050
the first chapter or two,
you give this nice background

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:45.900
on his heritage, his family.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.800
And it's nice because
it's not this arduous,

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.740
every relative in
the family tree.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:54.640
But there are people there
flying in very primitive planes

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:58.810
around the world doing things
that I knew a few people did

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:01.020
back then, but I didn't
realize that Elon's family--

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:04.079
so he's definitely got
some interesting folks.

00:19:04.079 --> 00:19:06.370
Would you mind, I guess,
talking a little bit about how

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:09.229
his childhood may have shaped
the person he is today?

00:19:09.229 --> 00:19:10.270
ASHLEE VANCE: Yeah, sure.

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:12.860
Yeah, well, so, just real
quick his grandfather

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.290
on his mother's side,
Joshua Halderman,

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:18.800
he probably deserves a book
in and of his own right

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.979
because he was insane.

00:19:20.979 --> 00:19:22.020
MALE SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.270
ASHLEE VANCE: He was Canadian.

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.970
And just picked up his family
and moved to South Africa

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:26.660
one day.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:31.080
And he used to fly his
own single-engine plane.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.410
And with his wife,
they flew-- this

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:37.710
would have been-- I don't know--
must have been in the '50s,

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:39.090
I want to say.

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:42.170
They flew from South
Africa all the way up

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:46.622
the African coast, all the way
across Asia, down to Australia.

00:19:46.622 --> 00:19:48.580
I mean, it took them--
it was like it took them

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.930
a year just to get the paperwork
done to do this flight.

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:52.790
MALE SPEAKER: Wow.

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:56.130
ASHLEE VANCE: And
then one day, they

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:58.970
decided to enter this car
race from South Africa

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:01.330
to Northern Africa
in a station wagon.

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:04.700
And they got second place,
I think, in this car race.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:10.140
And then every weekend,
or every other weekend,

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.670
his grandfather would take
Elon's mom and her four

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:15.960
siblings, and they would go look
for a lost city of the Kalahari

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.710
out in the bush.

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:17.830
And they would
land their planes,

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:19.996
and there would be lions
in the camp and everything.

00:20:19.996 --> 00:20:24.212
So he was a chiropractor.

00:20:24.212 --> 00:20:26.670
MALE SPEAKER: There's a nice
picture, I think, in the book,

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.690
as well, that shows
them with the plane.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:29.390
ASHLEE VANCE: With
them with the plane.

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:32.050
Elon tried to go-- he tried to
buy the plane later in life.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:34.465
I mean, so I think
he was definitely

00:20:34.465 --> 00:20:35.840
like a little bit
of that spirit.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.420
And Elon knew his grandfather.

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.970
And then they would always
talk about these stories

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:44.200
and, I think, this idea that
if you want to do something,

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.930
just go do it, no matter
how audacious it seems.

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:50.100
But, I mean, on the
other side, Elon

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:55.260
was-- he was a big
reader and everything.

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:58.040
He was also kind
of a know-it-all.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.077
He didn't have a lot
of friends growing up.

00:21:00.077 --> 00:21:01.910
Sort of his family
seemed like the only ones

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:04.500
that really would tolerate him.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.520
And at school, I
mean, he was basically

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:14.090
either kind of ignored by
a lot of people or bullied,

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:15.940
and really badly.

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:17.880
There's one incident
that he talks

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.270
about where he got kicked
down a flight of stairs,

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:23.681
and then the guys stuck in--
got lit into them even more

00:21:23.681 --> 00:21:24.180
after that.

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:27.139
He was in the hospital
for about a week or two.

00:21:27.139 --> 00:21:28.680
And there were a
few times like that.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.240
It was South Africa
at that time--

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:34.100
even still today-- it's a
very masculine, macho, sort

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:36.127
of athletic culture.

00:21:36.127 --> 00:21:37.460
And Elon didn't play any sports.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:40.582
And he was like the bookish
guy off in the corner.

00:21:40.582 --> 00:21:41.790
And then it was really funny.

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:43.430
I mean, I went back
and I interviewed--

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:45.230
I found all these kids that
he went to grade school with.

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:46.355
And I was really surprised.

00:21:46.355 --> 00:21:48.670
I mean, two or
three of them said

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:51.520
he was the least likely
guy that we thought

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.770
would do anything exceptional.

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:56.140
It wasn't that
they thought he was

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:57.420
bad at anything or anything.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.160
It was just that he was so--
nobody thought about him.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.350
He just stayed to himself.

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.510
And then he had a really
horrendous relationship

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:09.090
with his father, which,
like in the book,

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:14.270
he talks about having
this horrible childhood.

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:16.040
He never-- it's kind
of unfulfilling.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.065
He never tells us exactly
what is dad did to him.

00:22:19.065 --> 00:22:21.550
And in my interviews
with him, there

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:23.880
were times when he'd start
to well up with tears.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.390
And he would start
to talk about it.

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:26.514
And then he would shut off.

00:22:26.514 --> 00:22:28.840
And that happened
four or five times.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.810
But I think the sum total
of all this stuff was,

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:36.470
I mean, you can just play
armchair psychologist,

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:39.380
and it's like a guy who's
out to kind of prove

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:44.990
to the world he's special and
can get a lot of things done

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:46.180
and deserves our attention.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.500
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:48.250
I appreciate that.

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:50.210
I had one quote I wrote down.

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:52.130
He says, I did not
have a good childhood.

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:53.530
It was like misery.

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:57.400
And going off what you
just said, would you

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.256
say that the chip
on his shoulder,

00:22:59.256 --> 00:23:01.230
do you think it formed
during that time?

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:03.330
Does he still have it?

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:04.450
ASHLEE VANCE: Yeah.

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:06.205
I definitely think so.

00:23:06.205 --> 00:23:08.080
There's sort of two
things going on with him.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.580
He's always this
independent spirit.

00:23:14.085 --> 00:23:16.697
He used to always want to get
to America, to Silicon Valley,

00:23:16.697 --> 00:23:17.280
in particular.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.800
He'd read about this is where
technology is happening.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.550
He got a computer at a young
age and was really into it.

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:25.800
And the second he's
17, he runs away

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:30.700
from home with $100 in his
pocket and lands in Canada.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.690
And he's backpacking
around for a year.

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:37.920
And so he had sort of
an independent streak.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:45.010
But I do think any
time you tell him no,

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:48.530
he's going to try
to prove you wrong,

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:50.850
that he can do something.

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:53.530
It's so funny because
that quote you

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:56.690
read, not only does
any time I ask him

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:58.750
sort of how he
got through really

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:01.720
tough times with the companies
or in his life-- I mean,

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.220
he always talks
about his childhood.

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:06.710
His wives always talk about
his childhood being horrible,

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:07.980
all his close friends.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.510
So this is clearly
something that

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:15.490
left this scar and this
sort of need to get past it.

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:16.440
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.130
ASHLEE VANCE: And I do think
he has a chip on his shoulder.

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:21.820
We talked a little bit sort
of like Michael Jordan kind

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.320
of type figure.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.800
I mean, I do think Elon's
cut using that mold.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.600
He's just relentless and
takes everything as a sleight.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:31.710
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:32.390
Thank you.

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:36.710
To move on to maybe a
little happier things, what

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:39.660
I was struck by is, just
as a lay person [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:43.010
of reading the book, you know
Elon is the guy, the Tesla guy,

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:45.360
SolarCity, SpaceX.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:48.250
And you just think, how does one
man lead all these companies?

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:49.400
And that's cool enough.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.690
But then I'm reading about him
picking up a 350-pound sumo

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:54.050
wrestler off the ground.

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:57.740
I'm reading about him at his
birthday parties volunteering

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:00.079
to have balloons placed
all over his body,

00:25:00.079 --> 00:25:02.370
especially in between his
legs, and have knife-throwers

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:03.650
throwing knives at him.

00:25:06.141 --> 00:25:08.432
ASHLEE VANCE: These investors
were not happy with that.

00:25:08.432 --> 00:25:10.140
MALE SPEAKER: Not
happy with that, right?

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.560
And the one that I love
most is this anecdote

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.390
that somebody says no
to him at his company.

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:16.430
Like, I can't do this.

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:17.960
And you're fired on the spot.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.750
I'm going to take-- I don't know
if he fires him, but he says,

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:21.300
I'm going be CEO of
my two companies,

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:22.910
and I'm going to
be CEO of your job.

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:24.307
And I'm going to
accomplish this.

00:25:24.307 --> 00:25:25.640
And he has a streak of doing it.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.170
And it always works out.

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:28.480
Is this the profoundly gifted?

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:32.080
Is he just like a super human,
I guess, is what I'm getting at.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.497
Is he really Tony Stark?

00:25:33.497 --> 00:25:35.830
ASHLEE VANCE: Yeah, I mean,
I don't-- It's kind of weird

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:38.340
because it sounds like such
a fan boy kind of thing.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.660
I mean, and I tried to have
the book be really balanced.

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:46.560
But it definitely
seems like he has--

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:51.250
He's got a stamina and a
resolve that other people, just

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:52.950
in my experience,
do not seem to have.

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:55.010
And it's an intensity of will.

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:02.360
And I thought this was total BS.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.530
Because I'd heard these
stories about you go to him

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:06.030
and you say this
thing's impossible,

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:07.840
and then he does it.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.400
I mean, it just
sounds like total BS.

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.110
Especially at
SpaceX, I interviewed

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:16.560
hundreds of people
that worked at SpaceX.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.990
And many people said they
saw this exact thing happen.

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:22.150
It was like you tell him
this thing can't be done

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:24.250
and he takes over the project.

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:25.250
And he does it.

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:27.330
And then if he does
it, you're pretty much

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:30.590
fired at the end of that because
you said it couldn't be done.

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:34.730
And I think it
takes a toll on him.

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:36.810
When we would be at
dinner, he would sometimes

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:40.410
come in and just have
this really haggard look,

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:43.419
like somebody at the
end of the marathon.

00:26:43.419 --> 00:26:45.460
And he's just sitting
there at 8 o'clock at night

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:48.320
and has been at
the office all day.

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.970
But he seems to be able to
do that for days on end.

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:53.120
It's really strange.

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.453
MALE SPEAKER: Actually to
bring up an interesting thing.

00:26:55.453 --> 00:26:57.400
I decided not to read a
passage from the book,

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.740
it's a couple pages
long, where you talk

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:01.510
about a typical week for Elon.

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:03.970
And there's also a nice--
somebody put together

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:06.470
an image of all the flights
that he takes in a year,

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:07.610
he took in one year.

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:10.500
So how does a man run
multiple companies like this?

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.281
He has five kids?

00:27:12.281 --> 00:27:14.530
ASHLEE VANCE: You know, five
boys, twins and triplets.

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:15.880
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.655
How is it possible?

00:27:17.655 --> 00:27:19.780
We struggle with the 24
hours we're given in a day.

00:27:21.384 --> 00:27:23.550
ASHLEE VANCE: There's all
the stuff we talked about.

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:24.930
And then he has a
lot of help as well.

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:26.140
But I mean, isn't it strange?

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.060
It's a totally
abnormal existence.

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.040
So more or less, it
fluctuates a little bit,

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:34.410
but it's kind of Monday,
Tuesday at SpaceX,

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:37.490
coming in up here
sort of Tuesday night.

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:40.880
And then Wednesday,
Thursday at Tesla.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.130
And then Friday back to LA.

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:45.570
And then typically it
seemed like the weekends

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:47.640
would be whichever
company was having

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.670
the most immediate disaster.

00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:55.900
And the entire time
I was doing the book,

00:27:55.900 --> 00:28:00.210
he worked like
seven days a week.

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:03.855
And then there's a woman in
the book, Mary Beth Brown.

00:28:03.855 --> 00:28:05.810
If Elon is kind of
like Tony Stark,

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:07.060
she would be his Pepper Potts.

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:10.530
She was with him from Paypal on.

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:14.540
She devoted her life to him.

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:18.710
She lived in two cities just
like he did, had no boyfriend

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:20.470
that I could discern.

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:22.880
She didn't ever even have
lunch or anything like that.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.820
And she handled his
personal affairs,

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:27.979
like scheduling custody
with the kids, who

00:28:27.979 --> 00:28:30.270
was going to pick them up,
like basic things like that.

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:33.030
And then business affairs,
she handled Elon's PR,

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:36.550
more or less, for the
really top-level stuff.

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:43.110
So she was this glue that
made everything work.

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:46.270
And then he used to
have a team of nannies.

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:48.880
They've done a little
nanny reduction lately.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:52.110
So/ they're down
to two or three.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:54.870
And then when he's up
here, he's got his staying

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:56.666
at the friends and all that.

00:28:56.666 --> 00:28:58.320
Yeah, it's a totally
crazy existences.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:04.060
His kids-- by all accounts,
he's a very good dad.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:06.370
It's just that his kids
live a very strange life.

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:08.730
There's one time
we're at a dinner.

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:12.480
And he said, I just got back
from Monaco with the boys.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.550
We were watching the F1 races
with the prince and princess.

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:20.310
And then his people
would tell me--

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:23.230
because he brings the kids
to SpaceX on the weekends.

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:26.400
So it's like they're so bored
of going to the rocket factory.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.840
And they're like the
only 10-year-old boys

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:32.625
on the planet that are bored
of going to the rocket factory.

00:29:32.625 --> 00:29:33.750
MALE SPEAKER: That's great.

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:36.560
That's fantastic.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.935
Kind of on this thread, I
remember one of his employees--

00:29:38.935 --> 00:29:40.934
I think it's a director
of one of the companies,

00:29:40.934 --> 00:29:43.940
somebody pretty high up-- said,
I would be in Europe or China

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:46.409
and send an email at 2:30
in the morning his time.

00:29:46.409 --> 00:29:48.200
Five minutes later,
I'd get an answer back.

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.300
It's unbelievable to have
support on that level.

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:54.140
So what toll does it take
on his health and his family

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:57.620
if he's up that late
working seven days a week?

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:00.840
ASHLEE VANCE: Well, you can see
he's been married and divorced.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:01.730
To the second wife.

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:05.190
He's married, divorced, married,
divorced, and then gotten back

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:06.090
together with again.

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:07.656
MALE SPEAKER: I
didn't realize that.

00:30:07.656 --> 00:30:08.156
OK.

00:30:08.156 --> 00:30:09.520
OK.

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.800
ASHLEE VANCE: I think
it takes a-- I don't

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.205
think he has anything
resembling a normal life.

00:30:15.205 --> 00:30:16.830
There's another quote
in the book where

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:18.970
he's between wives
at the moment and he

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:23.440
says-- I was interviewing
him at his cubicle in SpaceX

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.160
and he's like, I
need a date again.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:29.160
He goes, how long do you
think a woman needs a week?

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:29.930
10 hours?

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:32.747
Is like 10 about right?

00:30:32.747 --> 00:30:34.705
MALE SPEAKER: About the
minimum would be great?

00:30:34.705 --> 00:30:35.496
ASHLEE VANCE: Yeah.

00:30:35.496 --> 00:30:36.649
And then there's another.

00:30:36.649 --> 00:30:37.940
You remind me of another thing.

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:41.390
The guy who was talking about
when he would answer emails

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:42.130
at any time.

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:45.070
I mean, there's one
time when Elon's

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:47.740
in bed with Tallulah
his second wife.

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:52.320
And the team at SpaceX has
totally screwed something up.

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.100
And it's 2:00 in the morning.

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:57.616
And he doesn't want
to wake Tallulah up.

00:30:57.616 --> 00:30:58.990
And Elon really
lays into people.

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:04.880
So he's like whisper yelling
at these guys from bed.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.840
They're all huddled
around the speaker phone

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:10.529
taking this verbal
lashing from him.

00:31:10.529 --> 00:31:11.820
MALE SPEAKER: That's fantastic.

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:13.580
Did you get that story
from Tallulah, or--

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:14.680
ASHLEE VANCE: That one--

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:15.480
MALE SPEAKER: --from one
of the people [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:18.940
ASHLEE VANCE: That was from
this guy, Kevin Brogan, who--

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:21.260
yeah, he was on--
So there's also

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:24.030
this-- I don't know if this is
common to every tech company,

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:26.070
but at Elon's
company, they always

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:27.380
talk about the critical path.

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:30.240
And so it's the one thing
that's blocking the companies

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.500
at any point in time.

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.392
And so that's where
Elon puts his focus.

00:31:33.392 --> 00:31:34.850
And so I remember
Kevin was on-- he

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:37.270
was the guy on the critical
path at that moment.

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:40.027
And so that meant that Elon's
watching you 24 hours a day.

00:31:40.027 --> 00:31:40.860
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:41.420
ASHLEE VANCE: Yeah.

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:43.430
MALE SPEAKER: I think that's a
good segue into just what is he

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:44.430
like with employees?

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:47.680
It seemed like there
was a general sense

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:51.214
of admiration, but
very varied stories

00:31:51.214 --> 00:31:52.380
on either side of that line.

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.930
ASHLEE VANCE: Yeah,
I mean, I think

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:57.020
Google has some of this
going for it as well

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.950
and is probably among the
few companies that do.

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:01.950
But I think there's
like this mission

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:07.030
that Tesla and SpaceX have that
the employees fully buy into.

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:09.890
And it's a little bit
different than working

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:11.949
at another company.

00:32:11.949 --> 00:32:13.490
If you want to go
to Mars, and that's

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:15.430
been your dream
since you were a kid,

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:17.700
SpaceX is the place
you go to work.

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:21.080
If you are into electric
cars or you really

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:25.500
care about changing the
global warming situation,

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:26.450
you buy into that.

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:29.120
And so there is a
sense of mission.

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:32.390
And there's this faith in Elon.

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:34.560
Especially now, I think.

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.950
Pre-2012, he was struggling
in a lot of ways.

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:39.910
He has hit his stride more.

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:43.670
And so now I think there's this
real faith that if you-- you

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.310
may have to work hard.

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:46.650
You may suffer a bit.

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:51.190
But there's nobody else is going
to get it done the way he is,

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:53.540
and that these
companies are the place

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:57.180
to do the most exciting
work in those fields.

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.129
It's kind of weird.

00:32:59.129 --> 00:33:00.920
The one thing that I
was struck by the most

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:07.660
is that-- at both Tesla and
SpaceX, there's among the EVPs,

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:10.800
there's a group of people
that have been there really

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.940
since both companies
have been founded.

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:14.960
So they've worked
alongside Elon through

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:20.480
thick and thin for 10 or
12 years and pretty much

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.700
on a daily basis.

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:25.870
And I don't think he would
consider them friends.

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:28.690
And I don't think they
would consider him friends.

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:33.660
I think it's still there's
always this line drawn for him.

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:36.475
And I don't know.

00:33:36.475 --> 00:33:38.490
I found that a
little bit weird just

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:42.000
because they have been
through-- both companies

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.400
have almost gone
bust so many times

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.900
and pulled off pretty
incredible feats.

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:51.050
So it feels like this
amazing bonding exercise.

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:51.800
MALE SPEAKER: Wow.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.897
ASHLEE VANCE: So yeah,
he's always the boss.

00:33:54.897 --> 00:33:56.230
MALE SPEAKER: I understand that.

00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:56.732
OK, cool.

00:33:56.732 --> 00:33:58.940
I want to turn it over the
audience in a moment here.

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:00.509
A couple of quick last ones.

00:34:00.509 --> 00:34:02.550
Can you tell us about the
time that Google almost

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:03.360
acquired Tesla?

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.151
ASHLEE VANCE: Yeah.

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:14.780
The Model S had
come out in 2012.

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.989
And it had received way
better reviews than, I think,

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:20.300
anyone, even Elon,
would have expected.

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:22.460
Even the Detroit
automotive press

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:25.199
was saying this may be
the best car ever built.

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:27.550
And you had this
whole first adopter

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:32.379
wave of a lot of people in
California who bought the car.

00:34:32.379 --> 00:34:34.379
We're used the early
adopters, but early adopter

00:34:34.379 --> 00:34:37.949
for something that cost
$100,000 and its door

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:42.650
handles may or may not
work is a leap of faith.

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:44.630
And people bought in.

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:45.870
Their sales were fantastic.

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:48.650
And then things
started to cool off.

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:52.590
After you had that first wave,
there were on the Tesla forums,

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.070
there were glitches
with the car,

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:56.517
like the windshield
wipers would go weird.

00:34:56.517 --> 00:34:57.850
The door handles would go weird.

00:34:57.850 --> 00:35:01.820
The interior was not really
where a luxury car should be.

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:03.400
And so I think a
lot of people-- you

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:07.550
have to place orders to
get in line for the car.

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:10.060
And so people would put
down $5,000 to get line,

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:11.880
but they were all
waiting to actually

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:15.670
convert that to a purchase
until everything got worked out.

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:19.500
And this was a huge
problem for Tesla.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.210
Because you're
running a factory,

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:25.570
it's burning through tons of
money if it's not being filled.

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:29.745
And so it was
basically, I think it

00:35:29.745 --> 00:35:35.810
was the second
quarter of 2013, Elon

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:39.342
could plot out that they're
just going to run out of money.

00:35:39.342 --> 00:35:40.800
And he was good
friends with Larry.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.300
And I think he felt
like Larry would

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:46.520
sort of-- because the
mission of the company's

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:49.600
important to Elon, I think, he
felt like Larry not only would

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.790
be sort of like into
buying the company,

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:54.850
but would see it through more
than maybe some other guys.

00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:59.485
And so he turned to him
for this emergency bailout.

00:35:59.485 --> 00:36:01.110
But Elon still didn't
trust him enough.

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:04.320
He wanted to remain
CEO for, I think,

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:11.940
it was five years of time
within the auspices of Google.

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:14.630
And he wanted an
immediate guarantee

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:17.850
for-- it's in the book,
but it's like $3 billion,

00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:21.550
I think, of money to sort of
not only see this tough time

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:23.930
through, but advance the
factory and everything.

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:26.780
And then this very
Elon thing happened.

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:31.240
He basically took
everybody in the company,

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.690
whether you were
in HR or marketing

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:36.050
or whatever you
did-- an engineer--

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:39.820
and he had everybody call
every single customer who

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:43.630
had placed a reservation
and try to talk them

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:45.990
into converting it into a sale.

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:49.760
And within two weeks,
they sold so many cars,

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:53.340
that it ended up being Tesla's
first profitable quarter.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.420
And then the stock
price immediately,

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.240
once they announced
that, it shot up.

00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.960
And then it became the best
performing stock of 2013.

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.840
And so there was
never-- not only

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:05.350
did they have enough money
to see through the quarter,

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:07.120
then Tesla became
so expensive that it

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.570
was like-- I don't
even think Google

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:10.907
would've bought it anyway.

00:37:10.907 --> 00:37:12.240
MALE SPEAKER: Understandably so.

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:13.690
Tesla almost an
Alphabet company.

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:14.481
ASHLEE VANCE: Yeah.

00:37:14.481 --> 00:37:20.912
I mean, it's a little tricky
because some of the stuff

00:37:20.912 --> 00:37:23.370
was sourced in the book, so
there's only so much I can say,

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:26.104
but this was very
close to happening.

00:37:26.104 --> 00:37:26.870
MALE SPEAKER: Wow.

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:27.590
Fair enough.

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:28.384
Very interesting.

00:37:28.384 --> 00:37:30.550
At this time, I'd love to
have folks in the audience

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:32.425
also chime in with
questions as well, I think

00:37:32.425 --> 00:37:33.962
Jeremy has a mic in the back.

00:37:33.962 --> 00:37:36.910
AUDIENCE: Yeah I want to
go back to your mentioning

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:40.000
how much of an influence comic
books and reading science

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.091
fiction was for Musk.

00:37:42.091 --> 00:37:43.840
One of the things I'm
really curious about

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:47.100
is, looking at the industries
that he's taken on,

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:52.980
it's very sort of like Modernist
perspective of transportation

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:54.540
and energy.

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:56.040
Even the way he's
thinking about AI,

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.420
I'm curious if it's
reflecting this '50s,

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:01.940
'60s view from science fiction.

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.470
And meanwhile, when you think
about like Philip K. Dick,

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:06.410
you think about
Cyberpunk, a lot more sort

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:09.470
of engaging with identity,
how a human identity involved,

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:12.460
how our composition evolves
through genetic engineering.

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:15.400
Do you see him engaging
in some of these more

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.762
recent preoccupations
of science fiction?

00:38:17.762 --> 00:38:19.220
ASHLEE VANCE: I
mean, first of all,

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:21.000
I think your point
is exactly right.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.180
I mean, that's the
way I sort of came--

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:26.630
your first point is the way
I came to view the companies.

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:30.260
I mean, like the aerospace
stuff in particular

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.010
is sort of depressing
outside of SpaceX.

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:36.240
I would go to launches of
Arianespace and-- I mean,

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.530
these companies
do amazing things.

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:42.040
But the equipment looks
like it's from 1960s still.

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:46.960
And you expect there to be
these kind of modern-- you just

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.080
expect it to be advanced.

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.080
And it just hasn't been.

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:52.780
And SpaceX definitely has
put pressure on everybody

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:56.120
to up their game on software,
all the electronics inside

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:58.410
of the rockets, and
then more recently

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:00.340
just with the way a
capsule should look.

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.945
And Elon's going to come
out with new spacesuits

00:39:02.945 --> 00:39:04.650
soon that he says are crazy.

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:06.890
And so, he's into
all that stuff.

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:10.407
And then I think that
modernization of Tesla's

00:39:10.407 --> 00:39:12.240
pretty obvious, like
beyond the electric car

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.540
stuff, the software in the car.

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:17.830
It's funny because people ask
the second part of the question

00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:18.330
to me.

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:20.410
Other times it's like, what?

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:22.910
When's Elon going to cure
cancer or something like that.

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:28.360
I don't he-- I just never
heard him really get

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:34.730
into the biotech sort of-- I've
never heard him even address

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:36.310
that stuff outside of industry.

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:37.060
It's really funny.

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:39.350
I mean, I think that's kind
of where he's locked in.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:45.890
Craig Venter and Elon
are pretty close.

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:49.600
And they talk about these
biological 3D printers

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.920
on Mars and where they
want to go with that.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.420
But that was the
only time I've ever

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:58.500
heard him sort of even begin to
sort of veer in that direction.

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:02.180
One of the central arguments I
try to make in the book is that

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:04.466
Elon's-- I give you
guys credit, too,

00:40:04.466 --> 00:40:07.750
but Elon is one of our best
examples-- I think the best--

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:09.930
of combining atoms and bits.

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:13.090
And this is obviously
going to be this huge trend

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:18.590
that we see in the next couple
decades of-- essentially

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:24.200
what he's done is take Silicon
Valley, just the way you run

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:27.850
your business, more like the
way companies are run here,

00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:30.110
and then the software
ethos and sort of push that

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:32.720
into these industries
that were not prepared yet

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.900
to move at that speed
or think that way.

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:40.194
There's examples
in the book where

00:40:40.194 --> 00:40:42.110
if you want to put
a radio on a rocket,

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:45.770
NASA would make you put
this $100,000 space grade

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:46.970
radio on the rocket.

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:48.960
And I'm sure that
was because they

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.210
used to worry about the
radiation and all these things

00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:52.490
messing with the electronics.

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:56.070
And then SpaceX was building
their own for $5,000.

00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:58.320
And they would have to fly
it up like a bunch of times

00:40:58.320 --> 00:40:59.944
and prove to them
that it still worked.

00:40:59.944 --> 00:41:03.350
Or that they could put four
of the $5,000 radios on.

00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:08.870
And so, to me, Elon
invents a lot of stuff,

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:11.780
but he's this great integrator
of technologies and pushing

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.382
these industries forward.

00:41:14.382 --> 00:41:15.840
AUDIENCE: Thanks
for talking to us.

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:16.590
The book is great.

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:17.872
ASHLEE VANCE: Oh, thank you.

00:41:17.872 --> 00:41:19.830
AUDIENCE: Now that the
book has been published,

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:22.878
what is Elon's response?

00:41:22.878 --> 00:41:24.760
Did he get a chance
to read it before?

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:28.114
And have you guys-- are you
guys still on communication?

00:41:28.114 --> 00:41:29.655
ASHLEE VANCE: Yeah,
it's complicated.

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:37.540
Even though he didn't
get to make any changes,

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:39.485
I didn't want him to
have to buy it on Amazon

00:41:39.485 --> 00:41:43.030
and speed read through it
before anything happens.

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:46.420
So I think it was about three
weeks before the book came out.

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:48.640
The presses had started
and all that stuff.

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.590
So I sent him a copy.

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:53.459
And then he did this
very Elon thing.

00:41:53.459 --> 00:41:55.250
I woke up one morning,
and the first email,

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:58.480
the timestamp was like 3:30 AM.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.340
And he had been going
through the book paragraph

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:02.015
by paragraph.

00:42:02.015 --> 00:42:03.390
And it was sort
of like-- I mean,

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:04.870
it was all-- it
was a mix of stuff.

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:09.350
Kind of silly things like, I
don't really eat like that.

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:11.600
And then other things, like,
yeah, you got this right.

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:12.920
And it was all over the place.

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:14.220
It was actually kind of cool.

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:21.770
He's like there's three
factually wrong things.

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:23.950
And two of them were
opinions of him,

00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:25.920
which I was trying to
explain were not facts.

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:31.670
And then the third one, he
said that Kimbal, his brother,

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:33.622
had bought this car.

00:42:33.622 --> 00:42:35.080
They had a
cross-country road trip.

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.780
And he's like, I bought
the car, not Kimbal.

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:38.610
I was like, OK, I'm sure we
can get to the bottom of that

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:40.180
before the paperback comes out.

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:45.760
And then there were a
couple nastier emails.

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.750
And then a day went by.

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:48.625
And then he came back,
and he said, you know,

00:42:48.625 --> 00:42:49.720
this is really well done.

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:54.980
And he gave me an
accuracy rating of 95%.

00:42:54.980 --> 00:43:02.230
Which like in Elon terms, I
take that as 100% for mortals.

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:05.290
And then basically
those three weeks passed

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:07.820
and the book came out,
and then some of the press

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:10.550
started grabbing-- like
"The Washington Post" did

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:13.960
this list of the juiciest quotes
or whatever from the book.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:16.610
And there were a couple
there, like one he

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:19.730
said he was a samurai
and he would not fail.

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:24.570
And then the other one was about
during Tesla's rougher times,

00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:27.100
him giving this
employee a hard time

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:29.370
for going to see the
birth of his child

00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:32.410
when he was supposed
to be at a big meeting.

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:35.780
And that was weird,
when people reacted

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:39.030
to that in a
negative way, then he

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:40.730
reacted in a pretty
negative way.

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:43.960
It was weird because
he'd never even commented

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:47.540
on either of those things
when he read the book.

00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:49.540
And so then he got
[INAUDIBLE] for a little bit.

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:52.690
And then things have been
pretty normal since then.

00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:55.260
I sort of covered
some Tesla stuff.

00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:56.790
He's back together
with Tallulha.

00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:59.090
And she's been quite nice to me.

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:01.110
So I don't know.

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:05.320
Things are still a little
tense, but not horrible.

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:08.060
AUDIENCE: To what
extent do you think

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:11.360
a lot of what Musk is doing
is a reaction to a failure

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:14.250
of our institutions?

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:16.164
The hyper loop was,
essentially, his version

00:44:16.164 --> 00:44:17.580
of a back-of-the-envelope
drawing.

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:20.360
I mean, gigantic white paper,
but it's a back-of-the-envelope

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:21.910
drawing.

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:23.947
And you see a lot of
people comparing that.

00:44:23.947 --> 00:44:25.530
And I think his idea
was to compare it

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:27.238
against California
high speed rail, which

00:44:27.238 --> 00:44:28.910
is this gigantic
thing which used

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:33.060
to be emblematic
of our inability

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:35.210
as a civilization to really
accomplish big things.

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:37.860
And his shtick is trying
to accomplish big things.

00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:39.337
To what extent do
you do you think

00:44:39.337 --> 00:44:41.170
that he's responding
to that, or that that's

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:44.349
why he seems to be so
important, that sort of thing?

00:44:44.349 --> 00:44:46.140
ASHLEE VANCE: Yeah, I
think you're spot on.

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:47.930
I mean, I broke the
story on the hyper loop.

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:50.200
And I sat Elon the first
time he ever talked about it.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:52.410
And it was exactly
what you said.

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:55.440
I mean, it was
basically a brainstorm--

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:58.460
He saw the California
high speed rail coming

00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:03.110
and thought it was so disastrous
and such a horrible mistake

00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:06.630
that he had to come up
with some other proposal.

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:08.640
I don't think-- I
know for a fact,

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:11.940
he had no intention of building
the hyper loop initially

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:14.090
at all, and sort of--
well, it was more

00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:20.100
like a thought exercise
and just to make people

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:23.830
see how bad the train
was and that we should

00:45:23.830 --> 00:45:26.180
be striving for something else.

00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:33.100
I think Elon,
Larry, Jeff Bezos--

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:36.510
they're all sort of
examples of people

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:40.110
who have amassed enough
wealth now to do things

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:48.870
that governments used to do and
that are proving that they can

00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:50.970
accomplish stuff on that scale.

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:54.020
And there doesn't seem to be a
willingness on the government

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:56.610
side to tackle a
lot of these things.

00:45:56.610 --> 00:46:01.830
And so I guess it depends
where you are on the spectrum.

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:04.360
If you think this is a
bunch of "Star Trek" fans

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.920
who have made too much
and are charging around,

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:10.440
going after these wild dreams,
or if you buy into the idea

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:13.020
that this is the direction
we should head in.

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:18.430
I mean, I think,
if nothing else,

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:23.140
Elon's set a good example
for believing in the spirit.

00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:26.660
Even if you just take SpaceX,
you drop the Mars thing and all

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:30.410
that, the US used to have like
100% of the launch market.

00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:32.070
Then we went down to 0%.

00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:35.260
And we're completely
uncompetitive

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:36.300
on the worldwide stage.

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:39.140
And now SpaceX is easily
the low-cost leader

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:40.200
that has brought us back.

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:44.680
It's manufacturing everything
in the United States.

00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.720
Lockheed and Boeing
buy Russian engines

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:50.490
to send up our spy satellites,
which obviously the government

00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:53.090
gave up if we're doing that.

00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:55.590
So, yeah, I mean I
completely agree.

00:46:55.590 --> 00:46:57.510
I think it's a really
interesting time

00:46:57.510 --> 00:47:01.070
to be alive when people can go
do these government-scale type

00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:02.860
things.

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:03.846
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:47:03.846 --> 00:47:04.470
Love the books.

00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:07.159
And actually, I felt
like I've been following

00:47:07.159 --> 00:47:08.700
Elon and Tesla and
SpaceX pretty well

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:09.470
for the last several years.

00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:11.260
And I was amazed
how much I learned

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:12.926
and how much I enjoyed
hearing this sort

00:47:12.926 --> 00:47:14.571
of oral integrated
way you've talked

00:47:14.571 --> 00:47:15.820
about how the stories went on.

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:16.390
ASHLEE VANCE: Oh, thank you.

00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:17.680
AUDIENCE: That's unusual for
books about Silicon Valley

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.300
because normally you
feel like I'm just

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:20.280
reading what I've read before.

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.570
This is for the people
who live outside there.

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:23.300
But this-- anyway-- this
really broke through.

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:24.430
ASHLEE VANCE: Thank you.

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:27.410
AUDIENCE: My question was-- and
this is more just your own gut

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:30.220
opinion-- a lot of the stuff
that Elon says and does,

00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:33.140
it's hard for me to tell if he's
being really savvy and cynical,

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:34.740
like some of the PR stuff.

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:36.880
Or if it's just kind
of vanity, and he's

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:37.990
off the cuff and whatever.

00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:40.950
A lot of the PR feels
very spontaneous,

00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:43.744
but you're not clear if he's
trying to sound that way, or--

00:47:43.744 --> 00:47:45.660
I remember when I first
saw the Tesla factory,

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:47.910
there's this giant
Schuler press.

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:50.260
And there was this crazy
story to get in the factory.

00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:51.843
And then he made
them take it all down

00:47:51.843 --> 00:47:54.430
and paint it red because he
didn't like the way it looked.

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:54.990
Is it crazy?

00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:55.510
Or is it brilliant?

00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:56.093
Or is it both?

00:47:56.093 --> 00:47:58.140
I'm just kind of curious
how you break down

00:47:58.140 --> 00:47:59.030
those kind of
decisions he makes.

00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:00.821
ASHLEE VANCE: It's
funny that you ask that.

00:48:00.821 --> 00:48:02.610
There were times
when I would ask

00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:04.590
myself the exact same question.

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:06.550
It's definitely-- I
think it's a mix of both.

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:11.340
There are these
almost like propaganda

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:13.470
sort of things that
he does internally,

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:15.487
but they actually do
seem to work really well.

00:48:15.487 --> 00:48:17.320
Like when you into the
Tesla factor, I mean,

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:20.260
it's hard not to
be enthusiastic.

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:22.970
And this is not some
dingy car factory.

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:25.360
This is like an exciting
place making exciting cars

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:29.260
with all this huge massive
logos and the color.

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:32.530
And at SpaceX, everything
is this pristine white.

00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:33.990
You could eat off the floor.

00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:37.700
And it's like the white
counter, the white orchids,

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:40.090
the white everything
all the way through.

00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:46.110
And so he has this sort of--
that, to me, was the most

00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:48.590
sort of Steve Jobs-ian
part about him,

00:48:48.590 --> 00:48:51.090
is he pays attention
to things like that.

00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:53.240
The other-- and
then, you know, he's

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:56.570
also very good at--
he's definitely

00:48:56.570 --> 00:49:01.780
outclassing in PR
terms his peers

00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:04.890
at the aerospace companies
and the automotive companies.

00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:07.360
I feel bad for them sometimes.

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:10.160
Elon will do a Reddit AMA.

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:13.577
And then Lockheed CEO's like,
I'm going to do a Reddit AMA.

00:49:13.577 --> 00:49:15.160
And then every
question is about Elon.

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:21.490
And then I remember Tesla was
having an event the same day

00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:22.840
Ford was having an event.

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:24.840
And there were like 50
people at the Ford thing,

00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:26.780
and there were
5,000 people lined

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:29.410
up outside of the Tesla thing
all just because Elon tweeted

00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:32.645
about I may show something.

00:49:32.645 --> 00:49:34.187
And with Elon, you never know.

00:49:34.187 --> 00:49:35.645
Is it actually
going to be a thing?

00:49:35.645 --> 00:49:39.160
Or is it just going to be
some sort of software update

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:42.610
that we're getting in six
months or-- you don't know.

00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:46.570
Other stuff, he's just
totally off the cuff

00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:49.720
and I think not very
good at what he's doing.

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:54.070
But they have to sue the
Air Force to try and get

00:49:54.070 --> 00:50:00.470
the rights to bid on the launch
contracts for spy satellites.

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:03.077
It was a Friday afternoon when
they announced that lately.

00:50:03.077 --> 00:50:05.410
So any other company, if
you're going to sue potentially

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:08.660
your largest customer,
and it's the government,

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:10.640
you would like do
this strategically.

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:14.050
And what you do is call up
a reporter at "The New York

00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:16.030
Times" ahead of time
and be like, look,

00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:18.950
I'm going to give you this-- I'm
going to leak you this story.

00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:21.510
And you would sort of
feed them your spin

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:25.640
and hope the reporter does
a sympathetic SpaceX story.

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:29.262
And you have that on the
front page on Monday morning.

00:50:29.262 --> 00:50:31.220
I'm pretty sure what
happened was that Elon who

00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:34.010
wrote the press release
himself and finished it

00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:35.700
at 3:45 on a Friday.

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:39.322
And then five minutes later,
issued the press release.

00:50:39.322 --> 00:50:41.930
And then all his PR people
were like, oh, crap.

00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:44.640
We're going to sue
the US government.

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:46.610
Now let's sort of
figure out what

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:47.860
we're going to say about this.

00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:51.760
And that's, I think, probably
how that kind of thing goes.

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.820
And he talks about it in
the book a little bit,

00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:55.403
like the speeches
and stuff like that.

00:50:55.403 --> 00:50:57.665
He definitely does
not do the Steve Jobs,

00:50:57.665 --> 00:50:59.880
I'm rehearsing for
days beforehand.

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:02.240
I mean, he just gets
up there and wings it.

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:06.340
And sometimes it works,
and sometimes it doesn't.

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:09.490
You definitely have to
give him credit for being

00:51:09.490 --> 00:51:10.740
the five-tooled player.

00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:17.590
I mean, to be able to do some
of the engineering, marketing,

00:51:17.590 --> 00:51:23.140
business decisions, the
fact that he actually has

00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:26.840
a hand in all that stuff
and can do it competently

00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:28.930
if not sort of
excel at it at times

00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:32.369
is like completely unusual.

00:51:32.369 --> 00:51:32.910
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:34.451
What was the thing
that surprised you

00:51:34.451 --> 00:51:36.335
about him the most?

00:51:36.335 --> 00:51:39.880
ASHLEE VANCE: I think
just the once he

00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:41.760
agreed to cooperate
with the book,

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:45.656
and then we-- it's probably
about like 18 months.

00:51:45.656 --> 00:51:47.280
I mean, we had this
weird relationship.

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:48.470
We were not friends.

00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:49.970
It was like a
business relationship

00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:53.010
of some sort of where I was
obviously on the begging end.

00:51:53.010 --> 00:52:02.030
And so he could be this
wonderful guy to deal with.

00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:04.430
And then he can be a very
hard guy to deal with.

00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:10.406
And the ups and downs and the
intensity of that and being--

00:52:10.406 --> 00:52:11.780
I definitely am
in a weird space.

00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:13.570
I have spent way
more time with them

00:52:13.570 --> 00:52:17.409
than probably like a pretty
select group of people,

00:52:17.409 --> 00:52:19.200
especially for a
journalist, way more time.

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:23.930
And so you would start
to hear these stories

00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:28.890
and then to get like that
up close and personal,

00:52:28.890 --> 00:52:31.800
to see the intensity of
how it operates first

00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:35.070
it was like oh OK all this
stuff makes a lot of the cell

00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:42.860
and I like I've just never met
anyone who is just all in about

00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:44.990
every single thing he does.

00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:49.800
And it just felt when everything
was finally all said and done

00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:52.780
and the book came out, it
just felt such a relief

00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:57.680
because it had just
been this crazy process.

00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:00.140
And I mean, I feel
in retrospect,

00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:04.760
I really feel blessed
to have sort of gotten

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:07.922
to know kind of what it's like.

00:53:07.922 --> 00:53:08.880
And then, I don't know.

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:10.450
And then you hear all these
stories along that way.

00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:11.740
And you're like, there's
no way this could be true.

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:14.200
And then it turns out,
I mean, most of them

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:18.180
seem like they are kind of true.

00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:22.010
Just sort of the
larger-than-life kind of thing.

00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:24.160
MALE SPEAKER: I've actually
got one more question.

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.196
We'll stop after that.

00:53:25.196 --> 00:53:27.820
And then, I think, you'll stick
around for a bit for some more.

00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:29.260
Forgive me, it's kind
of a rambling question.

00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:31.010
But I've been thinking
about this since we

00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:32.740
spoke maybe a couple hours ago.

00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:35.620
And we compared Elon in
some ways to Michael Jordan.

00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:37.680
And just a quick side
thing for anybody

00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:39.510
who's listening now
or watching later,

00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:41.070
highly recommend
going on YouTube

00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:44.760
and looking up the Hall of
Fame enshrinement speech

00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:47.220
that Michael Jordan
gave a few years ago.

00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:47.970
I forget.

00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:50.010
It was about a
20-minute long speech.

00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:51.260
He gets up there.

00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:54.200
And he gets the longest
speech at the end.

00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:57.700
And he's going after guys like
John Stockton who he beat,

00:53:57.700 --> 00:53:59.430
defeated for years.

00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:01.760
And John Stockton goes up
there as humble, grateful.

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:02.884
He's there with his family.

00:54:02.884 --> 00:54:03.570
He's at peace.

00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:05.590
Jordan's still taking shots.

00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:07.820
He flies in the
guy who was picked

00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:09.430
over him for the
high school team

00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:11.340
just to point him
out in the audience.

00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:13.574
I think he threw
a coach out, too.

00:54:13.574 --> 00:54:16.240
So we're making some comparisons
about this chip on the shoulder

00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:19.090
that Elon may or
may not still have.

00:54:19.090 --> 00:54:20.680
But it's a two-part question.

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:23.110
You've met with a lot
of these other CEOs.

00:54:23.110 --> 00:54:25.470
You met with Larry
for this book.

00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:28.390
Part one is how
does Elon compare

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:31.570
to these other titans in a way?

00:54:31.570 --> 00:54:33.140
And part two, I'd
love to also ask

00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:38.050
you is, around time that speech
Jordan gave, ESPN, I think,

00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:42.430
did a cover story about how
Jordan can't sleep at night.

00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:45.860
He has cowboy Westerns on his TV
that remind him of his father.

00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:49.405
And he needs them on all
night to be able to sleep.

00:54:49.405 --> 00:54:51.780
Do you worry or do you think
even his friends might worry

00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:55.970
that Elon someday
might be past is prime

00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:57.850
and still not
letting go, I guess?

00:54:57.850 --> 00:55:00.279
ASHLEE VANCE: I never
thought about that one.

00:55:00.279 --> 00:55:01.320
MALE SPEAKER: It's tough.

00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:03.400
For such a-- I never
would've thought about it

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:04.300
either until we spoke

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:05.160
ASHLEE VANCE: Yeah.

00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:06.700
So remind me exactly what the--

00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:07.390
MALE SPEAKER: OK,
first question,

00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:09.780
how does he compare to his
contemporaries, his peers?

00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:12.779
They all are leaders just
filled with that drive?

00:55:12.779 --> 00:55:13.570
ASHLEE VANCE: Yeah.

00:55:16.590 --> 00:55:18.090
Say Elon is unique
in a couple ways.

00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:21.902
I mean, one, he
is-- to his credit,

00:55:21.902 --> 00:55:23.610
I mean, despite all
this stuff I've said,

00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:27.694
I mean, he's surprisingly down
to earth in many, many ways.

00:55:27.694 --> 00:55:28.860
I talk about it in the book.

00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:30.276
When he comes into
the restaurant,

00:55:30.276 --> 00:55:33.470
he's not I'm Elon coming
in the restaurant.

00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:35.470
It's just kind of like,
I'm walking to my table.

00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:38.620
He doesn't really expect
anyone to kind of notice him.

00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:40.300
Or he just doesn't care.

00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:45.110
And he never had
lots of handlers

00:55:45.110 --> 00:55:47.690
or it was always just--
Elon was just, deal with me.

00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:48.660
Let's just do this.

00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:54.322
And he was very earnest
and authentic when

00:55:54.322 --> 00:55:56.280
he was answering questions,
or at least putting

00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:59.640
a good effort forward.

00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:02.410
And then sort of the
180 part of that,

00:56:02.410 --> 00:56:05.700
though, is that intensity thing
we were talking about before.

00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:11.470
I mean, he is on a-- I think
I've met most of the major tech

00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:12.050
CEOs.

00:56:12.050 --> 00:56:17.204
And he's just like-- he's
just on a level of intensity

00:56:17.204 --> 00:56:18.120
beyond them, you know?

00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:22.630
I would say like the
Michael Jordan thing

00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:24.660
where we talked about it before.

00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:27.737
I mean, definitely does
not take no for an answer

00:56:27.737 --> 00:56:29.320
on a level that's
kind of frightening.

00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:32.969
And then is just relentless.

00:56:32.969 --> 00:56:35.260
There's a guy in the book
who says something about Elon

00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:39.700
will out-think you, out-hustle,
and there's one other part.

00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:41.490
But it's always the hustle part.

00:56:41.490 --> 00:56:44.680
He will do anything to win.

00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:47.840
When we were talking about
Lockheed and the other CEOs,

00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:50.530
that's the other part where
I feel sorry for them.

00:56:50.530 --> 00:56:52.219
You're just a guy
who's in a job.

00:56:52.219 --> 00:56:54.010
And you're trying to
run this company well.

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:57.570
And there's this maniac who's
like, I'm going to destroy you.

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:01.910
For him, it's war, right?

00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:06.400
And for these other guys, you're
a CEO running a major company.

00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:09.200
That's perfectly acceptable.

00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:10.840
And so, yeah, I
think for him, it's

00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:13.027
like everything is
a bit of a battle.

00:57:13.027 --> 00:57:13.860
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:16.090
And the last part,
though, is do you ever

00:57:16.090 --> 00:57:18.910
think it might have
a toll some day?

00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:22.840
ASHLEE VANCE: Yeah, I think
what I talked about, too,

00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:25.740
when you could see it on his
face, that he's clearly already

00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:27.120
has like a physical toll.

00:57:30.514 --> 00:57:32.180
There's a weird thing
that I've noticed,

00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:35.200
which is that as
time has gone on

00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:38.840
and he's done better and
better and made more money,

00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:41.340
you know the funny
thing, like SpaceX,

00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:46.214
Jeff Bezos had the luxury
of being filthy, filthy

00:57:46.214 --> 00:57:47.880
rich by the time he
started Blue Origin.

00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:49.780
He never had to turn
his space company

00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:51.510
into a for-profit enterprise.

00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:54.970
If he wants to go to Mars,
he can just go to Mars.

00:57:54.970 --> 00:57:57.090
Elon had made a lot of
money-- like $200 million--

00:57:57.090 --> 00:58:00.430
from Paypal, but not enough
to make a colony on Mars.

00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:04.549
So he had to make a
for-profit space company.

00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:05.840
MALE SPEAKER: He had to hustle.

00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:07.660
ASHLEE VANCE: Yeah,
he had to hustle.

00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:17.050
And so I think as the stuff
has started to pan out for him

00:58:17.050 --> 00:58:21.680
and he's made more money, it's
not like it's a relief for him.

00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:24.700
It's like now I'm going to
announce the hyper loop.

00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:28.030
Now I'm going to announce
the space internet.

00:58:28.030 --> 00:58:30.620
It's like it's always growing
and growing and growing.

00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:34.050
I think there's almost
like an addiction to doing.

00:58:34.050 --> 00:58:38.140
And I think he does enjoy
the Tony Stark sort of thing.

00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:41.590
I think he enjoys the
adoration of people.

00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:45.700
And so instead of it
being a moment to pause

00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:48.380
and just be the status
quo for a little bit,

00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:50.720
then use the money to just
advance the businesses,

00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:53.679
it's like, no, now we're going
to do the next crazy thing.

00:58:53.679 --> 00:58:54.970
And you see it with Tesla, too.

00:58:54.970 --> 00:58:57.260
I mean, he sort of has
to build the giga factory

00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:58.860
to get the batteries
down where he

00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:01.640
wants to get the
price of the car down.

00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:04.280
But it's like Tesla had
just hit this point.

00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:06.965
You made the best car the
automotive industry has ever

00:59:06.965 --> 00:59:07.465
seen.

00:59:07.465 --> 00:59:08.860
And the stock price
is doing well.

00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:10.276
You're turning a
profit sometimes.

00:59:10.276 --> 00:59:12.090
And it's like,
OK, now we're just

00:59:12.090 --> 00:59:13.506
going to take all the money.

00:59:13.506 --> 00:59:15.380
And then we're going to
raise $2 billion more

00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:18.530
and bet the company on this
battery factory the minute

00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:20.320
that happened.

00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:22.050
And so he's just relentless.

00:59:22.050 --> 00:59:23.200
MALE SPEAKER: Very cool.

00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:23.840
It's a fascinating read.

00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:25.180
That was fascinating
conversation.

00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:26.680
Thanks so much for
being here, Ashlee.

00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:28.138
ASHLEE VANCE: Thanks
for having me.

00:59:28.138 --> 00:59:30.030
