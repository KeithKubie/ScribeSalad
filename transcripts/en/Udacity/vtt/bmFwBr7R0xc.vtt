00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.350
Information theory has a very interesting history. Claude Shannon was

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.950
a genius mathematician who was working at Bell Labs who came

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.470
out with this information theory. He's also called as the father

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.590
of the information age. Why it is interesting, is because at

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.340
the time Bell Labs had a communication mechanism set up

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.720
and they had just figured out long distance communication, but they

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.570
had no idea how to charge people. So you could send

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.260
a message and they would charge you per message, or they

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.210
could find out how many words were in those message

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.800
and they would charge you per word, but none of

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.650
them made sense because you could sometimes write shorter sentences

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.335
and can be much more information. So it really became

00:00:37.335 --> 00:00:40.340
necessary to find out what is information and Shannon was

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.640
the first person to ever try to work on that

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.150
problem and figure something out. But information theory has also

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.460
a background from physics and that is why it has words

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.510
like entropy in it. The physicists who studied

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.680
thermodynamics were the first scientist to actually understood

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.290
information. If you are interested in learning more

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.600
about the physicists background of information theory, you should

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.490
read up on Maxwell's Demon. Maxwell's Demon is

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.720
a very famous part experiment that Maxwell came

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.810
out with. In physics we believe that energy

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.290
can neither be created or destroyed, but Maxwell's Demon

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.910
proves that energy can, can ordered into information

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.100
and the combination of energy and information can neither

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.380
be created or destroyed. But let's come back

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.840
to the big world and let's discuss how Claude

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.040
Shannon looked at it. So his task was

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.440
to send messages from one place to the other

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.940
and try to figure out which message has

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.990
more information. So, let's start with a simple example.
