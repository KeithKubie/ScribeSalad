00:00:06.586 --> 00:00:09.986
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Boss Level is this
unique space because it kind

00:00:09.986 --> 00:00:13.656
of like takes what we
normally do, it condenses it

00:00:13.656 --> 00:00:16.206
into this smaller package,
but it's like amplified.

00:00:16.706 --> 00:00:22.016
So during Boss Level, kids are met
with these challenges, multiple,

00:00:22.016 --> 00:00:24.156
multiple challenges every day.

00:00:24.396 --> 00:00:27.046
&gt;&gt;Student: For my Boss
Level I did with Kate is

00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:29.426
that I went to the MOMA with her.

00:00:29.426 --> 00:00:31.976
In that Boss Level, I was
able to prove my talent.

00:00:33.076 --> 00:00:35.096
&gt;&gt;Teacher: On three,
Bruce, say "Go Boss Level."

00:00:35.096 --> 00:00:36.936
Ready, one, two, three...

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:38.956
&gt;&gt;All: Go Boss Level.

00:00:48.536 --> 00:00:52.656
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I think if kids really
recognize what their teachers want

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:56.326
to teach them and want to expose them
to, that the sky's the limit in terms

00:00:56.326 --> 00:00:58.576
of what their future can hold.

00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:03.246
With Boss Level, I feel like the
teacher's really able to pick a topic

00:01:03.246 --> 00:01:05.856
that they are passionate
about and then use

00:01:05.856 --> 00:01:07.716
that passion to inspire the students.

00:01:08.206 --> 00:01:11.736
And because you have such a long
period of time to work on a project,

00:01:12.176 --> 00:01:15.876
it feels more satisfying
than even playing a game

00:01:15.876 --> 00:01:17.596
for two periods or two lessons.

00:01:17.676 --> 00:01:21.546
Like you're really spending five or
six periods a day with the same group

00:01:21.546 --> 00:01:25.856
of kids, really pushing them
towards this challenging goal

00:01:26.326 --> 00:01:31.536
and it allows the students to
really embody what an artist does

00:01:31.536 --> 00:01:33.416
or what a scientist
does or a fundraiser.

00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:36.066
And so that really is
a special experience.

00:01:36.356 --> 00:01:39.146
The students have to embody
the role of that individual

00:01:39.236 --> 00:01:40.646
to get to the end results.

00:01:40.856 --> 00:01:45.076
As opposed to, as a student, the end
result is prescribed by the teacher

00:01:45.076 --> 00:01:46.276
and defined by the teacher.

00:01:46.276 --> 00:01:49.046
They have to define the
end result for themselves.

00:01:49.216 --> 00:01:53.506
&gt;&gt;Student: Boss Level is like
where you get to show what you know

00:01:53.626 --> 00:01:59.346
from the past trimesters that you've
learned from your teachers and see

00:01:59.346 --> 00:02:06.556
if you can show that you
improved from the past months.

00:02:06.556 --> 00:02:09.266
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I think it's important for
the kids to be at MOMA first of all

00:02:09.336 --> 00:02:13.216
to be in the space and be two feet
in front of a Jackson Pollock.

00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:15.466
Like that's a sensory experience
that's really important.

00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:18.916
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The idea of learning
by doing is so important

00:02:19.236 --> 00:02:22.236
because we really believe
that in order for students

00:02:22.236 --> 00:02:25.556
to really understand something, like
to really deeply learn something,

00:02:25.556 --> 00:02:26.996
you have to do something with it.

00:02:27.096 --> 00:02:28.606
So it's not just about
learning something,

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:31.476
but it's about taking the information
and creating something out of it,

00:02:31.476 --> 00:02:32.846
or making something out of it.

00:02:33.156 --> 00:02:38.926
And so that kind of learning is
not limited to a classroom space,

00:02:38.926 --> 00:02:41.766
but it also happens
in a classroom space.

00:02:41.836 --> 00:02:46.376
&gt;&gt;Student: In MOMA, you can only look
at the art and you can't touch it,

00:02:46.506 --> 00:02:47.586
or you'll get in trouble.

00:02:48.096 --> 00:02:52.286
So we wanted to give
people the opportunity

00:02:53.126 --> 00:02:55.976
to touch and feel the art.

00:02:57.156 --> 00:02:58.826
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay, what should it be?

00:02:58.926 --> 00:03:03.026
I was thinking it would
be called Spa.

00:03:03.196 --> 00:03:04.256
We're going to walk them through it

00:03:04.256 --> 00:03:06.406
and then they're going
to say what they feel.

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:07.636
Let's say they feel rocks,
but it's actually dirt,

00:03:07.666 --> 00:03:09.316
we write down what we think and
then we show them the sheet of paper

00:03:09.346 --> 00:03:10.976
of all the things they touched.

00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:14.136
&gt;&gt;Woman: Ew!

00:03:15.456 --> 00:03:16.826
&gt;&gt;Student: Don't kill it.

00:03:18.536 --> 00:03:18.966
&gt;&gt;Woman: Is it bagels?

00:03:19.386 --> 00:03:20.696
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.976
[laughs]

00:03:22.126 --> 00:03:24.000
&gt;&gt;Student: I think
embodied learning means

00:03:24.156 --> 00:03:25.516
that like you learn
but with your senses.

00:03:25.516 --> 00:03:29.626
So like touch, feel, look, and yeah.

00:03:29.846 --> 00:03:32.116
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Because you're not
in a classroom, what you expect

00:03:32.316 --> 00:03:34.306
to happen can be totally open.

00:03:34.426 --> 00:03:39.936
It lets you access your creativity
in a way that's different from being

00:03:39.936 --> 00:03:40.946
in a place that you're always in.

00:03:42.156 --> 00:03:44.896
&gt;&gt;Teacher: He keeps saying,
"Oh it's fine, it's fine."

00:03:44.896 --> 00:03:45.446
&gt;&gt;Student: No, it's fine.

00:03:45.446 --> 00:03:47.296
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Really, I don't know,
I don't think I believe you.

00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:48.976
I think there's a catch here, because
there's been a catch in all of these.

00:03:50.316 --> 00:03:53.836
&gt;&gt;Teacher: My students can always
count on me to support them

00:03:53.926 --> 00:03:57.726
in being successful in life,
not just in seventh grade.

00:03:58.016 --> 00:04:02.076
And for their future
lives, not just a state test

00:04:02.076 --> 00:04:04.996
or some sort of end assessment.

00:04:05.056 --> 00:04:09.646
I want them to feel like they can
achieve whatever goal they want

00:04:09.646 --> 00:04:12.006
to achieve and I'll always
support them in that.

00:04:12.006 --> 00:04:14.916
And I think sometimes holding them
to high standards, which can seem

00:04:14.916 --> 00:04:18.066
like being a strict
teacher, is actually sort

00:04:18.066 --> 00:04:19.216
of helping them in the long run.

00:04:19.216 --> 00:04:20.066
And I think it takes--

00:04:20.456 --> 00:04:22.486
for my students, I think it
takes them a little while

00:04:22.546 --> 00:04:24.456
to recognize that, and
I think when they do,

00:04:24.886 --> 00:04:27.516
that it's a really nice
relationship that's formed

00:04:27.516 --> 00:04:29.906
and hopefully continues
over the years.
