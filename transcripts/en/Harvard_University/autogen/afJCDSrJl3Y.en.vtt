in the SU to very small country we could
 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.629
in the SU to very small country we could
make some impact or is it better to

so I felt that we needed some framework

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:09.460
so I felt that we needed some framework
 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.329
so I felt that we needed some framework
of thinking about these things and only

00:07:12.329 --> 00:07:12.339
of thinking about these things and only
 

00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:15.540
of thinking about these things and only
as a guide because the the confidence in

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:15.550
as a guide because the the confidence in

precise estimates has to be somewhat

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:17.949
precise estimates has to be somewhat
 

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:20.550
precise estimates has to be somewhat
guarded so we started to think about

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560
guarded so we started to think about
 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.519
guarded so we started to think about
just the common measures things like

00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:23.529
just the common measures things like
 

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:25.950

a new vaccine and then also building and
 

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:36.600

of course because we live in this

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:36.610
of course because we live in this
 

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.550

cost-effectiveness so how much would it
 

00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:43.950

cost and we took as our measure bed nets

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:43.960

reducing HIV transmission which is
 

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.649
reducing HIV transmission which is
actually cost saving so we took two

00:07:55.649 --> 00:07:55.659
actually cost saving so we took two
 

00:07:55.659 --> 00:07:58.019
actually cost saving so we took two

everybody would agree are useful very

00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:01.149
everybody would agree are useful very
 

00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:03.570
everybody would agree are useful very
useful interventions and then we put

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:03.580
useful interventions and then we put
 

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:04.920
useful interventions and then we put
them across the rest of the portfolio

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:04.930
them across the rest of the portfolio
 

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:06.829

very quickly you know some things did

00:08:11.309 --> 00:08:11.319
very quickly you know some things did
 

00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:14.369
very quickly you know some things did
fall out so you know and they were very

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:14.379
fall out so you know and they were very
 

00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:16.529
fall out so you know and they were very
positive project in some ways but we had

00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:16.539
positive project in some ways but we had
 

00:08:16.539 --> 00:08:18.719
positive project in some ways but we had
a look at them very carefully we looked

00:08:18.719 --> 00:08:18.729
a look at them very carefully we looked
 

00:08:18.729 --> 00:08:20.700
a look at them very carefully we looked
at for instance where would a hookworm

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:20.710
at for instance where would a hookworm
 

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:23.610

that on our portfolio great I think it's

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:00.190
that on our portfolio great I think it's
 

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:02.640
that on our portfolio great I think it's
very interesting and I think perhaps one

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:02.650
very interesting and I think perhaps one
 

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:05.760

of the other things too to comment on is

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:05.770
of the other things too to comment on is
 

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.790

how you see global health evolving in

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800
how you see global health evolving in

Gates when they announced in 2007 and a
 

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.960
Gates when they announced in 2007 and a
meeting that they'd convened that they

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:30.970
meeting that they'd convened that they
 

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.330
meeting that they'd convened that they
were calling for the eradication of

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:33.340
were calling for the eradication of
 

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.370
were calling for the eradication of
malaria and of course there I was as a

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:35.380
malaria and of course there I was as a
 

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.220

basic scientist saying really the

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:38.230
basic scientist saying really the
 

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:40.230
basic scientist saying really the
eradication of malaria we've tried this

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:40.240
eradication of malaria we've tried this
 

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.560
eradication of malaria we've tried this
once um does it does it really make

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:43.570
once um does it does it really make
 

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.930
once um does it does it really make
sense but i think that is led to a

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:45.940
sense but i think that is led to a
 

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.270
sense but i think that is led to a
paradigm shift in the field that that

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:48.280
paradigm shift in the field that that
 

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.490
paradigm shift in the field that that
we're at least thinking about how to

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:50.500
we're at least thinking about how to
 

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.800
we're at least thinking about how to
eradicate malaria and what it would take

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:52.810
eradicate malaria and what it would take
 

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:55.380
eradicate malaria and what it would take
what are the various steps and i'm

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:55.390
what are the various steps and i'm
 

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.980
what are the various steps and i'm
wondering in terms of that so that was

00:09:58.980 --> 00:09:58.990
wondering in terms of that so that was
 

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.420
wondering in terms of that so that was
considered at least in the malaria field

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:00.430
considered at least in the malaria field
 

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.060
considered at least in the malaria field
a very bold step at the time and the

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:03.070
a very bold step at the time and the
 

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:06.030
a very bold step at the time and the
question is how do you think global

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:06.040
question is how do you think global
 

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.370
question is how do you think global
health thinking is evolving as we speak

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:08.380
health thinking is evolving as we speak
 

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.100
health thinking is evolving as we speak
today are there such dramatic changes in

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:11.110
today are there such dramatic changes in
 

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:14.850
today are there such dramatic changes in
other areas no Diane I think actually

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:14.860
other areas no Diane I think actually
 

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.370
other areas no Diane I think actually
you you really on track with your

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:17.380
you you really on track with your
 

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.990
you you really on track with your
comments over there so to the extent

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:19.000
comments over there so to the extent
 

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.170
comments over there so to the extent
that if one looks back over the last

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:22.180
that if one looks back over the last
 

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.240
that if one looks back over the last
couple of decades in the health care

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:24.250
couple of decades in the health care
 

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.730
couple of decades in the health care
sector in general but in global health

in particular there been elements of

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920
in particular there been elements of
 

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.590
in particular there been elements of
pessimism that anything could be done

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600
pessimism that anything could be done
 

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.010
pessimism that anything could be done
because the infrastructure and the

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:35.020
because the infrastructure and the
 

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.870
because the infrastructure and the
situation in many of the region's that

we are most interested in would be so

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:39.220
we are most interested in would be so
 

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.480
we are most interested in would be so
difficult to work in or they would be

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:42.490
difficult to work in or they would be
 

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.150

sort of millennial thinking about as

so there was either the sort of

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:00.510
so there was either the sort of
 

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:01.940
so there was either the sort of
fantastical thinking or there was

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:01.950
fantastical thinking or there was
 

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:04.340

extreme pessimism and and what I've seen

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:04.350
extreme pessimism and and what I've seen
 

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:06.620

is people now starting to roll up their

going the next step of saying and now
 

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.570
going the next step of saying and now
what are the practical plans whereby

that it goes both ways I've learnt a

that it goes both ways I've learnt a
 

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.570
that it goes both ways I've learnt a
fantastic amount from you know the

put a very different perspective and in
 

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:24.700
put a very different perspective and in
some ways some of the problems a little

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:24.710
some ways some of the problems a little
 

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.620
some ways some of the problems a little
bit more complex but certainly I think

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:26.630
bit more complex but certainly I think
 

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:28.720

for-profit sector of course you've got

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:33.860
for-profit sector of course you've got
 

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.590
for-profit sector of course you've got
some fairly simple measures of your

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600
some fairly simple measures of your
 

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.450
some fairly simple measures of your
portfolio you can look at its value its

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:37.460
portfolio you can look at its value its
 

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.630
portfolio you can look at its value its
economic value and things that you do to

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:40.640
economic value and things that you do to
 

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.970

very difficult thing when you're

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:18.570
of the places Uganda or the Democratic
 

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:20.470
of the places Uganda or the Democratic
Republic of Congo where they are being

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480
Republic of Congo where they are being
 

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.960
Republic of Congo where they are being
more frequent Ebola outbreaks even

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:23.970
more frequent Ebola outbreaks even
 

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:25.639
more frequent Ebola outbreaks even
though some of the infrastructure they

00:20:25.639 --> 00:20:25.649
though some of the infrastructure they
 

00:20:25.649 --> 00:20:28.039
though some of the infrastructure they
may not be fantastic have been able to

00:20:28.039 --> 00:20:28.049
may not be fantastic have been able to
 

00:20:28.049 --> 00:20:29.899
may not be fantastic have been able to
certainly have been adequate to dealing

00:20:29.899 --> 00:20:29.909
certainly have been adequate to dealing
 

00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:32.960
certainly have been adequate to dealing
with the problem it just re emphasizes

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:32.970
with the problem it just re emphasizes
 

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:35.269
with the problem it just re emphasizes
for us that you know whatever we could

00:20:35.269 --> 00:20:35.279
for us that you know whatever we could
 

00:20:35.279 --> 00:20:38.509
for us that you know whatever we could
do on the treatment side let's say and I

00:20:38.509 --> 00:20:38.519
do on the treatment side let's say and I
 

00:20:38.519 --> 00:20:39.889
do on the treatment side let's say and I
think I'm pretty hopeful we're going to

00:20:39.889 --> 00:20:39.899
think I'm pretty hopeful we're going to
 

00:20:39.899 --> 00:20:41.600
think I'm pretty hopeful we're going to
come up with some effective therapies

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:41.610
come up with some effective therapies
 

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:44.570
come up with some effective therapies
out of this situation whether it be the

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:44.580
out of this situation whether it be the
 

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:46.789
out of this situation whether it be the
antibody or even drug therapies and

00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799
antibody or even drug therapies and
 

00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:48.919
antibody or even drug therapies and
we'll see about a vaccine but things

00:20:48.919 --> 00:20:48.929
we'll see about a vaccine but things
 

00:20:48.929 --> 00:20:50.600
we'll see about a vaccine but things
that would need to be delivered by

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:50.610
that would need to be delivered by
 

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:55.399
that would need to be delivered by
people in a decent care setting without

00:20:55.399 --> 00:20:55.409
people in a decent care setting without
 

00:20:55.409 --> 00:20:58.340
people in a decent care setting without
that being in place we can have you know

00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:58.350
that being in place we can have you know
 

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:01.399
that being in place we can have you know
the antibody or the Magic Bullet drug

00:21:01.399 --> 00:21:01.409
the antibody or the Magic Bullet drug
 

00:21:01.409 --> 00:21:04.850
the antibody or the Magic Bullet drug
but being able to deliver that is going

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:04.860
but being able to deliver that is going
 

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.440
but being able to deliver that is going
to be the final frontier and the

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:06.450
to be the final frontier and the
 

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:08.330
to be the final frontier and the
obstacle so I think that we are very

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:08.340
obstacle so I think that we are very
 

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.310
obstacle so I think that we are very
focused on on that none it's a bit of a

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320
focused on on that none it's a bit of a
 

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:16.369
focused on on that none it's a bit of a
wake-up call another question that that

00:21:16.369 --> 00:21:16.379
wake-up call another question that that
 

00:21:16.379 --> 00:21:18.470
wake-up call another question that that
comes up not just about global health

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480
comes up not just about global health
 

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.310
comes up not just about global health
but but it does come up about how the

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:21.320
but but it does come up about how the
 

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.830
but but it does come up about how the
research you know industry how the

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:24.840
research you know industry how the
 

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.649
research you know industry how the
research infrastructure is funded in the

00:21:27.649 --> 00:21:27.659
research infrastructure is funded in the
 

00:21:27.659 --> 00:21:30.739
research infrastructure is funded in the
US and and I think for many students and

00:21:30.739 --> 00:21:30.749
US and and I think for many students and
 

00:21:30.749 --> 00:21:33.080
US and and I think for many students and
fellows now they're looking at the NIH

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:33.090
fellows now they're looking at the NIH
 

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:36.049
fellows now they're looking at the NIH
budget as being flat or even going down

00:21:36.049 --> 00:21:36.059
budget as being flat or even going down
 

00:21:36.059 --> 00:21:38.450
budget as being flat or even going down
in real dollars and that's really been

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:38.460
in real dollars and that's really been
 

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.519
in real dollars and that's really been
the place that the vast majority of

00:21:40.519 --> 00:21:40.529
the place that the vast majority of
 

00:21:40.529 --> 00:21:42.499
the place that the vast majority of
fundamental research in the United

00:21:42.499 --> 00:21:42.509
fundamental research in the United
 

00:21:42.509 --> 00:21:45.710
fundamental research in the United
States and has been funded over since

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:45.720
States and has been funded over since
 

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.960
States and has been funded over since
the the you know since the middle of the

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:47.970
the the you know since the middle of the
 

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:51.470
the the you know since the middle of the
last century and I think many of us see

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:51.480
last century and I think many of us see
 

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.440
last century and I think many of us see
that that situation may be permanently

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:54.450
that that situation may be permanently
 

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:56.629
that that situation may be permanently
changed there's there's really a change

00:21:56.629 --> 00:21:56.639
changed there's there's really a change
 

00:21:56.639 --> 00:21:57.690
changed there's there's really a change
and I'm wondering

00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:57.700
and I'm wondering
 

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:02.039
and I'm wondering
how you from the foundation side think

00:22:02.039 --> 00:22:02.049
how you from the foundation side think
 

00:22:02.049 --> 00:22:05.610
how you from the foundation side think
about that problem and what kinds of

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:05.620
about that problem and what kinds of
 

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.730
about that problem and what kinds of
things uh foundations like the Gates

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:08.740
things uh foundations like the Gates
 

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:13.799
things uh foundations like the Gates
Foundation can do to help you know help

00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:13.809
Foundation can do to help you know help
 

00:22:13.809 --> 00:22:16.139
Foundation can do to help you know help
advocate for additional government

00:22:16.139 --> 00:22:16.149
advocate for additional government
 

00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:18.240
advocate for additional government
funding I think that even with the

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:18.250
funding I think that even with the
 

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:19.919
funding I think that even with the
vastness of the Gates Foundation the

00:22:19.919 --> 00:22:19.929
vastness of the Gates Foundation the
 

00:22:19.929 --> 00:22:22.350
vastness of the Gates Foundation the
federal government still the research

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:22.360
federal government still the research
 

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.509
federal government still the research
infrastructure and the research the

scientific infrastructure and the
 

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.629
scientific infrastructure and the
federal government is still of course

00:22:27.629 --> 00:22:27.639
federal government is still of course
 

00:22:27.639 --> 00:22:31.259
federal government is still of course

what we were doing so there would be

00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760
what we were doing so there would be
 

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.419
what we were doing so there would be
complementarity and not redundancy and

00:23:02.419 --> 00:23:02.429
complementarity and not redundancy and
 

00:23:02.429 --> 00:23:05.730

it occurs in two areas one was and this

it occurs in two areas one was and this
is in the global health area now I would

00:23:07.649 --> 00:23:07.659
is in the global health area now I would
 

00:23:07.659 --> 00:23:09.899
is in the global health area now I would
say that you know why exactly with the

00:23:09.899 --> 00:23:09.909
say that you know why exactly with the
 

00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:12.539
say that you know why exactly with the
NIH be in global health Ebola is a great

00:23:12.539 --> 00:23:12.549
NIH be in global health Ebola is a great
 

00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:15.210
NIH be in global health Ebola is a great
example of why it actually is important

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:15.220
example of why it actually is important
 

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.060
example of why it actually is important
to be engaged in global health but to

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:18.070
to be engaged in global health but to
 

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:21.600
to be engaged in global health but to
the extent that we got two big funders

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:21.610
the extent that we got two big funders
 

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:23.190
the extent that we got two big funders
probably the two biggest funders of the

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200
probably the two biggest funders of the
 

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.519
probably the two biggest funders of the
global health research agenda we had no

00:23:26.519 --> 00:23:26.529
global health research agenda we had no
 

00:23:26.529 --> 00:23:28.139
global health research agenda we had no
notions of what our respective

00:23:28.139 --> 00:23:28.149
notions of what our respective
 

00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:29.610
notions of what our respective
portfolios were and whether there was

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:29.620
portfolios were and whether there was
 

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.259
portfolios were and whether there was
redundancy whether we were potentially

00:23:33.629 --> 00:23:33.639
funding the same people hopefully not
 

00:23:33.639 --> 00:23:35.940
funding the same people hopefully not
for the same activities but we didn't

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:35.950
for the same activities but we didn't
 

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:37.409
for the same activities but we didn't
know that and I think that we have now a

00:23:37.409 --> 00:23:37.419
know that and I think that we have now a
 

00:23:37.419 --> 00:23:38.879
know that and I think that we have now a
good sense of that we had that process

00:23:38.879 --> 00:23:38.889
good sense of that we had that process
 

00:23:38.889 --> 00:23:41.159
good sense of that we had that process
the other thing is that as much as we

00:23:41.159 --> 00:23:41.169
the other thing is that as much as we
 

00:23:41.169 --> 00:23:44.279
the other thing is that as much as we

there was such an example who funds that
 

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:04.560
there was such an example who funds that
and that's one of the things that we

sort of the crazy stuff and we've seen
 

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:18.490
sort of the crazy stuff and we've seen
actually now some great examples of

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:18.500
actually now some great examples of
 

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.410
actually now some great examples of
interesting things coming out of that so

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:20.420
interesting things coming out of that so
 

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:22.060
interesting things coming out of that so
that sort of complements the NIH and

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:22.070
that sort of complements the NIH and
 

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:23.590
that sort of complements the NIH and
they're probably the NIH would would not

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600
they're probably the NIH would would not
 

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:29.200
they're probably the NIH would would not

audience how have you dealt with the
challenges of our stable financial and

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:35.990
challenges of our stable financial and

and as you may know many of our students

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:40.550
and as you may know many of our students
 

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:41.770
and as you may know many of our students
are going to work in the nonprofit

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:41.780
are going to work in the nonprofit
 

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:44.650
are going to work in the nonprofit
sector so how would you suggest students

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:44.660
sector so how would you suggest students
 

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.990
sector so how would you suggest students
going into the nonprofit sector think

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:47.000
going into the nonprofit sector think
 

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.940
going into the nonprofit sector think
about funding challenges in their own

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:48.950
about funding challenges in their own
 

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:53.230
about funding challenges in their own
organizations thank you well you know

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:53.240
organizations thank you well you know
 

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.919
organizations thank you well you know
they clearly has been a constrained

00:24:55.919 --> 00:24:55.929
they clearly has been a constrained
 

00:24:55.929 --> 00:24:58.299
they clearly has been a constrained
funding source for for global health

00:24:58.299 --> 00:24:58.309
funding source for for global health
 

00:24:58.309 --> 00:25:00.910
funding source for for global health
which has been tied up with the larger

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:00.920
which has been tied up with the larger
 

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.440
which has been tied up with the larger
trends that we've talked about over here

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:02.450
trends that we've talked about over here
 

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:03.820
trends that we've talked about over here
so I wouldn't say that global health was

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:03.830
so I wouldn't say that global health was
 

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:06.040
so I wouldn't say that global health was
uniquely targeted but it does seem that

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:06.050
uniquely targeted but it does seem that
 

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:07.450
uniquely targeted but it does seem that
in some cases when people are

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:07.460
in some cases when people are
 

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.700
in some cases when people are
considering you know overseas direct

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:09.710
considering you know overseas direct
 

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:11.680

investments and the like that it comes

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:11.690
investments and the like that it comes
 

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:14.830
investments and the like that it comes
up as in in some countries in some

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:14.840
up as in in some countries in some
 

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.140
up as in in some countries in some
settings as one of the first things that

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:17.150
settings as one of the first things that
 

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:20.500
settings as one of the first things that
suggest that as might be something that

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:20.510
suggest that as might be something that
 

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.240
suggest that as might be something that
could be cut from from from the budgets

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:22.250
could be cut from from from the budgets
 

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:24.250
could be cut from from from the budgets
so we've seen our partners and

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:24.260

sources their diversified funding
 

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:36.760
sources their diversified funding
sources are pretty much shrunk and in

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:36.770
sources are pretty much shrunk and in
 

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:38.290
sources are pretty much shrunk and in
some cases we've become the major

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:38.300
some cases we've become the major
 

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:41.169
some cases we've become the major
funders of organizations that used to

00:25:41.169 --> 00:25:41.179
funders of organizations that used to
 

00:25:41.179 --> 00:25:43.330
funders of organizations that used to
have fifty plus percent of the funding

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:43.340
have fifty plus percent of the funding
 

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:46.450
have fifty plus percent of the funding
from a diversity of sources at that

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:46.460
from a diversity of sources at that
 

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:48.850
from a diversity of sources at that
that's a huge challenge for those

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:48.860
that's a huge challenge for those
 

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.620
that's a huge challenge for those
organizations because we would like them

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:50.630
organizations because we would like them
 

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:52.710
organizations because we would like them
to be independent and to have this

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720
to be independent and to have this
 

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:56.130
to be independent and to have this
diversity of funding so it's

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:56.140
diversity of funding so it's
 

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.480
diversity of funding so it's
necessitated a number of sort of hard

00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:58.490
necessitated a number of sort of hard
 

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:01.750
necessitated a number of sort of hard
discussions in terms of you know is this

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760
discussions in terms of you know is this
 

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.169
discussions in terms of you know is this
entity viable do we go forward with us

00:26:04.169 --> 00:26:04.179
entity viable do we go forward with us
 

00:26:04.179 --> 00:26:07.780

are the other ways that that we could do
 

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:12.100
are the other ways that that we could do
this kind of work in terms of somebody

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:12.110
this kind of work in terms of somebody
 

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:15.160
this kind of work in terms of somebody
going into the philanthropic or the

going into the philanthropic or the
 

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:17.260
going into the philanthropic or the
not-for-profit sector now with the

not-for-profit sector now with the
 

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:21.850
not-for-profit sector now with the
funding constraints that exist I I

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:21.860
funding constraints that exist I I
 

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.190
funding constraints that exist I I
wouldn't be totally pessimist

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:24.200
wouldn't be totally pessimist
 

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.060
wouldn't be totally pessimist
I think that some of the trends

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:27.070
I think that some of the trends
 

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:30.399
I think that some of the trends
particularly from philanthropy and the

00:26:30.399 --> 00:26:30.409
particularly from philanthropy and the
 

00:26:30.409 --> 00:26:32.590
particularly from philanthropy and the
way that we saw some philanthropists

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:32.600
way that we saw some philanthropists
 

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:37.200
way that we saw some philanthropists
drawn into the Ebola crisis you know

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:37.210
drawn into the Ebola crisis you know
 

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:39.430

types of investments they've made at
 

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:47.560
types of investments they've made at
this kind of level that that being very

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:47.570
this kind of level that that being very
 

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:49.779
this kind of level that that being very
exciting and I think that that we just

00:26:49.779 --> 00:26:49.789
exciting and I think that that we just
 

00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:51.129
exciting and I think that that we just
have to think of ways of translating

00:26:51.129 --> 00:26:51.139
have to think of ways of translating
 

00:26:51.139 --> 00:26:53.680
have to think of ways of translating
some of that funding it's always easy in

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:53.690
some of that funding it's always easy in
 

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:56.710
some of that funding it's always easy in
some ways to get funding for an acute

some ways to get funding for an acute
 

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.720
some ways to get funding for an acute
crisis that everybody knows and there's

00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:58.730
crisis that everybody knows and there's
 

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:00.970
crisis that everybody knows and there's
on the front pages of the newspaper but

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:00.980
on the front pages of the newspaper but
 

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.519
on the front pages of the newspaper but
how do we and this has been one of the

00:27:03.519 --> 00:27:03.529
how do we and this has been one of the
 

00:27:03.529 --> 00:27:05.769
how do we and this has been one of the
things that I found most remarkable we

00:27:05.769 --> 00:27:05.779
things that I found most remarkable we
 

00:27:05.779 --> 00:27:08.169
things that I found most remarkable we
have crises you know which are of a

00:27:08.169 --> 00:27:08.179
have crises you know which are of a
 

00:27:08.179 --> 00:27:10.389
have crises you know which are of a
greater dimension than Ebola going on

00:27:10.389 --> 00:27:10.399
greater dimension than Ebola going on
 

00:27:10.399 --> 00:27:12.610
greater dimension than Ebola going on
every day in the countries in which we

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:12.620
every day in the countries in which we
 

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:15.430
every day in the countries in which we
work how do we get the this border group

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440
work how do we get the this border group
 

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:19.149
work how do we get the this border group
of philanthropists now to know about and

00:27:19.149 --> 00:27:19.159
of philanthropists now to know about and
 

00:27:19.159 --> 00:27:20.799
of philanthropists now to know about and
actually to participate in that kind of

actually to participate in that kind of
 

00:27:20.809 --> 00:27:23.019
actually to participate in that kind of
funny that's a vast untapped source of

00:27:23.019 --> 00:27:23.029
funny that's a vast untapped source of
 

00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:25.659
funny that's a vast untapped source of
funding bet I think maybe leading on

00:27:25.659 --> 00:27:25.669
funding bet I think maybe leading on
 

00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:27.490
funding bet I think maybe leading on
from Ebola and one of the lessons we've

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:27.500
from Ebola and one of the lessons we've
 

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:32.019
from Ebola and one of the lessons we've
learned we can actually tap into very

00:27:32.019 --> 00:27:32.029
learned we can actually tap into very
 

00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:33.639

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:23.760
berry thanks for the question it is a

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:23.770
berry thanks for the question it is a
 

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:25.470
berry thanks for the question it is a
difficult question and we've looked at

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:25.480
difficult question and we've looked at
 

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.870
difficult question and we've looked at
this quite hard because there's the

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:27.880
this quite hard because there's the
 

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.230
this quite hard because there's the
element of training of people from

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240
element of training of people from
 

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:34.110
element of training of people from
developing countries and that is

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:34.120
developing countries and that is
 

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.750
developing countries and that is
absolutely critical there's also the

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:36.760
absolutely critical there's also the
 

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.720
absolutely critical there's also the
element of developing an infrastructure

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:39.730
element of developing an infrastructure
 

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:41.010
element of developing an infrastructure
in those countries so that the train

people will have a good home to return
to and will be excited to go back and

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:45.820
to and will be excited to go back and
 

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:47.820
to and will be excited to go back and
work in their countries and have the

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:47.830
work in their countries and have the
 

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:49.830
work in their countries and have the
kinds of opportunities that they would

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:49.840
kinds of opportunities that they would
 

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.930
kinds of opportunities that they would
like over there and I've been very

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:51.940
like over there and I've been very
 

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.600
like over there and I've been very
focused on and at least in the global

00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:56.020
health perspective focused on that
 

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.860
health perspective focused on that
aspect of the training question so what

00:28:58.860 --> 00:28:58.870
aspect of the training question so what
 

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:01.170
aspect of the training question so what
happens in some ways after training and

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:01.180
happens in some ways after training and
 

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:03.480
happens in some ways after training and
I think that would also enrich the pool

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:03.490
I think that would also enrich the pool
 

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:05.880
I think that would also enrich the pool
of people who are really applicants for

about ecowas in West Africa also going
in that direction so we are very

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:05.830
in that direction so we are very
 

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:07.680
in that direction so we are very
supportive of that that harmonization

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:07.690
supportive of that that harmonization
 

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:10.290
supportive of that that harmonization
from the perspective that we can then

from the perspective that we can then
have very good local decision-making

that will drive action I think that that

that will drive action I think that that
 

00:34:18.490 --> 00:34:21.480
that will drive action I think that that

what do we do with this we've been a big

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:10.730
what do we do with this we've been a big
 

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:13.930
what do we do with this we've been a big
source of the generation of healthcare

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:13.940
source of the generation of healthcare
 

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:16.930
source of the generation of healthcare
data but we've certainly not solved the

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:16.940
data but we've certainly not solved the
 

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.430
data but we've certainly not solved the
problem of the fact that that data is

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:18.440
problem of the fact that that data is
 

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:21.430
problem of the fact that that data is
siloed it's an archipelago of data out

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440
siloed it's an archipelago of data out
 

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:24.160
siloed it's an archipelago of data out
there of little data islands that

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:24.170
there of little data islands that
 

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:26.440
there of little data islands that
persist for certain periods of time and

persist for certain periods of time and
 

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:29.440
persist for certain periods of time and
there's no integration around that so in

there's no integration around that so in
 

00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:32.230
there's no integration around that so in

step so we need an integrative layer we

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:50.660
step so we need an integrative layer we
 

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:53.049
step so we need an integrative layer we
need a model in between which distills

need a model in between which distills
 

00:40:53.059 --> 00:40:55.180
need a model in between which distills
the data in some rational way whether it

say look we've got this data this is
 

00:41:13.369 --> 00:41:15.460
say look we've got this data this is
what it's telling us that let me show

what it's telling us that let me show
 

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:18.190
what it's telling us that let me show
you what it's like and that's a little

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:18.200
you what it's like and that's a little
 

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:20.289
you what it's like and that's a little
bit around what we're going to talk

00:41:20.289 --> 00:41:20.299
bit around what we're going to talk
 

00:41:20.299 --> 00:41:22.480

about at the session at least for part
 

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:24.730
about at the session at least for part
of the session and we're thinking about

of the session and we're thinking about
 

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:26.710
of the session and we're thinking about
ways of you know bringing this back to

ways of you know bringing this back to
 

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:29.109
ways of you know bringing this back to
individual people and we're thinking of

00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119
individual people and we're thinking of
 

00:41:29.119 --> 00:41:31.870
individual people and we're thinking of

a young girl and

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:36.390
a young girl and
 

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:38.720
a young girl and
you know what would the health care

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:38.730
you know what would the health care
 

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:40.849
you know what would the health care
system elements be the Chi confronted

00:41:40.849 --> 00:41:40.859

00:41:42.599 --> 00:41:45.319
not being seen by the health care system
and at home delivery what would her

00:41:45.319 --> 00:41:45.329
and at home delivery what would her
 

00:41:45.329 --> 00:41:48.319

and that's the sort of narrative arc we

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:50.130
and that's the sort of narrative arc we
 

00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:52.009
and that's the sort of narrative arc we
think about in that future world it's

so some countries are not even fortunate
to have the primary data so you don't

which are great in exactly the places
 

00:44:04.199 --> 00:44:06.849
which are great in exactly the places
where we don't have the data so our

00:44:06.849 --> 00:44:06.859
where we don't have the data so our
 

00:44:06.859 --> 00:44:09.919
where we don't have the data so our
drive over here would be not to be

00:44:09.919 --> 00:44:09.929
drive over here would be not to be
 

00:44:09.929 --> 00:44:11.809
drive over here would be not to be
redundant with the existing networks but

00:44:11.809 --> 00:44:11.819
redundant with the existing networks but
 

00:44:11.819 --> 00:44:13.549
redundant with the existing networks but
actually to think about putting these

00:44:13.549 --> 00:44:13.559
actually to think about putting these
 

00:44:13.559 --> 00:44:16.819

prepared to do that and to handle this
 

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:03.829

Foundation would put probably in the
next few years or so we've certainly

00:45:31.549 --> 00:45:31.559
next few years or so we've certainly
 

00:45:31.559 --> 00:45:34.429
next few years or so we've certainly
been very significant supporters of this

00:45:34.429 --> 00:45:34.439
been very significant supporters of this

almost in the developed countries as it

to fix and not such an easy one we often

00:46:00.439 --> 00:46:00.449
to fix and not such an easy one we often
 

00:46:00.449 --> 00:46:01.860
to fix and not such an easy one we often
get the question

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:01.870
get the question
 

00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:03.990
get the question
in terms of why would we have a

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000
in terms of why would we have a
 

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.090

element of the disease burden even in
 

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:16.920
element of the disease burden even in
developing countries I think that for

developing countries I think that for
 

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:19.500
developing countries I think that for
now at least when we look at the poorest

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:19.510
now at least when we look at the poorest
 

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:21.900
now at least when we look at the poorest
countries in the world it remains the

there infectious disease is a huge and

there infectious disease is a huge and
unsolved problem for them so we more of

first when we have you know got to a
 

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:47.820
first when we have you know got to a
certain point in that then we would have

00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:47.830
certain point in that then we would have
 

00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:49.950
certain point in that then we would have
to come back to this this issue of a

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:49.960
to come back to this this issue of a
 

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:53.160
to come back to this this issue of a
more rational allocation to the entities

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:53.170
more rational allocation to the entities

we're going to ask you to perhaps a
 

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:14.730
we're going to ask you to perhaps a
couple of takeaway messages for the

couple of takeaway messages for the

what I see across the world in terms of

the many global health groups that I
 

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:37.740
the many global health groups that I
meet with and actually many of these

00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:37.750
meet with and actually many of these
 

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:39.540

yourselves the only thing that I can
 

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:45.330
yourselves the only thing that I can
think about is that I was crazy not to

think about is that I was crazy not to
 

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:48.240

have done what I'm doing now 20 years
 

00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:51.990
have done what I'm doing now 20 years
ago so in terms of whether this is a

ago so in terms of whether this is a
 

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.390
ago so in terms of whether this is a
positive world to enter into or it's
