00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.240
So now let's talk about Markov Models.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.970
And my apologies if you already
know what Markov Models are,

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.880
because we're going to go through this
a little bit, then move into HMMs and

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.360
maybe that'll be new for you.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.770
And if it's not, you can just write in a
postcard telling me that you're unhappy.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.130
Send it to Megan.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.720
All right.
We're going to pretend for

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.480
the moment that weather, as in
the weather outside is a Markov Model.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.770
And if it were,

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.910
I'll also pretend that there's only
three types of weather you could have.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.880
You could have a sunny day,
a rainy day, or a snowy day.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.540
It's kind of like a little kid's book.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.580
And the Markov Model says
we have to specify, for

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.790
any given one of these,
what's the likely next day going to be?

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.080
So for example, suppose I tell you that
if it's sunny today there's an 80%

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.430
chance that it'll be sunny tomorrow,

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.850
15 that it'll be rainy,
5% that it'll be snowy.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.170
Likewise if it's rainy,

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.240
I may tell you well there's a 60%
chance that it'll rain tomorrow,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.340
if it's raining today there's only
a 2% chance that it'll be snowy.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.170
So it's a place that gets very cold so,
so once it's rainy,

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.728
when it's rainy it's not going to
snow and vice versa maybe.

00:01:03.728 --> 00:01:09.920
And 38% of it will be sunny,
and likewise, if it's snowing

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.890
there's a 20% chance that it'll keep
snowing, 75% chance that it'll be sunny,

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.100
and for the same reason before,
very unlikely that it'll rain.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.210
This is referred to as
a Markovian system.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.320
And in particular, if the only thing
you need to know to make a prediction

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.170
about what the weather tomorrow will be,
is what the weather today is,

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.090
that's referred to as a 1st
Order Markovian System.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.070
So I don't look at today, and
yesterday, and the day before.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.400
I'm just looking at today in order
to make a prediction about tomorrow.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.642
If I was looking at today and yesterday,
that would be a 2nd order Markovian.

00:01:43.642 --> 00:01:44.780
All right?

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.050
So the probability of moving, of being
in a particular state of getting to

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.640
a state, depends only on
the state I'm currently in.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.310
In order to specify our Markovian Model
we need a couple of things, right?

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.590
So, we need a set of states and these
are labeled here as S1, 2, through SN.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.220
And those, the S's, those are, there's
state one, state two, state, that's not

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.160
a particular time, or particular day,
there's three different states.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.140
So in this example, N would be three.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.700
We also need transition probabilities,
and that's written as AIJ.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.820
So that is the probability that
if you're in some state I,

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.490
that the next time you
would be in state J.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.660
And then finally to kick things off,
we need a initial distribution.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.040
That's just the probability that Q1, and
I'm going to talk about Q a little bit

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.590
more in a minute,
that Q1 is equal to Si.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.670
So, Q sub t Is whatever state I'm at,
at time t.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.810
So q sub 1 is the time, is the state
at the first day, or time one.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.270
So for this particular example,
as I showed you here,

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.420
you've got three states,
sunny, rainy, and snowy.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.460
We've got the state
transition probability.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.680
So, this matrix A, that's
the encoding of all of these links,

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.040
of all of these transition values.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.990
And then, I have an initial distribution
which just says well to start off with,

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.770
maybe, 70% chance that it's sunny,
25% chance that it's rainy and,

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.840
if my math is right 5% chance that
it starts out as being snowy.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.520
So, given this Markovian Model,
you can ask certain questions.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.680
For example, you could say
if I give you this series so

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.260
that's sunny, rainy,
rainy, rainy, snowy,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.830
snowy, you could say what's
the probability of getting that series?

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:33.490
Okay.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.980
Well you have all
the information you need.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.490
In fact it's written down here below,
I've got A and pi, right.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.660
It's just, the probability that
I start out sunny, that's here,

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.040
times the probability that it becomes
rainy given that it's sunny, so that

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.100
would be here, times the probability
of rainy given rainy which is there.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.990
All the way through,
I just have to chain it through, right?

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.531
And when I multiply all those
number together, 0.7 times 0.125,

00:03:58.531 --> 00:04:02.154
times [INAUDIBLE] I get some number,
0.0001512.

00:04:02.154 --> 00:04:03.890
Okay.
They tend to be small numbers,

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.260
by the way, probabilities and
HMMs, or in, in market models,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.920
because whenever I multiply a lot of
numbers that are probabilities together,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.410
since all numbers that are probabilities
are less than or equal to one,

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.459
when I multiply a lot of them,
I get small numbers.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.620
And when you implement these things,
you sometimes have to be careful and

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.550
do things like take the log but
that's all I'm going to say about that.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.650
All right, so that's a Markov Model.
