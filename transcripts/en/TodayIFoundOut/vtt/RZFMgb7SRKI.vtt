00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:34.210
In the 1993 movie Tombstone, Doc Holliday
(portrayed by actor Val Kilmer) is depicted

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.820
as a good guy at heart, helping Wyatt Earp
to keep order and law in the dangerous old

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.960
west town of Tombstone, Arizona.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.129
As is the case with Earp, there is a mound
of evidence that the real Doc Holliday wasn’t

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.820
nearly so squeaky clean.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.100
Here is the truth behind the legend of the
“slickest gunslinger in the west,” Doc

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.190
Holliday.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.260
Born John Henry Holliday on August 4, 1851
in Griffin, Georgia (today, a suburb of Atlanta),

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.100
“Doc” was the second child born to his
parents, Henry (“Major”) and Alice Jane

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.890
Holliday, but his older sister passed away
during childbirth.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.240
He would remain an only child.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.619
His father was a veteran of several wars,
including the Cherokee Indian War and the

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.140
Mexican-American war.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.979
When he returned in 1848 from the Mexican-American
war, he brought with him an orphaned Mexican

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.920
boy named Francisco Hidalgo.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.049
It is said when John Henry was a young child,
Francisco taught him how to become “the

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.759
quickest draw in the west.”

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.930
Growing up on a “Southern frontier” farm
was tough living, with humid air and erratic

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.930
weather.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.539
John’s family was Scottish-Irish, like many
in the region, and he was raised Protestant.

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.399
His mother taught him manners and etiquette,
while his father regaled him with war stories

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.650
and survival skills.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.229
John was but nine years old when the Civil
War broke out and his father once again left

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.140
for war, but not before moving his family
even further south, to the Georgia-Florida

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.140
border.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.260
John attended school and was a good student,
though he was noted as being somewhat rebellious.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.780
Quickly after his mother’s death in May
of 1866 from consumption (a.k.a. tuberculosis,

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.460
see: Why Tuberculosis was Called “Consumption”),
Major remarried to a neighbor’s daughter

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.260
(who was 23, eight years older than John).

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.599
John’s relationship with his father became
strained and he left home to attend the Pennsylvania

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.900
College of Dental Surgery in 1869, one of
the best dental schools in the country.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.730
Seemingly, he did quite well at school and
graduated with a license in 1872.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.580
He moved to St. Louis for a period of time,
to join a friend’s dental practice, before

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.959
moving back to Georgia.

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.099
Now, here begins the more interesting part
of Holliday’s life.

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:41.440
In 1872, in a story recounted in a Doc Holliday
biography written by Gary Roberts, Doc Holliday:

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.709
The Life and Legend, (but first conveyed in
1907 by noted writer Bat Masterson) Holliday

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.830
first killed a man in Georgia during a racial
dispute.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.240
Holliday and a few friends were at a watering
hole when a group of African-American men

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.670
joined them as well.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.159
Holliday did not approve and told them to
leave.

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:58.159
They didn’t.

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.439
He produced a gun and shot one to three men
(reports vary) to death.

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:06.360
Now, a few historians think this story may
not be entirely accurate due to discrepancies

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.099
in the 1907 version, but it wouldn’t have
been too out of character for Holliday given

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.700
his preponderance towards violence.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.700
Also around this time, he was diagnosed with
tuberculosis just like his mother, who he

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.230
watched die from the disease.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.050
With no effective cure, it was thought that
a dry climate could at least alleviate the

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.050
symptoms.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.430
Either because he was run out of town or due
to his sickness, or maybe both, he moved to

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.960
the dry air of Dallas, shortly thereafter
in 1872.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.530
He opened a dental practice in Dallas, but
it wasn’t for long.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.080
According to True West Magazine, Doc’s constant
coughing and illness kept patients away, so

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.950
he had to learn how to make money another
way – card games and gambling.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.220
Refined, intelligent, and good at keeping
a poker face, Doc excelled at Faro, where

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.989
he became a dealer (or “banker”) at several
saloons across Dallas.

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.510
Faro was a game which pitted the banker against
the other players.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.610
It was also a game that could be easily rigged.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.360
Doc was extremely good at Faro, or at least
extremely good at cheating, earning himself

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.049
a lot of money – and a lot of enemies.

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.150
Throughout the next few years, Doc was regularly
arrested and fined for his gaming in Dallas.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.390
To avoid charges, he went on the run throughout
the Southwest, dealing Faro at saloons all

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.410
along the way.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.830
He got into more than one disagreement that
required the use, or at least the threatening

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.660
of, the skills he learned from Fransisco so
many years back.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.580
He seems to have gotten into gunfights throughout
Texas, Kansas, Wyoming, and New Mexico.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.130
He also is known to have sliced open a man’s
stomach when the man refused to follow the

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.530
Faro rules that Doc had “implemented.”

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.900
At one point, it is thought that US Marshals
and Texas Rangers were even after him.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.630
In 1879, he had made enough money to open
his own saloon in New Mexico.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.979
He spent his time dealing Faro and drinking
heavily, until one night a former army scout

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.530
put up a fuss when one of Holliday’s saloon
girls (possibly a prostitute) told him that

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.949
she wasn’t in love with him.

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:57.610
The army scout went outside and began to fire
shots into Holliday’s establishment.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.310
So, Doc went outside and killed the man.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.120
The following year, he found himself in Tombstone,
Arizona where history was waiting for him.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.130
Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday first became familiar,
where else, but at a Faro gaming table.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.470
As the deputy of Dodge City, Earp was on the
trail of well-known train robber Dave Rudabaugh

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:21.810
and was venturing way out of his jurisdiction
in pursuit, nearly 400 miles and into Fort

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.810
Griffin, Texas.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.530
Historians believe Earp wasn’t doing this
out of any sense of justice, but rather for

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.139
the considerable reward money.

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:33.000
Either way, he was directed to the Faro table
of Doc Holliday, who had dealt with Rudabaugh.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.141
Normally, Holliday would never talk to a lawman,
but upon hearing about the reward over a game

00:05:37.141 --> 00:05:41.830
of Faro, he spilled the beans that he had
heard that Rudabaugh was hightailing it back

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:42.830
to Kansas.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.150
Earp wired the information to a friend there
and Rudabaugh was soon captured.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.050
It is not known if Earp shared the reward
money with Holliday, nor who won that game

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.050
of Faro.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.539
Also, according to a story supposedly told
by Earp (possibly just a legend, given Earp’s

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.819
and his many biographers’ known propensity
to make up such stories), Holliday once saved

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:00.960
Earp’s life.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.810
In 1879, with Holiday paying a visit to Dodge
City with his girlfriend “Big Nose Kate,”

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:11.120
the noted cowboy Tabo Driskell pulled a gun
on Earp and was about to shoot him when Holliday

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.180
came up behind him and placed a gun at his
temple.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.729
Driskell dropped his gun and from then on,
Earp credited Holliday with saving his life.

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:22.610
Whether true or not, in 1881, Earp wrote a
letter to Holliday asking him to join him

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.150
in Tombstone, saying they could use a dentist
in those parts.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.830
More likely, Earp probably just wanted his
favorite Faro dealer by his side to help fleece

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.760
the denizens of the then prosperous silver
mining town.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:38.289
So, Doc Holliday moved to Tombstone and that
was where his legend was made and why anybody

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:40.000
still remembers who he was.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.069
It seems Holliday’s participation in the
showdown at the OK Corral (or rather in a

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:48.889
vacant lot next to the OK Corral) against
Ike Clanton and his men had more to do with

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:53.300
his loyalty to Earp, and the fact that he
rarely said no to a gunfight, than upholding

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.300
the law.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.789
There is also some evidence that Clanton may
have been spreading rumors about Holliday

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:02.080
robbing a stagecoach and that his girlfriend,
“Big Nose Kate,” was a prostitute.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.470
There is also a story that Clanton called
Holliday and the Earps out for the fight over

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.610
they having cheated Clanton in a Faro game.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.479
On the other hand, this all may have been
said after the fact to give Holliday reason

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:13.210
to be in the gunfight.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:18.060
The violence only took thirty seconds, left
three men dead, and several men injured.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.509
While no one knows for sure who fired first,
it was Doc’s bullet that first rendered

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:23.819
a fatal shot.

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:26.569
It is even written in some accounts that Clanton
was not armed.

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:30.960
But finding the truth about what happened
in that gunfight is about as difficult as

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.390
finding Bigfoot.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.470
In the end, Holliday, along with Earp, was
put on trial for murder.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:39.120
He was exonerated, but several attempts were
made on his life over the next few years.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.389
He eventually made his way to Colorado where
he increasingly became dependent on alcohol

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:46.020
and opium as his health deteriorated.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:51.169
He died in 1887 at the young age of 37 in
Glenwood Springs, Colorado, from the same

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:54.039
illness that claimed his mother – tuberculosis.

00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:58.380
Wyatt Earp lived on and moved to Los Angeles
in the early 20th century where his story

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:03.330
got the Hollywood treatment, most prominently
in the largely fictitious, but ever popular,

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.690
“biography” Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshall.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.840
Always loyal to his friend, Earp perpetuated
the myth that his card shark, gun fighter

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.600
pal, Doc Holliday, was an old west hero.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.770
It seems, if we are taking real historical
accounts and evidence into consideration,

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.979
this is actually quite false.

00:08:18.979 --> 00:08:36.900
But, as with Earp’s Hollywoodized tale,
it sure makes a great story.
