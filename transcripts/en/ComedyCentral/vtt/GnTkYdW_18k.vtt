-(applause and cheering)
-Thank you very much.

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:05.071
Welcome back.

00:00:05.104 --> 00:00:07.974
Now, if you thought America's
lead crisis was limited

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:09.909
to a single town in Michigan,
think again.

00:00:09.942 --> 00:00:11.844
The problem in Flint has exposed

00:00:11.877 --> 00:00:13.679
a larger lead crisis
around the nation.

00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:16.115
And the fact is
that lead is an epidemic,

00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:17.550
and if you're anything like me,

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:19.185
you're wondering
how we even got here.

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:20.553
So, luckily, it's time

00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:22.688
for a<i> Nightly Show </i>
Super Depressing Deep Dive.

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:24.624
Take a look.

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:26.926
(clicking)

00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:28.261

MAN: 
<i> Hi. How are you?</i>

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:31.397
<i> Fantastic. Glad to hear it.</i>

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.401
<i> Okay, time for a</i> Nightly Show
<i> Super Depressing Deep Dive.</i>

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:37.937
<i> Everybody knows
 that lead is terrible.</i>

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.673
<i> When children ingest even
 a little bit of lead,</i>

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:42.575
<i> it causes brain damage,
 seizures, even death.</i>

00:00:42.608 --> 00:00:44.477
<i> And death is one
 of the worst things</i>

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.945
<i> that can happen to a child.</i>

00:00:45.978 --> 00:00:47.613
<i> Even worse than being forced
 to wear a onesie</i>

00:00:47.646 --> 00:00:49.248
<i> for a band your dad likes.</i>

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:51.250
<i> Hey, dads,
 babies don't like Wilco.</i>

00:00:51.283 --> 00:00:53.352
-(baby crying)
<i> -Nobody likes Wilco.</i>

00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:57.490
<i> Anyway, lead is terrible,
 but it's also everywhere.</i>

00:00:57.523 --> 00:00:59.225
<i> To find out why
 we have to travel</i>

00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:02.795
<i> all the back back to 1904,
 Australia.</i>

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:05.298
<i> See, in 1904,
 Australian investigators</i>

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:06.966
<i> realized that children
 in lead-painted homes</i>

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:09.168
<i> were showing the same symptoms
 as sick</i>

00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:11.671
<i> factory machinists
 who worked with lead all day.</i>

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:13.406
<i> Soon the Australians published
 their findings,</i>

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.274
<i> and everybody could read
 about how dangerous lead was.</i>

00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:17.009
(loud gasping)

00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:18.711
<i> Cut to 1922
 when the League of Nations</i>

00:01:18.744 --> 00:01:20.446
<i> tried to ban lead paint
 worldwide.</i>

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.249
<i> The band worked, lead paint was
 outlawed, and everything was</i>

00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:24.584

 -CHILDREN: Yay!

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:27.420
<i> -Back to you, Larry.</i>

00:01:27.453 --> 00:01:29.489
<i> Just kidding. Life is
 an ever-churning maelstrom</i>

(woman screams)

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:34.093
<i> See, the U.S. didn't ban lead
 paint until 1978.</i>

00:01:34.126 --> 00:01:35.461
<i> Why did it take more
 than 50 years</i>

00:01:35.494 --> 00:01:37.463
<i> for the U.S. to do anything
 about lead paint?</i>

00:01:37.496 --> 00:01:39.165

 greed...</i> -(bell dinging)

<i> -Just don't chew on it.
 It's made of lead.</i> -(coughs)

00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:45.004
<i> The U.S. didn't sign on to the
 1922 ban because of lobbying</i>

00:01:45.037 --> 00:01:47.740
<i> by pro-lead groups like
 the Lead Industries Association</i>

00:01:47.773 --> 00:01:49.976

<i> It was actively marketed

00:02:00.586 --> 00:02:02.455

 What was the deal with that?</i>

00:02:11.597 --> 00:02:13.833
<i> In fact, in 1938,
 the government even mandated</i>

00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:15.301
<i> that cheap lead-based paints
 had to be used</i>

00:02:15.334 --> 00:02:16.469

<i> So, like big tobacco, the lead
 industry fought warning labels,</i>

00:02:29.248 --> 00:02:30.716
