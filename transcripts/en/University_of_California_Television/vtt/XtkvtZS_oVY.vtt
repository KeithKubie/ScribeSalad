(soft music)

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.710
- At approximately 35
weeks into your pregnancy,

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.440
your provider will have you
take a Group B Streptococcus

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.540
or GBS test.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.250
Let's talk about what GBS is

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.630
and why this test is so
important for a healthy birth.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.530
GBS is a type of bacteria
that can live normally

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.970
in a woman's genital or urinary tract

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.680
and it's considered a
normal type of bacteria.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.750
It is not a sexually-transmitted disease

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.500
and no treatment is indicated

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.550
for women who have the bacteria.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.320
However, during delivery,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.600
when a baby is moving
along the birth canal,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.430
it can be exposed to GBS

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.090
and unfortunately can become very sick.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.110
Before routine testing for GBS,

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.230
about 1.7 babies out of 1,000 births

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.080
will become seriously
infected after delivery.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.913
Because of this,

00:00:57.913 --> 00:01:00.790
we now routinely test women
to see if they carry GBS

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.620
in their genitourinary tract

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.080
reducing the incidence
of serious infections

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.123
to just 0.22 cases per 1,000 births.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.380
Your provider may either
give you instructions

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.180
for doing the swab
yourself in the bathroom

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.780
during your prenatal visit

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.700
or may collect the swab
for you during the visit.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.460
If you have a strong preference
for one option or the other,

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.640
please talk with your provider
to let him or her know.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.020
This is the swab

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.090
and it's swept around
the outside of the vagina

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.600
down the perineum and
into the rectum briefly.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.110
Your provider will contact you

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.900
with the results of your test.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.690
If you do carry the bacteria,

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.560
you're given antibiotics
through an IV during labor

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.600
to prevent transmission to the baby

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.100
while it's traveling
through the birth canal.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.710
If you've had a urinary tract
infection during pregnancy

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.870
that was due to GBS bacteria,

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:49.870
you don't need a swab

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.080
because you're already
known to have the bacteria

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.350
and you'll be given antibiotics
during labor as well.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.630
Antibiotics are safe for
pregnancy and for breastfeeding.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.730
If you have a known allergy to penicillin,

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.470
it's important to let your provider know

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.630
when the GBS swab is being collected

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.220
as special testing will be done

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.343
to identify the best alternate
antibiotic to use instead.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.900
GBS testing is just one of the many ways

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.720
that we work to prevent
problems before they occur

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.910
protecting you and your baby

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.722
during your labor and delivery experience.

00:02:20.722 --> 00:02:23.139
