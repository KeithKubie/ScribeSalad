00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:46.530 align:start position:0%
you play the game but also the emotions
 

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.590 align:start position:0%
you play the game but also the emotions
you<00:07:46.620><c> want</c><00:07:46.800><c> to</c><00:07:46.980><c> feel</c><00:07:47.100><c> when</c><00:07:47.430><c> you</c><00:07:47.550><c> close</c><00:07:48.150><c> the</c><00:07:48.420><c> game</c>

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:48.600 align:start position:0%
you want to feel when you close the game
 

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.630 align:start position:0%
you want to feel when you close the game
so<00:07:49.200><c> they're</c><00:07:49.320><c> not</c><00:07:49.440><c> just</c><00:07:49.500><c> entertained</c><00:07:50.130><c> but</c><00:07:50.400><c> just</c>

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
so they're not just entertained but just
 

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.550 align:start position:0%
so they're not just entertained but just
then<00:07:51.030><c> find</c><00:07:51.390><c> an</c><00:07:51.660><c> hour</c><00:07:51.780><c> later</c><00:07:52.050><c> you</c><00:07:52.110><c> close</c><00:07:52.410><c> the</c>

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
then find an hour later you close the
 

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:59.410 align:start position:0%
then find an hour later you close the
app<00:07:52.680><c> and</c><00:07:52.980><c> you're</c><00:07:53.100><c> like</c><00:07:53.280><c> another</c><00:07:53.760><c> hour</c><00:07:53.850><c> older</c>

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.940 align:start position:0%
 
okay<00:08:00.420><c> so</c><00:08:00.480><c> using</c><00:08:00.810><c> user</c><00:08:01.080><c> sentiment</c><00:08:01.560><c> to</c><00:08:01.770><c> guide</c>

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:01.950 align:start position:0%
okay so using user sentiment to guide
 

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.530 align:start position:0%
okay so using user sentiment to guide
the<00:08:02.130><c> in</c><00:08:02.220><c> design</c><00:08:02.490><c> obviously</c><00:08:02.970><c> makes</c><00:08:03.150><c> sense</c>

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:03.540 align:start position:0%
the in design obviously makes sense
 

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
the in design obviously makes sense
and<00:08:03.960><c> but</c><00:08:04.380><c> as</c><00:08:04.470><c> you</c><00:08:04.560><c> mentioned</c><00:08:04.650><c> sir</c><00:08:04.980><c> it's</c><00:08:05.130><c> all</c>

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:05.250 align:start position:0%
and but as you mentioned sir it's all
 

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.820 align:start position:0%
and but as you mentioned sir it's all
it's<00:08:05.580><c> really</c><00:08:05.700><c> tricky</c><00:08:06.000><c> and</c><00:08:06.470><c> how</c><00:08:07.470><c> do</c><00:08:07.530><c> you</c><00:08:07.650><c> guys</c>

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:07.830 align:start position:0%
it's really tricky and how do you guys
 

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.410 align:start position:0%
it's really tricky and how do you guys
balance<00:08:08.010><c> between</c><00:08:08.370><c> optimizing</c><00:08:09.060><c> for</c><00:08:09.240><c> user</c>

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
balance between optimizing for user
 

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
balance between optimizing for user
sentiment<00:08:09.960><c> against</c><00:08:10.200><c> optimizing</c><00:08:10.950><c> and</c><00:08:11.190><c> for</c><00:08:11.490><c> key</c>

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:11.610 align:start position:0%
sentiment against optimizing and for key
 

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
sentiment against optimizing and for key
business<00:08:11.940><c> KPI</c><00:08:12.270><c> is</c><00:08:12.420><c> like</c><00:08:12.750><c> engagement</c><00:08:13.230><c> or</c>

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:13.530 align:start position:0%
business KPI is like engagement or
 

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:17.330 align:start position:0%
business KPI is like engagement or
revenue<00:08:14.030><c> you</c><00:08:15.030><c> do</c><00:08:15.210><c> this</c><00:08:15.330><c> one</c><00:08:15.570><c> okay</c><00:08:16.340><c> so</c>

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
revenue you do this one okay so
 

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.790 align:start position:0%
revenue you do this one okay so
obviously<00:08:17.640><c> we're</c><00:08:18.210><c> thinking</c><00:08:18.510><c> about</c><00:08:18.600><c> KPIs</c>

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
obviously we're thinking about KPIs
 

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.530 align:start position:0%
obviously we're thinking about KPIs
but<00:08:20.370><c> when</c><00:08:20.520><c> we're</c><00:08:20.730><c> designing</c><00:08:21.090><c> a</c><00:08:21.210><c> new</c><00:08:21.300><c> feature</c>

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
but when we're designing a new feature
 

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.870 align:start position:0%
but when we're designing a new feature
we'll<00:08:22.080><c> make</c><00:08:22.530><c> sure</c><00:08:22.710><c> we</c><00:08:22.860><c> stop</c><00:08:23.160><c> and</c><00:08:23.400><c> think</c><00:08:23.640><c> you</c>

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
we'll make sure we stop and think you
 

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.360 align:start position:0%
we'll make sure we stop and think you
know<00:08:24.000><c> is</c><00:08:24.240><c> this</c><00:08:24.420><c> a</c><00:08:24.540><c> retention</c><00:08:24.900><c> KPI</c><00:08:25.440><c> is</c><00:08:25.590><c> it</c><00:08:25.920><c> is</c><00:08:26.190><c> a</c>

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:26.370 align:start position:0%
know is this a retention KPI is it is a
 

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:27.650 align:start position:0%
know is this a retention KPI is it is a

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:27.660 align:start position:0%

feature is this a revenue feature and we
 

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.029 align:start position:0%
feature is this a revenue feature and we
really<00:08:30.480><c> think</c><00:08:30.660><c> about</c><00:08:30.810><c> that</c><00:08:31.140><c> and</c><00:08:31.440><c> often</c><00:08:31.920><c> you</c>

00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:32.039 align:start position:0%
really think about that and often you
 

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:33.529 align:start position:0%
really think about that and often you
