00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.720
One of assessing how emotionally damaged we might be is to identify

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:11.160
a range of markers of emotional health and
imagine how we fare in relation to them. At

00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:19.360
least four central themes suggest themselves.
Firstly Self-Love. Self-love is the quality that determines

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.951
how much we can be friends with ourselves
and, day to day, remain on our own side. When

00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:31.000
we meet a stranger who has things we don’t,
how quickly do we feel ourselves pitiful – and

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.190
how long can we remain assured by the decency
of what we have and are? When another person

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.559
frustrates or humiliates us, can we let the
insult go, able to perceive the senseless

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:48.519
malice beneath the attack – or are we left
brooding and devastated, implicitly identifying

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:54.370
with the verdict of our enemies? How much
can the disapproval or neglect of public opinion

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.801
be offset by the memory of the steady attention
of few significant people in the past? In

00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:06.479
relationships, do we have enough self-love
to leave an abusive union? Or are we so down

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.710
on ourselves that we carry an implicit belief
that harm is all we deserve? In a different

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.189
vein, how good are we at apologising to a
lover for things that may be our fault? How

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:23.719
rigidly self-righteous do we need to be? Can
we dare to admit mistakes or does an admission

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:29.530
of guilt or error bring us too close to our
background sense of nullity? In the bedroom,

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.229
how clean and natural or alternatively disgusting
and sinful do our desires feel? Might they

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:42.549
be a little odd, but not for that matter bad
or dark, since they emanate from within us

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:49.510
and we are not wretches? At work, do we have
a reasonable, well-grounded sense of our worth

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.320
– and so feel able to ask for (and properly
expect to get) the rewards we are due? Can

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.369
we resist the need to please others indiscriminately?
Are we sufficiently aware of our genuine contribution

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:09.340
to say no? Candour Candour determines the
extent to which difficult ideas and troubling

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.010
facts can be consciously admitted into the
mind, soberly explored and accepted without

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.070
denial. How much can we admit to ourselves
about who we are – even if, or especially

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:27.000
when, the matter is not especially pleasant?
How much do we need to insist on our own normality

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.640
and wholehearted sanity? Can we explore our
own minds – and look into their darker and

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.110
more troubled corners without flinching overly?
Can we admit to folly, envy, sadness and confusion?

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.840
Around others, how ready are we to learn?
Do we need always take a criticism of one

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.950
part of us as an attack on everything about
us? How ready are we to listen when valuable

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:59.590
lessons come in painful guises? Communication
Can we patiently and reasonably put our disappointments

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.900
into words that, more or less, enable others
to see our point? Or do we internalise pain,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.780
act it out symbolically or discharge it with
counterproductive rage? When other people

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.980
upset us, do we feel we have the right to
communicate or must we slam doors and retreat

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.170
into sulks? When the desired response isn’t
forthcoming, do we ask others to guess what

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.870
we have been too angrily panicked to spell
out? Or can we have a plausible second go

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.130
and take seriously the thought that others
are not merely being nasty in misunderstanding

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:40.460
us? Do we have the inner resources to teach
rather than insist? Trust How risky is the

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.650
world? How readily might we survive a challenge
in the form of a speech, a romantic rejection,

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.830
a bout of financial trouble, a journey to
another country or a common cold? How close

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.320
are we, at any time, to catastrophe? What
material are we made of? Will new acquaintances

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:03.700
like or wound us? If we are a touch assertive,
will they take it or collapse? Will unfamiliar

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.340
situations end in a debacle? Around love,
how tightly do we need to cling? If they are

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.850
distant for a while, will they return? How
controlling do we need to be? Can we approach

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.660
an interesting-looking stranger? Or move on
from an unsatisfying one? Do we, overall,

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.600
feel the world to be wide, safe, and reasonable
enough for us to have a legitimate shot at

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:33.190
a measure of contentment – or must we settle,
resentfully, for inauthenticity and misunderstanding?

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.430
It isn’t our fault or, in a sense, anyone
else’s that many of these questions are

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:43.440
so hard to answer in the affirmative. But,
by entertaining them, we are at least starting

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:50.880
to know what kind of shape our psycological wounds have and so what kind of bandages might be most necessary.
