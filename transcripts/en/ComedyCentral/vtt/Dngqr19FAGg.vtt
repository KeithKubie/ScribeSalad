00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:01.568
[goat bleats]

00:00:01.602 --> 00:00:02.569
- THAT'S GOOD, GARY.

00:00:02.603 --> 00:00:04.738
START IT OUT, BROTHER.

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:07.241
GOT TO GET YOU FIT, MATE.

00:00:07.274 --> 00:00:08.408
THAT'S GOOD, GARY.

00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:09.576
NOT IN FRONT OF THE CAR.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.044
I DON'T WANT TO RUN YOU OVER.

00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:12.379
THAT'S GOOD, GARY!

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:13.447
[laughter]

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.715
- I'LL HAVE THE SAME THING!

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:17.050
- [laughs]
- OH!

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:18.418
HE'S HORNY.

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:20.087
WE'RE GONNA CHECK ROEY
OVER HERE

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.422
WHO'S PUTTING A BUCK 35
OF COINS

00:00:22.456 --> 00:00:23.457
UP HIS FORESKIN.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.158
HE'S GONNA SPIT IT OUT, OKAY?

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:27.060
GARY'S HAVING A LOOK AT HIM.

00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:28.562
- DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:30.697
- [laughs]
WOW!

00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:31.798
- HOW MUCH WAS THAT?

00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:33.367
- $1.35.
- $1.35.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.601
- WHAT HAPPENED TO $1.40?

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:36.436
- HEY, GIRLS, DO YOU WANT
TO STICK A BUCK 40

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.938
UP YOUR [bleep]
TO BEAT HIM?

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:39.072
[laughter]

00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:41.074
GARY, WHERE ARE YOU, MATE?

00:00:41.108 --> 00:00:42.242
MATE--

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:44.011
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO KNOW.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.679
- YOU CAN HAVE
YOUR HUGH JACKMANS

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:47.681
AND YOUR CROCODILE DUNDEES,
BUT FOR MY MONEY,

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.516
THERE'S NO BIGGER CELEBRITY
IN AUSTRALIA

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.418
THAN GARY THE GOAT.

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:53.420
GARY...

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:54.755
AND HIS OWNER JIMBO

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:56.190
HAVE MADE HUNDREDS OF VIDEOS,

00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:57.724
BUT THEY'VE NEVER DONE
AN INTERVIEW,

00:00:57.758 --> 00:00:59.726
AND I'VE NEVER TALKED
TO A GOAT BEFORE,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.629
SO PLEASE WELCOME
THE GREATEST GOAT OF ALL TIME,

00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:04.064
GARY!

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:05.832
- GOOD DAY FROM AUSTRALIA.

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.367
- WHERE DID YOU AND GARY MEET?

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:09.036
- I DO COMEDY SHOWS
IN PUBS,

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.705
AND AFTER A GIG,
A GUY OFFERED ME A GOAT

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:13.240
FOR A CASE OF BEER.

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:15.242
- I GOT TO START PERFORMING
IN AUSTRALIA.

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:18.412
MY FANS HERE JUST GIVE ME DRUGS
AND PUSSY AFTER SHOWS.

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:20.747
CAN GARY DO ANY TRICKS?

00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:22.549
- NO, HE DOESN'T PLAY GUITAR

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:24.218
OR SING OR JUGGLE
OR ANYTHING.

00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:25.886
HE JUST GOES INTO THE PUBS.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:28.388
HE WALKS AROUND,
STEALS PEOPLE'S CHIPS,

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:29.823
DOES A [bleep],
AND FALLS ASLEEP.

00:01:29.857 --> 00:01:32.059
- YOU AND GARY
MIGHT BE ALCOHOLICS.

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:34.394
- GARY DOESN'T DRINK,
WHICH I'M REALLY HAPPY,

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:36.897
BECAUSE EVERY NIGHT
PEOPLE ARE OFFERING HIM BEER,

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.899
AND IF THAT--
IF GARY DRANK,

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:40.734
I'D HAVE A DRUNK GOAT
EVERY NIGHT,

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.069
AND THAT'S NOT GOOD

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:44.071
'CAUSE HE SOMETIMES
HAS GOT TO DRIVE HOME.

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:46.406
- DOES GARY LET YOU
RIDE HIM HOME?

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.409
- NO, BUT I'VE GOT A GOAT BUGGY
ON THE BACK.

00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:51.645
I'VE GOT A--LIKE, A HARNESS
FOR A HORSE,

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:53.480
WHERE I'VE SAT IN THE BACK,

00:01:53.514 --> 00:01:55.482
AND, YEAH,
BUT WE COULDN'T STEER,

00:01:55.516 --> 00:01:57.451
SO WE JUST RAN INTO A TRUCK.

00:01:57.484 --> 00:01:59.653
- HEY, ARE THERE ANY
LITTLE GARYS IN THE FUTURE?

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:01.488
- NO, NO,
HE'S GOT NO BALLS,

00:02:01.522 --> 00:02:03.323
WHICH MEANS
GARY'S THE END OF THE LINE.

00:02:03.357 --> 00:02:04.825
THAT'S WHY HE'S GOING HARD.

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:06.326
- WELL, WE APPRECIATE HIM
GOING HARD.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.828
THANKS FOR BEING HERE, GARY.

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:09.429
- BYE-BYE.

00:02:09.463 --> 00:02:10.764
- WE'VE GOT A GARY
IN OUR OFFICE,

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:12.966
AND HE IS THE LIFE
OF THE PARTY TOO.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.301
GARY.

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:15.969
- WHAT THEY COULD DO
ON A WINTER DAY

00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:18.305
IS PUT THE TREADMILL OUTSIDE

00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:21.808
AND TAKE SWEET POTATOES
THAT HAVE JUST BEEN BAKED...

00:02:21.842 --> 00:02:23.143
- OH, OKAY.

00:02:23.177 --> 00:02:25.145
- AND PUT 'EM IN THE CROTCH
OF YOUR PANTS.

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:26.313
- GARY!

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:27.481
- AND AS YOU'RE WALKING--

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:29.316
AS YOU'RE WALKING
ON THE TREADMILL,

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.485
THE SWEET POTATOES GET MUSHY,

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:33.153
AND THEY'RE STILL WARM,

00:02:33.187 --> 00:02:35.656
AND THEY START RUNNING DOWN
THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEGS,

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.224
AND IT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:39.393
YOU'RE IN ANOTHER PART
OF THE COUNTRY,

00:02:39.426 --> 00:02:41.895
AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE
OR HOW YOU GOT THERE,

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:43.730
BUT IT FEELS GOOD.

00:02:43.764 --> 00:02:45.399
YOU HAVE A DIMENSIONAL OUTTAKE

00:02:45.432 --> 00:02:47.401
OF WHAT YOUR REALISTICS ARE.

00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:49.236
YOU LIVE IN AN INVISIBLE PRISON.

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.804
YOU DON'T KNOW YOU'RE LOCKED UP,

00:02:50.838 --> 00:02:52.539
BUT YOUR MIND DOES.

00:02:52.573 --> 00:02:53.640
[laughing obnoxiously]

00:02:53.674 --> 00:02:54.975
- GARY!

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.310
- I HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED YET!

00:02:56.343 --> 00:02:57.578
- OH, GOD.

00:02:57.611 --> 00:03:00.047
- I'VE HAD A COUPLE
OUT-OF-BODY EXPERIENCES.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.316
HA!
YOU GUYS DRINK A LOT HERE?

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.318
AND A CARLOAD OF DOGS PULLED UP
IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:05.853
ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO.

00:03:05.886 --> 00:03:07.354
- GARY.
[laughs]

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:08.856
GARY!

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:10.357
- [clears throat]

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.861
IT'S CALLED LUBRICANT LAND.

00:03:13.894 --> 00:03:17.097
IT WOULD BE A HALFWAY
AMERICAN FLAG.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.299
DON'T GIVE UP!
- GARY.

00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:21.969
- YOU COULD PAINT A HERD
OF HUMMINGBIRDS IN FORMATION

00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:24.972
FLYING THIS WAY TO HIM
LIKE A "V."

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:26.173
EEE!

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.341
DICK OF THE WEEK.

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:29.176
- GARY!

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.844
- OH, HOW ABOUT A LITTLE HEAD?

00:03:30.878 --> 00:03:32.145
[laughter]

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:33.480
THOSE MINIATURE GOATS,

00:03:33.514 --> 00:03:35.816
I'VE SEEN 'EM FORNICATE
WITH MAILBOX POSTS.

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.185
THEY JUST GET UP THERE
AND HUMP IT.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:39.353
- PEEN.

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:40.687
- GARY.

00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:42.923
- TRY TO EXPLORE THAT WORD
A LITTLE DEEPER WITH ME.

00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:44.424
- PEEN, PEEN.

00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:46.426
- PEEN.
- PEEN.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.594
- ARE YOU THINKING OF "BEAN"?

00:03:47.628 --> 00:03:49.096
- PEEN.

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.764
- PEEN?
- PEEN.

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:52.766
PEEN.

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.101
- PEEN.

00:03:54.134 --> 00:03:56.436
[laughter]

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.505
I'M GLAD YOU'RE NOT A TEACHER,
MAN.

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:59.573
- OH, IF YOU--

00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:00.807
- IF YOU HAVE A HARD TIME
ABOUT--

00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:03.143
OH!
HE LEFT.

00:04:03.177 --> 00:04:05.145
HE'S TALKING ABOUT YOUR PENIS.

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:07.080
[laughter]

00:04:07.114 --> 00:04:08.415
- LIKE A FINE WINE,

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:10.417
GARY BUSEY ONLY IMPROVES
WITH AGE.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.085
HE IS THE HEART AND SOUL
OF THIS SHOW.

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:14.755
HE'S INSANE--
INSANELY TALENTED!

00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:16.924
GARY ASKED IF HE COULD COME BACK
ON ANOTHER EPISODE

00:04:16.957 --> 00:04:19.026
AND PHYSICALLY BATTLE ME
WITH CHILDREN'S TOYS.

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:20.527
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS,

00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:20.627
BUT I SAID YES.
