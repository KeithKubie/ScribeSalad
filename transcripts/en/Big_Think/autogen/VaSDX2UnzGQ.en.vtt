they're going to have to be pushed in
 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.760
they're going to have to be pushed in
that respect but it's kind of the same

the first thing you have to think about
 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.850
the first thing you have to think about
is how much energy do i use what am I

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860
is how much energy do i use what am I

go up second issue and related is even
insofar as they don't go up will they

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930
insofar as they don't go up will they
 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.630
insofar as they don't go up will they
become more volatile will they will they

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640
become more volatile will they will they

become more volatile will they will they
you know will we see the kinds of spikes

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440
you know will we see the kinds of spikes
 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.590

the last 12 months the answer to both of

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430
the last 12 months the answer to both of
 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.010
the last 12 months the answer to both of
those questions is almost certainly yes

the costs will go up and so will the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370
the costs will go up and so will the
 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.910
the costs will go up and so will the
volatility the second question is will
