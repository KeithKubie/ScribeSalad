00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:01.750
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Alright, so, can you explain it back to me?

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:05.905
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, yeah, there's three properties of sound wave. The sound is a wave. First

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:10.135
there's amplitude, that's how high and how low a wave goes. Then there's

00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:14.219
frequency, that's how many waves there are per second. And then there's purity,

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.850
that's how complex a wave is.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.059
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Excellent, so those are the properties of the wave itself. But what about three

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:24.340
properties of what we hear, what we perceive? So, by that I mean the volume,

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.887
the pitch, the timbre. Can you match the perceived sound properties to the

00:00:28.887 --> 00:00:30.789
properties of the wave?
