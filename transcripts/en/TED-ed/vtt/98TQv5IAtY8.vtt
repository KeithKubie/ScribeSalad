00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.070
Imagine an island where 100 people,

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.150
all perfect logicians,
are imprisoned by a mad dictator.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.291
There's no escape,
except for one strange rule.

00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:23.051
Any prisoner can approach the guards
at night and ask to leave.

00:00:23.051 --> 00:00:26.392
If they have green eyes, 
they'll be released.

00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:30.342
If not, they'll be tossed 
into the volcano.

00:00:30.342 --> 00:00:34.103
As it happens, 
all 100 prisoners have green eyes,

00:00:34.103 --> 00:00:36.676
but they've lived there since birth,

00:00:36.676 --> 00:00:41.491
and the dictator has ensured
they can't learn their own eye color.

00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:43.446
There are no reflective surfaces,

00:00:43.446 --> 00:00:46.155
all water is in opaque containers,

00:00:46.155 --> 00:00:47.663
and most importantly,

00:00:47.663 --> 00:00:50.780
they're not allowed 
to communicate among themselves.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.754
Though they do see each other
during each morning's head count.

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:59.196
Nevertheless, they all know no one would
ever risk trying to leave

00:00:59.196 --> 00:01:02.607
without absolute certainty of success.

00:01:02.607 --> 00:01:05.008
After much pressure 
from human rights groups,

00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:09.048
the dictator reluctantly agrees
to let you visit the island

00:01:09.048 --> 00:01:12.465
and speak to the prisoners
under the following conditions:

00:01:12.465 --> 00:01:14.549
you may only make one statement,

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.858
and you cannot tell them 
any new information.

00:01:17.858 --> 00:01:20.582
What can you say 
to help free the prisoners

00:01:20.582 --> 00:01:24.246
without incurring the dictator's wrath?

00:01:24.246 --> 00:01:25.979
After thinking long and hard,

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.381
you tell the crowd, 
"At least one of you has green eyes."

00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:33.269
The dictator is suspicious

00:01:33.269 --> 00:01:37.652
but reassures himself that your statement
couldn't have changed anything.

00:01:37.652 --> 00:01:42.401
You leave, and life on the island
seems to go on as before.

00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:44.656
But on the hundredth morning 
after your visit,

00:01:44.656 --> 00:01:47.183
all the prisoners are gone,

00:01:47.183 --> 00:01:50.881
each having asked to leave
the previous night.

00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:53.933
So how did you outsmart the dictator?

00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:59.108
It might help to realize that the amount
of prisoners is arbitrary.

00:01:59.108 --> 00:02:04.178
Let's simplify things
by imagining just two, Adria and Bill.

00:02:04.178 --> 00:02:06.498
Each sees one person with green eyes,

00:02:06.498 --> 00:02:09.744
and for all they know, 
that could be the only one.

00:02:09.744 --> 00:02:12.310
For the first night, each stays put.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.231
But when they see each other 
still there in the morning,

00:02:15.231 --> 00:02:17.641
they gain new information.

00:02:17.641 --> 00:02:22.268
Adria realizes that if Bill had seen
a non-green-eyed person next to him,

00:02:22.268 --> 00:02:24.230
he would have left the first night

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.209
after concluding the statement 
could only refer to himself.

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.321
Bill simultaneously realizes 
the same thing about Adria.

00:02:32.321 --> 00:02:34.340
The fact that the other person waited

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.124
tells each prisoner his
or her own eyes must be green.

00:02:39.124 --> 00:02:42.282
And on the second morning, 
they're both gone.

00:02:42.282 --> 00:02:44.526
Now imagine a third prisoner.

00:02:44.526 --> 00:02:48.795
Adria, Bill and Carl each see 
two green-eyed people,

00:02:48.795 --> 00:02:53.905
but aren't sure if each of the others
is also seeing two green-eyed people,

00:02:53.905 --> 00:02:55.512
or just one.

00:02:55.512 --> 00:02:57.821
They wait out the first night as before,

00:02:57.821 --> 00:03:01.072
but the next morning, 
they still can't be sure.

00:03:01.072 --> 00:03:03.801
Carl thinks, "If I have non-green eyes,

00:03:03.801 --> 00:03:06.977
Adria and Bill were just 
watching each other,

00:03:06.977 --> 00:03:09.703
and will now both leave 
on the second night."

00:03:09.703 --> 00:03:12.468
But when he sees both 
of them the third morning,

00:03:12.468 --> 00:03:16.226
he realizes they must 
have been watching him, too.

00:03:16.226 --> 00:03:19.284
Adria and Bill have each 
been going through the same process,

00:03:19.284 --> 00:03:22.295
and they all leave on the third night.

00:03:22.295 --> 00:03:24.255
Using this sort of inductive reasoning,

00:03:24.255 --> 00:03:28.883
we can see that the pattern will repeat
no matter how many prisoners you add.

00:03:28.883 --> 00:03:31.900
The key is the concept 
of common knowledge,

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.539
coined by philosopher David Lewis.

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:38.935
The new information was not contained
in your statement itself,

00:03:38.935 --> 00:03:42.953
but in telling it to everyone 
simultaneously.

00:03:42.953 --> 00:03:46.680
Now, besides knowing at least one
of them has green eyes,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.090
each prisoner also knows 
that everyone else is keeping track

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.321
of all the green-eyed people they can see,

00:03:54.321 --> 00:03:58.787
and that each of them 
also knows this, and so on.

00:03:58.787 --> 00:04:00.839
What any given prisoner doesn't know

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:04.316
is whether they themselves are one
of the green-eyed people

00:04:04.316 --> 00:04:06.431
the others are keeping track of

00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:12.571
until as many nights have passed
as the number of prisoners on the island.

00:04:12.571 --> 00:04:17.098
Of course, you could have spared
the prisoners 98 days on the island

00:04:17.098 --> 00:04:21.491
by telling them at least 99 of you
have green eyes,

00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:26.251
but when mad dictators are involved,
you're best off with a good headstart.
