00:00:00.291 --> 00:00:02.027
So you already know how to answer this question

00:00:02.027 --> 00:00:05.191
when the V0 is zero, when that is,

00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:07.710
he is dropping the ball, not throwing it actually.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.451
In fact I think you can answer this using

00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:12.619
our equation, X equals one half GT square

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:14.767
where we remember that G is about equal to

00:00:14.767 --> 00:00:16.834
10 meters per second square.

00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:18.302
Why don't you go ahead and calculate the

00:00:18.302 --> 00:00:20.000
the distance for these three cases.
