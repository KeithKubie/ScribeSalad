 ON THEIR PHONES.  THEY USE IT
 TO COMMUNICATE, LEARN NEW

 ENTERTAIN THEMSELVES.  THEY

 SHOW UP.  THEY TALK TO THEIR

 WE WANT TO BE THERE FOR OUR

 USERS ASKING THEM, "HI, HOW
 CAN I HELP?"  WE THINK OF THE

00:21:30.522 --> 00:21:35.441

 WAY.  WE THINK OF IT AS A

00:21:35.442 --> 00:21:39.757

 THIS AS BUILDING EACH USER

 WE ALREADY HAVE ELEMENTS OF

00:22:00.523 --> 00:22:04.812
 THE ASSISTANT WORKING HARD
 FOR OUR USERS.  I MENTIONED

00:22:04.813 --> 00:22:08.538
 EARLIER THAT 20% OF QUERIES
 ON OUR MOBILE APP IN ANDROID

00:22:08.539 --> 00:22:11.529
 IN THE U.S. ARE VOICE
 QUERIES.  EVERY SINGLE DAY,

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:15.038
 PEOPLE SAY OKAY, GOOGLE.  AND
 ASK US QUESTIONS THAT WE HELP

00:22:15.039 --> 00:22:19.661
 THEM WITH AND WE HAVE STARTED
 BECOMING TRULY CONVERSATIONAL

00:22:19.662 --> 00:22:23.656
 BECAUSE OF OUR STRENGTHS IN
 NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING.

00:22:23.657 --> 00:22:26.677
 FOR EXAMPLE, YOU CAN BE IN
 FRONT OF THIS STRUCTURE IN

00:22:26.678 --> 00:22:30.483
 CHICAGO AND ASK GOOGLE, "WHO
 DESIGNED THIS?"  YOU DON'T

00:22:30.484 --> 00:22:34.196
 NEED TO SEE "THE BEAN" OR
 "THE CLOUD GATE."  WE

00:22:34.197 --> 00:22:37.605
 UNDERSTAND YOUR CONTEXT AND
 WE ANSWER THAT THE DESIGNER

00:22:37.606 --> 00:22:43.829
 IS ANEARBY ANISH KAPOOR.
 HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE.  YOU

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:48.642
 CAN ASK GOOGLE, "WHO DIRECTED
 THE REVENANT?"

00:22:48.643 --> 00:22:53.468
 &gt;&gt;Google: THE RELEVANT WAS
 DIRECTED BY.

00:22:53.469 --> 00:22:57.470

 FOLLOW UP THAT WITH A

00:22:57.471 --> 00:23:00.877
 QUESTION SHOW ME HIS WORDS. 
 BECAUSE I FIND THAT NAME

00:23:00.878 --> 00:23:03.685
 VERY, VERY HARD TO PRONOUNCE. 
 AND GOOGLE COULD PICK THAT

00:23:03.686 --> 00:23:08.095
 CONVERSATION UP AND RETURN
 THE RIGHT ANSWER.

00:23:08.096 --> 00:23:10.204
 THIS HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN
 REALLY HARD TO DO FOR

00:23:10.205 --> 00:23:13.029

 ABLE TO DO IT IS BECAUSE WE

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:17.021

 IN BUILDING THE WORLD'S BEST

00:23:17.022 --> 00:23:21.436

 LOOKING TO GOOGLE TO GET --
 TO HELP THEM GET THINGS DONE,

00:24:57.098 --> 00:25:00.124
 BUT WE BELIEVE WE ARE JUST
 GETTING STARTED.  WE BELIEVE

00:25:00.125 --> 00:25:04.535
 THIS IS A LONG JOURNEY AND
 GIVEN IT'S A JOURNEY, WE WANT

00:25:04.536 --> 00:25:06.350
 TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT
 ABOUT THE FUTURE.  WE WANT TO

00:25:06.351 --> 00:25:10.757

 WE ASPIRE TO BE ABLE TO.

 HERE'S A COMMON SITUATION. 
 IT'S A FRIDAY NIGHT.  I'M

00:25:15.289 --> 00:25:19.405
 SURE MANY OF YOU CAN RELATE
 TO IT.  BACK HOME, I WANT TO

00:25:19.406 --> 00:25:21.514
 TAKE MY FAMILY TO A MOVIE. 
 YOU KNOW, YOU NORMALLY PULL

00:25:21.515 --> 00:25:25.315
 OUT YOUR PHONE, RESEARCH
 MOVIES, LOOK AT THE REVIEWS,

00:25:25.316 --> 00:25:28.344
 FIND SHOWS NEARBY, AND TRY TO
 BOOK A TICKET.

 YOU KNOW, WE WANT TO BE THERE
 IN THESE MOMENTS HELPING YOU.

00:25:31.261 --> 00:25:34.750
 SO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO ASK
 GOOGLE, "WHAT'S PLAYING

00:25:34.751 --> 00:25:38.269
 TONIGHT?"  AND BY THE WAY,
 TODAY, IF YOU ASK THAT

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:42.082

00:25:42.083 --> 00:25:45.195

 UNDERSTAND YOUR CONTEXT AND

 MAYBE SUGGEST THREE RELEVANT
 MOVIES WHICH YOU WOULD LIKE

 I SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK AT

 IT AND MAYBE TELL GOOGLE, "WE
 WANT TO BRING THE KIDS THIS

00:25:54.721 --> 00:25:57.224

 THE CASE, GOOGLE SHOULD

00:25:57.225 --> 00:26:01.634
 REFINE THE ANSWER AND SUGGEST
 FAMILY-FRIENDLY OPTIONS.

00:26:01.635 --> 00:26:05.165
 AND MAYBE EVEN ASK ME, "WOULD
 YOU LIKE FOUR TICKETS TO ANY

 OF THESE?"
 AND IF I SAY, "SURE, LET'S DO

00:26:11.569 --> 00:26:14.596

 AHEAD AND GET THE TICKETS AND

 WHEN GOOGLE RETURNED THE

 RESULTS, I COULD HAVE ASKED,
 "IS JUNGLE BOOK ANY GOOD?" 

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:47.701
 AND GOOGLE COULD HAVE GIVEN
 ME THE REVIEWS AND MAYBE EVEN

00:26:47.702 --> 00:26:50.818
 SHOWN ME A TRAILER.  AND BY
 THE WAY, I SAW THE MOVIE. 

00:26:50.819 --> 00:26:53.224

 AN AMBIENT EXPERIENCE THAT
 EXTENDS ACROSS DEVICES.  I

00:27:17.098 --> 00:27:21.401
 THINK COMPUTING IS POISED TO
 EVOLVE BEYOND JUST PHONES. 

00:27:21.402 --> 00:27:23.920
 IT WILL BE IN THE CONTEXT OF
 A USER'S DAILY LIFE.  IT WILL

00:27:23.921 --> 00:27:29.139
 BE ON THEIR PHONES, DEVICES

 YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS FOOD,

 OR:  WHAT IS DRAYMOND GREEN'S

00:46:29.726 --> 00:46:33.625
 LATER?  THAT AMIT HAS OFFERED
 TWO SMART REPLY SUGGESTIONS: 

00:46:33.626 --> 00:46:39.025
 I'M BUSY AND I'M IN!  OKAY. 
 I PROMISE I WON'T ACT OUT ANY

00:46:39.026 --> 00:46:42.705
 MORE EMOJIS.
 [ LAUGHTER ]

00:46:42.706 --> 00:46:47.325
 SO ALLO USES MACHINE LEARNING
 TO SUGGEST REPLIES ON THE

00:46:47.326 --> 00:46:50.115
 FLY, ANTICIPATING WHAT YOU
 MIGHT WANT TO SAY NEXT.  NOW,

00:46:50.116 --> 00:46:54.015
 THESE AREN'T JUST CANNED
 REPLIES.  ALLO LEARNS OVER

00:46:54.016 --> 00:46:57.115
 TIME AND WILL SUGGEST
 RESPONSES BASED ON HOW YOU

00:46:57.116 --> 00:47:00.205
 LIKE TO EXPRESS YOURSELF. 
 THE MORE YOU USE ALLO THE

00:47:00.206 --> 00:47:03.425
 BETTER THE SUGGESTIONS WILL
 BECOME.  SO THE SUGGESTIONS

00:47:03.426 --> 00:47:07.605
 YOU SEE ARE UNIQUE TO YOU.
 YOU CAN SAY THE THINGS YOU

00:47:07.606 --> 00:47:11.015
 WANT WITHOUT HAVING TO TYPE A
 SINGLE WORD.  AND SINCE

00:47:11.016 --> 00:47:14.105
 MESSAGING ISN'T JUST ABOUT
 TEXT, SMART REPLIES CONTAIN

00:47:14.106 --> 00:47:18.415
 STICKERS AND EMOJIS, TOO,
 BECAUSE AS THEY SAY, AN

00:47:18.416 --> 00:47:21.715
 EMOJI'S WORTH A THOUSAND
 WORDS.  DO THEY SAY THAT?

00:47:21.716 --> 00:47:23.716
 [ LAUGHTER

00:47:25.616 --> 00:47:26.715
 ]
 NOW I WANT TO SHOW YOU

00:47:26.716 --> 00:47:31.005
 SOMETHING REALLY COOL.  ALLO
 EVEN OFFERS SMART REPLIES

00:47:31.006 --> 00:47:34.215
 WHEN PEOPLE SEND PHOTOS TO
 YOU.

00:47:34.216 --> 00:47:36.216
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:47:42.016 --> 00:47:45.525
 THIS WORKS BECAUSE IN
 ADDITION TO UNDERSTANDING

00:47:45.526 --> 00:47:49.015
 TEXT, ALLO BUILDS ON GOOGLE'S
 COMPUTER VISION CAPABILITIES

00:47:49.016 --> 00:47:52.215
 TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE
 CONTENT AND THE CONTEXT OF

00:47:52.216 --> 00:47:56.215
 IMAGES.  IN THIS CASE, ALLO
 UNDERSTOOD THAT THE PICTURE

00:47:56.216 --> 00:47:59.725
 WAS OF A DOG, THAT IT WAS A
 CUTE DOG, AND EVEN THE BREED

00:47:59.726 --> 00:48:03.325
 OF THE DOG.  IN OUR INTERNAL
 TESTING, WE FOUND THAT ALLO

00:48:03.326 --> 00:48:08.505
 IS 90% ACCURATE IN
 DETERMINING WHETHER A DOG

00:48:08.506 --> 00:48:11.315
 DESERVES THE "CUTE DOG"
 RESPONSE.

00:48:11.316 --> 00:48:13.915
 [ LAUGHTER ]
 SO LET'S TRY SOMETHING EVEN

00:48:13.916 --> 00:48:18.725
 HARDER.  WHEN JOY SENDS A
 PHOTO OF PASTA, WE'RE ABLE TO

00:48:18.726 --> 00:48:21.715
 IDENTIFY THE PRECISE DETAILS
 OF THE IMAGE AND CREATE SMART

00:48:21.716 --> 00:48:28.225
 REPLIES MENTION MENTIONING BOTH
 LINGUINI AND THE CLAMS. 

00:48:28.226 --> 00:48:31.125
 WHAT'S REALLY COOL HERE IS WE
 DON'T JUST IDENTIFY WHAT'S IN

00:48:31.126 --> 00:48:33.125
 THE IMAGE.  SMART REPLY
 ACTUALLY CREATES A

00:48:33.126 --> 00:48:37.415
 CONVERSATIONAL RESPONSE,
 SOMETHING LIKE "YUMMY," THE

00:48:37.416 --> 00:48:39.505
 KIND OF THING YOU WOULD
 ACTUALLY SAY IN RESPONSE TO A

00:48:39.506 --> 00:48:43.715
 PHOTO OF FOOD.  THIS IS ONLY
 POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE'VE

00:48:43.716 --> 00:48:47.025
 MARRIED OUR STRENGTHS IN
 COMPUTER VISION AND NATURAL

00:48:47.026 --> 00:48:50.905
 LANGUAGE PROCESSING.  AND IF
 YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THERE'S A

00:48:50.906 --> 00:48:53.915
 LOT OF COMPLEX TECHNOLOGY AT
 WORK HERE JUST TO HELP YOU

00:48:53.916 --> 00:48:58.225
 SAY SOMETHING AS FUN -- AS
 SIMPLE AND NATURAL AS "I LOVE

00:48:58.226 --> 00:49:03.125
 LINGUINI."  SO, THAT'S A
 LITTLE HOW ALLO HELPS YOU

00:49:03.126 --> 00:49:06.005
 EXPRESS YOURSELF AND KEEP
 YOUR CONVERSATIONS GOING.

00:49:06.006 --> 00:49:09.315
 THE INTELLIGENCE BEHIND SMART
 REPLY ALSO GIVES YOU A TASTE

00:49:09.316 --> 00:49:13.105
 AT HOW ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY
 CAN MAKE YOUR MESSAGE

00:49:13.106 --> 00:49:16.725
 EXPERIENCE SIMPLER AND MORE
 PRODUCTIVE.  THE GOOGLE

00:49:16.726 --> 00:49:20.125
 ASSISTANT BUILT RIGHT INTO
 ALLO TAKES IT EVEN FARTHER,

00:49:20.126 --> 00:49:22.825
 SO I'M PLEASED TO INTRODUCE
 ONE OF OUR LEADS, REBECCA, TO

00:49:22.826 --> 00:49:25.615
 TELL YOU MORE ABOUT THE
 ASSISTANT IN ALLO.

00:49:25.616 --> 00:49:29.925
 [ APPLAUSE ]
  &gt;&gt;Rebecca Michael:  THANKS,

00:49:29.926 --> 00:49:36.205
 ERIK.  AS YOU HEARD EARLIER,
 THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT IS AN OP

00:49:36.206 --> 00:49:38.225
 GOING DIALOG BETWEEN YOU AND
 GOOGLE THAT HELPS YOU GET

00:49:38.226 --> 00:49:41.415
 THINGS DONE IN YOUR WORLD. 
 IT'S ALSO DESIGNED AS AN

00:49:41.416 --> 00:49:44.305
 AMBIENT EXPERIENCE.  IT'S
 THERE FOR YOU WHENEVER YOU

00:49:44.306 --> 00:49:48.715
 NEED IT.  AND IN MESSAGING
 THAT REALLY MEANS BRINGING

00:49:48.716 --> 00:49:51.325
 THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT RIGHT
 INTO YOUR CONVERSATION WITH

00:49:51.326 --> 00:49:53.915
 FRIENDS.  SO I'M GOING TO
 SHOW YOU HOW THE ASSISTANT

00:49:53.916 --> 00:49:57.725
 CAN HELP IN AMIT'S AND JOY'S
 CONVERSATION.  SO THEY'RE

00:49:57.726 --> 00:50:02.325
 PLANNING A DINNER AND JOY NOW
 SAYS SHE WOULD LIKE ITALIAN

00:50:02.326 --> 00:50:06.705
 FOOD.  THE ASSISTANT
 INTELLIGENTLY RECOGNIZES THAT

00:50:06.706 --> 00:50:11.415
 THEY COULD USE SOME TIPS FOR
 ITALIAN RESTAURANTS NEAR AND

00:50:11.416 --> 00:50:13.915
 YOU CAN SEE IT'S PROACTIVE
 SUGGESTIONS AT THE BOTTOM OF

00:50:13.916 --> 00:50:17.225
 THE SCREEN.  TAPPING THIS
 BRINGS UP RESTAURANT CARDS

00:50:17.226 --> 00:50:19.705
 THAT EVERYONE IN THE CHAT CAN
 SEE.

00:50:19.706 --> 00:50:22.215
 THESE ARE POWERED GUY
 GOOGLE'S KNOWLEDGE GRAPH

00:50:22.216 --> 00:50:24.725
 WHICH MEANS THAT ALLO CAN
 HELP WITH ALL KINDS OF

00:50:24.726 --> 00:50:28.815
 INFORMATION IN THE REAL WORLD
 WORLD.  SO THERE'S SOME BACK

00:50:28.816 --> 00:50:31.325
 AND FORTH ABOUT WHICH
 RESTAURANT TO GO TO.  IT

00:50:31.326 --> 00:50:35.025
 LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE LEANING
 TOWARDS CUCINA AT 7:00.  SO

00:50:35.026 --> 00:50:37.605
 AMIT TAPS ON THE RESTAURANT
 CARD TO BRING UP MORE

00:50:37.606 --> 00:50:41.915
 DETAILS.  LOOKS GOOD.  SERVES
 PASTA WHICH WE KNOW JOY

00:50:41.916 --> 00:50:45.725
 FANCIED.  SO AMIT CAN NOW GO
 AHEAD AND MAKE A RESERVATION

00:50:45.726 --> 00:50:49.415
 RIGHT THERE THROUGH OPEN
 TABLE.  THE ASSISTANT PROMPTS

00:50:49.416 --> 00:50:52.715
 HIM TO CONFIRM THE NUMBER OF
 DINERS AND WHAT TIME THEY

00:50:52.716 --> 00:50:57.905
 WANT TO EAT.  AND NOW THEY'RE
 BOOKED AND READY TO GO.

00:50:57.906 --> 00:51:01.415
 SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE --
 [ LAUGHTER ]

00:51:01.416 --> 00:51:08.015
 WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS
 COMPLETELY NEW.  IN THE PAST,

00:51:08.016 --> 00:51:11.615
 AMIT WOULD HAVE HAD TO LEAVE
 THE CHAT TO DO A GOOGLE

00:51:11.616 --> 00:51:14.415
 SEARCH, RETURN WITH SOME
 RESTAURANT OPTIONS, SWITCH

00:51:14.416 --> 00:51:19.215
 BACK AGAIN TO SHARE THE
 OPTIONS, GO OUT AGAIN TO MAKE

00:51:19.216 --> 00:51:23.315
 THE RESERVATION AT OPEN TABLE
 AND THEN COME BACK IN TO

00:51:23.316 --> 00:51:26.205
 SHARE THE DETAILS WITH THE
 REST OF THE GROUP.  IN ALLO,

00:51:26.206 --> 00:51:29.215
 AMIT AND JOY CAN CHOOSE AND
 RESERVE A RESTAURANT RIGHT

00:51:29.216 --> 00:51:34.925
 THERE IN THE CHAT AND IN A
 NATURAL AND SEAMLESS WAY.

00:51:34.926 --> 00:51:36.926
 [ APPLAUSE ]

00:51:42.416 --> 00:51:45.715
SO OPEN TABLE WILL BE JUST
 ONE OF THE MANY PARTNERS THAT

00:51:45.716 --> 00:51:48.515
 WILL BE PART OF THE GOOGLE
 ASSISTANT ECOSYSTEM, AND WE

00:51:48.516 --> 00:51:50.525
 CAN'T WAIT TO SHARE MORE SOON
 WITH THE DEVELOPER COMMUNITY

00:51:50.526 --> 00:51:53.205
 ABOUT HOW TO GET STARTED.
 [ APPLAUSE ]

00:51:59.716 --> 00:52:01.915
COOL.  SO WE SAW SOME
 PROACTIVE SUGGESTIONS FROM

00:52:01.916 --> 00:52:05.505
 GOOGLE THERE.  YOU CAN ALSO
 CALL ON THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT

00:52:05.506 --> 00:52:10.215
 DIRECTLY AT ANY TIME JUST BY
 TYPING  @GOOGLE AS AMIT'S

00:52:10.216 --> 00:52:13.015
 DOING NOW.
 AND HE'S GOING TO ASK FOR

00:52:13.016 --> 00:52:19.215
 FUNNY CAT PICS.  REALLY,
 AMIT?  OKAY.  COOL.  SO

00:52:19.216 --> 00:52:24.515
 GOOGLE OBLIGES, OF COURSE,
 WITH A LOVELY LINEUP OF CATS

00:52:24.516 --> 00:52:28.915
 FROM GOOGLE IMAGE SEARCH. 
 WOW, THAT CHIN.

00:52:28.916 --> 00:52:33.115
 OKAY.  SO YOU JUST SAW HOW
 THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT CAN BE

00:52:33.116 --> 00:52:36.125
 REALLY HELPFUL IN GROUPS. 
 YOU CAN ALSO HAVE A ONE ON

00:52:36.126 --> 00:52:39.825
 ONE CHAT WITH GOOGLE.  WHAT
 WE'RE SEEING NOW IS AMIT'S

00:52:39.826 --> 00:52:41.915
 CONTACT LIST AND GOOGLE'S
 APPEARING AT THE TOP THERE. 

00:52:41.916 --> 00:52:46.215
 SO LET'S JUMP IN AND HAVE A
 CHAT.  JUST LIKE WITH ANY

00:52:46.216 --> 00:52:49.415
 OTHER CONVERSATION, THIS ONE
 PICKS UP RIGHT WHERE YOU LEFT

00:52:49.416 --> 00:52:52.725
 OFF AND THE ASSISTANT WILL
 REMEMBER THINGS LIKE YOUR

00:52:52.726 --> 00:52:56.705
 NAME AND EVEN TELL YOU HOW
 IT'S FEELING.  LET'S TRY

00:52:56.706 --> 00:52:59.715
 SOMETHING MORE INTERESTING. 
 AMIT'S A BIG REAL MADRID FAN

00:52:59.716 --> 00:53:03.615
 AND HE WANTS TO NOW HOW THEY
 GOT ON IN THEIR LAST MATCH. 

00:53:03.616 --> 00:53:06.915
 WE WILL ASK THE ASSISTANT: 
 DID MY TEAM WIN?  IT LOOKS

00:53:06.916 --> 00:53:10.725
 LIKE THEY DID.  THEY WON
 THEIR -- YEAH.  SO REAL

00:53:10.726 --> 00:53:12.315
 MADRID FANS OUT THERE.
 [ APPLAUSE ]

00:53:12.316 --> 00:53:15.605
 COOL.  AND SO THEY WON THEIR
 LAST MATCH ON SATURDAY. 

00:53:15.606 --> 00:53:17.606
 LET'S SEE WHEN THEY ARE
 PLAYING

00:53:20.226 --> 00:53:23.115
 NEXT.  THAT'S PRETTY
 COOL.  THEY ARE THROUGH THE

00:53:23.116 --> 00:53:25.415
 CHAMPION'S LEAGUE FINAL AT
 THE END OF THE MONTH.  WE CAN

00:53:25.416 --> 00:53:28.115
 KEEP GOING LIKE THIS AND FIND
 MORE NEWS ABOUT THE TEAM JUST

00:53:28.116 --> 00:53:30.505
 BY TAPPING ON THE SUGGESTIONS
 THERE.  BUT LET'S GO AHEAD

00:53:30.506 --> 00:53:32.506
 AND TAP ON THEIR

00:53:34.816 --> 00:53:36.015
 ROSTER.
 THERE WE GO.  WE HAVE A

00:53:36.016 --> 00:53:39.315
 CAROUSEL WITH ALL THEIR TOP
 TALENT AND SHOULD WE CHECK

00:53:39.316 --> 00:53:41.316
 OUT EVERYONE'S FAVORITE?

00:53:45.906 --> 00:53:50.025
 MR. RONALDO.  LET'S SEE SOME
 OF HIS BEST TRICKS.

00:53:50.026 --> 00:53:55.215
 SO AMIT ONLY HAS TO TYPE
 "BEST TRICKS" AND THE

00:53:55.216 --> 00:53:57.715
 ASSISTANT UNDERSTANDS THE
 CONTEXT AND THAT HE MEANS

00:53:57.716 --> 00:53:59.915
 RONALDO'S BEST TRICKS AND
 RESPONDS WITH A YouTUBE

00:53:59.916 --> 00:54:01.515
 VIDEO.
 [ APPLAUSE ]

00:54:07.416 --> 00:54:10.515
WE WON'T PLAY THAT VIDEO NOW,
 BUT IF WE DID TAP IT, IT

00:54:10.516 --> 00:54:14.015
 WOULD PLAY RIGHT THERE IN THE
 CHAT.

00:54:14.016 --> 00:54:18.815
 SO, LET'S PLAY A GAME
 INSTEAD.  AMIT'S ASKING

00:54:18.816 --> 00:54:24.915
 GOOGLE TO PLAY A GAME.  AND,
 OKAY.  GOOGLE'S SUGGESTING

00:54:24.916 --> 00:54:28.915
 THE INC. EMOJI GAME.  THE WAY 
THIS

00:54:28.916 --> 00:54:31.505
 WORKS GOOGLE PROVIDES A
 STRING OF EMOJI AND YOU HAVE

00:54:31.506 --> 00:54:36.615
 TO GUESS THE FILM TITLE.  ARE
 YOU READY?

00:54:36.616 --> 00:54:39.115
 &gt;&gt;&gt; YES!
 &gt;&gt;Rebecca Michael:  YEAH? 

00:54:39.116 --> 00:54:43.015
 LET'S PLAY!
 OKAY.  SO LOOKS LIKE WE'VE

00:54:43.016 --> 00:54:48.225
 GOT A CROWN AND SOME RINGS. 
 ANY IDEAS?

00:54:48.226 --> 00:54:50.615
 &gt;&gt;&gt; LORD OF THE RINGS.
 &gt;&gt;Rebecca Michael:  I HEAR

00:54:50.616 --> 00:54:53.106
 THE PRINCESS BRIDE OVER
 THERE.  AMIT, ANY IDEAS?

00:54:59.116 --> 00:55:03.315
 LORD OF THE RINGS.  OH, IT
 WAS TOO EASY.  OKAY.  WE

00:55:03.316 --> 00:55:05.415
 COULD KEEP GOING BUT I THINK
 YOU GOT THE IDEA.  SO THAT

00:55:05.416 --> 00:55:06.715
 WAS OBVIOUSLY --
 [ LAUGHTER ]

00:55:09.816 --> 00:55:14.716
SHOULD WE KEEP GOING?  NO.
 ANY IDEAS?

00:55:18.226 --> 00:55:22.715
  THEY'RE GOOD.
 OKAY.  SO THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A

00:55:22.716 --> 00:55:26.525
 SUPER SIM MEL GAME AND
  SIMPLE GAME AND THERE'S

00:55:26.526 --> 00:55:28.705
 A BUNCH MORE YOU CAN PLAY IN
 ALLO.  WE REALLY THINK THE

00:55:28.706 --> 00:55:31.315
 BEST GAMES WILL COME FROM THE
 DEVELOPER COMMUNITY.

00:55:31.316 --> 00:55:32.515
 SO --
 [ APPLAUSE ]

00:55:39.516 --> 00:55:44.015
SO THAT WAS THE ASSISTANT IN
 ALLO. ALLOWING YOU TO HARNESS

00:55:44.016 --> 00:55:46.305
 ALL OF THE RICHNESS AND
 KNOWLEDGE FROM GOOGLE FROM

00:55:46.306 --> 00:55:50.015
 SEARCH, YouTUBE'S, MAPS,
 PHOTOS AS WELL AS MANY OF OUR

00:55:50.016 --> 00:55:54.525
 PARTNERS TO HAVE FUN AND GET
 THINGS DONE.  AS YOU SAW, THE

00:55:54.526 --> 00:55:58.115
 INTERFACE IS INHERENTLY
 PERSONAL AND CONVERSATIONAL

00:55:58.116 --> 00:56:01.315
 AND THE SMART SUGGESTIONS
 CHIP HELP TO KEEP THE

00:56:01.316 --> 00:56:03.215
 CONVERSATION FLOWING.  MOST
 IMPORTANTLY FOR THE FIRST

00:56:03.216 --> 00:56:07.025
 TIME, YOU CAN USE GOOGLE IN
 YOUR CHATS WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

00:56:07.026 --> 00:56:09.425
 AND WITH THAT, I'LL HAND IT
 BACK TO ERIK.

00:56:09.426 --> 00:56:14.525
 [ APPLAUSE ]
  &gt;&gt;Erik Kay:  THANKS, REBECCA.

00:56:14.526 --> 00:56:18.015
 AND THANKS, AMIT.
 I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE

00:56:18.016 --> 00:56:21.215
 POSSIBILITIES THAT GOOGLE
 ASSISTANT BRINGS TO

00:56:21.216 --> 00:56:23.305
 MESSAGING.
 NOW LET'S TALK A BIT ABOUT

00:56:23.306 --> 00:56:27.315
 PRIVACY AND SECURITY.  WE
 REALIZE THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE

00:56:27.316 --> 00:56:32.915
 WANT TO BE INCOGNITO.  OF
 COURSE, THIS APPLIES TO CHAT

00:56:32.916 --> 00:56:36.115
 AS WELL.  SO, FOLLOWING IN
 THE FOOTSTEPS OF CHROME,

00:56:36.116 --> 00:56:41.015
 WE'VE CREATED AN INCOGNITO
 MODE FOR ALLO.  WHILE ALL

00:56:41.016 --> 00:56:45.305
 MESSAGES IN ALLO ARE
 ENCRYPTED, CHATS IN INCOGNITO

00:56:45.306 --> 00:56:50.015
 MODE ARE END-TO-END
 ENCRYPTED.  INCOGNITO CHATS

00:56:50.016 --> 00:56:55.915
 HAVE DISCEET NOTIFICATIONS
 BEHINDING THE SENDERS AND

00:56:55.916 --> 00:57:00.205
 SHOULDER SURFERS AND PRYING
 EYES.  INCOGNITO ALSO OFFERS

00:57:00.206 --> 00:57:03.505
 MESSAGE EXPIRATION SO YOU'RE
 IN CONTROL OF HOW LONG YOUR

00:57:03.506 --> 00:57:06.115
 PRIVATE MESSAGES STICK
 AROUND.  AND SIMILAR TO WHEN

00:57:06.116 --> 00:57:10.315
 YOU CLOSE AN INCOGNITO WINDOW
 IN CHROME, WHEN YOU DELETE AN

00:57:10.316 --> 00:57:13.615
 INCOGNITO CONVERSATION IN
 ALLO, IT'S GONE FOREVER AND

00:57:13.616 --> 00:57:17.815
 NO ONE CAN SEE IT AGAIN ON
 YOUR DEVICE.  WITH INCOGNITO

00:57:17.816 --> 00:57:22.215
 MODE, ALLO GIVES PIEWFERS
  USERS

00:57:22.216 --> 00:57:23.825
 ADDITIONAL CONTROLS OVER
 THEIR PRIVACY AND SECURITY

00:57:23.826 --> 00:57:26.615
 AND WE ANTICIPATE ADDING EVEN
 MORE SECURITY FEATURES TO IT

00:57:26.616 --> 00:57:30.715
 OVER TIME.
 SO THAT'S ALLO.  ALLO IS

00:57:30.716 --> 00:57:34.115
 FAST, SMART, AND SECURE AND
 IT LET'S YOU EXPRESS YOURSELF

00:57:34.116 --> 00:57:37.225
 IN FUN NEW WAYS.  AND ALLO
 WILL BE THE FIRST HOME FOR

00:57:37.226 --> 00:57:40.125
 THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT AS IT
 STARTS TO TAKE SHAPE,

00:57:40.126 --> 00:57:44.005
 BRINGING THE RICHNESS OF
 GOOGLE RIGHT INTO YOUR CHATS.

00:57:44.006 --> 00:57:49.315
 NOW, ALLO IS ALL ABOUT
 MESSAGING BUT LET ME TALK TO

00:57:49.316 --> 00:57:53.915
 YOU A MINUTE ABOUT VIDEO
 CALLING.  JUST AS TECHNOLOGY

00:57:53.916 --> 00:57:57.425
 HAS HELPED CONNECT PEOPLE
 THROUGH MESSAGING, VIDEO

00:57:57.426 --> 00:58:00.415
 CALLING HAS BROUGHT FAMILIES
 AND FRIENDS TOGETHER FROM

00:58:00.416 --> 00:58:06.705
 AROUND THE WORLD.  IT CAN BE
 A MAGICAL EXPERIENCE, SO WHY

00:58:06.706 --> 00:58:10.125
 DON'T WE PICK UP THE PHONE
 AND DO IT MORE OFTEN?  WELL,

00:58:10.126 --> 00:58:15.115
 MAYBE THE OTHER PERSON HAS A
 DIFFERENT KIND OF PHONE. 

00:58:15.116 --> 00:58:19.325
 MAYBE THE CONNECTION IS A
 LITTLE SPOTTY.  AND EVEN WHEN

00:58:19.326 --> 00:58:24.725
 IT DOES WORK, GETTING A CALL
 CAN OFTEN FEEL INTRUSIVE

00:58:24.726 --> 00:58:27.625
 BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT QUITE SURE
 WHY THE OTHER PERSON'S

00:58:27.626 --> 00:58:30.105
 CALLING.
 THAT'S WHY WE CHALLENGED

00:58:30.106 --> 00:58:34.725
 OURSELVES TO DESIGN A VIDEO
 CALLING EXPERIENCE THAT WOULD

00:58:34.726 --> 00:58:40.015
 FEEL MAGICAL EVERY TIME.  SO,
 I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO

00:58:40.016 --> 00:58:46.425
 DUO., A SIMPLE ONE-TO-ONE
 CALLING APP FOR EVERYONE.

00:58:46.426 --> 00:58:48.426
 [ APPLAUSE ]

00:58:51.216 --> 00:58:56.215
DUO IS THE VIDEO COMPANION TO
 ALLO.  IT'S FAST AND PERFORMS

00:58:56.216 --> 00:59:00.405
 WELL EVEN ON SLOW NETWORKS. 
 IT'S END-TO-END ENCRYPTED. 

00:59:00.406 --> 00:59:03.415
 IT'S BASED ON YOUR PHONE
 NUMBER ALLOWING YOU TO EASILY

00:59:03.416 --> 00:59:06.715
 GET IN TOUCH WITH THE PEOPLE
 YOU CARE ABOUT AND IT WORKS

00:59:06.716 --> 00:59:11.115
 ON BOTH ANDROID AND iOS.
 BUT HERE'S A FEATURE THAT

00:59:11.116 --> 00:59:16.925
 MAKES ALLO REALLY SPECIAL. 
 WE CALL IT KNOCK KNOCK. 

00:59:16.926 --> 00:59:20.715
 KNOCK KNOCK SHOWS YOU A LIVE
 VIDEO STREAM OF THE CALLER

00:59:20.716 --> 00:59:25.425
 BEFORE YOU'VE EVEN PICKED UP. 
 NOT ONLY CAN YOU SEE WHO'S

00:59:25.426 --> 00:59:30.215

 TO AND WHY THEY'RE CALLING, A

 SPONTANEOUS AND NATURAL.

00:59:38.326 --> 00:59:41.615
 AND ONCE YOU PICK UP, DUO

 CHANGES WHAT IT'S LIKE TO

00:59:49.216 --> 00:59:51.216
 RECEIVE A VIDEO CALL.  SO

 APPARENTLY, TOO, IS POPPING

01:00:14.406 --> 01:00:17.515
 MAKING FUNNY FACES.  I CAN

01:00:44.926 --> 01:00:46.926
 &gt;&gt;Erik Kay:  OOPS.

01:00:51.116 --> 01:00:54.625
SO YOU JUST SAW HOW KNOCK
 KNOCK DREW US INTO THE

01:00:54.626 --> 01:00:58.825
 CONVERSATION WITH AVA AND
 ELENA BEFORE WE EVEN PICKED

01:00:58.826 --> 01:01:01.505
 IT UP AND HOW FAST AND SMOOTH
 IT WAS.  NOW, KNOCK KNOCK

01:01:01.506 --> 01:01:04.405
 ONLY WORKS WHEN THE VIDEO IS
 INSTANT.  THERE CAN'T BE A

01:01:04.406 --> 01:01:07.915
 GAP BETWEEN THE PHONE RINGING
 AND THE VIDEO APPEARING. 

01:01:07.916 --> 01:01:12.315
 THIS IS A REALLY HARD TEXAS

01:01:12.316 --> 01:01:14.715
 TECHNICAL PROBLEM BUT WE'RE
 UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO TACKLE

01:01:14.716 --> 01:01:19.525
 IT.  DUO WAS BUILT BY THE
 TEAM THAT WAS CREATED WEBRTC 

01:01:19.526 --> 01:01:20.915
THE OPEN
 SOURCE PLATFORM THAT NOW

01:01:20.916 --> 01:01:23.605
 POWERS MUCH OF TODAY'S MOBILE
 VIDEO COMMUNICATION.  WE KNOW

01:01:23.606 --> 01:01:27.825
 THEY TECHNOLOGY LIKE NO ONE
 ELSE.  WE USED A NEW PROTOCOL

01:01:27.826 --> 01:01:31.425
 CALLED QUIC THAT ALLOWS DUO
 TO ESTABLISH AN ENCRYPTED

01:01:31.426 --> 01:01:35.215
 CONNECTION IN A SINGLE ROUND
 TRIP.  WE OBSESSED OVER EVERY

01:01:35.216 --> 01:01:39.205
 LAST DETAIL OF VIDEO
 TRANSMISSION, HAND TUNING AND

01:01:39.206 --> 01:01:43.515
 OPTIMIZING CODECS, BANDWIDTH
 PROBING, ENCRYPTION AND MORE. 

01:01:43.516 --> 01:01:47.305
 THE RESULT IS THE UNIQUE FEEL
 OF KNOCK KNOCK.  YOU'RE RIGHT

01:01:47.306 --> 01:01:49.306
 THERE IN AN

01:01:51.316 --> 01:01:52.625
 INSTANT.
 SO THE OTHER THING THAT

01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:58.615
 REALLY SETS DUO APART IS HOW
 RELIABLE IT MAKES VIDEO

01:01:58.616 --> 01:02:02.315

 YOU ARE, WHETHER IT'S

01:02:02.316 --> 01:02:06.105

 DEGRADE GRACEFULLY WHEN
 BANDWIDTH IS LIMITED AND TO

 SEAMLESSLY SWITCH BETWEEN
 WiFi AND CELLAR.  AND, OF

01:02:19.226 --> 01:02:21.205
 COURSE, THIS ALL HAPPENS
 AUTOMATICALLY BEHIND THE

01:02:21.206 --> 01:02:24.625
 SCENES SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO
 WORRY ABOUT IT.

01:02:24.626 --> 01:02:28.525
 ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY COMBINES
 WITH A SMOOTH INTERFACE THAT

 THE N RELEASE, WE WANTED TO
 ACHIEVE A NEW LEVEL OF

01:06:37.591 --> 01:06:40.489

 ABOUT REDESIGNING AND

01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:43.898
 REWRITING MANY FUNDAMENTAL
 ASPECTS OF HOW THE SYSTEM

01:06:43.899 --> 01:06:47.214

 HOW THEY USE THEIR PHONES,

 AND MORE USEFUL.

 BY RELEASING EARLY DEVELOPER
 PREVIEWS OF THE N RELEASE

01:07:04.561 --> 01:07:07.358

 YOUR FEEDBACK.
 ALSO, GETTING THE PLATFORM

01:07:14.278 --> 01:07:16.899

 MORE TIME FOR APP DEVELOPERS

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:19.498
 AND DEVICE MAKERS TO BE READY
 FOR THE RELEASE LATER THIS

01:07:19.499 --> 01:07:23.808

 THE RESPONSE TO THE N

01:07:23.809 --> 01:07:26.527

 IN RECENT ANDROID RELEASES,
 WE EXTENDED THE OpenGL

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:36.241
 STANDARD TO BRING ADVANCED
 GRAPHICS CAPABILITIES,

01:08:36.242 --> 01:08:39.866
 USUALLY FOUND ON DESKTOP AND
 GAME CONSOLES, TO MOBILE.

01:08:39.867 --> 01:08:43.270
 WITH N, WE'RE MAKING OUR
 BIGGEST LEAP FORWARD WITH THE

01:08:43.271 --> 01:08:48.101
 INTRODUCTION OF VULKAN.
 VULKAN IS A MODERN 3D

01:08:48.102 --> 01:08:51.194
 GRAPHICS API DESIGNED TO GIVE
 GAME DEVELOPERS DIRECT

01:08:51.195 --> 01:08:55.307
 CONTROL OF THE GPU TO PRODUCE
 INCREDIBLE GRAPHICS AND

01:08:55.308 --> 01:08:57.419
 COMPUTE PERFORMANCE.
 AND WE MADE A CONCERTED

01:08:57.420 --> 01:08:59.723
 EFFORT TO WORK WITH THE
 INDUSTRY ON VULKAN SO YOU CAN

01:08:59.724 --> 01:09:05.541
 USE THE SAME PAYS AND
 GRAPHICS ASSETS AND SHADERS

01:09:05.542 --> 01:09:07.538
 ON THE DESKTOP AS WELL AS
 MOBILE.

01:09:07.539 --> 01:09:12.154
 BECAUSE VULKAN HAS A LOWER
 CPU OVERHEAD THAN OpenGL,

01:09:12.155 --> 01:09:15.170
 GAME DEVELOPERS ARE ABLE TO
 SQUEEZE IN MORE EFFECTS PER

01:09:15.171 --> 01:09:18.388
 FRAME WHILE STILL MAINTAINING
 A HIGH FRAME RATE.  LET'S

01:09:18.389 --> 01:09:22.691
 TAKE A LOOK AT A NEXUS 6P
 RUNNING A KNEW VERSION OF THE

01:09:22.692 --> 01:09:24.713
 NEED FOR SPEED GAME BY
 ELECTRONIC ARTS AND THERE ARE

01:09:24.714 --> 01:09:27.613
 A BUNCH OF REALLY NICE
 IMPROVEMENTS IN THIS VERSION

01:09:27.614 --> 01:09:30.931
 THANKS TO VULKAN.  YOU'LL
 NOTICE THE BEAUTIFUL GRAPHICS

01:09:30.932 --> 01:09:35.139
 IN REFLEXION ON THE CAR. 
 ALSO CHECK OUT THE REALISTIC

01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:37.548
 MOTION BLUR EFFECT WHICH IS
 COMPUTED FOR EVERY OBJECT AT

01:09:37.549 --> 01:09:40.362
 THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.
 AND THERE'S A REALLY NICE

01:09:40.363 --> 01:09:43.251
 WATER SURFACE EFFECT ON THE
 ROAD.  AND THE SHADERS FOR

01:09:43.252 --> 01:09:45.975
 THESE ARE PRE-COMPILED AHEAD
 OF TIME AND CAN NOW RUN

01:09:45.976 --> 01:09:48.582
 ANYWHERE.
 SO THAT'S GRAPHICS

01:09:48.583 --> 01:09:52.092
 PERFORMANCE.
 WE'VE ALSO SPENT A LOT OF

01:09:52.093 --> 01:09:55.803
 EFFORT WORKING ON IMPROVING
 THE ANDROID RUNTIME.

01:09:55.804 --> 01:10:00.721
 FIRST, WE'VE MADE MAJOR
 OPTIMIZATIONS TO OUR

01:10:00.722 --> 01:10:05.226
 COMPILER.  THE COMPILER IN N
 PERFORMS ANYTHING FROM 30 TO

01:10:05.227 --> 01:10:09.552
 600% FASTER ON MAJOR CPU
 BENCHMARKS LIKE DHRYSTONE.

01:10:09.553 --> 01:10:14.457
 SECOND, WE'VE ADDED A NEW
 JUST-IN-TIME OR LEGITIMATE

01:10:14.458 --> 01:10:17.472
 COMPILE HE COMPILER AND
 LEGITIMATE COMPILATION MEANS

01:10:17.473 --> 01:10:22.293
 THAT APP INSTALLS ARE FASTER. 
 75% FASTER IN N.  SO NOW

01:10:22.294 --> 01:10:25.618
 USERS CAN GET UP AND RUNNING
 MUCH MORE QUICKLY ON YOUR

01:10:25.619 --> 01:10:28.330
 APPS.  AND ALSO BECAUSE
 LEGITIMATE IS MORE SELECTIVE

01:10:28.331 --> 01:10:35.339
 ABOUT WHICH METHODS IT
 COMPILES, BY A FULL 50%.

01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:37.345
 NOW, UNLIKE CONVENTIONAL
 LEGITIMATE SYSTEMS, THE

01:10:37.346 --> 01:10:40.947
 ANDROID RUNTIME USES PROFILE
 GUIDE THE OPTIMIZATION TO

01:10:40.948 --> 01:10:43.561
 WRITE COMPILED CODE TO FLASH
 FOR THE NEXT TIME YOU RUN THE

01:10:43.562 --> 01:10:46.366
 APP, SO THIS IMPROVES
 PERFORMANCE AND REDUCES

01:10:46.367 --> 01:10:50.171
 BATTERY CONSUMPTION.
 IN SUMMARY, THE NEW

01:10:50.172 --> 01:10:52.980
 LEGITIMATE COMPILER IMPROVES
 SOFTWARE PERFORMANCE, MAKES

01:10:52.981 --> 01:10:55.383
 INSTALLS FASTER, AND REDUCES
 THE AMOUNT OF STORAGE YOU

01:10:55.384 --> 01:10:59.494
 NEED FOR APPS ON YOUR DEVICE.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT ANOTHER BIG

01:10:59.495 --> 01:11:03.006
 AREA OF FOCUS FOR US. 
 SECURITY.

01:11:03.007 --> 01:11:06.114
 WE DESIGNED ANDROID FROM THE
 BEGINNING WITH A MULTILAYERED

01:11:06.115 --> 01:11:09.027
 DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH SECURITY
 ARCHITECTURE.

01:11:09.028 --> 01:11:12.358
 AND ANDROID EMPLOYS THE
 LATEST CUTTING-EDGE SECURITY

01:11:12.359 --> 01:11:16.165
 TECHNOLOGIES.  THINGS LIKE
 SELINUX, VERIFIED BOOT

01:11:16.166 --> 01:11:18.263
 INTEGRITY, AND FULL DISK
 ENCRYPTION.

01:11:18.264 --> 01:11:21.476
 WITH N, WE'RE CONTINUING TO
 STRENGTHEN OUR DEFENSES IN

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:26.304
 THREE KEY WAYS.
 FIRST, N INTRODUCES

01:11:26.305 --> 01:11:28.908
 FILE-BASED ENCRYPTION.  BY
 ENCRYPTING AT THE FILE LEVEL

01:11:28.909 --> 01:11:32.308
 INSTEAD OF THE BLOCK LEVEL,
 WE'RE ABLE TO BETTER ISOLATE

01:11:32.309 --> 01:11:35.907
 AND PROTECT INDIVIDUAL USERS
 OF THE SYSTEM.

01:11:35.908 --> 01:11:38.632
 SECOND, WE LEARNED THE
 IMPORTANCE LAST YEAR OF

01:11:38.633 --> 01:11:41.928
 HARDENING THE SECURITY OF THE
 MEDIA FRAMEWORK.  ESPECIALLY

01:11:41.929 --> 01:11:44.237
 SINCE IT'S ACCESSING FILES
 FROM ANYWHERE ON THE

01:11:44.238 --> 01:11:47.954
 INTERNET.
 SO IN N, WE'VE SPLIT OUT KEY

01:11:47.955 --> 01:11:52.755
 SUBSYSTEMS INTO INDIVIDUAL
 SELINUX PROTECTED PROCESSES. 

01:11:52.756 --> 01:11:56.070
 THINGS LIKE CODECS AND FILE
 EXTRACTORS.  BY IMPROVING THE

01:11:56.071 --> 01:11:58.178
 SECURITY OF THE MEDIA
 FRAMEWORK, WE IMPROVE THE

01:11:58.179 --> 01:12:00.914
 SECURITY OF THE ENTIRE
 DEVICE.

01:12:00.915 --> 01:12:03.820
 THIRD, AND THIS IS SOMETHING
 THAT'S REALLY COOL, N

01:12:03.821 --> 01:12:06.925
 AUTOMATICALLY KEEPS YOUR
 PHONE UP-TO-DATE WITH THE

01:12:06.926 --> 01:12:10.733
 LATEST VERSION OF THE SYSTEM
 SOFTWARE WITHOUT YOU HAVING

01:12:10.734 --> 01:12:14.643
 TO DO ANYTHING.
 LIKE CHROMEBOOKS, NEW ANDROID

01:12:14.644 --> 01:12:18.356
 DEVICES BUILT ON N HAVE TWO
 SYSTEM UPDATE -- TWO SYSTEM

01:12:18.357 --> 01:12:21.174
 IMAGES.  SO WHEN AN UPDATE IS
 AVAILABLE, YOUR PHONE WILL

01:12:21.175 --> 01:12:24.173
 AUTOMATICALLY DOWNLOAD THE
 NEW SYSTEM IMAGE IN THE

01:12:24.174 --> 01:12:26.490
 BACKGROUND.
 SO THE NEXT TIME YOU POWER UP

01:12:26.491 --> 01:12:29.812
 YOUR PHONE, IT WILL
 SEAMLESSLY SWITCH INTO THE

01:12:29.813 --> 01:12:32.117
 NEW SOFTWARE IMAGE.
 YOU'RE NO LONGER ASKED FOR

01:12:32.118 --> 01:12:35.441
 YOUR PASSWORD WHEN THE PHONE
 POWERS UP, THANKS TO

01:12:35.442 --> 01:12:37.438
 FILE-BASED ENCRYPTION AND A
 NEW FEATURE CALLED "DIRECT

01:12:37.439 --> 01:12:42.447
 BOOT."  AND THAT PESKY
 "ANDROID IS UPGRADING

01:12:42.448 --> 01:12:45.643
 DIALOGUE" IS FINALLY GONE,
 THANKS TO THE NEW LEGITIMATE

01:12:49.053 --> 01:12:51.364
 JIT
 COMPILER.

01:12:51.365 --> 01:12:53.074
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 IS ACTUALLY DELETING CODE, BY

01:12:53.075 --> 01:12:56.591
 THE WAY.  ALL RIGHT.  THIS
 APPROACH TO SOFTWARE UPDATES

01:12:56.592 --> 01:12:58.607
 IS ONE OF THE MOST LOVED
 FEATURES OF CHROMEBOOKS AND

01:12:58.608 --> 01:13:01.004
 I'M REALLY EXCITED TO BRING
 IT TO MOBILE AS WELL.  SO

01:13:01.005 --> 01:13:04.721
 THAT'S SOME OF THE WAYS WE'RE
 IMPROVING SECURITY MECHANISMS

01:13:04.722 --> 01:13:07.515
 IN THE PLATFORM BUT LET'S NOT
 FORGET ABOUT ALL OF THE

01:13:07.516 --> 01:13:10.319
 SECURITY SERVICES THAT GOOGLE
 PROVIDES TO KEEP ALL ANDROID

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:12.830
 DEVICES SAFE.
 IN FACT, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

01:13:12.831 --> 01:13:16.335
 THE SCALE OF ANDROID AND
 GOOGLE PLAY AND THE NUMBER OF

01:13:16.336 --> 01:13:20.351
 DEVICES AND APPS OUT THERE,
 WE'RE PROVIDING ONE OF THE

01:13:20.352 --> 01:13:23.158
 MOST COMPREHENSIVE MOBILE
 SECURITY SOLUTIONS IN THE

01:13:23.159 --> 01:13:25.360
 WORLD.
 LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT A FEW

01:13:25.361 --> 01:13:29.184
 EXAMPLES.
 GOOGLE CHROME PROTECTS USERS

01:13:29.185 --> 01:13:32.487
 WHEN THEY'RE SURFING THE WEB
 THROUGH A SYSTEM CALLED SAFE

01:13:32.488 --> 01:13:34.801
 BROWSING.  SAFE BROWSING
 WARNS USERS AHEAD OF TIME

01:13:34.802 --> 01:13:38.716
 WHEN THEY'RE ABOUT TO GO TO A
 SITE THAT WE KNOW CONTAINS NO 

01:13:38.717 --> 01:13:40.930
-- MALWARE OR IS KNOWN TO
 BE DECEPTIVE.

01:13:40.931 --> 01:13:44.342
 TODAY, WE'RE PROTECTING OVER
 1 BILLION MOBILE CHROME

01:13:44.343 --> 01:13:47.158
 USERS.
 ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW WE

01:13:47.159 --> 01:13:51.461
 PROTECT USERS IS THROUGH THE
 GOOGLE PLAY STORE.  ALL

01:13:51.462 --> 01:13:54.466
 ANDROID APPS UNDERGO RIGOROUS
 SECURITY TESTING BEFORE

01:13:54.467 --> 01:13:57.965
 APPEARING ON THE STORE.
 WE REVIEW EVERY APP TO MAKE

01:13:57.966 --> 01:14:02.879
 SURE IT MEETS OUR POLICIES.
 WE ALSO RUN AN APP SECURITY

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:06.000
 IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM WITH
 DEVELOPERS TO IDENTIFY

01:14:06.001 --> 01:14:08.697
 POTENTIAL SECURITY
 VULNERABILITIES.  FOR

01:14:08.698 --> 01:14:11.100
 EXAMPLE, WE'VE WORKED WITH
 KEY BANKING AND eCOMMERCE

01:14:11.101 --> 01:14:16.131
 APPLICATIONS TO SURE THEY'RE
 USING HTTPS PROPERLY TO

01:14:16.132 --> 01:14:18.437
 PROTECT AGAINST
 MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE ATTACKS. 

01:14:18.438 --> 01:14:21.848
 GOOGLE PLAY ITSELF IS BUILT
 ON A STATE-OF-THE-ART

01:14:21.849 --> 01:14:25.159
 CLOUD-BASED INFRASTRUCTURE WE
 CALL "SAFETYNET."

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:28.371
 SAFETYNET -- WITH SAFETYNET
 GOOGLE'S EXPERT SYSTEMS AND

01:14:28.372 --> 01:14:30.478
 MACHINE LEARNING MODELS
 ANALYZE BILLIONS OF SIGNALS

01:14:30.479 --> 01:14:34.098
 EVERY DAY TO PREDICT BAD
 BEHAVIOR.  IF AN APP STEPS

01:14:34.099 --> 01:14:38.018
 OUT OF LINE, GOOGLE PLAY WILL
 BLOCK OR UNINSTALL THE APP,

01:14:38.019 --> 01:14:40.304
 NO MATTER WHERE IT WAS
 INSTALLED FROM.

01:14:40.305 --> 01:14:45.431
 AND THE SCALE OF SAFETYNET IS
 EXTRAORDINARY.  EVERY DAY, WE 

01:14:45.432 --> 01:14:49.749
-- WE TEST OVER A BILLION
 DEVICES AND OVER 8 BILLION

01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:52.456
 INSTALLED APPS.  AND ALL OF
 THIS HAPPENS UNDER THE HOOD

01:14:52.457 --> 01:14:55.654
 TO KEEP YOU SAFE AND SECURE,
 NO MATTER WHAT VERSION OF

01:14:55.655 --> 01:14:59.590
 ANDROID YOU'RE ON.
 LET'S MOVE ON.

01:14:59.591 --> 01:15:04.301
 A THIRD AREA OF FOCUS FOR US
 IS OUR CONTINUED EFFORT TO

01:15:04.302 --> 01:15:06.808
 IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY.  AND
 WE'VE TAKEN A CLOSE LOOK AT

01:15:06.809 --> 01:15:09.711
 HOW PEOPLE MULTITASK ON
 ANDROID, TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S

01:15:09.712 --> 01:15:12.520
 WORKING FOR THEM AND WHERE WE
 CAN IMPROVE.

01:15:12.521 --> 01:15:16.024
 AND WE'VE PARTICULARLY
 FOCUSED ON THE RECENT APPS

01:15:16.025 --> 01:15:18.536
 SCREEN.  AND WHAT WE LEARNED
 FROM OUR USER RESEARCH IS

01:15:18.537 --> 01:15:22.344
 THAT OVER 99% OF THE TIME,
 PEOPLE ONLY SELECT AN APP

01:15:22.345 --> 01:15:26.372
 WITHIN THE LAST SEVEN.
 SO WE DECIDED TO SIMPLIFY BY

01:15:26.373 --> 01:15:29.773
 AUTOMATICALLY REMOVING APPS
 IN THE LIST THAT YOU HAVEN'T

01:15:29.774 --> 01:15:31.779
 USED IN A WHILE.
 THIS THEN MAKES IT MUCH

01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:34.796
 EASIER TO FIND THE APP THAT
 YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

01:15:34.797 --> 01:15:39.510
 ALSO, BASED ON POPULAR
 DEMAND, WE'VE FINALLY ADDED A

01:15:39.511 --> 01:15:40.706
 "CLEAR ALL" BUTTON AT THE
 TOP.

01:15:40.707 --> 01:15:44.908
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 YEAH.  FEELS GOOD!

01:15:44.909 --> 01:15:48.027
 BUT MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE
 FEATURE IS SOMETHING THAT WE

01:15:48.028 --> 01:15:51.923
 CALL "QUICK SWITCH."  YOU CAN
 NOW FLIP TO THE PREVIOUS APP

01:15:51.924 --> 01:15:54.337
 YOU WERE IN JUST BY
 DOUBLE-TAPPING THE RECENTS

01:15:54.338 --> 01:15:57.452
 BUTTON FROM ANYWHERE.  YOU
 CAN THINK OF IT LIKE A

01:15:57.453 --> 01:16:00.658
 SIMPLIFIED ALT-TAB.  AND IT'S
 AMAZINGLY USEFUL IN SO MANY

01:16:00.659 --> 01:16:03.170
 SITUATIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE,
 LET'S SAY I'M IN A PHONE CALL

01:16:03.171 --> 01:16:06.502
 AND I'M TRYING TO COORDINATE
 AN EVENT.  I CAN FLIP OVER TO

01:16:06.503 --> 01:16:09.692
 THE CALENDAR APP I WAS JUST
 IN BY DOUBLE-TAPPING THE

01:16:09.693 --> 01:16:12.312
 RECENTS BUTTON AT THE BOTTOM
 RIGHT.  FROM THERE, I CAN

01:16:12.313 --> 01:16:15.324
 CHECK MY SCHEDULE AND THEN
 FLIP BACK TO THE DIALER BY

01:16:15.325 --> 01:16:18.226
 DOUBLE-TAPPING THE RECENTS
 BUTTON AGAIN.  IT'S PRETTY

01:16:18.227 --> 01:16:20.139
 COOL.
 NOW, MANY OF YOU HAVE ALSO

01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:23.652
 ASKED FOR THE ABILITY TO
 DISPLAY MORE THAN ONE APP AT

01:16:23.653 --> 01:16:26.373
 THE SAME TIME.  SO WE'VE
 INVESTED A LOT OF EFFORT IN

01:16:26.374 --> 01:16:29.973
 REDESIGNING OUR WINDOW
 MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IN N.

01:16:29.974 --> 01:16:33.995
 AND WE'RE INTRODUCING TWO
 POWERFUL NEW WINDOWING MODES

01:16:33.996 --> 01:16:36.418
 IN THIS RELEASE: 
 SPLIT-SCREEN AND

01:16:36.419 --> 01:16:40.131
 PICTURE-IN-PICTURE. 
 SPLINT-SCREEN IS DESIGNED FOR

01:16:40.132 --> 01:16:43.034
 TABLETS AND PHONES AND IT'S
 REALLY SIMPLE TO USE.

01:16:43.035 --> 01:16:46.248
 SO FOLKS LET'S SAY I'M
 WATCHING A VIDEO ON YouTUBE

01:16:46.249 --> 01:16:51.760
 TO LEARN HOW TO MAKE THE BEST
 NACHOS.  I CAN LONG-TAP ON

01:16:51.761 --> 01:16:56.559
 THE RECENTS BUTTON TO ENTER
 MULTI-WINDOW AND FROM LAUNCH

01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.864
 SOMETHING LIKE GOOGLE KEEP,
 FOR EXAMPLE.  NOW YOU CAN

01:16:58.865 --> 01:17:00.671
 UPDATE MY SHOPPING LIST FOR
 INGREDIENTS WHILE I'M

01:17:00.672 --> 01:17:02.487
 WATCHING THE VIDEO.
 THE SECOND MODE,

01:17:02.488 --> 01:17:05.011
 PICTURE-IN-PICTURE, IS
 DESIGNED FOR ANDROID TV AND

01:17:05.012 --> 01:17:08.818
 IT'S A GREAT WAY TO LET YOU
 KEEP WATCHING SOMETHING WHILE

01:17:08.819 --> 01:17:11.124
 YOU PERFORM ANOTHER TASK. 
 FOR EXAMPLE, LET'S SAY I'M

01:17:11.125 --> 01:17:14.433
 WATCHING A LIVE TV PROGRAM ON
 RETRO GAMING AND THEY'RE

01:17:14.434 --> 01:17:16.745
 TALKING ABOUT PACMAN AND I
 WANT TO SEE IF I CAN INSTALL

01:17:16.746 --> 01:17:20.051
 AND PLAY THE GAME MYSELF.
 I CAN PUT THE LIVE CONTENT

01:17:20.052 --> 01:17:24.168
 INTO PICTURE-IN-PICTURE MODE
 TO KEEP WATCHING IT AND THEN

01:17:24.169 --> 01:17:26.959
 GO AHEAD AND PERFORM A VOICE
 SEARCH FOR PACMAN.  THIS WILL

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:29.578
 THEN GIVE ME AN OPTION TO
 INSTALL THE GAME FROM THE

01:17:29.579 --> 01:17:32.486
 PLAY STORE, ALL AT THE SAME
 TIME AS WATCHING THE CONTENT. 

01:17:32.487 --> 01:17:37.010
 IT'S PRETTY COOL.
 NOTIFICATIONS IS ANOTHER AREA

01:17:37.011 --> 01:17:40.513
 WE'VE WORKED ON TO IMPROVE
 PRODUCTIVITY IN ANDROID AND

01:17:40.514 --> 01:17:43.229
 IT TURNS OUT THAT TODAY OVER
 HALF OF THE NOTIFICATIONS

01:17:43.230 --> 01:17:46.424
 SHOWN IN ANDROID ORIGINATE
 FROM MESSAGING APPLICATIONS.

01:17:46.425 --> 01:17:50.143
 SO WE DECIDED TO MAKE SOME
 CHANGES TO REALLY OPTIMIZE

01:17:50.144 --> 01:17:54.260
 FOR THIS USE CASE.
 WE'VE ADDED A NEW DIRECT

01:17:54.261 --> 01:17:57.363
 REPLY FEATURE WHICH LETS YOU
 QUICKLY REPLY TO A MESSAGE

01:17:57.364 --> 01:18:00.469
 LIKE SO.
 YOU NO LONGER NEED TO LAUNCH

01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:04.292
 THE APP TO FIRE OFF A QUICK
 RESPONSE, SO IT'S A REAL TIME

01:18:04.293 --> 01:18:06.595
 SAVER.  WE'VE ALSO ADDED A
 FEATURE TO GIVE YOU MORE

01:18:06.596 --> 01:18:10.817
 CONTROL OVER NOTIFICATIONS. 
 WITH N, YOU CAN LONG-TAP A

01:18:10.818 --> 01:18:13.936

 ONE OTHER AREA WE'VE WORKED

01:18:25.458 --> 01:18:28.969
 ON TO IMPROVE YOUR
 PRODUCTIVITY IN ANDROID IS

01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:31.482
 YOUR ABILITY TO EXPRESS
 YOURSELF WITH EMOJI AND

01:18:31.483 --> 01:18:37.688

 TO IT, VIRTUAL REALITY IS
 COMING TO ANDROID N.

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:18.242
 [ CHEERS ]
 SO IT ALL ACTUALLY STARTED AT

01:21:18.243 --> 01:21:21.283
 A GOOGLE I/O TWO YEARS AGO
 WITH CARDBOARD.  AND SINCE

01:21:23.846 --> 01:21:25.834
 PRETTY AMAZING THINGS.  THERE
 ARE MILLIONS OF THEM OUT

01:21:25.835 --> 01:21:29.035
 THERE IN THE WORLD, IN ALL
 SHAPES AND SIZES.

01:21:29.036 --> 01:21:32.292
 WE'VE ENABLED THOUSANDS OF
 DEVELOPERS TO BUILD THEIR

01:21:32.293 --> 01:21:35.833
 FIRST VR APP, AND USERS HAVE
 INSTALLED OVER 50 MILLION

01:21:35.834 --> 01:21:38.845
 CARDBOARD-ENABLED APPS.
 WE THINK THAT'S PRETTY GOOD

01:21:38.846 --> 01:21:41.888
 FOR WHAT IS, AFTER ALL, JUST
 A PIECE OF CARDBOARD.

01:21:41.889 --> 01:21:45.089
 NOW, WE LOVE CARDBOARD, AND
 FOR US, IT REPRESENTS SO MUCH

01:21:45.090 --> 01:21:49.686
 OF WHAT WE THINK VR SHOULD BE
 ABOUT.  IT SHOULD BE MOBILE. 

01:21:49.687 --> 01:21:53.541
 IT SHOULD BE APPROACHABLE, IT
 SHOULD BE FOR EVERYONE.

01:21:53.542 --> 01:21:56.243
 BUT WE KNEW IT WAS JUST A
 START BECAUSE THERE'S A LIMIT

01:21:56.244 --> 01:22:00.436
 TO HOW MUCH YOU CAN DO, HOW

01:22:00.437 --> 01:22:03.292
 IMMERSIVE AN EXPERIENCE YOU
 CAN CREATE WITH CARDBOARD AND

01:22:03.293 --> 01:22:06.196
 WITH PHONES THAT WERE REALLY
 ONLY MEANT TO BE PHONES.

01:22:06.197 --> 01:22:09.146
 WE WANTED TO CREATE SOMETHING
 WHICH HAS THE BEST ATTRIBUTES

01:22:09.147 --> 01:22:12.999
 OF CARDBOARD BUT WHICH IS
 ALSO COMFORTABLE, RICHLY

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.695
 INTERACTIVE AND FAR MORE
 IMMERSIVE.

01:22:14.696 --> 01:22:17.691
 BUT TO CREATE THAT KIND OF
 IMMERSION, YOU HAVE TO SOLVE

01:22:17.692 --> 01:22:21.344
 -- TO MAKE YOUR BRAIN SAY,
 YEP, I'M SOMEWHERE ELSE, YOU

01:22:21.345 --> 01:22:25.198
 HAVE TO SOLVE A LOT OF REALLY
 HARD PROBLEMS ACROSS ALL

01:22:25.199 --> 01:22:28.055
 PARTS OF THE VR EXPERIENCE. 
 YOU HAVE TO DESIGN A SYSTEM

01:22:28.056 --> 01:22:31.404
 THAT'S CAPABLE OF RENDERING
 AT VERY HIGH FRAME RATES AND

01:22:31.405 --> 01:22:33.605
 RESOLUTION.  TO MAKE THE
 EXPERIENCE REALLY KIVEL YOU

01:22:33.606 --> 01:22:35.897
 HAVE TO MINIMIZE WHAT'S
 CALLED MOTION TO PHOTON

01:22:35.898 --> 01:22:38.255
 LATENCY.  THAT'S THE DELAY
 BETWEEN WHEN THE MOVE YOUR

01:22:38.256 --> 01:22:40.406
 HEAD AND WHEN THE PICTURE
 UPDATES TO REFLECT THAT

01:22:40.407 --> 01:22:43.807
 MOTION.  AND YOU YOU NEED TO
 SOLVE FOR HOW YOU INTERACT

01:22:43.808 --> 01:22:46.663
 WITH THINGS IN VR.  AND WHEN
 YOU NAIL THOSE THINGS  IT

01:22:46.664 --> 01:22:49.204
 JUST FEELS LIKE YOU'RE THERE.
 WELL, WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON

01:22:49.205 --> 01:22:52.251
 THESE PROBLEMS AND MORE.  AND
 WHAT WE'VE BUILT WON'T BE

01:22:52.252 --> 01:22:54.103
 AVAILABLE UNTIL THIS FALL,
 BUT WE'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE

01:22:54.104 --> 01:22:59.005
 YOU TO IT TODAY.  WE CALL IT
 DAYDREAM.

01:22:59.006 --> 01:23:02.608
 DAYDREAM IS OUR PLATFORM FOR
 HI

01:23:02.609 --> 01:23:08.460
 HIGH QUALITY MOBILE VIRTUAL
 REALITY, AND IN IT ARE ALL

01:23:08.461 --> 01:23:12.917
 THE INGREDIENTS YOU NEED TO
 HAVE IMMERSIVE VR EXPERIENCE. 

01:23:12.918 --> 01:23:15.960
 OVER TIME DAYDREAM WILL
 ENCOMPASS VR IN MANY

01:23:15.961 --> 01:23:20.472
 DIFFERENT SAIPS AND SIZES BUT
 TOOS IT'S HOW IT WILL ENABLE

01:23:20.473 --> 01:23:23.276
 VR ON SMARTPHONES.
   AND THERE ARE TWO PARTS OF

01:23:23.277 --> 01:23:27.581
 IT.  THE SMARTPHONES
 THEMSELVES INCLUDING VR

01:23:27.582 --> 01:23:31.424
 OPTIMIZATION TO ANDROID N.  A
 REFERENCE DESIGN FOR HEADSET

01:23:31.425 --> 01:23:35.179
 AND CONTROLLER.  AND APPS,
 BOTH HOW YOU GET THEM THROUGH

01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:37.785
 GOOGLE PLAY AND THE APPS
 THEMSELVES.  WE'VE DESIGNED

01:23:37.786 --> 01:23:40.484
 AND BUILT EACH PART IN
 CONCERT WITH THE OTHERS WITH

01:23:40.485 --> 01:23:43.079
 A FOCUS ON GETTING THE
 END-TO-END USER EXPERIENCE

01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:45.230
 JUST RIGHT.  
   SO LET'S START WITH SMOAPS. 

01:23:45.231 --> 01:23:48.085
 THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS
 LOOK AT WHAT IT TAKES TO

01:23:48.086 --> 01:23:50.186
 BUILD A SMARTPHONE THAT'S
 GREAT AT BEING A SMARTPHONE

01:23:50.187 --> 01:23:53.728
 BUT ALSO AT BEING THE CORE OF
 A VR SYSTEM.   AND WITH INPUT

01:23:53.729 --> 01:23:57.739
 FROM THE MAJOR SILICON
 VENDORS AND SMARTPHONE

01:23:57.740 --> 01:24:00.787
 MANUFACTURERS, WE'VE CREATED
 A SET OF PHONE SPECIFICATIONS

01:24:00.788 --> 01:24:03.738
 FOR VR.  AND WE CALL PHONES
 THAT MEET THESE SPECS

01:24:03.739 --> 01:24:06.292
 DAYDREAM-READY.
 AND THE SPECS INCLUDE THINGS

01:24:06.293 --> 01:24:09.642
 LIKE HIGH PERFORMANCE SENSORS
 FOR ACCURATE HEAD TRACKING,

01:24:09.643 --> 01:24:12.091
 DISPLAYS WITH A FAST RESPONSE
 TIME TO MINIMIZE BLUR, AND

01:24:12.092 --> 01:24:14.790
 POWERFUL MOBILE PROCESSORS.
 AND IF A PHONE MEETS THESE

01:24:14.791 --> 01:24:17.353
 SPECS, IT WILL BE CAPABLE OF
 DELIVERING A GREAT VR

01:24:17.354 --> 01:24:20.547
 EXPERIENCE.
 BUT THE SMARTPHONE ITSELF,

01:24:20.548 --> 01:24:23.699
 IT'S ONLY PART OF THE STORY. 
 THE OPERATING SYSTEM, THE

01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:27.740
 SOFTWARE, IT NEEDS TO BE ABLE
 TO MAKE USE OF ALL OF THESE

01:24:27.741 --> 01:24:30.347
 CAPABILITIES, ALL WHILE
 KEEPING LATENCY TO AN

01:24:30.348 --> 01:24:33.340
 ABSOLUTE MINIMUM.
 SO WE'VE INTRODUCED WHAT WE

01:24:33.341 --> 01:24:36.291
 CALL VR MODE AS PART OF
 ANDROID

01:24:36.292 --> 01:24:38.959
 ANDROID N.  AND WE'VE WORKED
 AT ALL LEVELS OF THE ANDROID

01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:42.153
 STACK TO OPTIMIZE IT FOR VR. 
 AND WE FOCUSED IN PARTICULAR

01:24:42.154 --> 01:24:45.859
 ON PERFORMANCE AND LATENCY,
 WHICH REBROUGHT DOWN TO UNDER

01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:49.958
 20 MILLISECONDS.
   BY ADDING THINGS LIKE

01:24:49.959 --> 01:24:52.861
 SINGLE BUFFER RENDERING, AND
 VR SYSTEM UI, SO

01:24:52.862 --> 01:24:55.310
 NOTIFICATIONS AND ALERTS COME
 THROUGH PROPERLY IN VR.  AND

01:24:55.311 --> 01:24:57.754
 ALL OF THIS MAKES FOR A
 REALLY COMFORTABLE VR

01:24:57.755 --> 01:25:00.348
 EXPERIENCE THAT WE THINK
 USERS ARE GOING TO LOVE.

01:25:00.349 --> 01:25:03.905
 NOW, IT'S IMPORTANT, THESE
 IMPROVEMENTS ARE PART OF THE

01:25:03.906 --> 01:25:08.166
 CORE OF ANDROID N, SO THE
 ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM CAN BENEFIT.

01:25:08.167 --> 01:25:11.956
 AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR
 DEVELOPERS IS THERE ARE GOING

01:25:11.957 --> 01:25:17.104
 TO BE A LOT OF DAYDREAM-READY
 PHONES.  IN FACT, SAMSUNG,

01:25:17.105 --> 01:25:24.557
 ALCATEL, ASUS, HTC, HUE WEI,
 LG, XIAOMI, ALL WILL HAVE

01:25:24.558 --> 01:25:29.111
 PHONES COMPATIBLE WITH THE
 DAYDREAM-READY SPEC AND

01:25:29.112 --> 01:25:33.606
 SEVERAL WILL BE READY THIS
 FALL.   CHEEP CHEERP.

01:25:33.607 --> 01:25:36.054
 SO THAT'S PHONES WITH
 DAYDREAM-READY PHONE SPECS 

01:25:36.055 --> 01:25:40.974
 AND THE VR OPTIMIZEIZATIONS
 AS PART OF DROIRN.

01:25:43.707 --> 01:25:46.459
 LET'S TURN TO HEADSETS.  THIS
 IS OBVIOUS BUT A HEADSET  IS

01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:48.066
 SOMETHING YOU WEAR ON YOUR
 HEAD.  AND BECAUSE IT'S

01:25:48.067 --> 01:25:49.458
 SOMETHING THAT YOU WEAR,
 THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS YOU

01:25:49.459 --> 01:25:52.272
 NEED TO GET JUST RIGHT.  IT
 HAS TO HAVE GREAT OPTICS.  IT

01:25:52.273 --> 01:25:54.665
 HAS TO BE COMFORTABLE.  THE
 MATERIALS NEED TO FEEL GOOD. 

01:25:54.666 --> 01:25:57.267
 AND IT NEEDS TO BE REALLY
 EASY TO PUT ON AND TAKE OFF.

01:25:57.268 --> 01:26:01.609
  WE'VE TAKEN WHAT WE'VE
 LEARNED IN ALL OF THESE AREAS

01:26:01.610 --> 01:26:04.983
 AND WE'VE CREATED A REFERENCE
 DESIGN FOR HEADSETS THAT WILL

01:26:04.984 --> 01:26:10.720
 WORK ALAN EUSTACELY WITH
 DAYDREAM-READY ALAN SEAMLESSLY 

01:26:10.721 --> 01:26:11.577
WITH
 DAYDREAM-READY PHONES.  AND

01:26:11.578 --> 01:26:14.918
 WE'RE SHARING THE DESIGN WITH
 PARTNERS ACROSS THE ECOSYSTEM

01:26:14.919 --> 01:26:18.570
 AND THERE ARE BE SEVERAL
 AVAILABLE THIS FALL.   NOW,

01:26:18.571 --> 01:26:21.832
 WHEN IT COMES TO VR, EVERYONE
 THINKS ABOUT HEADSETS, BUT

01:26:21.833 --> 01:26:24.032
 THE CONTROLLER, HOW YOU
 INTERACT WITH VR, IT'S JUST

01:26:24.033 --> 01:26:26.529
 AS IMPORTANT.  AND WE WANTED
 TO CREATE A CONTROLLER THAT'S

01:26:26.530 --> 01:26:30.330
 OPTIMIZED FOR VR, THAT'S BOTH
 POWERFUL AND INTUITIVE.  AND

01:26:30.331 --> 01:26:32.923
 SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON A
 CONTROLLER FOR DAYDREAM.  IT

01:26:32.924 --> 01:26:35.778
 LOOKS LIKE THIS.
 AND IF WE ACTUALLY ZOOM IN A

01:26:35.779 --> 01:26:39.128
 LITTLE BIT, YOU CAN SEE THE
 CONTROLLER ITSELF, IT'S VERY

01:26:39.129 --> 01:26:42.638
 SIMPLE.  THERE ARE FEW
 BUTTONS AND A CLICKABLE

01:26:42.639 --> 01:26:45.139
 TOUCHPAD SO YOU CAN SCROLL
 AND SWIPE.  BUT HIDDEN INSIDE

01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:48.676
 THE CONTROLLER IS THE MAGIC. 
 WE'VE BUILT IN ORIENTATION

01:26:48.677 --> 01:26:51.691
 SENSORS SO IT KNOWS WHERE
 IT'S POINTING, HOW IT'S

01:26:51.692 --> 01:26:53.841
 TURNING.  AND YOU CAN DO SOME
 PRETTY AWESOME THINGS WITH

01:26:53.842 --> 01:26:55.842
 IT.  LET'S HAVE A LOOK.

 &gt;&gt;Clay Bavor:

01:27:53.443 --> 01:27:56.603
  SO AS YOU CAN
 SEE, THE CONTROLLER, IT'S

01:27:56.604 --> 01:27:59.039
 SUPER FLEXIBLE, AND THE
 DEVELOPERS WE'VE SHARED IT

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.941
 WITH ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.
 NOW THE CONTROLLER, TOO, WILL

01:28:00.942 --> 01:28:02.643
 BE PART OF THE REFERENCE
 DESIGN THAT WE'RE SHARING

01:28:02.644 --> 01:28:05.795
 WITH PARTNERS, WITH THE FIRST
 AVAILABLE THIS FALL.

01:28:05.796 --> 01:28:08.402
 OKAY.  SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT
 SMARTPHONES AND OPERATING

01:28:08.403 --> 01:28:11.603
 SYSTEMS, HEADSETS AND
 CONTROLLERS.  BUT ULTIMATELY,

01:28:11.604 --> 01:28:14.155
 THAT'S NOT WHAT VR IS ABOUT. 
 IT'S ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN

01:28:14.156 --> 01:28:18.255
 EXPERIENCE.
 SO LET'S TURN TO APPS, WHAT

01:28:18.256 --> 01:28:20.665
 YOU CAN DO IN VR.
 NOW, FIRST, IF YOU'RE A

01:28:20.666 --> 01:28:24.511

 THERE'S A LOT UPSTREAM, FROM

 PLAYING YOUR GAME.  USERS

01:28:27.023 --> 01:28:30.162
 HAVE TO FIND IT IN A STORE,
 BUY IT, INSTALL IT, LAUNCH

01:28:30.163 --> 01:28:34.121

01:40:27.801 --> 01:40:33.108
 SECOND, WE CREATED AN OPEN
 SOURCE PROJECT CALLED

01:40:33.109 --> 01:40:37.025
 ACCELERATED MOBILE PAGES OR
 AMP, TO MAKE IT SIMPLE TO

01:40:37.026 --> 01:40:40.740
 CREATE EXTREMELY FAST MOBILE
 WEB SITES USING EXISTING WEB

01:40:40.741 --> 01:40:44.944
 STANDARDS.
 ON AVERAGE, AMP PAGES LOAD

01:40:44.945 --> 01:40:48.258
 FOUR TIMES FASTER AND USE
 ONE-TENTH AS MUCH DATA. 

01:40:48.259 --> 01:40:53.384
 THESE THINGS LOAD ALMOST
 INSTANTLY.  SO WE'RE MAKING

01:40:53.385 --> 01:40:57.492
 IT EASIER TO DEVELOP MOBILE
 WEB SITES, BUT WE'RE ALSO

01:40:57.493 --> 01:41:00.595
 INVESTING IN NATIVE
 DEVELOPMENT.  WE WANT ANDROID

01:41:00.596 --> 01:41:03.915
 STUDIO TO BE THE QUICKEST,
 MOST RELIABLE WAY TO BUILD

01:41:03.916 --> 01:41:06.138
 ANDROID APPS.  I'D LIKE TO
 INVITE STEPH UP TO TELL YOU

01:41:06.139 --> 01:41:08.728
 MORE.

01:41:08.729 --> 01:41:13.342
  &gt;&gt;Stephanie Cuthbertson: 
 THANKS, JASON.  I'M STEPH.  I

01:41:13.343 --> 01:41:17.575
 WORK ON THE ANDROID TEAM. 
 ANDROID STUDIO IS OUR

01:41:17.576 --> 01:41:20.981
 OFFICIAL IDE.  IT'S
 PURPOSE-BUILT FOR ANDROID. 

01:41:20.982 --> 01:41:23.886
 AND IT WAS ONLY THREE YEARS
 AGO, RIGHT HERE AT I/O, THAT

01:41:23.887 --> 01:41:26.912
 WE SHOWED IT FOR THE FIRST
 TIME.

01:41:26.913 --> 01:41:32.533
 SINCE THEN, IT HAS BUILT A
 TON OF MOMENTUM.

01:41:32.534 --> 01:41:40.256
 92% OF THE TOP 125 APPS AND
 GAMES NOW USE ANDROID STUDIO. 

01:41:40.257 --> 01:41:43.961
 AND MILLIONS OF DEVELOPERS
 WORLDWIDE.

01:41:43.962 --> 01:41:47.271
 OUR ANDROID ENGINEERING TEAM
 SEES THAT ALMOST ALL THE

01:41:47.272 --> 01:41:49.490
 PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPERS THAT
 WE CONNECT WITH HAVE USED IT

01:41:49.491 --> 01:41:52.792
 AND SWITCHED OVER FROM OUR
 ECLIPSE TOOLS.

01:41:52.793 --> 01:41:55.300
 YOUR FEEDBACK HAS BEEN
 AWESOME BECAUSE IT'S HELPED

01:41:55.301 --> 01:41:59.431
 US FOCUS ON THE RIGHT THINGS. 
 WE CARE A LOT ABOUT MAKING IT

01:41:59.432 --> 01:42:02.424
 GREAT.  AND THERE'S MUCH MORE
 TO COME.

01:42:02.425 --> 01:42:05.353
 THIS MORNING, WE'LL RELEASE
 OUR LATEST, WHICH IS ANDROID

01:42:05.354 --> 01:42:11.667
 STUDIO'S 2.2 PREVIEW. 
 FOCUSING ON SPEED, SMARTS,

01:42:11.668 --> 01:42:15.071
 AND ANDROID PLATFORM SUPPORT.
 FIRST, SPEED.

01:42:15.072 --> 01:42:20.488
 ALREADY WITH 2.1 WE MADE
 BUILDING AND RUNNING CHANGES

01:42:20.489 --> 01:42:25.208
 10 TIMES FASTER THAN IT WAS
 ONLY SIX MONTHS AGO.  OUR NEW

01:42:25.209 --> 01:42:27.723
 INSTANT RUN FEATURE DROVE
 MOST OF THIS.  NOW WHEN YOU

01:42:27.724 --> 01:42:31.422
 HIT "RUN" WE DEPLOY CHANGES
 DIRECTLY INTO THE RUNNING

01:42:31.423 --> 01:42:34.851
 APP.  THE EMULATORS ARE THREE
 TIMES FASTER AND PUSH SPEEDS

01:42:34.852 --> 01:42:38.054
 ARE EVEN FASTER THAN THAT.
 SO ALL OF THAT MEANS THE

01:42:38.055 --> 01:42:41.057
 EMULATORS ARE NOW ACTUALLY
 FASTER THAN THE PHYSICAL

01:42:41.058 --> 01:42:44.075
 DEVICE THAT'S PROBABLY IN
 YOUR POCKET RIGHT NOW.

01:42:44.076 --> 01:42:47.694
 BUT WE WANT TO KEEP SPEEDING
 YOU UP TO LAUNCH EARLIER.

01:42:47.695 --> 01:42:51.196
 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU
 TOLD US IS THAT WE COULD NOT

01:42:51.197 --> 01:42:55.803
 POSSIBLY MAKE BUILD SPEEDS
 TOO FAST.

01:42:55.804 --> 01:42:58.637
 SO WITH 2.2 WE'RE GOING TO
 ACCELERATE BUILD SPEEDS

01:42:58.638 --> 01:43:02.167
 AGAIN.  PLUS WE KNOW INSTANT
 RUN'S A LONG-TERM BET SO

01:43:02.168 --> 01:43:03.777
 WE'LL KEEP EXPANDING
 COVERAGE.

01:43:03.778 --> 01:43:05.882
 ANOTHER THING WE WANT TO DO
 IS MAKE IT EASIER TO WRITE

01:43:05.883 --> 01:43:09.884
 TESTS TO HELP DRIVE UP APP
 QUALITY.  SO WITH TEST

01:43:09.885 --> 01:43:12.999
 RECORDING, NOW AS YOU JUST
 TAP THROUGH YOUR APP, WE'LL

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.616
 RECORD -- WE'LL WRITE ALL OF
 YOUR ESPRESSO TEST CODE FOR

01:43:15.617 --> 01:43:17.732
 YOU.  ALMOST -- IT'S
 BASICALLY AS IF --

01:43:17.733 --> 01:43:19.840
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

01:43:24.036 --> 01:43:26.350
IT'S AS IF YOU HAD
 HANDWRITTEN THE CODE YOURSELF

01:43:26.351 --> 01:43:29.255
 AND YOU CAN RUN THOSE TESTS
 LOCALLY OR YOU CAN RUN THEM

01:43:29.256 --> 01:43:33.678
 WITH OUR IDE-INTEGRATED CLOUD
 TEST LAB, TO MAKE SURE YOUR

01:43:33.679 --> 01:43:35.688
 APP RUNS WELL ON MANY ANDROID
 DEVICES.

01:43:35.689 --> 01:43:38.284
 NOW, ONE OF THE THINGS THE
 ENGINEERING TEAM IS MOST

01:43:38.285 --> 01:43:41.108
 EXCITED ABOUT IS THAT WITH
 2.2 YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE

01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:43.901
 TO BUILD LAYOUTS FASTER AND
 THEY'LL RUN FASTER, TOO.  SO

01:43:43.902 --> 01:43:47.615
 LET ME SHOW YOU THIS.
 2.2 INCLUDES A REWRITTEN

01:43:47.616 --> 01:43:51.430
 FEATURE-RICH LAYOUT DESIGNER,
 WITH NEW CONSTRAINT LAYOUTS. 

01:43:51.431 --> 01:43:55.238
 SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE
 HERE IS YOU'LL BE ABLE TO USE

01:43:55.239 --> 01:43:57.449
 THE LAYOUT WINDOW.  IT'S
 ALMOST LIKE A SHEET OF PAPER. 

01:43:57.450 --> 01:43:59.971
 SO YOU CAN POSITION YOUR
 WIDGETS AND ONCE YOU'RE

01:43:59.972 --> 01:44:02.275
 HAPPY, YOU'LL SEE HERE WE
 SAVE YOU A TON OF TIME

01:44:02.276 --> 01:44:04.678
 BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO
 AUTOMATICALLY ADD ALL THE

01:44:04.679 --> 01:44:07.396
 CONSTRAINTS FOR YOU, DOING A
 BUNCH OF ACTUALLY VERY COOL

01:44:07.397 --> 01:44:10.105
 MATH UNDER THE COVERS.
 YOU'LL SEE THE UI HERE IS NOW

01:44:10.106 --> 01:44:13.025
 GOING TO ADAPT SO YOU CAN TRY
 IT ON DIFFERENT ANDROID

01:44:13.026 --> 01:44:15.719
 ADVICES.  IT WILL ADAPT TO
 DIFFERENT ORIENTATIONS.  BUT

01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:18.728
 WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE IS BEHIND
 THE SCENES YOUR APP WILL RUN

01:44:18.729 --> 01:44:21.439
 FASTER, TOO.
 SO MANY OF YOU HERE ARE

01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:24.157
 PROFESSIONAL ANDROID
 DEVELOPERS AND YOU KNOW

01:44:24.158 --> 01:44:27.267
 BUILDING RICH UI USUALLY
 REQUIRES NESTED LAYOUTS AND

01:44:27.268 --> 01:44:29.979
 THOSE ARE HARD TO
 PERFORMANCE-TUNE AT TIMES.

01:44:29.980 --> 01:44:33.283
 WITH CONSTRAINT LAYOUTS,
 THERE IS NO NESTING REQUIRED,

01:44:33.284 --> 01:44:37.293
 SO OVERALL YOU GET THE SAME
 RICH UI, LESS WORK, AND

01:44:37.294 --> 01:44:39.501
 BETTER PERFORMANCE BY
 DEFAULT.

 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

01:44:47.630 --> 01:44:49.937
SECOND, SMARTS.  WE WANT TO
 HELP YOU WRITE BETTER ANDROID

01:44:49.938 --> 01:44:53.954
 APPS.  THE 2.2 PREVIEW
 INCLUDES A NEW APK ANALYZER

01:44:53.955 --> 01:44:57.562
 SO YOU CAN FIGURE OUT, "HEY,
 WHAT'S MAKING MY APP SO BIG?" 

01:44:57.563 --> 01:44:59.967
 THIS IS REALLY USEFUL FOR ALL
 OF YOU WHO ARE TARGETING

01:44:59.968 --> 01:45:02.175
 EMERGING MARKETS.  YOU'VE
 TALKED TO US A LOT ABOUT

01:45:02.176 --> 01:45:05.995
 THIS.  YOU ALSO HAD ASKED FOR
 A LAYOUT INSPECTOR SO WE HAVE

01:45:05.996 --> 01:45:08.311
 A NEW LAYOUT INSPECTOR IN 2.2
 SO YOU CAN FIND OUT WHAT'S

01:45:08.312 --> 01:45:11.213
 INSIDE YOUR ANDROID LAYOUTS.
 WHEN YOU RUN CODE ANALYSES,

01:45:11.214 --> 01:45:13.925
 YOU'LL FIND A BUNCH OF NEW
 QUALITY CHECKS, AND THAT'S IN

01:45:13.926 --> 01:45:17.933
 ADDITION TO THE 260 THAT ARE
 ALREADY THERE, ALL DESIGNED

01:45:17.934 --> 01:45:20.649
 TO ELIMINATE COMMON CLASSES
 OF ERRORS THAT WE SEE ON

01:45:20.650 --> 01:45:24.069

 AND WE INTEGRATED THE LATEST

01:45:24.070 --> 01:45:29.870
 VERSION OF THE WONDERFUL
 INTELLIJ IDE, 2016.1.

 [ APPLAUSE ]
 THE THIRD THING I WANT TO

01:45:33.977 --> 01:45:36.481
 TALK ABOUT IS ANDROID
 PLATFORM SUPPORT.  SO WE

01:45:36.482 --> 01:45:39.199
 DEVELOPED THE IDE RIGHT
 ALONGSIDE THE PLATFORM, SO WE

01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:43.234
 CAN BRING YOU THE VERY BEST.
 2.2 INCLUDES, TO NAME JUST A

01:45:43.235 --> 01:45:47.250

 WORKINGGRAPHIC-RICH LIKE
 GAMES AND APPS, YOU KNOW C++

01:45:56.588 --> 01:45:59.013
 IS CRITICAL AND IT'S BECAUSE
 OF YOUR REQUESTS WE'VE BEEN

01:45:59.014 --> 01:46:01.522
 SUBTLY BUILDING OUT C++
 SUPPORT.

01:46:01.523 --> 01:46:05.350
 NOW, WE ALREADY HAVE C++
 EDITING AND DEBUGGING, BUT IN

01:46:05.351 --> 01:46:08.054
 2.2 YOU'LL FIND A MAJOR
 CHANGE BASED ON YOUR

01:46:08.055 --> 01:46:11.175
 FEEDBACK.
 IN ADDITION TO GRADLE, FOR

01:46:11.176 --> 01:46:15.488

 WE WOULD REALLY ADMIRE, IT'S
 GREAT DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE

01:47:17.068 --> 01:47:19.874
 AND WE WANTED TO FIGURE OUT
 HOW TO BRING THAT TO OTHER

01:47:19.875 --> 01:47:22.823
 AREAS OF APP DEVELOPMENT. 
 WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY

 WITH COMPANIES BIG AND SMALL
 ALL OVER THE WORLD TO EXPLORE

01:47:24.928 --> 01:47:27.939
 HOW WE COULD MAKE OUR

 INTEGRATED PRODUCTS TO HELP
 YOU BUILD YOUR APP, GROW YOUR

01:47:46.135 --> 01:47:49.737

 THIS IS THE BIGGEST, MOST

01:47:49.738 --> 01:47:54.838
 COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPER

01:47:54.839 --> 01:47:59.046
 SO AT THE HEART OF THE NEW
 FIREBASE IS A MOBILE

01:47:59.047 --> 01:48:02.714
 ANALYTICS TOOL WE'VE BUILT
 FROM THE GROUND UP CALLED

01:48:02.715 --> 01:48:07.428
 FIREBASE ANALYTICS.  IT'S
 INSPIRED BY MUCH OF THE WORK

01:48:07.429 --> 01:48:10.420
 THAT WE'VE DONE IN THE LAST
 TEN YEARS WITH GOOGLE

01:48:10.421 --> 01:48:13.326
 ANALYTICS, BUT IT'S DESIGNED
 SPECIFICALLY FOR THE UNIQUE

01:48:13.327 --> 01:48:16.414
 NEEDS OF APPS.
 IT'S GREAT FOR APP DEVELOPERS

01:48:16.415 --> 01:48:20.325
 FOR A COUPLE OF WAYS.  FIRST,
 IT GIVES YOU RICH INSIGHTS

01:48:20.326 --> 01:48:24.725
 INTO WHAT USERS ARE DOING
 INSIDE OF YOUR APP.  AND IT

01:48:24.726 --> 01:48:29.515
 ALSO TELLS YOU WHERE THEY'RE
 COMING FROM WITH RICH CROSS

 AUDIENCES WHICH INTEGRATES
 ALL OF FIREBASE TOGETHER. 

01:48:40.875 --> 01:48:45.679
 WITH FIREBASE AUDIENCES, YOU
 CAN GROUP USERS BASED ON THE

01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:49.374
 CRITERIA THAT MATTERS TO YOU
 MOST, AND THEN TAKE ACTION

 OVER A DOZEN OTHER MAJOR
 FEATURES.  I'M GOING TO COVER

01:49:16.944 --> 01:49:18.848
 SOME HIGHLIGHTS.
 FIRST THERE'S CLOUD MESSAGING

01:49:18.849 --> 01:49:21.658
 AND NOTIFICATIONS, WHICH IS
 BUILT ON THE WORLD'S MOST

01:49:21.659 --> 01:49:24.945

 ONE MILLION APPS SENDING OVER
 170 BILLION MESSAGESES EVERY

01:49:29.145 --> 01:49:33.104
 DAY.
 AND NOW THAT IT'S INTEGRATED

01:49:33.105 --> 01:49:35.573
 INTO FIREBASE, YOU CAN SEND
 TARGETED NOTIFICATIONS TO

 [ APPLAUSE ]

01:49:50.644 --> 01:49:55.431
 NOW, APP QUALITY IS IMPORTANT
 TO ALL OF US.  IF YOUR APP

01:49:55.432 --> 01:49:58.377
 CRASHES, IT'S BAD FOR YOUR
 USERS, AND IT HURTS YOUR

01:49:58.378 --> 01:50:02.781

 CREATED FIREBASE CRASH

 TAKE ACTION TO REDUCE IMPACT
 ON YOUR USERS.

 ANOTHER ASPECT OF BUILDING A
 HIGH-QUALITY APP IS BEING

01:50:23.199 --> 01:50:26.598
 ABLE TO TUNE AND EXPERIMENT
 WITH FEATURES.  SO WE'VE

01:50:26.599 --> 01:50:30.390
 TAKEN THE SAME INFRASTRUCTURE
 THAT WE USE FOR OUR OWN APPS

 INSTALL PROCESS SO YOU CAN
 DRIVE INSTALLS WHILE STILL

01:51:06.654 --> 01:51:09.256
 ABLE TO TAKE WHAT WAS 13 TAPS
 DOWN TO ONLY

01:51:12.955 --> 01:51:14.757
 4.
 SO AS I MENTIONED, THERE ARE

01:51:14.758 --> 01:51:18.118
 OVER A DOZEN FEATURES OF THE
 NEW FIREBASE, AND WHILE EACH

01:51:18.119 --> 01:51:21.764
 OF THEM IS INTERESTING ON ITS
 OWN, THE POWER OF FIREBASE IS

01:51:21.765 --> 01:51:24.556
 IN HOW THEY'RE INTEGRATED
 TOGETHER.

01:51:24.557 --> 01:51:28.507
 HERE'S A QUICK EXAMPLE. 
 FIRST, WITH CRASH REPORTING,

01:51:28.508 --> 01:51:32.561
 YOU CAN SEE CRASHES AS
 THEY'RE HAPPENING.  THEN IN

01:51:32.562 --> 01:51:35.465
 ANALYTICS, YOU CAN LOOK AT
 WHAT THE IMPACT IS ON YOUR

01:51:35.466 --> 01:51:38.413
 BUSINESS.  ONCE YOU FIX THE
 CRASH, YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE

01:51:38.414 --> 01:51:41.420
 NOTIFICATIONS TO REACH BACK
 OUT AND INVITE USERS BACK

01:51:41.421 --> 01:51:46.615
 INTO YOUR APP.  OR USE REMOTE
 CONFIG TO OFFER THEM A

01:51:46.616 --> 01:51:49.472
 COUPON.  AND ALL OF THIS IS
 INTEGRATED INTO OUR GOOGLE

01:51:49.473 --> 01:51:52.731
 CLOUD PLATFORM, SO THAT IF
 YOU WANT TO DO DEEPER, MORE

01:51:52.732 --> 01:51:55.636
 CUSTOMIZED ANALYSIS OF YOUR
 ANALYTICS DATA, YOU CAN

01:51:55.637 --> 01:52:00.478
 EXPORT IT TO BIGQUERY,
 GOOGLE'S FULLY MANAGED,

01:52:00.479 --> 01:52:03.776
 PETABYTE SCALE DATA WHITE

01:52:03.777 --> 01:52:05.322
 WAREHOUSE.
 SO I'VE ONLY SKIMMED THE

01:52:05.323 --> 01:52:08.127
 SURFACE, BUT WE'RE GOING TO
 GO INTO DETAIL LATER ON THIS

01:52:08.128 --> 01:52:10.991
 AFTERNOON, AND WE HAVE OVER
 30 SESSIONS ON FIREBASE

01:52:10.992 --> 01:52:15.179
 THROUGHOUT I/O.
 THE NEW FIREBASE IS AVAILABLE

01:52:18.728 --> 01:52:21.580
TODAY THROUGH ONE --

01:52:21.581 --> 01:52:26.994
 THROUGH ONE EASY TO INSTALL
 SDK ACROSS ANDROID, iOS,

01:52:26.995 --> 01:52:30.846
 AND THE WEB.  PLEASE GIVE IT
 A TRY.  WE'RE REALLY

01:52:30.847 --> 01:52:33.234
 INTERESTED TO HEAR WHAT YOU
 THINK AND WE CAN'T WAIT TO

01:52:33.235 --> 01:52:36.136
 SEE WHAT YOU BUILD NEXT.
 AND WITH THAT, HERE IS ELLIE

01:52:36.137 --> 01:52:38.987
 TO GIVE YOU A PREVIEW OF A
 NEW ANDROID EFFORT THAT WE'RE

01:52:38.988 --> 01:52:43.136

 HI, EVERYBODY.  I'M ELLIE
 FROM THE ANDROID TEAM.  AND

01:52:53.199 --> 01:52:55.399
 I'M HERE WITH FICUS
 KIRKPATRICK, OUR ENGINEERING

01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:58.192
 DIRECTOR.
 WE HOPE THAT FIREBASE WILL

01:52:58.193 --> 01:53:02.655
 MAKE IT A LOT EASIER FOR ALL
 OF YOU TO BUILD GREAT APPS. 

01:53:02.656 --> 01:53:07.274
 AND WE'RE ALSO THINKING HARD
 ABOUT HOW ANDROID APPS SHOULD

01:53:07.275 --> 01:53:10.938
 EVOLVE AND DO MORE.
 WE'LL BE SHOWING YOU A SNEAK

01:53:10.939 --> 01:53:13.277
 PEEK OF A NEW PROJECT.  WE
 THINK IT'S GOING TO CHANGE

01:53:13.278 --> 01:53:16.339
 HOW PEOPLE EXPERIENCE ANDROID
 APPS, AND WE'LL BE BRINGING

01:53:16.340 --> 01:53:19.939
 IT TO ANDROID USERS AND
 DEVELOPERS OVER THE NEXT

01:53:19.940 --> 01:53:21.030
 YEAR.
 DEVELOPERS LIKE ALL OF YOU

01:53:21.031 --> 01:53:24.231
 HERE HAVE BUILT AMAZING
 ANDROID APPS.  THEY UNLEASH

01:53:24.232 --> 01:53:27.538
 THE FULL POWER OF ANDROID
 DEVICES, SEAMLESSLY COMBINING

01:53:27.539 --> 01:53:31.784
 THE CAMERA, SENSORS, SMOOTH
 ANIMATIONS, AND MORE.

01:53:31.785 --> 01:53:34.245
 BUT YOU'VE REALLY TOLD US
 THAT YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO

01:53:34.246 --> 01:53:37.941
 BRING USERS INTO YOUR APPS
 MORE QUICKLY.  WE WANT TO

01:53:37.942 --> 01:53:42.888
 MAKE IT EASIER FOR USERS AND
 DEVELOPERS TO CONNECT; FOR

01:53:42.889 --> 01:53:46.152
 USERS TO ACCESS A WIDER RANGE
 OF APPS AND FOR DEVELOPERS TO

01:53:46.153 --> 01:53:50.803
 REACH MORE PEOPLE.
 WITH THE WEB, YOU CAN JUST

01:53:50.804 --> 01:53:53.886
 CLICK ON A LINK AND LAND ON A
 WEB PAGE.  THAT'S ONE CLICK

01:53:53.887 --> 01:53:57.599
 AND A FEW SECONDS.
 WHAT IF YOU COULD RUN ANY APP

01:53:57.600 --> 01:54:02.045
 WITH ONE TAP?
 THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON. 

01:54:02.046 --> 01:54:07.007
 WE'RE EVOLVING ANDROID APPS
 TO RUN INSTANTLY, WITHOUT

01:54:07.008 --> 01:54:13.699

 PREVIEW OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN
 WORKING ON, AND I CAN'T TELL

01:54:25.555 --> 01:54:27.663
 YOU HOW MUCH I'VE BEEN
 LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS

01:54:27.664 --> 01:54:29.911
 MOMENT FOR A REALLY LONG
 TIME.

01:54:29.912 --> 01:54:33.102
 SO LET'S SAY MY FRIEND
 MICHAEL SENDS ME THIS LINK TO

01:54:33.103 --> 01:54:36.813
 TASTY ON BUZZFEED VIDEO.  AND
 LET'S BE COMPLETELY CLEAR. 

01:54:36.814 --> 01:54:39.262
 LET'S BE HONEST WITH EACH
 OTHER.  I DO NOT HAVE THE

01:54:39.263 --> 01:54:43.009
 BUZZFEED VIDEO APP INSTALLED
 ON MY PHONE.

01:54:43.010 --> 01:54:46.560
 SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS
 WE'RE GOING TO TAP THE URL,

01:54:46.561 --> 01:54:50.963
 AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE ME
 RIGHT INTO BUZZFEED VIDEO'S

01:54:50.964 --> 01:54:52.964
 ANDROID APP, WITHOUT
 INSTALLING

01:54:55.568 --> 01:54:59.058
 IT.
 FICUS, GO! 

01:54:59.059 --> 01:55:01.459
 WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS
 GOOGLE PLAY IS FETCHING ONLY

01:55:01.460 --> 01:55:05.199
 THE PIECES OF THE APP THAT WE
 NEED RIGHT NOW. 

01:55:08.412 --> 01:55:10.412
 THERE.
 [ APPLAUSE

 WE ARE IN THE ANDROID APP. 

01:55:18.007 --> 01:55:21.250
 AND I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO
 INSTALL IT.  IT WAS PRETTY

01:55:21.251 --> 01:55:24.755
 FAST TOO; RIGHT?
 SO HERE YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A

01:55:24.756 --> 01:55:28.155
 BUNCH OF DIFFERENT VIDEOS
 SHOWING HOW TO MAKE A BUNCH

01:55:28.156 --> 01:55:30.152
 OF DIFFERENT RECIPES, AND THE
 VIDEOS START PLAYING

01:55:30.153 --> 01:55:32.649
 AUTOMATICALLY.  REMEMBER,
 IT'S A REAL ANDROID APP;

01:55:32.650 --> 01:55:35.599
 RIGHT?  AND I CAN JUST SWIPE
 AND GO TO THE NEXT VIDEO

01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:39.202
 REALLY QUICKLY.
 THE APP WAS ABLE TO OPEN SO

01:55:39.203 --> 01:55:43.299
 FAST BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SPLIT
 UP INTO MODULES.  WHEN FICUS

01:55:43.300 --> 01:55:47.311
 TAPPED THE LINK, GOOGLE PLAY
 DOWNLOADED ONLY THE CODE THAT

01:55:47.312 --> 01:55:49.599
 WAS NECESSARY TO DISPLAY THIS
 SCREEN.

01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:52.553
 AND IF I WANT TO KEEP
 BUZZFEED VIDEO ON MY HOME

01:55:52.554 --> 01:55:57.352
 SCREEN, IT'S SIMPLE TO
 INSTALL THE APP RIGHT HERE.

01:55:57.353 --> 01:56:00.259
 HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE. 

01:56:06.164 --> 01:56:08.050
 PHOTO AND VIDEO HAS AN
 ANDROID APP BUT I DON'T HAVE

01:56:08.051 --> 01:56:11.154
 IT ON MY PHONE BECAUSE I
 DON'T SHOP FOR CAMERAS EVERY

01:56:11.155 --> 01:56:14.600
 DAY.  IF I'M SEARCHING  FOR
 SOMETHING SPECIFIC LIKE A

01:56:14.601 --> 01:56:16.752
 CAMERA BAG I CAN STILL GET
 THAT SAME EXPERIENCE.  WITH

01:56:16.753 --> 01:56:19.716
 ONE TAP, THE APP OPENS UP
 RIGHT TO THE BAGGY WANT TO

01:56:22.811 --> 01:56:25.616
 BAG I WANT TO
 BUY.  TECHNICALLY, THIS IS A

01:56:25.617 --> 01:56:29.464
 DEEP LINK TO THE ANDROID
 ACTIVITY THAT B&amp;H ROTE TO

01:56:29.465 --> 01:56:33.860
 DISPLAY THIS PAGE.  I CAN
 ALSO  SWIPE RIGHT HERE AND

01:56:33.861 --> 01:56:35.203
 SEE MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE
 BAG.

01:56:35.204 --> 01:56:38.010
 NOW, WHEN I ADD IT TO MY
 CART, THE ANIMATION THERE WAS

01:56:38.011 --> 01:56:42.752
 PRETTY SLICK.  AND AT CHOWT

01:56:42.753 --> 01:56:45.752
 CHECKOUT TIME, DRAIP WORKS
 JUST LIKE IF I HAD THE APP

01:56:45.753 --> 01:56:47.559
 INSTALLED.  I DON'T HAVE TO
 PULL OUT MY CREDIT CARD AND

01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:53.471

 AND DROID INSTANT APPS, ANDROID

01:56:53.472 --> 01:56:55.469

 ALREADY SIGNED IN AND READY

01:56:55.470 --> 01:56:57.865
 TO PAY.  SO IT'S GOING TO
 TAKE ME TWO TAPS, NOT TWO

01:56:57.866 --> 01:57:00.360
 MINUTES.

01:57:06.411 --> 01:57:08.906
 ANDROID INSTANT APPS CAN HELP
 ME WHEN I'M OUT AND ABOUT.

01:57:08.907 --> 01:57:11.519
 SO I WALK UP TO A PARKING
 METER AND I NEED TO PAY.  I'M

01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:14.462
 IN A REAL HURRY TODAY AND I
 DON'T HAVE TIME TO INSTALL A

01:57:14.463 --> 01:57:18.468
 PARKING APP, BUT WHAT IF I
 COULD JUST TAP MY PHONE, AND

01:57:18.469 --> 01:57:21.554
 WITH NFC IT COULD BRING UP
 THE PARKING APP IMMEDIATELY?

01:57:21.555 --> 01:57:26.110
 ALL I HAVE TO DO IS CHOOSE
 HOW LONG I WANT TO PARK.  I'M

01:57:26.111 --> 01:57:28.011
 ALREADY DONE.
 AND NOW FICUS CAN RUN OFF THE

01:57:28.012 --> 01:57:30.712
 STAGE TO HIS MEETING AND EVEN
 ADD MORE PARKING TIME LATER

01:57:30.713 --> 01:57:36.516
 IF HE REALLY NEEDS TO.
 SO THAT'S ANDROID INSTANT

01:57:36.517 --> 01:57:41.112

 TOTALLY SEAMLESS, FROM

01:57:41.113 --> 01:57:43.751
 LAUNCHING THE APP, TO SIGNING
 IN, TO MAKING PAYMENTS.

 UPDATE YOUR EXISTING APP. 

01:57:48.412 --> 01:57:52.013
 IT'S THE SAME ANDROID APIs,
 THE SAME PROJECT, AND THE

01:57:52.014 --> 01:57:54.961
 SAME SOURCE CODE.  AND IT CAN
 TAKE LESS THAN A DAY OF WORK,

01:57:54.962 --> 01:57:57.758
 DEPENDING ON HOW YOUR APP IS
 BUILT.

01:57:57.759 --> 01:58:02.420
 YOU'RE MODULARIZE YOUR APP
 AND GOOGLE PLAY WILL DOWNLOAD

01:58:02.421 --> 01:58:05.568
 ONLY THE PARTS THAT ARE
 NEEDED ON THE FLY, AS YOU SAW

01:58:05.569 --> 01:58:08.561
 HERE.  WE'RE REALLY EXCITED
 TO GIVE DEVELOPERS MORE WAYS

01:58:08.562 --> 01:58:11.416
 TO GET THEIR APPS INTO THE
 HANDS OF USERS.  IN ADDITION

01:58:11.417 --> 01:58:13.618
 TO DISCOVERING YOUR APPS IN
 THE PLAY STORE AND INSTALLING

01:58:13.619 --> 01:58:16.717

 PEOPLE CAN CAN USE YOUR
 INSTANT APP DIRECTLY, AND AS

01:58:19.125 --> 01:58:21.526
 WE SHOWED EARLIER, IF THEY
 WANT TO INSTALL IT, THAT'S

01:58:21.527 --> 01:58:24.017
 EASY, TOO.
 MOST IMPORTANTLY, YOU WILL BE

01:58:24.018 --> 01:58:28.071
 IN CONTROL OF THE EXPERIENCES
 YOU BUILD.  AND WHEN YOU DO

01:58:28.072 --> 01:58:32.516

 WILL BE JUST ONE TAP AWAY FOR

 OH, YEAH, I ALMOST FORGOT TO

01:58:37.526 --> 01:58:40.272
 MENTION ONE REALLY IMPORTANT
 DETAIL.  SO THIS DEMO THAT

01:58:40.273 --> 01:58:42.874

01:59:06.330 --> 01:59:09.322
 A BIG CHANGE IN HOW WE THINK
 ABOUT APPS.  WE WANT TO GET

01:59:09.323 --> 01:59:12.881
 IT RIGHT.  AND SO THAT'S
 GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME FOR

01:59:12.882 --> 01:59:14.876

 WE'RE WORKING NOW WITH A

 WORKING ON THIS WITH EVERYONE
 ELSE.  AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO

02:00:06.617 --> 02:00:11.999
 DO THAT IN TWO WAYS.  FIRST,
 WE ARE OPENING UP CORD

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:16.115
 COMPONENTS OF OUR MACHINE
 LEARNING SYSTEMS.  LAST YEAR,

02:00:16.116 --> 02:00:21.808
 WE OPEN SOURCED TENSORFLOW SO
 DEVELOPERS CAN EMBED MACHINE

02:00:21.809 --> 02:00:28.311
 LEARNING AND DEEP NEURAL NETS
 WITH A SINGLE APIs API.  IN 

02:00:28.312 --> 02:00:29.601
2015,
 IT WAS THE MOST FORKED

02:00:29.602 --> 02:00:31.918

 THE NUMBER ONE MACHINE

 SITE.

 LAST WEEK WE OPEN-SOURCED A
 NATURAL LANGUAGE PARSER WHICH

02:00:39.102 --> 02:00:42.163
 IS ALSO BUILT ON TOP OF
 TENSORFLOW.  WE ARE DOING

02:00:42.164 --> 02:00:45.949
 THESE THINGS SO WE CAN ENGAGE
 THE EXTERNAL COMMUNITY AND

02:00:45.950 --> 02:00:49.791
 WORK ON THIS TOGETHER WITH
 EVERYONE.

02:00:53.889 --> 02:00:57.090
 ALSO EXPOSING OUR MACHINE

 GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORM OVER

02:01:23.185 --> 02:01:26.888

 YOU USE GOOGLE CLOUD

 ACCESS TO THE GREAT SOFTWARE

02:01:38.956 --> 02:01:42.360
 MACHINE LEARNING, THE SCALE
 AT WHICH WE NEED TO DO

02:01:42.361 --> 02:01:45.157
 COMPUTING IS INCREDIBLE AND
 SO WE'VE STARTED BUILDING

02:01:45.158 --> 02:01:51.053
 SPECIALIZED, CUSTOM HARDWARE. 
 WE CALL THESE TENSOR

02:01:51.054 --> 02:01:55.724
 PROCESSING UNITS OR TPUs. 
 TPUs DELIVER AN ORDER OF

02:01:55.725 --> 02:01:59.624
 MAGNITUDE HIGHER PERFORMANCE
 PER WATT THAN ALL

02:01:59.625 --> 02:02:02.827
 COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE GPUs
 AND FPGAs.  AND WHEN YOU

02:02:02.828 --> 02:02:06.035
 USE THE GOOGLE CLOUD
 PLATFORM, YOU GET -- YOU CAN

02:02:06.036 --> 02:02:09.125
 TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TPUs AS
 WELL.

02:02:09.126 --> 02:02:13.236
 TPUs ARE WHAT POWERED
 ALPHAGO, DEEPMIND'S ALPHAGO,

02:02:13.237 --> 02:02:18.625
 IN ITS GAME AGAINST LEE SEDOL
 SEDOL.  GO IS AN ANCIENT

02:02:18.626 --> 02:02:21.527
 CHINESE BOARD GAME.  IT'S A

02:02:21.528 --> 02:02:24.728
 SIMPLE 19 BY 19 GRID BUT IT
 IS ONE OF THE MOST COMPLEX

02:02:24.729 --> 02:02:27.738
 GAMES HUMANS HAVE EVER
 DESIGNED.  IT HAS MORE

02:02:27.739 --> 02:02:30.644
 POSSIBLE BOARD
 CONFIGURATIONS, MANY MORE

02:02:30.645 --> 02:02:34.134
 POSSIBLE BOARD CONFIGURATIONS
 THAN THERE ARE ATOMS IN THE

02:02:34.135 --> 02:02:37.234
 UNIVERSE.  BEATING GO FOR
 COMPUTERS WAS WIDELY

02:02:37.235 --> 02:02:40.238
 CONSIDERED TO BE THE GRAND
 CHALLENGE FOR AI AND MOST

02:02:40.239 --> 02:02:42.335
 PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WOULDN'T
 HAPPEN FOR ANOTHER DECADE OR

02:02:42.336 --> 02:02:45.132
 SO.
 SO WE ARE REALLY THRILLED

02:02:45.133 --> 02:02:47.331
 THAT ALPHAGO WAS ABLE TO
 ACHIEVE THIS MILESTONE

02:02:47.332 --> 02:02:50.934
 RECENTLY.
 ONE THING WORTH CALLING OUT,

02:02:50.935 --> 02:02:55.848
 IN THE SECOND GAME THERE WAS
 A MOVE 37 BY ALPHAGO.  IT

02:02:55.849 --> 02:02:59.431
 CHANGED THE COURSE OF THE
 GAME AND IS NOW WIDELY

02:02:59.432 --> 02:03:02.539
 CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST
 BEAUTIFUL GO MOVES EVER SEEN

02:03:02.540 --> 02:03:05.936
 IN TOURNAMENT PLAY.  IT WAS
 NOT JUST AN INTUITIVE MOVE

02:03:05.937 --> 02:03:09.435
 BUT A VERY CREATIVE MOVE.  WE
 NORMALLY DON'T ASSOCIATE

02:03:09.436 --> 02:03:13.331
 COMPUTERS WITH MAKING
 CREATIVE CHOICES AND SO TO

02:03:13.332 --> 02:03:16.534
 US, THIS REPRESENTS A
 SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENT IN

02:03:16.535 --> 02:03:20.531
 AI.
 BY THE WAY, LEE SEDOL HAS WON

02:03:20.532 --> 02:03:23.647
 EVERY SINGLE GAME SINCE HE
 PLAYED AGAINST ALPHAGO AND HE

02:03:23.648 --> 02:03:26.547
 HAS EVEN REPLAYED SOME OF THE
 MOVES HE LEARNED FROM ALPHAGO

02:03:26.548 --> 02:03:30.639
 IN THAT GAME.
 AS A STATE-OF-THE-ART

02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:34.035
 CAPABILITIES IN MACHINE
 LEARNING AND AI PROGRESS, WE

02:03:34.036 --> 02:03:37.136
 SEE THEM BECOMING VERY
 VERSATILE AND WE THINK IT

02:03:37.137 --> 02:03:40.538
 APPLIES TO A WIDE RANGE OF
 FIELDS.  I WANT TO GIVE YOU

02:03:40.539 --> 02:03:45.340
 TWO EXAMPLES.  FIRST,
 ROBOTICS.  AT GOOGLE, A BUNCH

02:03:45.341 --> 02:03:50.647
 OF 20%ERS DECIDED TO HELP
 ROBOTS -- TRAIN ROBOTS TO

02:03:50.648 --> 02:03:53.242
 PICK UP OBJECTS.  YOU CAN SEE
 IT BEHIND ME.  THIS IS NOT

02:03:53.243 --> 02:03:56.150
 NEW.  YOU USUALLY DO IT BY
 WRITING CONTROL SYSTEM CODE. 

02:03:56.151 --> 02:04:00.944
 YOU PROGRAM THE ROBOTS WITH
 RULES.  BUT THIS TIME THEY

02:04:00.945 --> 02:04:05.042
 DECIDE TO USE DEEP LEARNING
 TECHNIQUES.  SO YOU CREATE A

02:04:05.043 --> 02:04:08.946
 CONTINUOUS FEEDBACK CYCLE SO
 THAT THE ROBOTS CAN LEARN

02:04:08.947 --> 02:04:12.249
 HAND-EYE COORDINATION BY
 THEMSELVES USING DEEP

02:04:12.250 --> 02:04:14.142
 LEARNING.
 AS YOU CAN SEE, THEY KEEP

02:04:14.143 --> 02:04:16.850
 DOING IT AND THEY KEEP
 LEARNING IT OVER AND OVER

02:04:16.851 --> 02:04:21.441
 AGAIN AND OVER TIME, THEY GET
 BETTER AND THEY EVEN LEARN

02:04:21.442 --> 02:04:25.954
 NATURAL AND USEFUL BEHAVIORS. 
 SO, FOR EXAMPLE, THE ROBOT IS

02:04:25.955 --> 02:04:29.440
 NUDGING THE STAPLER AWAY TO
 PICK UP THAT YELLOW OBJECT. 

02:04:29.441 --> 02:04:32.841
 WE DIDN'T WRITE THAT RULE. 
 THE ROBOT LEARNED IT

02:04:32.842 --> 02:04:35.948
 AUTOMATICALLY USING DEEP
 LEARNING.  SO IT'S AN AMAZING

02:04:35.949 --> 02:04:37.747
 EXAMPLE OF WHAT MACHINE
 LEARNING CAN DO.

02:04:37.748 --> 02:04:39.748
 [ APPLAUSE ]

02:04:43.544 --> 02:04:45.749
ANOTHER EXAMPLE IN
 HEALTHCARE, DIABETIC

02:04:45.750 --> 02:04:50.549
 RETINOPATHY IS THE FASTEST
 GROWING CAUSE OF BLINDNESS. 

02:04:50.550 --> 02:04:54.761
 IT AFFECTS 4.2 MILLION PEOPLE
 IN THE U.S. AND MANY MORE

02:04:54.762 --> 02:04:58.762
 WORLDWIDE.  TO DETECT IT, YOU
 NEED TO DO A SCAN, A SCAN OF

02:04:58.763 --> 02:05:02.450
 THE EYE LIKE YOU SEE BEHIND
 ME AND A HIGHLY TRAINED

02:05:02.451 --> 02:05:06.254
 DOCTOR CAN DETECT IT.  IF
 DETECTED EARLY, THE

02:05:06.255 --> 02:05:10.552
 TREATMENTS ARE EFFECTIVE.  IF
 DETECTED LATE, IT CAUSES

02:05:10.553 --> 02:05:13.647
 IRREVERSIBLE BLINDNESS.  AND
 IT'S VERY, VERY DIFFICULT TO

02:05:13.648 --> 02:05:16.552
 HAVE HIGHLY TRAINED DOCTORS
 AVAILABLE IN MANY PARTS OF

02:05:16.553 --> 02:05:20.520
 THE WORLD.  SO WE SET OUT TO
 WORK WITH A SMALL TEAM OF

02:05:20.521 --> 02:05:24.619
 ENGINEERS AND DOCTORS AND,
 AGAIN, USE DEEP LEARNING AND

02:05:24.620 --> 02:05:29.013
 STARTED TRAINING ON EYE
 SCANS.  AND OVER TIME, OUR

02:05:29.014 --> 02:05:32.914
 COMPUTER VISION SYSTEMS HAVE
 GOTTEN REALLY GOOD AT

02:05:32.915 --> 02:05:35.620
 DETECTING DIABETIC
 RETINOPATHY EARLY.  THIS IS

02:05:35.621 --> 02:05:38.429
 STILL EARLY, AND THERE'S A
 LONG ROAD AHEAD, AND WE'LL

02:05:38.430 --> 02:05:40.821
 WORK WITH THE MEDICAL
 COMMUNITY TO GET IT IN THE

02:05:40.822 --> 02:05:43.911
 HANDS OF AS MANY PEOPLE AS
 POSSIBLE.  BUT YOU CAN SEE

02:05:43.912 --> 02:05:46.224
 THE PROMISE, AGAIN, OF USING
 MACHINE LEARNING.

02:05:46.225 --> 02:05:50.825
 WHEN I HEAR ABOUT
 ADVANCEMENTS LIKE THESE, I'M

02:05:50.826 --> 02:05:53.415
 REMINDED THAT WE LIVE IN AN
 EXTRAORDINARY PERIOD FOR

02:05:53.416 --> 02:05:58.621
 COMPUTING.  WHETHER CLIMATE
 CHANGE, HEALTHCARE, OR

02:05:58.622 --> 02:06:02.820
 EDUCATION, THE MOST IMPORTANT
 STRUGGLES ALREADY HAVE

02:06:02.821 --> 02:06:06.422
 THOUSANDS OF BRILLIANT AND
 DEDICATED PEOPLE WORKING TO

02:06:06.423 --> 02:06:11.021
 MAKE PROGRESS ON ISSUES THAT
 AFFECT EVERYONE.

02:06:11.022 --> 02:06:14.111
 NOW, CONSIDER WHAT THE BEST
 CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCHERS,

02:06:14.112 --> 02:06:19.417
 DOCTORS, OR EDUCATORS CAN DO
 WITH THE POWER OF MACHINE

02:06:19.418 --> 02:06:23.516
 LEARNING ASSISTING THEM.
 AS YOU HAVE SEEN TODAY, I'M

02:06:23.517 --> 02:06:26.222
 INCREDIBLY EXCITED ABOUT THE
 PROGRESS THAT WE ARE MAKING

02:06:26.223 --> 02:06:31.913
 WITH MACHINE LEARNING AND AI. 
 WE BELIEVE THAT THE REAL TEST

02:06:31.914 --> 02:06:36.012
 IS WHETHER HUMANS CAN ACHIEVE
 A LOT MORE WITH THE SUPPORT

02:06:36.013 --> 02:06:39.932
 OF AI ASSISTING THEM.
 THINGS PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT TO

02:06:39.933 --> 02:06:44.828
 BE IMPOSSIBLE MAY, IN FACT,
 BE POSSIBLE.  WE LOOK FORWARD

02:06:44.829 --> 02:06:48.545
 TO BUILDING THIS FUTURE
 TOGETHER WITH ALL OF YOU.

02:06:48.546 --> 02:06:50.437
 THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AT
 GOOGLE I/O.
