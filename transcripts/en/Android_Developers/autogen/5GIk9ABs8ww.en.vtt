a few is actually I think this is the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990
a few is actually I think this is the
 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.580
a few is actually I think this is the
first i/o where we have a majority of

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590
first i/o where we have a majority of
 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.450
first i/o where we have a majority of
returning people but it looks like we've

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460
returning people but it looks like we've
 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.550
returning people but it looks like we've
got a lot of new faces here and how many

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560
got a lot of new faces here and how many
 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.620
got a lot of new faces here and how many
people here are actively involved in the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630
people here are actively involved in the
 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.020

pretty much what I expected so a lot of

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100
pretty much what I expected so a lot of
 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.179
pretty much what I expected so a lot of
great stuff for you and before I jump

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189
great stuff for you and before I jump
 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.010
great stuff for you and before I jump
into some of the new stuff let me put it

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020
into some of the new stuff let me put it
 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.859
into some of the new stuff let me put it
into perspective a bit this is actually

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869
into perspective a bit this is actually
 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.170
into perspective a bit this is actually
a computer game I wrote 40 years ago

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180
a computer game I wrote 40 years ago
 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.899
a computer game I wrote 40 years ago
this year the codes on the left and the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909
this year the codes on the left and the
 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.270
this year the codes on the left and the
actual game input and output is on the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280
actual game input and output is on the
 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.700
actual game input and output is on the
right at that point when we were doing

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710
right at that point when we were doing
 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.459
right at that point when we were doing
computer games we basically had sort of

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469
computer games we basically had sort of
 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.069
computer games we basically had sort of
glorified electric typewriters and that

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079
glorified electric typewriters and that
 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.350
glorified electric typewriters and that
was our input and output you in this

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360
was our input and output you in this
 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.760
was our input and output you in this
particular game we had a list of

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770
particular game we had a list of
 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.819
particular game we had a list of
numerical commands you would type in

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829
numerical commands you would type in
 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.859
numerical commands you would type in
just a year or two after that came out I

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869
just a year or two after that came out I
 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.530
just a year or two after that came out I
saw my first video screen and got to

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540
saw my first video screen and got to
 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.200
saw my first video screen and got to
code

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210
code
 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.670
code
if something that actually controlled

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680
if something that actually controlled
 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.200
if something that actually controlled
the video on the screen and it was a

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210
the video on the screen and it was a
 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.180
the video on the screen and it was a
revelation for me and of course right

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190
revelation for me and of course right
 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.370
revelation for me and of course right
around that time as video and computers

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380
around that time as video and computers
 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.080
around that time as video and computers
were coming together it made some of the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090
were coming together it made some of the
 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.270
were coming together it made some of the
first video games possible and those

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280
first video games possible and those
 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.800
first video games possible and those
kinds of combinations we've actually

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810
kinds of combinations we've actually
 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.570
kinds of combinations we've actually
become kind of used to it but every few

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580
become kind of used to it but every few
 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.400
become kind of used to it but every few
years there's some new dramatic mix of

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410
years there's some new dramatic mix of
 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.410
years there's some new dramatic mix of
new technologies that can come together

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420
new technologies that can come together
 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.270
new technologies that can come together
in these great ways you know for example

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280
in these great ways you know for example
 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.210
in these great ways you know for example
we had CD ROMs and a higher color

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220
we had CD ROMs and a higher color
 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.680
we had CD ROMs and a higher color
resolution that enabled the kind of

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690
resolution that enabled the kind of
 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.600
resolution that enabled the kind of
modern graphics that were used to now or

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610
modern graphics that were used to now or
 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.940
modern graphics that were used to now or
modems and server based architecture

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950
modems and server based architecture
 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.070
modems and server based architecture
that made MMOs and a lot of the online

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080
that made MMOs and a lot of the online
 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.860
that made MMOs and a lot of the online
games possible and more recently we have

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870
games possible and more recently we have
 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.330
games possible and more recently we have
you know smartphones that are putting

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340
you know smartphones that are putting
 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.710
you know smartphones that are putting
those games right in our pocket and

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720
those games right in our pocket and
 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.480
those games right in our pocket and
connecting us with everybody else in the

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490
connecting us with everybody else in the
 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.690
connecting us with everybody else in the
world those are just a few examples the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700
world those are just a few examples the
 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.250
world those are just a few examples the
games industry now is bigger than it's

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260
games industry now is bigger than it's
 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.830
games industry now is bigger than it's

session there this year we had more

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930
session there this year we had more
 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.620
session there this year we had more
people there I think than they even fit

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630
people there I think than they even fit
 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.030
people there I think than they even fit
into this room but right in this room

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040
into this room but right in this room
 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.040
into this room but right in this room
alone we've got almost double the amount

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050
alone we've got almost double the amount
 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.960
alone we've got almost double the amount
of people that were at the first Game

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970
of people that were at the first Game

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.890
hundredfold since then the sorry the GDC
has grown to hundredfold since then and

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900
has grown to hundredfold since then and
 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.660
has grown to hundredfold since then and
with good reason because there are all

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670
with good reason because there are all
 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.600
with good reason because there are all
these wonderful new technologies

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610
these wonderful new technologies
 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.830
these wonderful new technologies
platforms beyond just the kind of

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840
platforms beyond just the kind of
 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.110
platforms beyond just the kind of
computers and the dedicated consoles

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120
computers and the dedicated consoles
 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.880
computers and the dedicated consoles
that were used to but of course we've

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890
that were used to but of course we've
 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.920
that were used to but of course we've
seen browser-based social gaming and

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930
seen browser-based social gaming and
 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.930
seen browser-based social gaming and
downloadable games a lot of indie games

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940
downloadable games a lot of indie games
 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.120
downloadable games a lot of indie games
coming that way and of course mobile

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130
coming that way and of course mobile
 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.430
coming that way and of course mobile
games of all types and the last couple

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440
games of all types and the last couple
 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.930
games of all types and the last couple
of years we've now started to look at

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940
of years we've now started to look at
 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.240
of years we've now started to look at
virtual reality and wearables so it's

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250
virtual reality and wearables so it's
 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.560
virtual reality and wearables so it's
given us all sorts of wonderful

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570
given us all sorts of wonderful
 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.350
given us all sorts of wonderful
opportunities and here at Google we make

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360
opportunities and here at Google we make
 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.090
opportunities and here at Google we make
all sorts of hardware software and

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100
all sorts of hardware software and
 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.160
all sorts of hardware software and
services that help you develop games

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170
services that help you develop games
 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.320
services that help you develop games
grow your audiences enter and some

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330
grow your audiences enter and some
 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.690
grow your audiences enter and some
profits so today as we're talking about

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700
profits so today as we're talking about
 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.370
profits so today as we're talking about
some of those things and in the next few

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380
some of those things and in the next few
 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.080
some of those things and in the next few
days as you hear from our other groups I

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090
days as you hear from our other groups I
 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.180
days as you hear from our other groups I
hope you think about the advantages that

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190
hope you think about the advantages that
 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.040
hope you think about the advantages that
you get when you combine some of those

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050
you get when you combine some of those
 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.930
you get when you combine some of those
services together to explore new areas

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940
services together to explore new areas
 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.360
services together to explore new areas
just as those examples I mentioned in

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370
just as those examples I mentioned in
 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.190
just as those examples I mentioned in
the past of new things coming together

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200
the past of new things coming together
 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.560
the past of new things coming together
like that to see what kind of new games

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570
like that to see what kind of new games
 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.750
like that to see what kind of new games
or even new entire types of games that

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760
or even new entire types of games that
 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.870
or even new entire types of games that
you can create and the practical reasons

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880
you can create and the practical reasons
 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.610
you can create and the practical reasons
for the experimenting for this there are

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620
for the experimenting for this there are
 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.100
for the experimenting for this there are
a lot of payoffs for you it's really I

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110
a lot of payoffs for you it's really I
 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.920
a lot of payoffs for you it's really I
think like going

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930
think like going
 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.930
think like going
through a secluded mountain pass and

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940
through a secluded mountain pass and
 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.999
through a secluded mountain pass and
maybe there'll be a dead end on the

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:31.009
maybe there'll be a dead end on the
 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:32.650
maybe there'll be a dead end on the
other side maybe it'll open up into a

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660
other side maybe it'll open up into a
 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.659
other side maybe it'll open up into a
fertile valley maybe there's an entire

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669
fertile valley maybe there's an entire
 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.790
fertile valley maybe there's an entire
new continent of possibility the the

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800
new continent of possibility the the
 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.040
new continent of possibility the the
smartphone games when they came out our

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050
smartphone games when they came out our
 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.870
smartphone games when they came out our
whole new continent it's just amazing

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880
whole new continent it's just amazing
 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.240
whole new continent it's just amazing
how big that's gotten and I think that

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250
how big that's gotten and I think that
 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.100
how big that's gotten and I think that
we have some really great possibilities

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110
we have some really great possibilities
 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.040
we have some really great possibilities
coming up in those areas too one of the

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050
coming up in those areas too one of the
 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.600
coming up in those areas too one of the
reasons for doing that is if you combine

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610
reasons for doing that is if you combine
 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.659
reasons for doing that is if you combine
some new exciting thing like virtual

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669
some new exciting thing like virtual
 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.900
some new exciting thing like virtual
reality with something as big as the

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910
reality with something as big as the
 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.930
reality with something as big as the
billion plus Android smartphone users

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940
billion plus Android smartphone users
 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.879
billion plus Android smartphone users
and make a game that works well in both

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889
and make a game that works well in both
 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:02.740
and make a game that works well in both
of those fields then you've got

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750
of those fields then you've got
 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.390
of those fields then you've got
something that has the appeal and the

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400
something that has the appeal and the
 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.700
something that has the appeal and the
press attention of virtual reality but

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710
press attention of virtual reality but
 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.200
press attention of virtual reality but
the huge market of the existing

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210
the huge market of the existing
 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.150
the huge market of the existing
smartphones out there and it's not easy

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160
smartphones out there and it's not easy
 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.469
smartphones out there and it's not easy
to do that sort of thing but it's

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479
to do that sort of thing but it's
 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:13.930
to do that sort of thing but it's
certainly possible and the payoff is

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940
certainly possible and the payoff is
 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.150
certainly possible and the payoff is
really worthwhile so that's just using

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160
really worthwhile so that's just using
 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.770
really worthwhile so that's just using
some existing technologies let's

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780
some existing technologies let's
 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.210
some existing technologies let's
consider some of the new ones that are

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220
consider some of the new ones that are
 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.430
consider some of the new ones that are
