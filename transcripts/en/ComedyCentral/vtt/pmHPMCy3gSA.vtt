00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:34.233
Was I in another coma?

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:35.735

He's like America's
worst president.

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:48.914 align:start size:84% position:16%

Well I hope he
spends time in jail,

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.766

The Juice is loose. He had
a great year last year.

and won a bunch of Emmys.

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:25.451 align:start size:97% position:3%
Then they shot a documentary
and it won the Oscar.

00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:26.452

00:01:26.452 --> 00:01:27.787 size:88% position:44%

doesn't even have an Oscar.

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:32.458

Bad boyfriend, he smokes inside,

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:36.295
he's way older than he
looks, and Mortdecai.

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:39.465
- Mortdecai was bad? What? How?

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:43.035
It costarred Gwyneth Paltrow,
America's friggin' sweetheart!

00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:44.971

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:46.472
- Goop is great!

00:01:46.472 --> 00:01:48.140
- Goop is the worst thing
I've ever fucking heard of!

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.975

(man screams)

00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:53.212
- You bastard.

00:01:53.212 --> 00:01:55.481 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Shut up. Shut the
fuck up, okay? Shut up!

00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:57.216
I just wanna wear
my Aaron Hernandez

00:01:57.216 --> 00:01:58.651
jersey it calms me down.

00:01:58.651 --> 00:01:59.651
Where is it?

00:01:59.651 --> 00:02:01.687
- You mean this? You mean this?

00:02:01.687 --> 00:02:02.821
- Why is that all ripped up?

00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:04.190 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Because Aaron
Hernandez is a murderer.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.691
- No!

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:06.992
- He murdered a bunch of
people including himself.

00:02:06.992 --> 00:02:08.494
- He's dead?
- He's dead!

00:02:08.494 --> 00:02:10.162

00:02:10.162 --> 00:02:11.664
(Nick gasps)

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:12.998
(heart monitor flatlining)

00:02:12.998 --> 00:02:15.534
- And he moved too
much. God damn it!

00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:17.670
Ruined the frickin' painting.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.406
(inhales deeply)

00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:30.516

doesn't like sick people any
more, so you have to leave.

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:37.524
Oh, they're already
dead. Even better.

00:02:39.558 --> 00:02:40.393
