00:00:05.334 --> 00:00:07.750
HAOHSIANG LIAO: Whenever you
have interaction with people,

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.010
you leave impressions.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.230
You are evaluated.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:17.090
So that's a very basic,
fundamental idea.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.490
We want to give evaluation to
our students each performance.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.780
That means each class.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.940
And the second thing
is we are convinced

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.450
that, as long as students
are persistent and consistent

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.590
in their efforts to
take this course,

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.480
they can demonstrate very
good skills in Chinese.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.940
So because of those two reasons,
we adopt a daily grading system

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.530
here.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.540
So usually, after
class, we provide

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.710
feedback to each student's
performance in class--

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.060
including language, including
his cultural behavior--

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.360
so that students know what to
improve for the next sessions.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.190
We usually do written feedback.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.370
So we use an online-- we have
a website called Engrade.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.940
So besides entering grades,
you can also leave comments

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.120
to each student privately.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.470
So each student, as
long as they get access

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.045
into their website
to their account,

00:01:16.045 --> 00:01:18.770
they will read the comments
from the instructor.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.840
So the comments--
it really depends

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.200
on the student's performance.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.410
It can be as simple
as, you know, pay

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.260
attention to the
following pronunciations.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.650
It can be a little
bit more elaborated.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.390
For example, think
about, how are you

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.770
going to deal with
compliments in Chinese?

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.300
For example, this is another
example I always like to use.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.850
In American culture, when
you receive a compliment,

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.570
it's very natural for
you to say thank you.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.540
For example, your
Chinese is very good.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.350
You say, thank you.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.225
Your English is good.

00:01:50.225 --> 00:01:50.980
Thank you.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.000
However, being humble
is the way when

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.780
you receive a compliment
in Chinese culture.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.180
You don't accept it
by saying thank you.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.500
Sometimes you say things,
for example, like,

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.580
there's still a long way for
me to go, so it's too far.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.570
Oh, I don't know where the
compliments come from. [LAUGHS]

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.310
So yeah, the fundamental
idea in Chinese culture

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.250
about compliments
is to remain humble.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.090
So if the student's performance
in class is from his L1,

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.030
we will encourage
them and give them

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.670
the feedback by
thinking about, how

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.840
do you deal with compliments
in Chinese culture,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.450
according to a textbook
where everything

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.020
is based on the materials
we cover in class?

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.080
So students can know
this is something

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.300
that they can work on.
