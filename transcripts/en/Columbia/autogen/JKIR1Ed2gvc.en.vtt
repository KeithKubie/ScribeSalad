indeed the IMF have done an interesting

indeed the IMF have done an interesting

of these indicators and they have assess

of these indicators and they have assess
 

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.510
of these indicators and they have assess
the extent to which these are covered by

the extent to which these are covered by
 

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.029
the extent to which these are covered by
financial stability reviews and in many

00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039
financial stability reviews and in many
 

00:19:43.039 --> 00:19:46.330
financial stability reviews and in many
cases they are simply not and in all

cases they are simply not and in all
 

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:49.060

cases they are missing some of them and
 

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:52.529
cases they are missing some of them and
interestingly the database shows that

00:19:52.529 --> 00:19:52.539
interestingly the database shows that
 

00:19:52.539 --> 00:19:55.149
interestingly the database shows that

than ones who were not supervisors
suggesting that if you are a supervisor

00:20:10.779 --> 00:20:10.789
suggesting that if you are a supervisor
 

00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:12.820
suggesting that if you are a supervisor
you are somewhat constrained in what you

you are somewhat constrained in what you
 

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:14.830
you are somewhat constrained in what you
can say about developments in the

can say about developments in the
 

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.360
can say about developments in the

people will say well if that's really

people will say well if that's really
 

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.419
people will say well if that's really
worrying the supervisor gosh we really

00:20:19.419 --> 00:20:19.429
worrying the supervisor gosh we really
 

00:20:19.429 --> 00:20:21.730
worrying the supervisor gosh we really
ought to be worried about it so there's

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:21.740
ought to be worried about it so there's
 

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.039
ought to be worried about it so there's
an interesting divergence there between

00:20:24.039 --> 00:20:24.049
an interesting divergence there between
 

00:20:24.049 --> 00:20:25.690
an interesting divergence there between

what's going wrong so what you could see

what's going wrong so what you could see
 

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.070
what's going wrong so what you could see
during this period is that although

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.080
during this period is that although
 

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.919
during this period is that although
there was an outpouring of publication

00:20:38.919 --> 00:20:38.929
there was an outpouring of publication
 

00:20:38.929 --> 00:20:40.630
there was an outpouring of publication
of our financial stability it did not

of our financial stability it did not
 

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:45.850
of our financial stability it did not
lead to any action why is that the case

well there is of course a difference a

that have to be significant losses but
 

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:52.310
that have to be significant losses but
the problem is that a lot of those

00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:52.320
the problem is that a lot of those
 

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:53.960
the problem is that a lot of those
losses would fall on German banks and

point of view and I think it's not the
most likely outcome so I think what is

00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:15.150
most likely outcome so I think what is
 

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:17.810
most likely outcome so I think what is
most likely is that we get continued

are getting ready for that I'm going to
 

00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:29.099
are getting ready for that I'm going to
just start off by asking one question

00:49:29.099 --> 00:49:29.109
 
 

00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:32.950
 
which has to do with of differences of

focusing on financial stability one of
 

00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:50.710
focusing on financial stability one of
the big problems in one of the big

00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720
the big problems in one of the big
 

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:52.810
the big problems in one of the big
differences between going after price

00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:52.820
differences between going after price
 

00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:55.329
differences between going after price
stability vs financial market stability

00:49:55.329 --> 00:49:55.339
stability vs financial market stability
 

00:49:55.339 --> 00:49:59.589
stability vs financial market stability
is that there's a there's a very large

00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599
is that there's a there's a very large
 

00:49:59.599 --> 00:50:01.329
is that there's a there's a very large
difference in terms of the political

difference in terms of the political
 

00:50:01.339 --> 00:50:06.849
difference in terms of the political
economy so I one can imagine the

00:50:06.849 --> 00:50:06.859
economy so I one can imagine the
 

00:50:06.859 --> 00:50:08.170
economy so I one can imagine the
difficulties that the Fed might have

00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:08.180
difficulties that the Fed might have
 

00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:13.960
difficulties that the Fed might have
faced in December of 2007 when Lehman

faced in December of 2007 when Lehman
 

00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:15.310
faced in December of 2007 when Lehman
was trading at seventy dollars a share

to be shut down the question one of the

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:28.310
to be shut down the question one of the
 

00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:29.829
to be shut down the question one of the
questions is how do you regulate the

00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839
questions is how do you regulate the
 

00:50:29.839 --> 00:50:33.490
questions is how do you regulate the
regulator how do you make sure that even

00:50:33.490 --> 00:50:33.500
regulator how do you make sure that even
 

00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:36.310

if you gave mandate to a central bank

00:50:36.310 --> 00:50:36.320
if you gave mandate to a central bank
 

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:40.210
if you gave mandate to a central bank
that it will actually carry forward and

00:50:40.210 --> 00:50:40.220
that it will actually carry forward and
 

00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:41.980
that it will actually carry forward and
be able to deal with these very

00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:41.990
be able to deal with these very
 

00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:43.859
be able to deal with these very
politically connected powerful

politically connected powerful
 

00:50:43.869 --> 00:50:49.660
politically connected powerful
institutions well and I think the best

00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:49.670
institutions well and I think the best
 

00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:51.310
institutions well and I think the best
answer to that question is that you

00:50:51.310 --> 00:50:51.320
answer to that question is that you
 

00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:55.050
answer to that question is that you
shouldn't have a bee in December 2007

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:55.060
shouldn't have a bee in December 2007
 

00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:57.880
shouldn't have a bee in December 2007
and i guess the thrust of what i'm

00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:57.890
and i guess the thrust of what i'm
 

00:50:57.890 --> 00:51:00.160
and i guess the thrust of what i'm
saying is that you should be attempting

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:00.170
saying is that you should be attempting
 

00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:05.230
saying is that you should be attempting
to respond and to these trends before

00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:05.240
to respond and to these trends before
 

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:08.740
to respond and to these trends before
they get get critical but i think the

00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:08.750
they get get critical but i think the
 

00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:11.250
they get get critical but i think the
other part of my answer would be

00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:11.260
other part of my answer would be
 

00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:15.150
other part of my answer would be
that it would be very helpful if the

00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:15.160
that it would be very helpful if the
 

00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:19.650
that it would be very helpful if the
central bank had an explicit statutory

00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:19.660
central bank had an explicit statutory
 

00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:22.000
central bank had an explicit statutory
responsibility for financial stability

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:22.010

I think one of the problems that we saw

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:35.960
I think one of the problems that we saw
 

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:39.520
I think one of the problems that we saw
in the lead-up to the crisis was that it

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:39.530
in the lead-up to the crisis was that it
 

00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:41.980
in the lead-up to the crisis was that it
was quite difficult for central banks to

00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:41.990
was quite difficult for central banks to
 

00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:44.890
was quite difficult for central banks to
act decisively and because they didn't

00:51:44.890 --> 00:51:44.900
act decisively and because they didn't
 

00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:47.260
act decisively and because they didn't
have a very clear mandate for doing so

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:47.270
have a very clear mandate for doing so
 

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:49.420
have a very clear mandate for doing so
they had a very clear mandate on retail

00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:49.430
they had a very clear mandate on retail
 

00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:50.950
they had a very clear mandate on retail
price inflation but they didn't have a

financial stability now I have to say

00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:56.570

own view because the Treasury didn't
 

00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:12.700
own view because the Treasury didn't
control it properly and didn't really

00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:12.710
control it properly and didn't really
 

00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:14.550

business and that's the end of it
 

00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:32.420
business and that's the end of it
because we don't think that they're

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:32.430
because we don't think that they're
 

00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:35.270
because we don't think that they're
going to create systemic risk or else

00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280
going to create systemic risk or else

it's going to go out of business and we

it's going to go out of business and we
 

00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:41.180
it's going to go out of business and we
think that it needs to be rescued

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:41.190
think that it needs to be rescued
 

00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:43.040
think that it needs to be rescued
because of the rest of the system and
