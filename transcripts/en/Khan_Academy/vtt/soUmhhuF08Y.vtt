00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.900
If x-- and the operator here is
this x with a circle around it,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.280
so maybe we'll call it circle-x.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.510
If x circle-x y is equal
to x plus 3y, and x--

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.707
I'll call that circle-plus.

00:00:11.707 --> 00:00:13.540
So it's not plus, it's
a different operator.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.581
It's a new operation, and
we're defining it here.

00:00:15.581 --> 00:00:20.350
And x circle-plus y is equal
to 4x squared minus y squared,

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.245
find negative 2 circle-plus the
quantity three circle-cross,

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:28.371
or circle-x minus 1.

00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:30.620
So if we just break it down,
we use these definitions,

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.536
it should hopefully be
pretty straightforward.

00:00:32.536 --> 00:00:36.710
So let's evaluate 3
circle-x negative 1.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.530
So 3 circle-x negative 1.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.790
Well, they define
that as whatever

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.730
is x plus 3 times whatever is y.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.650
So this is going
to be whatever is

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.440
x, so that is our 3, plus
3 times whatever is y.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.830
Well, that's going
to be negative 1.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:03.560
So this is 3 plus negative
3, which is equal to 0.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.150
So this whole part right
over here is equal to 0.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.270
So our entire
expression simplifies

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.620
down to negative
2 circle-plus 0.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.170
And now we can use this
definition right here. x

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.850
circle-plus y is equal to
4x squared minus y squared.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.160
So in this situation, our x--
let me circle it over here.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:37.270
Our x is negative
2 , and our y is 0.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.240
So this is going to be
equal to-- it's going

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.650
to be equal to 4
times x squared.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.610
So that's negative 2 squared.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.050
4 times negative 2
squared minus y squared.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.500
Well, y is just 0.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.070
Minus 0 squared.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.240
And 0 squared is
obviously just 0.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.880
And so this simplifies to
4 times negative 2 squared.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.950
Negative 2 squared
is positive 4.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.740
So it's 4 times 4.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.990
So it simplifies to 4 times
4, which is equal to 16.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.860
And we're done.
