are no more anonymous API calls so even

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479
are no more anonymous API calls so even
 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:17.730
are no more anonymous API calls so even
if you're doing something simple like

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740

fortunately the the registration process

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789
fortunately the the registration process
 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:29.699
fortunately the the registration process
is quite lightweight and you can do it

00:01:29.699 --> 00:01:29.709
is quite lightweight and you can do it
 

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:33.059
is quite lightweight and you can do it
using the Google developers console so

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069
using the Google developers console so
 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:35.219
using the Google developers console so
let's switch to the screen sharing right

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229
let's switch to the screen sharing right
 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.199
let's switch to the screen sharing right
now and I'll walk you through the

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:37.209
now and I'll walk you through the
 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:39.960
now and I'll walk you through the
process so we get here right now by

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970
process so we get here right now by
 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.230
process so we get here right now by
going to cloud Google com slash console

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240
going to cloud Google com slash console
 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.880

registration I can now use the data API

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409
registration I can now use the data API
 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:01.860
registration I can now use the data API
but I need one more piece of information

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870
but I need one more piece of information
 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.319
but I need one more piece of information
in order to start making those read-only

in order to start making those read-only
 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.409
in order to start making those read-only
API calls and that's the API key and I

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:07.419
API calls and that's the API key and I
 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:08.580
API calls and that's the API key and I
can do that by clicking on the

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590
can do that by clicking on the
 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.059

to the public API access and clicking on
 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.250
to the public API access and clicking on
create new key so let's say

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260
create new key so let's say
 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.869
create new key so let's say
hypothetically that I'm going to be

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879
hypothetically that I'm going to be
 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.649
hypothetically that I'm going to be
doing these calls from the context of a

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:25.659
doing these calls from the context of a

web browser making some JavaScript calls
 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.569
web browser making some JavaScript calls
in that case clicking on browser key is

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579
in that case clicking on browser key is
 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.369
in that case clicking on browser key is
appropriate if you're going to be doing

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379
appropriate if you're going to be doing
 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:33.780
appropriate if you're going to be doing
these read-only calls

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790
these read-only calls
 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.819
these read-only calls
mute from some sort of you know some

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829
mute from some sort of you know some
 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.379

more server-side scripts you could click

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389
more server-side scripts you could click
 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.819
more server-side scripts you could click
on server key I have the option here of

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829
on server key I have the option here of
 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.349
on server key I have the option here of
making it so that the API key can only

making it so that the API key can only
 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.460
making it so that the API key can only
be used when the JavaScript origin is a

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470
be used when the JavaScript origin is a
 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.949
be used when the JavaScript origin is a
specific whitelisted domain this is a

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959
specific whitelisted domain this is a
 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.599
specific whitelisted domain this is a
security feature way of protecting your

security feature way of protecting your
 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.640
security feature way of protecting your
key a little bit it's not something I'm

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650
key a little bit it's not something I'm
 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.649
key a little bit it's not something I'm
particularly worried about right now but

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:55.659
particularly worried about right now but
 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:57.839
particularly worried about right now but
you can fill in the actual domain for

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849
you can fill in the actual domain for
 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.819
you can fill in the actual domain for
your website if you would like to so I'm

and you'll see over here I have an API

restriction over there and this is an
API key that I could then use to make v3

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:15.759
API key that I could then use to make v3
 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:20.339
