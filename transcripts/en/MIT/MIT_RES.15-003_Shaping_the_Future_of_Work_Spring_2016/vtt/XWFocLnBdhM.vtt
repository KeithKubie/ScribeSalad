00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.720
Earlier in this
course, we talked

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.380
about the changing
role of labor unions

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.020
and how the decline
in union membership

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.470
has contributed to the breakdown
of the social contract.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.500
To understand this
better, let's look

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.640
at how union membership rates
have changed since their peak

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.670
in the 1950s, when almost
one third of all employees

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.930
belonged to a union.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.390
By the early 1980s,
around the time when

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.720
we began to see the real
effects of the breakdown

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.100
of the social contract,
union membership

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.670
was already declining.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.720
And from then until now,
it declined even more

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.630
dramatically.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:51.360
In 2013, only 11% of 129 million
working individuals in the US

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.760
had a union on the job and
collective bargaining network.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.670
Now, in the private sector,
which employees most

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.250
working individuals in the US,
this percentage is even lower--

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.600
barely 7% of these workers
in fast food, health care,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.840
or technology, for example,
barely 7% have a union at work.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.620
Now, labor leaders and scholars
who study employment and labor

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.750
unions argue that
a number of factors

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.810
have contributed to
this decline in unions.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.150
Some argue, for example, that
the structure of the economy

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.890
plays a role, as growth in
non-union sectors concentrated

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.940
in service industries
has outstripped growth

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.550
in industries like
construction and manufacturing

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.280
where unions historically
have been strong.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.540
Others point to the increased
difficulty of organizing

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.470
new membership,
and in particular,

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.280
to the legal obstacles
that exist in implementing

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.770
new agreements at work.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.650
Recent research has found that
only one in seven workplaces

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.320
where workers have organized an
election and voted for a union

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.100
will actually see a contract in
the year following their vote.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.310
And oftentimes, these types
of elections are contentious.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.100
And in workplaces
where employers

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.450
have been charged with
trying to discourage union

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.200
activity through
unfair labor practices,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.160
the odds go down
by nearly a third.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.450
In addition to these economic
and legal challenges,

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.780
labor leaders and
scholars also point

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.380
to increased
anti-union activity,

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.710
not only by employers, but
increasingly by policymakers,

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.400
as we've seen in states
like Wisconsin and Indiana,

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.330
who are rolling back
workers' rights to organize

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.660
and collective
bargaining agreements.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.650
So over the past
three decades, there's

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.020
really been a shift, not only
in how many people experience

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.810
labor unions on the job,
but in the way that we

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.830
think about labor unions.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.710
In this course, we've talked
about the social contract

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.230
and what it means at work--

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.270
this idea that what's good for
workers is good for businesses.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.490
And although we have examples
of many good employers

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.800
as discussed by Professor
Zeynep Ton in her video,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.520
many employers act
as though this idea

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.100
is no longer the case--

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.890
that what's good
for workers is not

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.230
necessarily good for businesses,
and that unions do not

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.280
have a role in improving
the way that firms work.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.400
At the same time, declining
wages, less job security,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.070
and increased costs related
to things like health care

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.160
and student loans
are making it more

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.500
difficult for
working individuals.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.810
All of this adds up to
a difficult environment,

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.110
not only for labor
unions, but also

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.950
for individuals
who try to protect

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.910
their rights on the job.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.930
The good news, however, is
that over the past two decades,

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.970
we've had a flurry of
activity in organizing around

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.310
economic justice in ways
that are bringing employees'

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.190
voices front and center.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.250
These include new
strategies of labor unions

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.050
to expand their membership
and include more working

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.200
people, the growth of
worker centers and labor

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.450
associations outside this
realm, and the strengthening

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.870
of employment policy through
economic development.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.740
We've also seen a growing
number of social movements

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.440
that are highlighting the ways
in which the social contract

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.090
can be reestablished at work.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.130
In the next video,
we'll talk about each

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:21.949
of these in a bit more detail.
