00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.870
When the framework can run in the
background it is said to be thread safe.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.930
However, there are several frameworks
that are not thread safe and

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.570
can only run in the main queue.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.210
There or
two notable cases in the apple stack.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.340
These are two banana peels waiting for
a newbie to step on them.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.460
These are UIKit and Core data.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.460
Let's start with UIKit.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.070
You cannot run anything from
UIKit in the background, or

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.570
your app will crash intermittently.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.710
That's the beauty of concurrency bugs.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.710
Sometimes they show up,
sometimes they don't.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.330
The bottom line is never use
anything who's name ends with

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.080
view in the background.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.660
Or else.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.750
Core data is a bit more complicated, and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.470
we will deal with this in greater
detail once we reach core data.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.750
The thing to remember here is
that ns manage object context

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.460
can only be used in the same
queue it was created.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.960
Therefore, if you created
the context in the main queue,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.710
you may only use it in the main queue.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.660
However, if you create
a context in a background que,

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.740
then you may only use
it in the background.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.760
My recommendation is to wait until we
feel really confident with core data and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.790
GCD before you try to mix them together.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.700
Core data in the background is second
than core data, so tread carefully,

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.374
Daniel son.

00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:27.460
Until then, wax on wax off.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.410
Remember to breath, very important, hai.
