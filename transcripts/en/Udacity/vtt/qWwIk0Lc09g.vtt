00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.380
Things to think about for your social
media page are making sure you follow

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.480
the guidelines for each platform.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.010
Make sure you have all the things like
a cover photo, a profile photo, and

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.330
a description.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.570
And make sure that you have a tone
of voice for your brand and

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.543
you're sticking to it.

00:00:13.543 --> 00:00:15.679
You want your company
to have a voice and

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.360
a personality that's
recognizable by your customers.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.080
Because you already know
your market segment or

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.840
your persona, you'll know how
to communicate with them.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.430
Now, if it's relevant to your audience,
try to be a little bit light hearted and

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.700
delight your user in a funny way.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.370
&gt;&gt; Make users smile from the way
you communicate with them.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.240
&gt;&gt; MailChimp let's you have
a little bit of fun when you're

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.610
setting up your account.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.960
If you try to choose a username
that already exists, they say,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.810
maybe it's your evil twin, spooky.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.700
You kind of get their personality
through that and it's delightful and

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.000
it will make you smile if you notice it.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.690
Check out readme, when you're about
to put in your password the little

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.170
owl covers up his eyes,
it's a cute little extra touch.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.410
Once you have your basic setup and your
unique tone of voice, all you have to do

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.760
is simply find the secret sauce
to make your content go viral.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.960
Easy, right?

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.370
Well, no, it's actually the most
challenging thing with social media.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.920
It's really hard to predict what
your audience will share, and

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.890
what they're really
going to engage with.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.260
&gt;&gt; Hopefully, you'll measure everything
you do and be able to learn from it.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.200
If your app is great,
users will spread the word for you.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.690
You should make it easy for

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.120
users to share by adding
a social feature to your app.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.980
Google recently launched app
invites which will allow your

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.270
users to easily share your
app with their contacts.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.320
App invites will recommend your users
their closest contacts to share your app

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.360
with and give them an easy to download
link right in email or text message.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.972
&gt;&gt; You see this a lot with game apps,
where your users are given an image to

00:01:40.972 --> 00:01:44.660
share on Twitter with their highest
score or their ranking in the game.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.980
You can also see this in
shopping apps when they

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.830
recommend that you post what
you just bought to Facebook.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.830
&gt;&gt; Let's get an expert's
advice on social media.
