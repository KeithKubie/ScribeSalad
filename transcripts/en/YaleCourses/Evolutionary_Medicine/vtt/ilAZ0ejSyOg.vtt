1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.170
Another aspect of particularly primate reproduction is that we have invasive

2
00:00:09.511 --> 00:00:11.730
placentas.
Let's take a look at what that means.

3
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.190
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.340
<v 0>Implantation of the embryo is aggressive.</v>

5
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.170
It's invasive and this invasiveness is actually ancient,

6
00:00:21.171 --> 00:00:23.000
but it was lost in some lineages.

7
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.740
<v 1>Okay.</v>

8
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.520
<v 0>The degree of invasiveness varies among mammalian groups.</v>

9
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.180
Invasion is something that should give a fitness advantage early in life because

10
00:00:34.181 --> 00:00:38.080
it gives the embryo increased control over nutrition and growth.

11
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.300
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.710
<v 0>However,
there are tradeoffs.</v>

13
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.450
Greater embryonic control over maternal blood pressure increases the risk of

14
00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:50.160
Preeclampsia and animals with more invasive placentas have greater risk of

15
00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:51.300
metastatic cancer.

16
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.320
So the fact that placentas are invasive really has a number of rather surprising

17
00:01:00.871 --> 00:01:01.621
consequences.

18
00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:06.621
One is it shows that the embryo and the mother are to a certain degree in

19
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:11.070
conflict with each other and the embryo is trying to take more control over the

20
00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:11.401
mother.

21
00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:16.401
Then the mother would like to give and as with many other things that we've seen

22
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.620
every time a system comes in that has a big advantage,

23
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.510
that also means that evolution is willing to tolerate a big vulnerability or a

24
00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:31.410
big cost in order to get that advantage.
And in this case,

25
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.800
the diseases of pregnancy and the risk of medicine.

26
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.870
Metastatic cancer are two of the costs are vulnerabilities that are associated

27
00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:41.250
with invasive placentas.

28
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:43.270
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.710
<v 0>So the pre embryo is implanting aggressively the outer embryonic cells,</v>

30
00:01:47.711 --> 00:01:52.480
the trophoblasts actually bore into the uterus by succeeding enzymes that

31
00:01:52.481 --> 00:01:56.140
dissolve the tissue that protects maternal blood,
blood vessels.

32
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.550
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.240
<v 0>The endometrium is both enabling and limiting this invasion.</v>

34
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.550
So there is an overlap of interest between the embryo and the mother of course,

35
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.160
but there is also some conflict of interest.

36
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.270
<v 1>Okay.</v>

37
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.140
<v 0>The trophoblast then becomes part of the placenta where it secretes hormones</v>

38
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.730
that can mimic maternal hormones and these hormones influence maternal blood

39
00:02:19.731 --> 00:02:22.610
sugar and the dilation of maternal arteries in the placenta.

40
00:02:22.611 --> 00:02:26.750
That helps to regulate the delivery of nutrients to the embryo.

41
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.760
The degree of invasion and the ability of embryonic tissue to control nutrient

42
00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:36.761
flow depend on placental morphology and that varies among major groups of

43
00:02:36.861 --> 00:02:37.400
mammals.

44
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.060
So one of the things we're going to be looking at is the variation in placental

45
00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:45.490
morphology.
Now for our purposes,

46
00:02:45.491 --> 00:02:50.050
the critical feature of placental morphology or the ones that determine how many

47
00:02:50.051 --> 00:02:55.051
layers of cell and tissue separate fetal blood from maternal blood and how

48
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.930
intimately fetal and maternal tissue are intertwined.

49
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.090
How large surface area
prior to placenta formation,

50
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:08.620
there are six layers of tissue that separate maternal and fetal blood during

51
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:10.060
class contagion.
One,

52
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:13.660
two or three of the maternal layers can be lost

53
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.860
and the shape of the placenta can be either diffuse.

54
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.730
That means that occupies most of the surface of the embryonic sack.

55
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.380
It can be cuddled lead canary with multiple discrete attachments.

56
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.990
They can be zoned [inaudible] forming a band around the fetus or it can be

57
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:36.130
discoid attaching at one point and being smaller than the fetus.

58
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.380
We have discoid Placentas,

59
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.050
so here are the potential fetal and maternal layers.

60
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.630
On the left we have fetal tissue.
On the right we have maternal tissue.

61
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.110
This is a fetal blood vessel.
This is a maternal blood vessel.

62
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.990
The blood vessel is surrounded by an endothelium.
That's layer one.

63
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.690
Then there is connective tissue and then there are the chorionic epethelial

64
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:06.940
cells as the,

65
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.690
when the Zygote or the pre embryo first implants.

66
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.040
This would be the layer cells lying next to the endometrium.

67
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.230
Those are the endometrial epithelial cells.

68
00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:20.920
Then there's maternal connective tissue than there are maternal endothelial

69
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:23.560
cells surrounding the blood vessel.

70
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.890
And then there is the delivery of blood itself.

71
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.980
So potentially three fetal and three maternal layers.

72
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.480
The fetal extra embryonic membranes all go into forming the placenta and both

73
00:04:37.571 --> 00:04:42.571
fetal and maternal tissue layers can contribute to the structure of the blood

74
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:47.650
vessels to connective tissue and epithelial cells can contribute to the
placenta.

75
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.750
So placental classification based on cell layers has these names.

76
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.540
Epithelium Chorio,
which is cows,

77
00:04:58.541 --> 00:05:03.541
pigs and horses is the full set of six membranes in endothelial Chorio,

78
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.450
which would be caught dogs and cats,

79
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.690
one layer of maternal tissue.
The uh,

80
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.760
epithelial layer in the endometrium has been lost.

81
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.400
However,
in Hema Correale,
which characterizes,
uh,
humans and rodents,

82
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.990
the growing chorionic Villi erode through the maternal endothelium.

83
00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:30.790
They form a Hema Correale placenta in which the fetal chorionic epithelium is

84
00:05:30.791 --> 00:05:34.210
bathed directly in maternal blood.

85
00:05:34.211 --> 00:05:38.500
So here is the fetal fetal epithelium here is actually in Ville I,

86
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.280
this is just a simplified cross section and the maternal blood is actually right

87
00:05:45.281 --> 00:05:48.160
up against it.
So it's bathed in maternal blood.

88
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.490
So when and why did that evolve and what are the consequences?

89
00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.230
Well,
here is the evolutionary history of layers laid out in a phylogenetic tree.

90
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.440
And what we're looking at are in black,

91
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:07.370
we have epithelium,

92
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:12.371
Choreo and red endothelial Correale and in blue hemo Correale and we,

93
00:06:12.921 --> 00:06:17.090
what we can see is the Hema Correale placenta is actually ancient.

94
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.980
That's not a derived condition.
That is an ancient condition.
Interestingly,

95
00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:26.000
that condition has been lost in certain groups.
So for example,

96
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.790
in things like the,

97
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.170
we don't really know what the condition was in a deeper ancestor than that,

98
00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:37.550
but in the marsupials they have an empathy Leo Correale Placenta.

99
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:42.790
So they have the full six layers and that is also the case in the ungulates.

100
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.170
So things like pigs and horses and cows and hippopotamuses,

101
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.740
they all have epithelial Correale placentas.

102
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.280
Then the endothelial Correale.

103
00:06:55.281 --> 00:07:00.260
So the one where one tissue layer has been lost on the maternal side includes

104
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:03.890
things like elephants and aardvarks and malls,

105
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:08.570
European malls and foxes and cats and,
and uh,

106
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.380
fruit bats.
Also,
uh,
another set of bets.

107
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.330
However,
humans retain the ancient condition,

108
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:22.100
so they have a hemo Correale placenta.
The fewer the layers,

109
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.720
the shorter the gestation time.

110
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.650
So if we looked at 109 species of all memo orders,

111
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.910
then the fewer the number of tissue layers that separate maternal and fetal

112
00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:36.080
blood,
the shorter that gestation length through given maternal body mass.

113
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:41.570
So the shift from the noninvasive epithelial Correale placenta to the

114
00:07:41.571 --> 00:07:45.380
intermediate really invasive endothelial Correale placenta to the highly

115
00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:50.381
invasive Hema Correale placenta reduces gestation time by 35 days.

116
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.970
It might be more accurate to turn that around and say since the Hema Correale

117
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.730
placenta is the ancestral condition,

118
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:04.450
that adding tissue layers increased gestation time by 35 days.

119
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:13.120
This is what some of the macro morphology placenta this looks like.

120
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:18.500
So here we have a diffuse placenta.

121
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.780
It's characteristic of horses and pigs.

122
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.370
The cost of lead Neri Placenta is characteristic of cows.

123
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.410
The zone re placenta,

124
00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:32.860
which actually wraps around the amniotic sac is characteristic of carnivores and

125
00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:38.600
elephants.
So dogs,
cat seals,
bears and elephants.

126
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:43.630
And the discoid placenta is characteristic of primates and rodents.

127
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:48.410
So we have that kind of placenta and sodas.
A mouse here,

128
00:08:48.411 --> 00:08:52.970
the light pink is the amniotic sac and the dark pink is the placenta.

129
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:57.930
These shapes also have an evolutionary history.

130
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.700
It turns out that our discoid placenta,

131
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.920
which is here in black,

132
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:10.400
is also ancient and primitive and the derived forms are things like the diffuse

133
00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:15.360
placenta found in pigs.
The cuddle lead,

134
00:09:15.361 --> 00:09:17.730
Neri Placenta found in a cow.

135
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.210
The Baidus discoid placenta,

136
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.470
which is found in tree shrews is uh,

137
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.890
two sets of disks and the Zona re placenta,

138
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:34.070
which wraps around the amniotic sac is found in foxes,

139
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:39.570
cats.
And then in some of the Afro Therians,
the elephant,
the Aardvark,

140
00:09:39.571 --> 00:09:42.600
the rock hyrax and so forth.
However,

141
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:46.140
our discoid placenta is ancient and primitive.

142
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:48.410
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

143
00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:49.760
<v 0>However,
what about Vli?</v>

144
00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:54.050
The internal morphology of the Placenta so it can be folded lamellar villas,

145
00:09:54.051 --> 00:09:58.310
trabecular labyrinthine,
the villas Nate,

146
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:02.630
part of our placenta,
which you can see sketched here.

147
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.600
So this is,
uh,

148
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.370
where the actual interface is.
And the,

149
00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:15.380
uh,
fetal epithelium is bathed here in maternal blood.

150
00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:19.060
So with an extensive surface area,
which is,
uh,

151
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:24.190
created by making a treelike villas that is protruding into that space that is

152
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:29.090
derived in humans.
Okay.

153
00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:33.500
And it's also shared with,
uh,
some of the carnivores.

154
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:37.190
<v 1>Okay?</v>

155
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:42.190
<v 0>So if we take all of the differences in human plantation and we compare them</v>

156
00:10:42.411 --> 00:10:45.380
with nonhuman primates and other placental mammals,

157
00:10:45.381 --> 00:10:50.381
what we see is that primary interstitial implantation is something that only

158
00:10:50.481 --> 00:10:54.530
occurs,
uh,
in great apes among primates.

159
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.750
And if we look among other placental animals,

160
00:10:56.751 --> 00:10:59.660
we can find it in Guinea pigs and a few other roads.

161
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:01.820
The other thing here in this table,

162
00:11:01.821 --> 00:11:06.821
I would like to emphasize is that have to do with deep trophoblast invasion that

163
00:11:07.581 --> 00:11:11.600
reaches the third,
uh,
the inner third of the myometrium.

164
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:17.150
So this is something shared only with great apes,
uh,

165
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.450
among primates.
And if we look among other mammals,

166
00:11:20.451 --> 00:11:25.451
we can see it with even deeper invasion in some bats and in the Guinea pig.

167
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:33.300
So what that means is that the great ape share the risk of Preeclampsia with us

168
00:11:33.671 --> 00:11:38.671
because this deep invasions seems to be a morphological precondition for that

169
00:11:38.681 --> 00:11:41.950
risk.
And most Rodens and Armadillos do not.

170
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.470
Now what about vulnerability?
Well,

171
00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:54.400
there are striking similarities between invasive placental cells and invasive

172
00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:55.270
cancer cells.

173
00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:01.830
The cellular mechanisms that stem cells use to invade the Placenta may be reused

174
00:12:02.201 --> 00:12:05.680
by cancer cells to invade in spread during metastases.

175
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.340
This involves cell adhesion molecules,

176
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:14.370
the extracellular matrix and metallo protein aces that are in the context of

177
00:12:16.031 --> 00:12:17.230
extracellular matrix.

178
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:23.860
Angiogenesis is also a feature of both implantation and cancer spread.

179
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.300
We now know at least 11 genes that are expressed,

180
00:12:28.301 --> 00:12:31.930
both informal trophoblastic tissue and in malignant tumors.

181
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:38.100
So understanding the maternal mechanisms that control trophoblast invasion may

182
00:12:38.501 --> 00:12:41.950
help us to improve methods of controlling metastases.

183
00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:44.360
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

184
00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:49.360
<v 0>a comparative study showed that animals that have less invasive presentation</v>

185
00:12:49.701 --> 00:12:51.620
have less risk of metastatic cancer.

186
00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:57.340
So here we have four panels for four different kinds of cancer.

187
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.083
<v 1>The</v>

188
00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.180
<v 0>bars on the x axis are basically cows,
horses,</v>

189
00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:07.350
cats and dogs.

190
00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:13.190
The x axis is percentage of malignant tumors and this is for skin cancer,

191
00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.300
glandular epithelium,
non glandular epithelium and connective tissue.

192
00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:26.010
And the pattern that we see basically is that for three out of four of these

193
00:13:26.011 --> 00:13:30.180
cancer types,
skin glandular epithelium and connective tissue,

194
00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.960
the risk of metastatic cancer is much higher in the groups that have invasive

195
00:13:36.571 --> 00:13:41.571
placentation and much lower in those that do not have invasive presentation.

196
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:47.840
So cows and horses are at less risk of metastatic cancer than our dogs and cats.

197
00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.111
To summarize,

198
00:13:52.111 --> 00:13:56.940
Mammalian placentas very widely in the number of tissue layers that separate the

199
00:13:56.941 --> 00:14:01.680
fetal and maternal blood in the shape of the structures that mediate the

200
00:14:01.681 --> 00:14:05.850
exchange and in the degree of fetal invasion of maternal tissue.

201
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:11.730
Human placentas are a mixture of ancient and derived features.

202
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.870
Deep invasion is derived,

203
00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:20.820
we share it with chimpanzees and gorillas and it is associated with the risk of

204
00:14:20.821 --> 00:14:23.130
Preeclampsia of high maternal,

205
00:14:23.131 --> 00:14:26.640
dangerously high maternal blood pressure during pregnancy.

206
00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:32.380
Trophoblast invasion,
pre adept cells for metastases.

207
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:37.100
It isn't early life fitness benefit that's trading off with elite light late

208
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:40.620
life risk.
So it's a very good example of antagonistic plant ropey

209
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:46.810
animals that have less invasive presentation have less risk of metastatic

210
00:14:46.811 --> 00:14:47.200
cancer.
