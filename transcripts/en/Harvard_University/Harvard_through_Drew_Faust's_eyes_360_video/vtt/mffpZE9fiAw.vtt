00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.890
The third part of
Memorial Hall, which

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.240
is to the right of the
transept, is Sanders Theater.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.530
And this is a place that so
much history has happened in.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.480
Churchill spoken there.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.610
Marcel Marceau has
performed there.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.500
John Gielgud has
performed there.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.670
Booker T Washington received
an honorary degree on the stage

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:26.270
there.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.830
During my presidency, we had
a remarkable special ceremony

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.380
to give an honorary degree
to Teddy Kennedy, who

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.270
had been diagnosed
with a brain tumor,

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.150
so we wanted to hurry up
and give him his degree.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.460
And it was just a
wonderful celebration.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.070
And it meant so much to him.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.080
And I can still see him.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.600
I left the stage and he
was supposed to follow me.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.140
And he didn't want to leave
at the end of the ceremony.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.200
And I remember turning around
and seeing his silhouette

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.480
as he looked out at
the cheering audience.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.040
And the cheers would not stop.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.180
And he would not leave.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.170
And I'll always keep that
image of the entire Sanders

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.180
audience and Teddy Kennedy
silhouetted in front of them.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.400
A number of wonderful
undergraduate courses

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.570
are taught there.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.940
Michael Sandel's Justice course.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.690
I remember attending a session
of Tom Kelly's first nights

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.310
course.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.830
It's also been a place
where wonderful concerts

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.060
and theatrical events
have taken place.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.360
Wynton Marsalis, who
gave six concert lectures

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.050
over a period of three
years several years ago,

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.140
performed all of
them in Sanders Hall.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.380
And I remember he said that he
loved performing in that place

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.740
because the wood paneling
made it seem as if he

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.650
were playing inside a violin.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.220
And so the acoustics
were really special.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.720
So when I think
about these three

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.810
parts of Memorial
Hall and the vision

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.740
that the Civil War era
alumni had for this hall

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.190
to be a core of campus life,
but also a uplifting place that

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.310
would raise the spirits
of the institution

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.450
and make the institution think
about its highest values,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.420
I think we've done a pretty good
job of carrying that forward

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.080
into the 21st century.
