00:00:00.213 --> 00:00:01.850
- [Voiceover] We're asked
to subtract negative six X

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.870
to the fourth minus
three X squared Y squared

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.421
plus Y to the fourth from
two X to the fourth minus

00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:13.483
eight X squared Y squared
mins Y to the fourth.

00:00:13.483 --> 00:00:17.055
And I encourage you to pause
this video and give it a try.

00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:18.685
Alright, let's work through it together.

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:21.192
So We're gonna subtract
this green polynomial

00:00:21.192 --> 00:00:23.120
from this magenta one.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.791
So we can rewrite this as,

00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:27.707
we're to actually
perform it we could write

00:00:27.707 --> 00:00:30.086
two X to the fourth

00:00:30.086 --> 00:00:33.987
minus eight X squared Y squared

00:00:33.987 --> 00:00:36.490
minus Y to the fourth

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.462
minus, and I'm gonna
write this in parenthesis,

00:00:39.462 --> 00:00:41.227
give us some space,

00:00:41.227 --> 00:00:45.685
minus negative six X to the fourth

00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:49.888
minus three X squared Y squared

00:00:49.888 --> 00:00:53.301
plus five Y to the fourth.

00:00:53.301 --> 00:00:55.994
So notice, I'm subtracting
this green polynomial

00:00:55.994 --> 00:00:58.758
in two variables from
this magenta polynomial

00:00:58.758 --> 00:00:59.918
in two variables.

00:00:59.918 --> 00:01:02.425
Which is exactly what
it says to do up here.

00:01:02.425 --> 00:01:04.005
So what's this going to be?

00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:06.118
Well I can just rewrite the magenta part.

00:01:06.118 --> 00:01:08.532
We're gonna have two X to the fourth

00:01:08.532 --> 00:01:12.225
minus eight X squared Y squared

00:01:12.225 --> 00:01:14.036
minus Y to the fourth.

00:01:14.036 --> 00:01:16.612
And then I can distribute
this negative sign.

00:01:16.612 --> 00:01:20.002
So if we say the negative of
negative six X to the fourth,

00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:22.835
that's gonna be positive
six X to the fourth.

00:01:22.835 --> 00:01:26.318
So that's gonna go positive
six X to the fourth.

00:01:26.318 --> 00:01:30.730
And then the negative of negative
three X squared Y squared

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.538
is going to be positive
three X squared Y squared.

00:01:34.538 --> 00:01:38.763
So plus three X squared Y squared.

00:01:38.763 --> 00:01:40.319
And then last but not least,

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:42.828
we have a negative, or we're subtracting

00:01:42.828 --> 00:01:45.382
positive five Y to the fourth.

00:01:45.382 --> 00:01:50.165
So that's going to be
subtracting five Y to the fourth,

00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:51.972
or negative five Y to the fourth.

00:01:51.972 --> 00:01:55.478
And now we can try to simplify.

00:01:55.478 --> 00:01:58.104
So let's first look at
this term right over here.

00:01:58.794 --> 00:02:01.221
We have two X to the fourths.

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:05.228
And what we could look for is
another X to the fourth term.

00:02:05.888 --> 00:02:08.043
And we see it right over here.

00:02:08.043 --> 00:02:10.180
So we have two X to the fourths

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.105
and we can add that to
six X to the fourths.

00:02:13.105 --> 00:02:14.172
So what's that going to be?

00:02:14.172 --> 00:02:16.100
Well if I have two of something,
and then I add another

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.563
six of that something, that's going to be

00:02:17.563 --> 00:02:20.651
eight X to the fourths, two plus six.

00:02:20.651 --> 00:02:22.973
Two X to the fourth
plus six X to the fourth

00:02:22.973 --> 00:02:26.284
is going to be eight
X to the fourth power.

00:02:27.054 --> 00:02:30.551
And now we have this X
squared Y squared term.

00:02:31.252 --> 00:02:33.597
We could say we're
subtracting eight of them.

00:02:33.597 --> 00:02:35.688
And over here we're adding three of these

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:38.032
X squared Y squared terms.

00:02:38.032 --> 00:02:39.426
So we could add these coefficients.

00:02:39.426 --> 00:02:41.562
If we're taking away eight,
but we're adding three

00:02:41.562 --> 00:02:45.039
we could view this as negative
eight X squared Y squareds

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:48.313
plus three X squared Y squareds.

00:02:48.313 --> 00:02:51.308
Well what's negative eight plus three?

00:02:51.308 --> 00:02:53.491
Well that's going to be negative five.

00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:57.251
Negative five X squareds Y squareds.

00:02:57.251 --> 00:02:59.063
So that's that term.

00:02:59.063 --> 00:03:00.828
Let me write that a little bit neater.

00:03:00.828 --> 00:03:02.708
That's this term

00:03:02.708 --> 00:03:05.540
right over here, don't forget
to include this sign here.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.490
This is you're subtracting
eight X squared Y squareds,

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.482
you could do that as negative
eight X squared Y squared

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:13.895
plus three X squared Y squared.

00:03:13.895 --> 00:03:15.567
And then last but not least,

00:03:15.567 --> 00:03:19.213
you're subtracting one Y to the fourth,

00:03:19.213 --> 00:03:22.394
and then you're subtracting
five more Y to the fourths.

00:03:22.394 --> 00:03:23.986
So what's that going to be?

00:03:25.314 --> 00:03:27.869
You could view this as
negative one Y to the fourth

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:29.680
minus five Y to the fourths.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.002
Well that's going to be
negative one minus five

00:03:32.002 --> 00:03:33.163
is negative six.

00:03:33.163 --> 00:03:37.272
Negative six Y to the fourths.

00:03:37.272 --> 00:03:39.269
And we're done, we have subtracted

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.190
this from that.
