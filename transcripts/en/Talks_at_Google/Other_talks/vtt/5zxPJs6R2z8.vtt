[Indian accent]

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.789
administrator and political activist, and
columnist. He was former Public Administrator.

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:18.100
Some of his achievements as Administrators,
as Administrator include: the rehabilitation

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:26.700
of 8,000 families in Vizag, who are displaced
by the Steel Plant, and large scale irrigation

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.570
projects like a two lakh acre dry land, irrigation
in Prakasham district.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.329
Later, he resigned from IAS and, si-, and
has, since then has been leading the Lok-Satta

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:44.500
Movement, organized corruption and world politics.
Under his able leadership, Lok-Satta played

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.969
a prominent role in achieving electoral reforms
and the Right to Information Act and several

00:00:51.969 --> 00:01:01.799
other reforms. But, he, Dr. Jayaprarakash
Narayan is presently a member of Andhra Pradesh

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:10.810
Legislative Assembly and his party has branches
in five states, and contested in three states.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.210
And he also had, he also coordinates with
several reformist organizations, like Federal

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.380
Democratic [inaudible] India and People for
Lok-Satta.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.780
As part of Pe-, People for Lok-Satta Rejuvenate
campaign, he's presently touring several citi-,

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.280
several cities in inter-, in the United States
and advocating some of the chok-, solutions

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.600
to the challenges India facing, like proportional
representation, local government allowing

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.899
NRI's voting rights and NRI's role in Indian
politics.

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:46.659
Thanks JP garu for making time in his busy
schedule and thank Innovation Team for making

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:56.909
this happen. Without no further delay, I invite
Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan. Sorry for inter [inaudible].

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:57.909
[applause]

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.550
&gt;&gt;JP:
[Indian accent]

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:08.750
Friends, I'm delighted to be here with you.
Oftentimes, when somebody is very tall, there's

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:16.110
a natural advantage in life. For once, I found
that [presenter] being very tall was a disadvantage.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:23.170
The microphone was a little, at a lower level
and I was amused by this idea that what appears

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.050
to be of great advantage sometimes could actually
be a problem on occasion.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.230
I think that's important when we discover
things about a society, about a nation, about

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:44.610
an economy, and in many ways about many organizations.
I was asked to make a few points about Indian

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:54.060
economy and politics and I've chosen the theme:
19th-century Politics and 21st-century Economy.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.960
Can they coexist and if there are some serious
issues here, what can we do to make things

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.930
better?

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:10.370
If the 20th century offered us any lessons,
it is that you cannot delink economics from

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.901
politics. The biggest question decided by
the 20th century will allow us whether or

00:03:17.901 --> 00:03:23.790
not the socialist economy was right or the
market economy was right. It's a central political

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.790
question.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:32.770
Ultimately, we recognize that the economic
growth of a country is not neutral to the

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:40.480
political trajectory of that nation. And in
1991, when the Berlin Wall collapsed, in '89

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.040
when the Berlin Wall collapsed, in '91 when
The Soviet Union collapsed and much of the

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:53.900
world embraced market economy, but with certain
changes; certain significant changes. Then,

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:01.120
the assumption of the world is that humankind
has discovered what works best in terms of

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.910
economic growth and political organization.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:14.010
But, I think we all should recognize that's
not an unadulterated victory of market economy.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.799
The market economy won because they have actually
absorbed some of the socialist principles.

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.470
In the first half of the 20th century, education
and healthcare were not regarded as government's

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.430
business. But, in the second half of the 20th
century, most every major country in the world

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:36.020
of any consequence embraced both education
and healthcare as part of governments business.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.240
The services may be provided by the private
sector, but it must be driven by the public

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.680
sector; just a broader understanding. In a
many-, very fundamental sense, it is this

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.160
synthesis of some of the socialist principles
with a market economy that made a success

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.680
of market economy possible.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:05:03.010
Therefore, I would like to start off my presentation
with a brief discussion of the role of state.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.590
What is it that the modern state should be
doing? It should be debating whether it should

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.010
be socialist or market based. What is the
role of the state? In India, this question

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:18.310
has never been adequately addressed. I would
like to argue that the state is primarily

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.380
meant for public order, justice, and rule
of law; apart from the difference of the [inaudible

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:29.220
 ] so on and so forth. And then it must be
essentially to enhance the capabilities of

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.420
the citizens of the societies--

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.420
[phone rings]

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.930
of the society, so that the accident of birth,
"accident of the womb", as Warren Buffet called

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:42.930
it, does not determine the fate of the child.
And that is education and healthcare. And

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.350
then, of course, infrastructure required for
a modern economy, in particular, transport

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.240
and powers technical, communications, thanks
to all of you guys; the government's role

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:58.710
is now very marginal except minimal regulation,
really. And the natural resources development

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.400
there's no way anybody but a straight actor
is going to do something like Tennessee Valley

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.330
Authority, or the Hoover Dam. It has to be
a governments business. And finally, social

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.950
security, a measure of social security so
that those who fall into the cracks, their

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:19.590
concerns can be addressed in a humane modern
society. Once we look at state and its role

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.850
with greater clarity in this manner, I think
a lot of questions can be addressed much better.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:32.630
The economic story of India, in the past 10,
15, 20 years, is by now reasonably well understood

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:41.290
across the world. In 1947, we start with 2%
to the global GDP. There is something called

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:49.169
global GDP. But, not too long ago in human
history terms, about three centuries, four

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:57.440
centuries before that, India shape of economic,
the world economy was something like 25%.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.990
But all until 150 to 200 years because we
did not even take advantage of the Industrial

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:09.540
Revolution. India fell to 2% of the global
GDP. By 1991, this fell down to 1% of the

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:17.330
GDP. The economy in India grew at a snail's
pace, but in terms of the global economy,

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:24.139
our share came down to 1%. In 1991, as we
all know now, the current Prime Minister as

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:29.390
Finance Minister of India, in the wake of
an enormous crisis, out of compulsion, not

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:35.370
conviction, engineered and made a U-turn in
our economic policies.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:42.470
Today, we are back at 2% of the global GDP.
In other words, we ran very hard for 63 years

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.730
to remain where we were. In related terms,
not that India hasn't progressed at all, but

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:55.020
we're still the way we were in 1947. But,
the general perception is with a reasonably

00:07:55.020 --> 00:08:03.000
good growth rates, those cannot matching China's,
and with some everyday stuff, sustaining those

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.389
growth rates, India could well be one of the
major economies of the world in the next few

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:10.389
decades.

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:16.371
The emerging markets forum say it's by 2039.
If India does a few things right, we could

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:21.330
well be the second largest economy in the
world. That China will be the largest is more

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:25.770
or less accepted now, I think. There are a
very few people in the world who say that

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:31.520
anything else is possible now. But the future,
of course, may tell us a different story.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:37.800
Whether India will actually fulfill our potential
is a great challenge. My argument is India

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:44.730
has the potential to achieve this miracle,
but we are to make this miracle happen. Our

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:49.449
politics has become now a great impediment
to economic growth and to fulfilling India's

00:08:49.449 --> 00:08:50.449
potential.

00:08:50.449 --> 00:08:55.519
[pause]

00:08:55.519 --> 00:09:00.689
If you look at politics of India in the past
60 years, there's a huge success story. At

00:09:00.689 --> 00:09:07.399
one level, India is the first country in the
world to embrace universal adult franchise

00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:14.110
on the first day that the Constitution was
written. For largely illiterate and extremely

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:22.300
poor country, to embrace adult franchise on
a universal basis from day one was actually

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:30.709
a great adventure. It was an enormous expression
of faith in the wisdom of the bulk of the

00:09:30.709 --> 00:09:33.269
people of the country.

00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:40.149
This very great country in which we are right
now: the first republic in the modern world,

00:09:40.149 --> 00:09:45.569
the first democracy in the modern world, the
first country to practice abolition of powers,

00:09:45.569 --> 00:09:50.889
the first country with a written constitution,
despite recognition that all human beings

00:09:50.889 --> 00:09:58.529
are equal, it took them something like, 144
years after those immortal words written in

00:09:58.529 --> 00:10:01.959
The Declaration of Independence to recognize
that women are equal to men.

00:10:01.959 --> 00:10:09.290
It took a civil war and the sacrifice and
the blood and gore of more than ten thousand

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:15.249
able-bodied youth of this country to recognize
that people of another skin color are the

00:10:15.249 --> 00:10:21.009
same as any other skin color. Even in that
context, and given the fact that Britain took

00:10:21.009 --> 00:10:26.769
centuries before women got the right to vote
in 1928, it was actually remarkable expression

00:10:26.769 --> 00:10:32.060
of faith and the part of Indian Constitution
make us to recognize that all Indians, irrespective

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:36.899
of caste, religion, language, and we have
many, many, many languages even here. I'm

00:10:36.899 --> 00:10:42.279
sure many people do not realize how many languages
there are in India, serious languages for

00:10:42.279 --> 00:10:48.689
thousands of years history, hundreds of years
history, their own literature, their own script,

00:10:48.689 --> 00:10:49.689
and their own unique culture.

00:10:49.689 --> 00:10:51.730
[pause]

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:57.970
Despite all this, and despite the fact that
India was actually partitioned on the basis

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:05.089
of religion, the Indian Constitution make
us put enormous faith in the people of the

00:11:05.089 --> 00:11:10.709
country. And in some respects, I think that
faith is fully vindicated.

00:11:10.709 --> 00:11:16.041
If you take India's political evolution, it's
a remarkable success story in the sense that:

00:11:16.041 --> 00:11:23.290
A. We retained our political freedoms. B.
There is intense electoral competition. Elections

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:29.629
in India are not make-believe elections. C.
The winners do not punish the losers. There

00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:33.140
are many countries in the world where the
loser is punished merely because he lost the

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:38.399
election. He may lose his head or liberty
or many things. In India that never happen,

00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:44.440
mercifully. And finally, the elected government
is truly an authority. It's not some [inaudible]

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.440
agenda.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:53.889
Going by these four postulates, India is a
truly vibrant, functioning democracy. And

00:11:53.889 --> 00:11:58.509
that we could actually maintain a moderate
rate of growth t-, in the economy and now

00:11:58.509 --> 00:12:05.209
emerges a reasonably influential country in
terms of the future economy the globe.

00:12:05.209 --> 00:12:10.459
It's a source of some satisfaction. But the
fact is there are also many dark corners of

00:12:10.459 --> 00:12:16.300
Indian politics and unless they are set right,
unless we throw light on them, unless we change

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.139
that, we may not fulfill our true economic
potential.

00:12:19.139 --> 00:12:23.860
[pause]

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:31.920
Particularly, because India is largely poor
and because most people are still illiterate,

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:38.120
because politics is in the power struggle
without any reference to ideologies or any

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:43.800
outcomes, because there's increasing contention
in politics, but there's only a change of

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:49.529
players and there's no change in the outcomes,
there's no change in the rules of the game;

00:12:49.529 --> 00:12:53.319
money has become the currency of politics.

00:12:53.319 --> 00:12:56.450
For those of you from the United States, it
might appear that's very normal thing in politics,

00:12:56.450 --> 00:13:00.600
after all the US has spent a lot of money
in politics. But those are two different worlds,

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:06.649
altogether. The money spent here is entirely
for legitimate campaigning purposes; most

00:13:06.649 --> 00:13:16.449
of it for television advertising. It's fully
accounted. And it's transparent. Sadly, much

00:13:16.449 --> 00:13:21.629
of the money is spent in elections in India
is unaccounted and for illegitimate purposes,

00:13:21.629 --> 00:13:24.329
mostly for work buying with money and liquor.

00:13:24.329 --> 00:13:28.429
So the market economy actually works in the
politics of India. And that's what ought to

00:13:28.429 --> 00:13:35.500
be changed. The second perversion of Indian
politics is in a country of abject poverty,

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:41.239
it's very easy for the governments to seduce
the workers, offering them all kinds of freebies;

00:13:41.239 --> 00:13:47.339
unsustainable in the long term, very detrimental
to public good, but in the short term there's

00:13:47.339 --> 00:13:52.809
always a way of persuading the worker that
they're free power, free color television,

00:13:52.809 --> 00:13:58.920
free rice, and every month some amount of
money, irrespective of everything else that

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.379
that will be given once the government resumes
office.

00:14:01.379 --> 00:14:06.790
I'm not mention this things as casual. These
are all a real sore spot in India by political

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:11.160
parties; some of them actually were delivered.
There is state of time in order where every

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.160
family was offered a color television. And
they were actually delivered in significant

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.689
measure. I don't know how many were delivered
finally, but millions of color televisions

00:14:18.689 --> 00:14:21.459
were delivered by the elected government as
part of the promise that they made to the

00:14:21.459 --> 00:14:26.799
electorate befor election. So increasingly,
parties resort to this kind of thing; taking

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:32.790
advantage of the poverty. The third is, of
course, in a very diverse country with many

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:36.649
primordial loyalties, it's very easy to divide
the people in caste, region, religion, and

00:14:36.649 --> 00:14:42.779
language. And mobilize them as working blocks,
with orders and stuff, "What's in it for me

00:14:42.779 --> 00:14:48.290
if I work for this party or that party?" Because
there's no, there's no sense that any party

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:53.410
would make any difference, therefore, there's
only emotional purchase available.

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:58.889
Once we have these three attitudes in politics,
which are increasingly dominant in the mainstream

00:14:58.889 --> 00:15:04.809
political parties, we have seen this crisis.
We have elections, we help peaceful transfer

00:15:04.809 --> 00:15:08.910
of power, we have fierce contention, we have
liberty, but political outcomes are simply

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:14.749
not what India needs and that's what ought
to be changed.

00:15:14.749 --> 00:15:19.610
And therefore, my argument is that this kind
of a 19th-century political mode, a medieval

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:24.029
political mode where politics is all about
power struggle, when we master the art of

00:15:24.029 --> 00:15:31.089
getting into power without bothering about
the outcomes, that cannot be coexist in the

00:15:31.089 --> 00:15:34.559
21st-century economy. One of them has to give
in. Either the politics must change, or the

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:38.389
economy will eventually decline and collapse.

00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:41.590
What will happen depends on what we do in
the next ten years or so in India.

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:49.449
A comparison with China would be very apt
because many people, obviously, are interested

00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:54.089
in the two Asian giants in terms of population
we're now more number two, respectively. In

00:15:54.089 --> 00:15:58.079
terms of growth based upon large economies,
now China is number one and India is pretty

00:15:58.079 --> 00:16:03.129
close to being number two. And in terms of
potential, India could well emerge as one

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:07.249
of the economic giants of the world in the
next 30 years if we do well.

00:16:07.249 --> 00:16:12.679
So obviously, comparisons are inevitable.
But I think one, one has to understand things

00:16:12.679 --> 00:16:18.420
in perspective. One argument often advanced
is that China is not a democracy; therefore,

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.569
they can do pretty much what they want.

00:16:20.569 --> 00:16:26.249
And therefore, they can actually focus on
excellence in economic growth even at the

00:16:26.249 --> 00:16:30.299
cost of short term political price. Because
after all, one of the great challenges of

00:16:30.299 --> 00:16:35.649
democratic politics anywhere in the world
is the conflict between the short term political

00:16:35.649 --> 00:16:43.069
price you have to pay for pursuing right policies,
and the long term, slow rate of social payoff

00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:45.339
is one of the most difficult things anywhere
in the world.

00:16:45.339 --> 00:16:48.899
That's why we all love to hate politicians,
because politicians are present with this

00:16:48.899 --> 00:16:53.691
all the time. They have to reconcile confronting
interests and satisfy all groups, and they

00:16:53.691 --> 00:16:58.149
have to be mindful of the short term political
price and yet focus on the long term public

00:16:58.149 --> 00:17:04.470
good. These are awesome challenges. Obviously,
in a dictatorship you don't have this problems;

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.860
it's easier.

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:13.920
Nevertheless, I think we're always taken the
case when we try and say that democracy is

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:18.610
detrimental to economic growth. I would like
to argue that almost everything good that

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:24.620
happen in China is actually because of the
democratization of society. And almost everything

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:32.810
bad that happen in China after the October
rev-, 1948 revolution was because Chinese

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:37.400
leadership on occasion acted autocratically
in an arbitrary manner.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:44.400
Take the later case, The Great Leap Forward,
between 1959 and '62, because of Mao Zedong's

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:52.539
actually irrational policies, arbitrary policies,
20 million Chinese starved to death. 1959

00:17:52.539 --> 00:17:53.840
to '62 was not because of

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:58.190
[pause]

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:03.990
any sensible policies. The autocracy of China
actually caused perhaps the greatest man-made

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:11.440
misery in the 20th century. Similarly, the
Cultural Revolution of the 1960s, it was again

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.809
another initial blunder. But the good things
that happened in China are because they tried

00:18:15.809 --> 00:18:22.389
to democratize: education, healthcare access,
decentralization of power, technology to villages,

00:18:22.389 --> 00:18:27.790
enhancing productivity; these are all clues
of democratization. An authoritarian leadership

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:34.380
actually enhanced the contingent democracy.
We always think in terms of democracy as merely

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:41.080
working. Democracy is more than that. We have
in India great liberty, but are we a democratic

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:46.909
society fully in some respects? I suspect
not. In some respects, I dare to argue that

00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:52.169
China is perhaps more democratic than India.
You take the local governments in China. They

00:18:52.169 --> 00:18:54.679
are far more influential.

00:18:54.679 --> 00:18:59.240
There's far greater decentralization of power.
There is greater citizen empowerment at the

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:03.690
local level then in India today. Everything
in India revolves on the Prime Minister, the

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:09.639
Chief Minister at the provincial level and
the District Magistrate at the district level.

00:19:09.639 --> 00:19:15.470
The citizens and the communities and the local
governments have hardly any role at all. Similarly,

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:19.740
education, healthcare, there's sense of a
modern democracy, have not been given the

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:23.690
kind of importance that they deserved in India.

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:28.340
What I'm arguing is the normative democracy
in terms of constitution and elections are

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:32.980
necessary, but not sufficient. We have to
actually have a functioning democracy in terms

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:38.171
of society being democratized. In terms of
fu-, people's future being decided not by

00:19:38.171 --> 00:19:43.149
the accident of birth, accident of the womb,
but by their hard work.

00:19:43.149 --> 00:19:47.730
And the society must give an opportunity to
fulfill her true potential. In that sense,

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:53.149
we have a lot to learn from China. This categorization,
crude categorization of something is a democracy,

00:19:53.149 --> 00:19:58.360
something is not, bears immediate uncertain
indicators is not sufficient. And India must

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:06.700
learn with humility the art of democratization
for a society. If that is the case, what are

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.740
the things India should do? I'll come to the
concluding part of my presentation so we can

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:15.759
have some time for meaningful interaction.
Well, I'm making a controversial point. I'm

00:20:15.759 --> 00:20:20.809
well aware of that and I think it requires
some serious examination.

00:20:20.809 --> 00:20:25.480
First is local governments. One great thing
that happened in India is a maturation of

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:33.330
federalization. India is a multi-lingual country.
In a northern neighborhood in Canada, I've

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:36.580
told there's only one other language apart
from English spoken by the Quebec people,

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:41.899
the French language. And yet, every five years
or so, there is a demand for cessation and

00:20:41.899 --> 00:20:44.980
there's some kind of accommodation for the
time being and we never know when Canada is

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:51.330
going to break up. You see a tiny country
like Belgium, for instance, again two languages

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:54.980
and every other day there's a fight breaking
out. Right now I'm told that there's no government

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.621
in office there. They're figuring out who
should be the Prime Minister.

00:20:57.621 --> 00:21:04.730
You see Sri Lanka, our own southern neighbor,
there's only one other language, Sinhalese,

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:10.139
the main language of the country. And the
minority, northern Tamil's, they spoke the

00:21:10.139 --> 00:21:15.509
Tamil language. And because the country did
not know how to reconcile the linguistic aspirations

00:21:15.509 --> 00:21:20.799
of these two groups, there was a bloody civil
war, tens of thousands of people died, one

00:21:20.799 --> 00:21:25.019
of the most murderous terrorist groups was
on rampage for decades, and only recently

00:21:25.019 --> 00:21:29.919
they have been able to overcome the terrorist
group and hopefully, they'll learn the lesson.

00:21:29.919 --> 00:21:34.250
And now the indications are that they are
trying to follow the Indian model of federalism.

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:43.409
And India, in contrast, there are at least
18 major languages. It's not like China where

00:21:43.409 --> 00:21:48.600
Mandarin is spoken by an estimated 85% of
the people. And all the other ethnic nationalities,

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:54.389
apart from Han Chinese, there are only 15%
of the people. In India, the largest language

00:21:54.389 --> 00:21:58.429
is spoken only by about 40% people, 40 to
45% people, Hindi.

00:21:58.429 --> 00:22:03.160
In that again, there are so many dialects
that Brij Puri is different from the chaste

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:11.269
Hindi for let's say, Bhopal or Indore. And
other language, second biggest language, Telugu,

00:22:11.269 --> 00:22:18.240
is spoken by about 8 to 8½% of the people.
All other languages are now after order; 8%,

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.900
6%, 5%, etc.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:26.800
And yet, despite having 18 languages, each
of them with their own literature, their own

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:33.730
culture, their own tradition, and their own
history for centuries, some for millennia.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:39.990
India could actually unite all of them if
the federalism today matured. When the Constitution

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:45.100
was written, while we were a federal country
it was actually quasi-federal.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:49.929
The federal government was more in command
because the founding fathers were terrified

00:22:49.929 --> 00:22:54.059
of the possibility of further vulcanization
of India, given the experience of partition

00:22:54.059 --> 00:23:00.090
in India in 1947. But, over the past 25 years,
one of the great things that happened in India

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:04.760
is this federalism has now become very mature.
The states have come into their own. They

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:10.039
have now considerable leeway in deciding things,
and in deciding their own des-, their own

00:23:10.039 --> 00:23:11.340
destinies.

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:15.620
But the tragedy is the states in turn have
not recognized the need to encourage local

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:22.040
communities to be self-governing. They spread
a constitutional injunction and we have huge

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:30.360
amendments in 1994, running into 7,700 words.
If you compare that with American Constitution,

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:38.159
the whole of American Constitution today some
222 years after it was written, it has some

00:23:38.159 --> 00:23:39.230
7,400 words.

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:46.730
Our provisions relating to local governments
alone, they run into 7,700 words. And yet,

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:52.909
we created over-structured, under-powered
local governments and the bureaucracy, of

00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:58.549
which I was a member for a long time, the
state legislatures, of which I'm a member

00:23:58.549 --> 00:24:03.500
currently, these two have conspired to ensure
that the local governments are enfeebled.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:10.419
There is absolutely no desire in India to
really empower the communities and to see

00:24:10.419 --> 00:24:14.920
that the people who can preside over their
own destinies. Unless India recognizes the

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:20.679
merit of decentralization, a very complex
and lost country, we will never be able to

00:24:20.679 --> 00:24:24.590
deliver services. Without local government
empowerment, you cannot have a linkage between

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:26.970
authority and accountability.

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:31.559
You cannot have a clear understanding in the
minds of the people between their word and

00:24:31.559 --> 00:24:37.289
public good that results from that. And most
of all, you cannot have a link between taxes

00:24:37.289 --> 00:24:42.320
and services rendered. And therefore, there'll
be always a reluctance to pay taxes.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:48.240
In India, tax avoidance is a national sport.
I'm sure many of us dislike to pay taxes,

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:53.210
but in India we really elevate that to a very
high quality sport. Our tax to GDP ratio,

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:59.899
even today is only about 18%. That means only
18% of the GDP is collected by any government

00:24:59.899 --> 00:25:06.970
at any level; federal, local, or state towards
taxes. Compare that with the United States,

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:12.519
it's about 40% in this country. Go to Europe.
Most countries have 50%. Some countries are

00:25:12.519 --> 00:25:18.740
60%. Now we might not go to 60% or 50%, but
to actually have a decent, functioning state

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:23.139
of fulfilling responsibilities, the tax rates
must go higher. There must be greater tax

00:25:23.139 --> 00:25:24.190
compliance.

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:28.060
That never happen as long as the bulk of the
people of India don't notice the link between

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:33.549
the taxes they pay and the services they get.
And therefore, they'll be always more towards

00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:39.470
getting something in the, on co-, on the quick.
There'll be always a desire for short term

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:43.710
maximization. Like, "Make us some freebie;
this rice, or this free power, or this free

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:47.480
color TV. Because I know there's something
tangible that I get and I don't know what

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:51.059
else I'll get anyway. Therefore, that's all
I expect from politics and let the country

00:25:51.059 --> 00:25:55.470
be damned." If that is to be changed, people
must see where the tax money is going and

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:58.370
they must understand alternative uses for
the tax money.

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:01.710
For all these reasons, we have to empower
the local governments. The way, for instance,

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:07.330
to change despite being an autocratic regime,
has actually been trying to do. The second

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:14.610
major change required is "rule of law". Normally,
India has an impeccable system of rule of

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:15.610
law.

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:19.299
The judiciary is independent, the Supreme
Court is pretty strong, perhaps not as strong

00:26:19.299 --> 00:26:24.830
as the United States, but next to U-, US,
the judiciary is the strongest in the world.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:30.269
We have many independent constitutional organs,
like the Election Commission, the world's

00:26:30.269 --> 00:26:35.299
most powerful Election Commission. The election
law deciding body. And many of the organs.

00:26:35.299 --> 00:26:38.040
But, nevertheless, the rule of law is pretty
weak.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:43.029
The norms are different from the practice.
The police are entirely under the control

00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:47.580
of the political institute in almost every
state in the country. We cannot even conceive

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:52.179
of a situation like what happened in Illinois
state in your country when Rod Blagojevich,

00:26:52.179 --> 00:27:01.210
when he had tried to sell the, the Senator's
appointment for a price. He was promptly thrown

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:07.340
out of office, he's probably politically buried
forever, and he may even go to jail.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:14.590
If you applied that standard in India, I'm
afraid it would 95% of us would be found wanting.

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:19.269
And unless we actually create a system where
there's a fierce, independence of the Crime

00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:25.810
Investigation Authority, anticorruption agencies,
and independent prosecution. And speedy justice;

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:30.460
our justice system is independent, but it's
very, very slow and ponderous. I don't want

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.559
to go into details as to what needs, needs
to be done. There are simple, elegant answers

00:27:33.559 --> 00:27:34.559
to that.

00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:39.000
I, myself, as a member of the Administrative
Reforms Commission have specifically come

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.499
out with series of proposals to bring about
significant changes within the bounds of our

00:27:43.499 --> 00:27:48.230
Constitution. So, the answers are evident.
But, we have to actually apply them so that

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:56.809
the culture of "VIPs", Very Important Persons,
the culture of cronyism, the culture of patronage,

00:27:56.809 --> 00:28:01.309
the culture of those in power determining
all outcomes, even in justice system, and

00:28:01.309 --> 00:28:07.129
even when it comes to crime investigation,
unless we change these things we're in serious

00:28:07.129 --> 00:28:08.129
trouble.

00:28:08.129 --> 00:28:12.590
After all, the strength of a market economy
is that the market drop rates equal of everybody.

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:17.870
It's a level playing field. And if the contracts
are not honored, if those in power decide

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:22.679
what'll happen and who the next billionaire
is going to be, and those who actual do business

00:28:22.679 --> 00:28:27.940
in India are worried about how to enforce
the contracts, then obviously, they'll be

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:33.590
a serious aback to businesses. The third big
change we require is to fight corruption.

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:36.900
[pause]

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:42.610
Corruption is obviously prevalent in many
countries. The Blagojevich case shows in-,

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:48.260
America is no exception. But, in countries
like India, it's ubiquitous. It is universally

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:52.710
believed that if you want to do business in
India, you have to be corrupt. Countries like

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:56.909
the US have the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act, which is now later adopted by the European

00:28:56.909 --> 00:29:03.690
Commission. And eventually now has become
the United Nations Convention against Corruption.

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:07.990
Nevertheless, the fact is in many countries,
if you want to actually do serious business,

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:14.019
unless you please those in government or in
politics, you cannot move forward. Un-, unless

00:29:14.019 --> 00:29:20.730
that is changed, I'm afraid any economic growth
will be stalled. If you want to contain corruption

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:25.450
again, the answers are self-evident. What
you have done to Rod Blagojevich in this country

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:31.890
must be possible for everybody in India: speedy
justice, confiscation of properties, throwing

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:37.540
them in jail, getting them out of politics,
those who are corrupt and creating a mechanism

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:43.110
for political campaign finance. We have an
excellent law on campaign finance in India

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:49.010
enacted in 2003. Works at the moment and I
was privileged to be a part of that, is largely

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:52.289
responsible for bringing about that law; it's
an excellent law.

00:29:52.289 --> 00:29:58.450
In the United States, for instance, in the
wake of Watergate in 1970s, you brought in

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:03.639
the Campaign Finance Reform Law after Nixon's
resignation. But since then, for about 40

00:30:03.639 --> 00:30:09.940
years, there's been no serious change. And
then came, for about 30-35 years, and then

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:14.090
came the Feingold-McCain Law, which is actually
a feeble legislation to improve the campaign

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:18.539
finance system. India has arguably one of
the finest campaign finance laws, except that

00:30:18.539 --> 00:30:23.299
it has simply not been implemented. The parties
don't care about it. Ours is perhaps the only

00:30:23.299 --> 00:30:26.690
party in India that goes by that in letter
in spirit.

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:32.350
Unless we make it mandatory to actually implement
that, and unless world banks exist, we are

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:37.290
in serious trouble. But meanwhile, we have
to address the challenges of corruption by

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:42.419
institutional mechanisms, by creating an independent,
strong, anti-corruption agency. And independent

00:30:42.419 --> 00:30:49.409
prosecution by punishing swiftly and surely
the corrupt people by setting a strong example,

00:30:49.409 --> 00:30:55.879
punitive example, and by doing several other
things that many other countries have successfully

00:30:55.879 --> 00:30:58.570
done to curb corruption substantially.

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:06.139
Finally, politics is about incentive, just
like economics. If, in a poor country like

00:31:06.139 --> 00:31:11.521
India, word-buying is what gets you to the
winning post, I suspect people will continue

00:31:11.521 --> 00:31:15.440
to buy the words, many people will continue
to sell the words. If the buyer and seller

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:22.531
are happy, no law, no constitution can really
set that right. We have to change the incentives.

00:31:22.531 --> 00:31:27.450
The Indian electoral system is a legacy of
the colonial Britain. It's not at all a rational

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:31.980
system. It's utterly irrational. I believe
Attlee, who was the Prime Minister of Britain

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:36.409
at that time, actually argued in favor of
other models like, the American presidential

00:31:36.409 --> 00:31:42.330
system and the European proportional representation
system. But the Indians said, "No, we are

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:46.090
more British than all of you guys. We'll have
to pursue with your own electoral system even

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:47.419
if we get rid of you."

00:31:47.419 --> 00:31:53.730
And that's actually happening today. In Britain,
except in the House of Commons, in every other

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:59.500
election they're going up this old-fashioned
First Past-the-Post system. In the regional

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:05.649
parliaments of Scotland, Northern Wales, and
Ireland, this is misproportionately based.

00:32:05.649 --> 00:32:11.010
In local elections, it's proportionately based.
Europe and Ireland proportionally based. London

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:17.369
City, an electorate executive, an electorate
mayor, like now Boris Johnson is in, is the

00:32:17.369 --> 00:32:18.369
mayor.

00:32:18.369 --> 00:32:23.379
Utterly the first mayor in this new mode of
electionist Ken Livingston. India is the only

00:32:23.379 --> 00:32:28.289
country that is sticking with the old-fashioned
British best Minister, First-Past-the-Post

00:32:28.289 --> 00:32:32.249
model. It appears that Britain may actually
be changing back to the House of Commons level,

00:32:32.249 --> 00:32:37.570
also. We all know what happened in the last
week when the two parties for the first time

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:43.080
after Second World War in Britain, headed
by Cameron and Nick Clegg, they all joined

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.639
forces to form a coalition government.

00:32:45.639 --> 00:32:50.210
And eventually, in the next two, three years,
we may well see in Britain a shift to some

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:56.230
sort of proportionate representation. The
reason why India requires a shift is if one

00:32:56.230 --> 00:33:02.960
word extra means victory, one word less means
defeat, in an abjectly poor country where

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:07.970
the political culture is already considerably
damaged, word buying is rampant. Word buying

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:12.039
will continue, corruption will continue, politics
will be distorted.

00:33:12.039 --> 00:33:16.120
We have to change it to a system where if
you vote this way, that way, it don't matter,

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:21.789
it's the person that the votes to get. It's
not how much you control the constituency.

00:33:21.789 --> 00:33:28.529
As a local zemindar as we call it, a local
chief, a man with complete clout, complete

00:33:28.529 --> 00:33:33.460
domination of the local population. That's
what really gives political dividends in India

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:38.460
today. We have to change it to a system where
it's the major party and the candidates. And

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:42.409
the platform of the political party, rather
than the news offered to individuals to get

00:33:42.409 --> 00:33:50.190
the marginal vote that will determine the
political outcomes. If we do these things,

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:56.669
then we could have probably change India's
political system from the 19th-century archaic

00:33:56.669 --> 00:34:01.521
model to something approximate in the 21st
century. And our economy and our politics

00:34:01.521 --> 00:34:06.299
can co-exist.
Einstein once said, "Twentieth century is

00:34:06.299 --> 00:34:11.820
characterized by perfection of means and confusion
of ends." Indian politicians have mastered

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:17.160
the art of acquiring power. They perfected
their means. But what power is about, in terms

00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:21.650
of outcomes, is something that eludes us all
the time. There's hardly any change in respect

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:27.230
of what happens, no matter who is in office.
And that's what should be changed in India.

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:32.429
I believe Indian people are alive to this
challenges. They are capable of addressing

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:36.550
them, but they require an urgent push from
all over the world with our compatriots of

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:42.640
Indians. Indian compatriots are there. People
of Indian origin is there, are there.

00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:47.320
The businesses of India, all Indian businesses,
they must argue for change because they must

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:52.230
not think politics is different from economics.
There is a notion in business circles that

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:56.550
what will do business isn't related to what,
what kind of politics takes shape. Politics

00:34:56.550 --> 00:35:01.050
has a decisive influence on the way businesses
take shape and the way economic growth trajectory

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:05.810
takes shape. And unless we address the larger
questions of politics without being partisan,

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:11.930
without really getting into who should be
in power, but focusing on what should be the

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:13.640
outcomes.

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:21.760
Unless we do that, economy itself is in peril.
Indian businesses are now slowly awakening

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:27.840
themselves to this reality. We require a change
fundamentally. I believe we will change. When

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:35.420
status quo is unsustainable, change is inevitable.
That's why the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. It

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:39.640
did not fall because of any bullets or warfare;
it fell because the people voted with their

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:43.880
feet. Because they could see the contrast
between what's happening across the borders,

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:48.880
across the wall, and in their own society.
And they could not take it any longer.

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:53.550
And no society could depress its people forever.
And a democratic society will change when

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:58.800
people want it adequately, but people must
be awakened to the possibilities of change.

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:03.550
But the danger is change will still happen;
it will not be the right kind of change. Twenty

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:10.771
years ago, there was a very popular story
in Moscow. I believe hundreds of people were

00:36:10.771 --> 00:36:16.830
queuing in front of a Russian shop for a few
crumbs of bread in Moscow City, on a bitter,

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:24.160
biting, cold, winter morning. They waited
and waited but there was no bread in sight.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:27.080
When young man lost his temper after some
time, he said, "I'm sick and tired of it.

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:32.220
I'll go and kill the General Secretary in
Kremlin." And they stormed off in protest.

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:35.180
The others still waited patiently because
they know there was still the midnight knock,

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:41.480
there was still the Secret Police, the Gestapo,
or whatever they called it in, in Soviet Union.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:46.770
There's still the concentration camps, the
GULAGs, therefore they all waited very quietly

00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:52.340
and patiently. The same man came back after
two hours. The others still were waiting and

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:55.131
there was no bread in sight. They're all gathered
around him and asked him, "What happened?

00:36:55.131 --> 00:36:58.670
Have you killed the General Secretary?" He
said, "A riot in Kremlin can rob the store

00:36:58.670 --> 00:37:03.470
now, children are hungry at home, please tell
us what happened?" This young man said, "You

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:07.610
know, I went there to kill the General Secretary,
but there was a much longer queue waiting

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:08.610
there."

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:11.170
[laughter]

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:18.970
This story was recounted in every single household
of Soviet Union in all the 15 republics at

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:23.700
the time. People laughed about it, but they
did nothing about it.

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:30.080
Change did come in 1991, but not the kind
of change any Soviet citizen wanted. Change

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:34.090
will always come. It will always overtake
us, eventually, every society. The challenge

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:39.560
is, is it the kind of change we all need,
we all desire and that will be positive? Or

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:45.630
is it the change we'll have to submit ourselves
to and pay the price for? That's the challenge

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:53.280
facing Indian people, and Indian politicians,
Indian civil servants, and Indian businessmen.

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:58.420
I believe we are all capable of rising to
the challenge and fulfilling our potential

00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:01.790
and becoming one of the great economies on
one of the most moderating influences in the

00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:08.300
modern world, in a complex, ever-changing,
unpredictable world. But only if we set our

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:13.890
house in order today. And I believe the stakes
for the world are as great as they are for

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:18.440
India, because what happens to one system
of humanity cannot but impact the rest of

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:24.590
the world. And I believe the rest of the world
is actually waiting for this, this caged lion,

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:34.050
to really find its own feet and find its own
direction. And I believe ultimately, 21st-century

00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:39.890
economy and 21st-century politics will coincide
and show the way to many other countries in

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:44.970
emerging economies which continue to believe
that economic growth and political freedom

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:51.970
cannot coexist. We have to prove that these
two can and must coexist. The challenge in

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:58.840
that sense is fundamental and it's human.
Thank you.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.840
[applause]

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.580
I'll be happy to take questions…comments,
criticism.

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:05.580
[pause]

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:07.510
[audience chatter]

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:16.310
Do we have a collar microphone? No? Ok, sorry.

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:20.230
&gt;&gt;male audience1:
[Indian accent]

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:24.360
Thank you very much for a great talk. I think
you said it perfectly when you said, you know,

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:31.740
we, we're perfect at the means but not the
ends. One of the things I find calm in Indian

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:38.080
politics is there is rationality, there's
no rationality in the structure. There is

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:42.860
a structure deficit when it comes to peace
and, for example, like take that Tamilaru

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:52.400
TV promise. There was no motivation to actually
say, "OK, we're promising a TV for every household,

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:57.980
but this is what it's gonna buy us." Or, for
example, even if you take the Supreme Court,

00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:03.410
right? Right now the new Chief Justice came
up and, I mean, like, he took office, first

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:08.180
day in 29 minutes he cleared five cases by
simply dismissing most of them.

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:09.480
[JP laughs]

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:15.850
And, the thing is, I mean, all these things
are quite arbitrary. And the reason why that

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:23.850
is, is before somebody like, any official,
any, any organization, anybody, does something,

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:30.030
there is no requirement or motivation to say
why they are doing it, what is the purpose,

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:36.280
what is, what is the measurable goal they
are trying to achieve? Any of that. I wonder

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:42.590
if you could, if you could, you know, speculate
on what could be done to, for more of that

00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:43.590
kind of--

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:45.700
&gt;&gt;JP:
It's, it's a good question. I'll address each

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:50.520
of this briefly so that we get a sense of
what it's about. Take the Supreme Court. Normatively,

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:55.200
the Supreme Court is supposed to function
like the American Supreme Court. But we bungle

00:40:55.200 --> 00:41:01.230
even in the initial stages, to be fair. Instead
of making it a constitutional code, which

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:06.850
it ought to be in a very large, federal country,
we made also an appellate court and practically

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:08.540
everything under the sun.

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:13.931
And also we gave it original jurisdiction
on certain issues. The naturalities, in the

00:41:13.931 --> 00:41:18.780
United States, you know, Supreme Court, typically
100 to 150 cases, I may be, I may be wrong

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:24.730
by an order of magnitude of ten, twenty percent.
Only that many cases are taken every year.

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:31.160
And they're heard continuously by all the
nine Justices. And at the end of the year

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:35.520
if there is some pretty big cases never heard,
they're all set aside because they'll come,

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:39.170
they'll come another day. A constitutional
court doesn't have to see everything under

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:40.300
the sun.

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:43.670
Whereas in India, typically every year we
have tens of thousands of cases going before

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:48.100
the courts and of course have to be really,
are very arbitrary as a set. Suppose we create

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:52.490
very much like in the US federal courts of
appeal, for appeals over the high court judgments

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:57.111
at the state level, and then have the Supreme
Court only as the Constitutional Court that

00:41:57.111 --> 00:42:01.590
is basically envisaged, then the problem would
be substantially addressed.

00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:02.590
&gt;&gt;audience1:
Right.

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:06.550
&gt;&gt;JP: So there are very simple answers. In
fact, K. K. Venugopal, a very distinguished

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:12.600
advocate and jurist, has very strongly argued
for this recently in a, in a brilliant two,

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:19.490
two piece article in The Hindu and I complimented
N.Ram, the editor for The Hindu, for actually

00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:23.280
raising the debate and I believe we have to
look at these issues.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:29.690
Look at politics, there are two fundamental
schisms. One is the role of the state; we

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:35.980
haven't yet really addressed it as a society
whether distributing television sets is the

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:41.920
function of a government. Or is it related
to this rule of law and there's education

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:44.800
and health care of reasonable quality. What
is the function of a government? We haven't

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:49.150
yet come down to it. If it's more like a Maharajadhiraja,
a king, a monarch, doing pretty much what

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:51.560
she or he wanted.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:56.970
The second is, within the government is structure
again, the role of a particular tier of government,

00:42:56.970 --> 00:43:01.190
an organ of state is very unclear in the minds
of politicians and the public themselves.

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:04.350
So the notion what is federal, or what does
the federal government do, what does the state

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:08.200
do, what does the local government do, what
does judicial do, what do the police do, what

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:13.030
does bureaucracy do, what does legislature
do, what does executor do? There simply blurred

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:18.090
lines, therefore, most people expect a legislator
to behave like an executor, and an executor

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:23.570
to be actively important and vestful. Judiciary
actually wants to be all the time to be the

00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:24.620
executor, sometimes even the lawmaker.

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:28.721
All kinds of things are happening. Distortions
are there. And when it come to the people,

00:43:28.721 --> 00:43:35.070
at the end of the day, in a system where the
word has no meaningful consequence in their

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:40.370
lives, and this is a central fact, and in
a system where a few words more or less is

00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:45.410
gonna determine the political outcomes, in
an abjectly poor country what happened is

00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:50.510
a very natural thing. What's happening in
India in terms of money politics is a rational

00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:55.640
response to an irrational situation. It's
a perfect irrational response. I mean, if

00:43:55.640 --> 00:44:00.450
I were a citizen, if I know that nothing probably
of any consequence happen in terms of the

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:03.930
outcome in the election, then I would try
to maximize my short term gain.

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:04.930
&gt;&gt;audience1:
Right.

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:06.450
&gt;&gt;JP:
And if a thousand rupees or two thousand pieces

00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:10.110
offered per vote, and this not an ab-, this
is not an abstract figure, it's a very real

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:15.070
figure in India in several states, particularly
Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, etc.

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:19.850
In an abjectly poor country there's big money.
And therefore, I try to maximize my short

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:23.590
term gain. Others, the freebies after the
election, the free power and free color TV.

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:29.200
Or emotional purchase because in a primordial
society, where caste and other loyalties are

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:32.841
all important, and we haven't really enabled
people to discover that there's something

00:44:32.841 --> 00:44:36.480
more important than your caste, there's something
personal for your family. Better education

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:40.051
for your children, maybe. Good health care
for your family, maybe. That's more important

00:44:40.051 --> 00:44:45.370
than your caste and religion. Unless we establish
that link, always this primordial loyalties

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:46.420
be more important.

00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:51.770
And therefore, emotional purchase. And politicians
are perfect at the art of using these three

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:56.570
purchases: directly buying the vote, offering
freebies for the vote, or giving emotional

00:44:56.570 --> 00:45:00.720
purchase in the form of caste, religion, and
language. And that's why we have to address

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:06.590
in these three vests, local governments, citizen
central governments, electoral system, a fight

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:11.120
against corruption. It can't be a one sector,
one [inaudible], there's no single silver

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:13.920
bullet. I will say these are the five bullets
together.

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:14.920
&gt;&gt;audience1:
Right.

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:17.270
&gt;&gt;JP:
And unless we are understand adequately, I

00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:22.110
know all of the deeply concerned, but unless
the concern is informed by a deep awareness

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:27.170
of what, what's the way forward, it could
be a really concern. We have to actually go

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:28.980
forward. And that's my argument.

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:30.250
&gt;&gt;audience1:
Thank you.

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:33.000
&gt;&gt;JP:
Thank you. I'll try and be brief, I know.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000
&gt;&gt;male audience2:
[Indian accent]

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Yes.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.000
&gt;&gt;JP:
Please.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000
&gt;&gt;audience2:
So, most of the problems that you mentioned

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.870
revolve around two causes. Basically, there
isn't probably a right re-, legalization of

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:45.770
probably like, procedure for it, like you
mentioned the Supreme Court thing, right?

00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:50.570
Like, that we don't have a like, a separate
appeals court, right? And the second one you

00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:55.360
mentioned was there is no right implementation
in, in spite of the right legalization existing,

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:58.950
but the people we expect them to correct are
the same people who are getting the purchase

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:03.550
out of it by exploiting it. So, it's, it's,
it's like a loop it seems to me, like, h-,

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:04.740
how, how do you resolve that--

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:09.200
&gt;&gt;JP: It's a terrific question. It's a terrific
question. In our politics, it's about solving

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:16.030
the dilemmas of a society. If you have a constitution
whose intent is sound, politics is the structure,

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:22.671
the bridge between the constitutional values
and the society's current culture. Now, if

00:46:22.671 --> 00:46:27.361
politics that ought to be a solution has become
part of the problem, then we turn to the vicious

00:46:27.361 --> 00:46:32.820
cycle. The dangerous loop you talked about.
But let's go a little backwards. Why did this

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:35.250
happen in the first place?

00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:40.490
When India became free, we had arguably, the
greatest galaxy of leaders ever assembled

00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:46.160
on the face of the earth. The only comparison
would be to the American Freedom Fighters

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:50.310
and the Constitution makers, the Founding
Fathers of the United States. There is no

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:56.950
other episode in history when such a galaxy
of liberal-minded, well-educated, deeply committed,

00:46:56.950 --> 00:47:02.680
great leaders came together with a common
purpose to build a nation. Post-independence

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:07.880
was some time again, that caste played a role.
But subsequently, the best and the brightest

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:15.190
society. They have given up on politics. They
have thought that they would pursue their

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:19.430
own personal goals, which is of total their
right, that's what life is about, but at the

00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:25.230
cost of public domain. The vacuum is left
and the scum of humanity increasingly filled

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:29.850
that. Or bad practices particularly took over.
In politics, too, like in economics, aggression's

00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:35.720
law operates. Bad politics always drives away
good politics. So, the answer really lies,

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:40.750
in order to break this deadlock, this logjam,
in the middle classes, the educated people,

00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:45.751
the young people who are forward looking recognize
in the centrality of politics even to the

00:47:45.751 --> 00:47:50.050
economic future of the country. And playing
a role.

00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:54.620
Everyone doesn't have to simply give up everything
and then go and become a martyr or a farmer.

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:59.910
Everybody can't go and become a contestant.
But we all have to play creative political

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:08.220
roles as citizens from registration from voting
to voting sensibly and definitely to mobilizing

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:12.510
other people to think rationally, to pursuing
rational policies, to enhancing the quality

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:16.640
of public discourse, to everything that's
required to really make a democracy healthy.

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:20.210
Look at the United States the way there was
this massive debate in this country in the

00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:24.830
healthcare policies. And even truly perhaps
the last word has not said. And there's going

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:30.070
to be an election in the next few months and
maybe people will have a chance to speak,

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:35.530
speak up. And, I'm, I'm sure there'll be a
sequel to that. That is the stuff of politics.

00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:40.030
In India, I don't recall, I'm not sure if
I can recall a single instance when a Prime

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:45.030
Minister ever addressed the country on a single
issue of say, how to educate our people? How

00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:48.650
to improve the quality of healthcare? Or anything
else for that matter.

00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:55.220
So we have to redefine politics and unless
the middle classes are deeply engaged, and

00:48:55.220 --> 00:49:02.230
unless they learn the art of pursuit of personal
goals along with pursuit of public good simultaneously,

00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:07.330
we have problem. Somewhere we have to break
this logjam. Politicians, there's no point

00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:11.890
blaming them, I know we all love to hate politicians.
Everybody, even in the United States, everybody

00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:17.160
loves to hate a Congressman or politician.
It's a normal, democratic skepticism. It's

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:22.080
a good, healthy thing. But that doesn't solve
the problem. You can improve politics only

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:25.540
by better politics and more politics, not
by abolition of politics.

00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:26.891
&gt;&gt;audience2:
Thank you.

00:49:26.891 --> 00:49:29.000
&gt;&gt;male audience3:
[Indian accent]

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:36.450
Dr. JP, thank you for coming here. You said
politics are intertwined with money, not only

00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:44.470
that, in India they're also intertwined with
violence. So, maybe there should have been

00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:50.580
a competition of ideas. It's been, it's been
replaced, it's already is replaced by competition

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:58.060
of rhetoric. So, what I wanted to ask you
was about a specific instance. How do you

00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:03.010
think the Telangana issue should be handled
and what is your party's stance on that?

00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:06.100
&gt;&gt;JP:
Ok, I knew this question would come up in

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:08.310
some form or the other.

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:09.310
[laughter]

00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:12.000
And I'm sure another question will come up
about reservations; I'll be surprised if it

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:18.250
doesn't come up. You know, we love polarities
in India. We love a yes or no kind of an approach.

00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:22.460
But we have to be a little more sensible and
practical about dealing with this matters.

00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:26.590
As I said before, our federalism has matured
remarkably. One of the great success stories

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:31.270
of India is of federalism. In the past 25
years, there's been a steep change in federalism;

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:36.802
we can be very, justly proud of that. It's
the only great example of a truly diverse

00:50:36.802 --> 00:50:39.160
society that models federalism after the United
States.

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:43.180
In some ways a much more miraculously than
the United States because we have such vast

00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:49.090
linguistic gulf, apart from poverty, etc.
But nevertheless, in a complex federal policy,

00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:54.079
we're going to have these issues coming up.
But, we must not lose our shirt over that

00:50:54.079 --> 00:51:00.660
and this whole notion that creation of a Telangana
is a disaster, or it is a solution; it is

00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:02.010
a cure.

00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:07.050
Both is very dangerous. It's neither a cure
nor a catastrophe. We must take it in our

00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:11.540
stride. Except practical, political arrangements
and people are seeking. Now, how practical

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:15.921
is it? Is it the best way forward, is something
that the nation must slowly debate and come

00:51:15.921 --> 00:51:20.580
to terms with it because the, the implications
are not going to be merely regional or limited

00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:25.740
to one state. They are going to apply to the
whole country. If language is not a marker,

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:30.040
in a country where every non-Hindi state has
one state, one language principle, work with

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:35.140
a new marker so that in, in Tamil Nadu, the
Northern part of the country, the Eastern

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:39.020
or Western part of the country, demands now
crop up, how we deal with that will depend

00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:41.020
on what kind of markers we decide.

00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:45.690
There's nothing wrong in having markers. Like
an artisan in some parts, you can simply say,

00:51:45.690 --> 00:51:50.160
"I'll take this parallel and I'll take this
vertical, and that's it. I don't care how

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:52.930
this state is created, but this is my state."
There's nothing wrong with that, that's what

00:51:52.930 --> 00:51:56.150
India wants. But you must also uniform principle.

00:51:56.150 --> 00:52:02.200
The second thing is the first part of India
where a region, which is host to the Capital

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:06.340
City, unlike in United States, the capitalist
in India not only politically centralized,

00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:11.100
but also economically centralized, demographically
centralized. The hubs of economic growth,

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:15.730
that region in all seem to have a separate
statehood. Until now, it's the far flung regions

00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:19.550
heavy from big cities that wanted a separate
statehood. Now when economy is increasingly

00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:24.440
concentrated around big cities, what is every
interest at? Because what happens here could

00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:31.230
happen tomorrow in Western Maharashtra Mumbai.
Northern Tamil Nadu in Chennai, Southern Karnataka

00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:34.930
in Bangalore, or some other state with some
other capital city, or big city.

00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:40.700
We're to realize, we have to recognize that
there is an issue here and find a way of resolving

00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:45.420
that issue. Once we do those two things, it
doesn't matter what we do. We can, because

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:49.760
it makes no difference. The real answer lies
in local governments, not in one state more

00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:53.150
or one state less. Neither integration nor
separation of a state is going to change anything

00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:57.330
monumentally. It's just going to create one
more Chief Minister in the Cabinet. Nothing

00:52:57.330 --> 00:52:58.330
more.

00:52:58.330 --> 00:52:59.550
&gt;&gt;audience3:
Thank you.

00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:00.980
&gt;&gt;JP:
Yeah.

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:03.830
&gt;&gt;male audience4:
[Indian accent]

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:06.820
Since I'm the last question, I'd like to ask
two questions, ok?

00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:08.230
[JP laughs]

00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:16.380
My first question is about the distinction
that you drew about the Chinese ground level

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:23.830
democracy versus our normative, the normative
democracy in India. I read a book by Fareed

00:53:23.830 --> 00:53:29.370
Zakaria where he kind of drew a distinction
between democracy and rule of law. And he

00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:35.850
said that rule of law is equally or more important
than actually elections and other external

00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:41.790
characteristics of democracy. But I don't
think that rule of law actually exists at

00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:46.710
ground level in China either, they don't have
even the property rights, even though they're

00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:51.570
not strong in India, they're probably stronger
in India than China. So I would like to have

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:53.290
your thoughts about why does --

00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:54.290
&gt;&gt;JP:
OK

00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:56.640
&gt;&gt;audience4:
work in China? That's question number one.

00:53:56.640 --> 00:54:04.570
Question number two is about the Maoist Insurgents
in India. Even people like [inaudible] are

00:54:04.570 --> 00:54:12.750
coming out saying that because of this abject
failure of governments and there even the

00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:17.060
Maoists are out there; violence might be the
only answer that the people there might have

00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:18.060
against the Indians--

00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:20.840
&gt;&gt;JP:
Good questions, but--

00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:23.610
&gt;&gt;audience4:
I don't, I don't agree with him, I just want

00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:24.610
your thoughts--

00:54:24.610 --> 00:54:27.420
&gt;&gt;JP:
I understand. First about Fareed Zakaria and

00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:32.120
China's rule of law and absence of it. Now,
when I made a comparison between India and

00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:41.780
China, I did just to caution the Indian scholars
and others who consistently argue that we

00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:47.010
are so democratic and wonderful that we have
nothing to change. It is not to argue that

00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:51.100
China is better than India in that respect.
That would be a foolish argument.

00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:56.070
All I'm arguing is that there are factions
in Chinese governance which are perhaps more

00:54:56.070 --> 00:55:03.530
democratic than in a liberal, free Indian
society. Overcentralization has been our bane.

00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:08.960
Decentralization has been their strength.
Decentralization by definition is democratization.

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:12.480
A total democratization. In India, we have
not yet done it.

00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:17.840
Obviously, rule of law is far more deficient
in China than in India. In India, the instruments

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:22.150
of rule of law are really very strong; they're
there. The delivery is weak for a variety

00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:26.130
of reasons we have to now set that right.
But in other ways, the acceptance of rule

00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:32.220
of law as a notion, as a norm, are the instruments
of rule of law a constitutional and legal

00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:37.430
instruments of rule of law, we are ages ahead
of China. There's no question, but still we

00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:39.430
have to set something straight.

00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:45.370
Obviously, what we have to demonstrate to
the world is that freedom and economic growth

00:55:45.370 --> 00:55:49.040
are compatible. Democracy is not related to
growth because some people are now coming

00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:55.980
to the dangerous conclusion that growth in
an emerging economy means autocracy. So why

00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:59.890
I argue, so why I'm arguing that China is
invested democratic is, is democratic impulses

00:55:59.890 --> 00:56:03.950
of China that actually led to growth, not
autocratic impulses. You must see both of

00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:04.950
them together.

00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:14.840
Otherwise, I agree. But I'm not very, a great
fan of the notion of Fareeh Zakaria, that

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:20.901
you must increasingly view power to the unelected.
I recognize the importance of the unelected

00:56:20.901 --> 00:56:27.190
institutions like the Supreme Court, like
the Election Commission, etc. But the think

00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:32.350
that you can somehow solve the problems of
politics by nonpolitical institutions is a

00:56:32.350 --> 00:56:36.030
typical bureaucratic or middle class approach.

00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:41.350
There is no substitute to politics. Clean,
decent politics, mobilizing public opinion,

00:56:41.350 --> 00:56:45.630
and more and more and better and better people
playing a creative role; being deeply engaged

00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:50.740
as citizens and as, as people who would influence
the outcomes of the local level and the state

00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:56.580
and national level. There's no substitute
to that. And the danger is, and somehow believing

00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:59.620
that because we have a Supreme Court, we have
an Election Commission, or some other strong

00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:04.000
body, everything will be alright. My friend,
Seshan, a very good personal friend, even

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:09.220
today, and since has very few friends remaining
actually, he's a good man but not very strong

00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:14.890
and sometimes a civic man. He was a great
Election Commissioner. What did he prove?

00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:19.510
He proved that the constitutional lawist in
India could be autonomous if they really,

00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:25.800
sought, sought to be so. If they chose to
be so. He proved that they could actually

00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:30.790
be independent. But, could he change the nature
of elections in India? Far from it. Seshan

00:57:30.790 --> 00:57:32.820
himself knows that. It's not his failure.

00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:38.580
After all, the constitution itself is a creation
of the constitution and a law of the land.

00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:43.691
The Parliament gives the mandate for the Election
Commission to function. It can only function

00:57:43.691 --> 00:57:48.830
within that. It has no mandate to go beyond
that. Therefore, to think that somehow by

00:57:48.830 --> 00:57:52.880
investing so much authority and prestige and
hope in them, we can solve the problems of

00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:58.090
India, we'd comitting a great mistake. They
are necessary, but they're not sufficient.

00:57:58.090 --> 00:58:04.670
Ultimately, politics have to be set by politics.
About Maoists, I'm glad you asked this question.

00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:09.450
Undoubtedly, the failure of governance in
India are in capacity to fulfill the aspirations

00:58:09.450 --> 00:58:14.000
of the bulk of the people. And the fact that
the accident of birth is determined in the

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:20.250
future by the bulk of the children. These
are the fuel; these are the fodder for generating

00:58:20.250 --> 00:58:26.100
any number of violent moments. Some of them
turned to be Maoist; that's not the only one.

00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:32.730
We have recognized that, but having recognized
that if we do not also recognize that in a

00:58:32.730 --> 00:58:38.280
democratic society where the constitutional
liberty are available and vote is available,

00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:44.470
the only forum of dissent, form of dissent
is within the bounds of the constitution.

00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:50.920
Namely, you holler, you shout, you protest,
you demonstrate without obstructing others,

00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:55.180
without disrupting other peoples freedoms,
in front of the White House. When I went the

00:58:55.180 --> 00:59:00.801
other day, I saw; found two groups of people
with the banners about all kinds of things.

00:59:00.801 --> 00:59:05.640
That is legitimate democratic protest, its
basis is provided and they continue to try

00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:10.140
and attract public attention and eventually,
as even politicians recognize that they cannot

00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:12.290
ignore that issue, they will address that.

00:59:12.290 --> 00:59:17.060
That is democracy. All else should feel sufficiently
mad about it, like some of the nice Hollywood

00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:21.760
films. Somebody gets into Congress and moves
the Congress and the nation and something

00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:26.420
about it. That's all politics is about. But
if I say that because I'm not happy with the

00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:30.250
way things are, I will take to the gun, I
will extinguish the liberties available under

00:59:30.250 --> 00:59:35.250
the Constitution, I'll take law into my hands,
and I will, in fact, repeal this constitution

00:59:35.250 --> 00:59:39.900
instead of abolish the constitution itself.
That's not acceptable. Therefore, the state

00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:46.530
and the people have every right and duty to
do everything within the bounds of the constitution

00:59:46.530 --> 00:59:52.970
to control it. Let there be no mistake, whatsoever.
Abraham Lincoln had this question repeatedly

00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:58.590
posed to him during the Civil War. He said
time and again if the first article of the

00:59:58.590 --> 01:00:01.760
American Constitution collapses, all else
fails.

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:04.870
Therefore, in order to preserve the first
article, namely the union, there should be

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:12.290
union of states. I will do whatever it takes.
Just like there is a hierarchy of principles

01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:16.260
or hierarchy of needs, there is also a hierarchy
of principles. The ultimate principle for

01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:20.830
the state is to preserve the Constitutional
order. Everything else is to become subordinate

01:00:20.830 --> 01:00:26.980
to that. Having said that, merely by doing
whatever it takes to control them is it enough?

01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:31.280
No. We also have to create a just order, give
confidence to the bulk of the people that,

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:36.820
"Look, we understand your agony. We hear your
voice, we created a framework which more just

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:41.110
and more humane and it's not even perfect,
it's always work in progress, but everybody

01:00:41.110 --> 01:00:47.720
has a chance." I don't agree with, the author
at all in this respect. I know, you don't

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:52.890
either. It's very dangerous not to use arguments
without understanding the context. She's able

01:00:52.890 --> 01:00:55.460
to speak out because she's at liberty.

01:00:55.460 --> 01:01:00.070
What happened in Cambodia, please remember.
When Pol Pot was in power, one third of all

01:01:00.070 --> 01:01:06.010
Cambodian people were decimated. The youngest
child was first killed so that the rest of

01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:11.590
the family understood the pain. The fellow
with glasses, somebody like you or me, just

01:01:11.590 --> 01:01:16.181
because you wore glasses, the fact that you
wore glasses means that you are, you are not

01:01:16.181 --> 01:01:20.470
a hard working man. You're not a liberal.
They feel you are dangerous to society. They

01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:25.410
killed them. The people with soft hands; they
were killed. One after the whole family was

01:01:25.410 --> 01:01:31.670
killed. One third of the whole country was
butchered by its own government. It never

01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:39.730
happened in history, not even Hitler did that.
If that is how a notion of a future, I don't

01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:46.520
think any Indian wants it. Because of temporary
anger about the injustices on occasion we

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:53.670
may say, "Oh, next race is better." But no.
It's a dangerous argument. As long as freedom

01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:58.410
is there, as long as vote is there, there's
only one route, there's, there's only one

01:01:58.410 --> 01:01:59.410
road.

01:01:59.410 --> 01:02:04.760
That man may not be recorded but they have
some questions I'll be happy to take. It's

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:05.760
up to you.

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:11.100
Ok, ok, ok. I'll just take that question.

01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:13.820
&gt;&gt;male audience5:
[Indian accent]

01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:19.390
You recently become the MLA in, in some region.
So, I'd like to know some of the positive

01:02:19.390 --> 01:02:24.840
experiences you had in like, typical Indian
movies and Indian literature, the recent one.

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:29.950
They depict Indian politics as something really
nasty, something really dirty. Actually, you've

01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:35.810
met some people at some, at least civilians
who were nice to you, who actually abided

01:02:35.810 --> 01:02:41.040
by the line, give you a kind of positive spirit
like, "Yes, there are people who want a change."

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:43.130
I'd like to know more about that.

01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:49.660
&gt;&gt;JP:
Ok. First of all, we must have a, a broader

01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:56.280
argument. Are politicians necessarily scoundrels?
Does it mean that the scum of humanity in

01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:00.300
this politics and all the nice people and
nice people are outside politics? Are there

01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:06.070
two groups of society? Or, are politicians
doing, in a set of circumstances, whatever

01:03:06.070 --> 01:03:12.550
they think they should do in order to try?
We must have some clarity. I would plead with

01:03:12.550 --> 01:03:18.620
you to recognize that politicians are just
another set of human beings.

01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:23.780
They are not a very specialized set of corrupt,
rotten, criminal human beings, they are human

01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:30.840
beings. Period. If you create an institutional
framework where by doing what is right you

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:36.300
can also politically prosper, they would happily
do that. The Prime Ministers, the Chief Ministers,

01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:41.950
the MPs and MLAs of India, they are not taking
a vow to destroy India. They are taking a

01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:45.950
vow to do whatever it takes to get, to get
into power. And to do whatever it takes to

01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:51.110
stay in power. It's for us to create a system
where you can do something honorable and decent

01:03:51.110 --> 01:03:55.710
and public-spirited and yet, be politically
relevant.

01:03:55.710 --> 01:03:59.420
If you consistently prove that by doing the
nice thing and the right thing, you're politically

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:04.320
irrelevant. We are actually driving them to
do something wrong. My experience proved this

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:10.050
to be absolutely true. Most of the fellow
legislators of my, in my provincial assembly,

01:04:10.050 --> 01:04:17.920
80% of them at least, almost everybody, with
exception of myself, they have paid money

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:22.760
to get the vote. It's, it's universally known.
But despite that, they recognize that they

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:26.980
have become victims of a vicious cycle. Given
a choice, given a chance, they'll actually

01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:30.872
do something nice and decent. They despair
all the time, but they feel that they are

01:04:30.872 --> 01:04:35.130
in the vicious cycle they can't get out of
the trap easily. So, they're not villains.

01:04:35.130 --> 01:04:41.770
And my faith is vindicated. But, will they
always behave in a manner that, that really

01:04:41.770 --> 01:04:45.870
oppose their views? No. Because they're creatures
of their own parties, they're slaves of their

01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:50.720
party, and they're slaves of the power game.
And they simply feel that there's no escape

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.720
from that.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:58.040
So, unless there is external pressure and
pull, and unless we, we mobilize the society

01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:04.480
and prove that clean politics and honesty
are compatible with survival in our public

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:10.460
office; I don't think we can change that.
I'll conclude the comment with one last word.

01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:19.470
We have in India today a phenomenal opportunity.
We have the technology, thanks to all of you,

01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:23.931
the world is virtually flat, and we can access
almost everything that's happening almost

01:05:23.931 --> 01:05:28.020
anywhere in the world; get knowledge of a
kind which would be unbelievable earlier.

01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:33.530
We have the resources, may not be enough to
have an American standard of living, which

01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:39.150
probably is crazy anyway. It's too high. It's
not possible for the whole globe, but we have

01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:44.850
enough resources to be able to fulfill all
the basic needs of Indian people and to give

01:05:44.850 --> 01:05:48.100
opportunity for us to fulfill our potential
as a country.

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:53.630
What we lack are institutions. What we lack
is the right kind of politics. And with all

01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:57.700
these institutions, technology plant, can
be transplanted easily. Institutions like

01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:03.200
take a lot of nurturing. Institutions take
a lot of public pressure. Institutions take

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:08.890
the middle classes and the educated people
to be engaged; deeply and on a sustained basis.

01:06:08.890 --> 01:06:14.550
What I'm arguing is, let us be engaged because
our future is on the line. And in a fundamental

01:06:14.550 --> 01:06:18.410
sense, the mankind's truthfulness is on the
line. There's no reason for cynicism and despair

01:06:18.410 --> 01:06:23.460
at all. On occasion it appears to be exceedingly
difficult, but there are forces of change.

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:28.251
The young people are increasingly more confident,
they believe that they can change their country;

01:06:28.251 --> 01:06:33.780
they're idealistic whether they live in India
or abroad. Economic growth itself is actually

01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:38.520
spurring forces of change in the country.
It's going to make many people ask uncomfortable

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:43.600
questions and the communications evolution
that all of you have had is reaching in you

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:50.930
also, many Indians, including the ordinary,
poor, shop owners, and, and hard workers.

01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:54.790
And all these will ultimately bring about
a fundamental change, but the question is

01:06:54.790 --> 01:06:58.980
what direction of change it'll take? That
depends on what we do now. That's why I gave

01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:04.171
you the most great example. If we do the right
thing together, today, if we give confidence,

01:07:04.171 --> 01:07:07.940
then that change will be the right one. Otherwise,
change will anyway happen, but not the, not

01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:12.810
necessarily the right one. I ask a few in
our own enlightened self-interest, interest

01:07:12.810 --> 01:07:18.100
of India, and in a larger sense an interest
with the broader humanity. We worked ourselves

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:21.971
to make a difference to the way the Indian
political trajectory takes shape. Thank you

01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:23.690
very much.

01:07:23.690 --> 01:07:24.550
