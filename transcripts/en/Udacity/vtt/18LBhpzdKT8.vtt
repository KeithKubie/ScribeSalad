00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.810
At this point you should know what
monetization method you want to use, and

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.300
how you'll implement it.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.670
You might also have a plan
B in the back of your head,

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.210
in case that first one doesn't work out.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.610
And you should also have a plan for
tracking and

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.110
measuring the success of your model.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.630
&gt;&gt; Keep in mind, you can apply the user
segment to creating the previous unit

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.370
to any of these reports.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.410
This will help you get insights per
group, which is much more accurate.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.670
As Yogi Berra said,
you can observe a lot just by watching.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.110
In our world, keep watching your users.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.080
&gt;&gt; In the next lesson,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.250
you'll learn how to iterate on your
monetization model, changing your

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.920
approach when you're not making
the amount of money that you need to.
