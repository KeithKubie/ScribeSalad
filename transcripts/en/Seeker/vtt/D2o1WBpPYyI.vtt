00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.860
When you eat something sour, your tongue is
actually tasting protons!

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.560
YES I’m positive!

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.030
Hang with me though, cuz, it gets weirder.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.720
First, to understand all this sour-y strangeness,
we have to understand how the tongue tastes

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.550
things to begin with, and just saying ‘taste
buds’ ain’t gonna cut it.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.520
Those little bumps on your tongue are called
papillae, and located in the crevices of each

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.100
papilla are your taste buds.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.130
Each of those taste buds contains clusters
of sensory cells, and when a compound from

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.180
your food comes in contact with them, it causes
a chain reaction in nearby nerve cells, bringing

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.200
the message all the way back to the brain.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.559
There, the message combines with the messages
from your nose to create what we experience

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:39.559
as taste.

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.239
But with sour tastes, things happen a little
differently.

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.780
Foods that are “sour” are registered that
way because they’re acidic.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.129
Citrus fruit has citric acid, vinegar has
acetic acid, and most sour candies contain

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.110
citric or malic acid.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.570
When you eat these foods, the acids dissolve
in your saliva and their hydrogen ions split

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.149
off-- these ions then make their way down
to your little sensory cells!

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.999
But instead of just activating a receptor
at the edge of the cell, like what happens

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:12.090
with sweet and savory flavors, the hydrogen
ions actually enter the cell via specialized

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.090
ion channels.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.020
Upon entry they set off that chain reaction
that tells your brain it’s time to pucker

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.020
up.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.020
And TBH, this might be the coolest thing we
taste.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.020
We’re tasting IONS.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.020
Them’s Protons!

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.499
I mean, our sweet receptors evolved to recognize
simple carbohydrates like boring old glucose,

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:30.130
and savory (or umami) receptors and bitter
receptors both recognize different groups

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.130
of proteins.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.039
Which is kind of cool, i guess.

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:34.039
But tasting protons?

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:35.039
That’s awesome.

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.670
But, as far we know, tasting electrons just

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.850
didn’t serve any evolutionary purpose.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.780
The thing is, sour doesn’t really have an
evolutionary purpose anyway.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.980
Or rather, we haven’t figured out what singe purpose it would be yet.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.340
The other tastes make sense-- things that
taste sweet give us energy, salty things give

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:56.819
us sodium to maintain a whole host of body
function, umami things are rich in protein,

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:00.489
and bitter tastes warn us of potential toxicity.But
sour??

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:03.159
It’s kind of a mixed bag.

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.430
Some sour things- like Vitamin C- are necessary
for survival.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.200
But others -- like spoiled food, could make
us sick.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.110
In the end, not only are sour candies the
best but now you can pucker up and then tell

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.870
all your friends about how awesome these sour
proton kids taste.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.360
Then they can shush you at the movies.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.440
Shush! Movies!

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.580

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.110
And if you’ve got a sweet spot for food
science - I just did a deep dive over

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.819
on Seeker Plus into the science of meat, watch it here.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.420
Fun fact: I eat sour candy at every movie.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.420
Every time.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.000
I love sour stuff I can't get enough of it.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.240
Thanks for watching.
