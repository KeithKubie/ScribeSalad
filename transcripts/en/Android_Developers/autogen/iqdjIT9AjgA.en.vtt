00:00:06.081 --> 00:00:07.809
 HaloTalk is a platform 

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:09.551
 Connecting language learners from all over the world 

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:11.727
 Making language learning fun and attractive 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.271
 Zachary Nagai, founder and executive director of HaloTalk 

00:00:16.527 --> 00:00:20.047
 I was born in Hainan and grew up in Hong Kong 

00:00:20.111 --> 00:00:21.327
 I also received my education in the United States 

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:22.735
 She worked in South Korea 

00:00:22.863 --> 00:00:27.019
 Through my multicultural experiences 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:28.939
 I created Halo Talk 

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:31.831
 I wish every learner a language 

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:34.263
 Be able to communicate with native language speakers 

00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:36.631
 They are in real talks 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:39.383
 Since its launch in 2013 

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:42.327
 HaloTook has been hugely popular among language learners 

00:00:42.647 --> 00:00:45.911
 We have more than 12 million users around the world 

00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:48.663
 Last year we won an award 

00:00:48.791 --> 00:00:51.095
 Best Social Application in Google Playstation for 2017 

00:00:51.863 --> 00:00:54.231
 It's a big challenge 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:56.363
 To develop an instant chat program such as HaloTalk 

00:00:56.363 --> 00:00:56.938
 Luckily 

00:00:56.938 --> 00:01:00.237
 We have a console in Google Play to help improve the quality of the app 

00:01:02.378 --> 00:01:05.883
 Android indicators aggregate and display data about application performance 

00:01:05.883 --> 00:01:08.123
 This includes detailed analysis by device 

00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:11.151
 Allowing rapid access to the optimum level of target devices 

00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:15.124
 To help improve crash rates and user experience 

00:01:15.188 --> 00:01:16.276
 With the help of android indicators 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.668
 HaloTook managed to reduce the proportion of (the program does not respond) by 60% 

00:01:19.796 --> 00:01:23.444
 And excessive alerts at 95% 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.692
 HaloTook has built a stable business model with subscriptions 

00:01:29.204 --> 00:01:31.316
 After adopting the Google Play model for subscriptions 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.004
 We saw a 350% increase in revenues over the previous year 

00:01:34.324 --> 00:01:38.164
 HaloTalk subscription renewal rate is around 75% 

00:01:38.484 --> 00:01:41.620
 In case of automatic renewal failure 

00:01:41.876 --> 00:01:44.820
 Give users seven days to fix payment issues 

00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:49.364
 Which improved recovery from a 13% 

00:01:49.812 --> 00:01:54.164
 Since we applied the introductory offer to sign up for Google Store 

00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:57.400
 Our short-term income nearly quadrupled 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.548
 HaloTook has been a global communication platform since the first day 

00:02:02.868 --> 00:02:05.300
 Users can practice in more than 100 languages 

00:02:05.428 --> 00:02:08.500
 With partners to learn from about 200 countries 

00:02:08.884 --> 00:02:11.001
 We learned from the analytical data from the console in Google Play 

00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:12.892
 That the continuation rates in Japan and South Korea 

00:02:12.956 --> 00:02:15.732
 Much higher than the internal rate 

00:02:15.796 --> 00:02:17.908
 This gives us a good reason to invest more to localize the application 

00:02:17.972 --> 00:02:21.812
 For these two countries, from language to operations 

00:02:21.876 --> 00:02:23.220
 The credit goes back to Google Play 

00:02:23.604 --> 00:02:26.036
 Where HaloTook's rating is in the PlayStation 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.980
 Rose from 3.7 to more than 4.3 

00:02:29.044 --> 00:02:32.240
 Which strengthens our determination to create a better experience for our users 

00:02:32.308 --> 00:02:33.524
 Through new technology 

00:02:33.588 --> 00:02:35.060
 We sincerely hope it 

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:38.900
 In the future, everyone will be able to master at least three languages 

00:02:39.028 --> 00:02:41.332
 While making new friendships in different countries 

00:02:41.396 --> 00:02:42.484
 And enjoy the happiness 

00:02:42.676 --> 00:02:46.196
 Provided by cultural diversity through HaloTook
