00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.428
I must look rather strange to you,

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.318
all covered in spines,

00:00:31.036 --> 00:00:32.712
without even a face.

00:00:35.162 --> 00:00:38.120
But I've taken many forms during my life.

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.323
I started out just like you:

00:00:42.585 --> 00:00:45.000
a tiny egg in a watery world.

00:00:46.235 --> 00:00:48.455
My parents never knew each other.

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:50.962
One moonlit night before a storm,

00:00:50.986 --> 00:00:53.998
thousands of urchins, clams and corals

00:00:54.022 --> 00:00:57.330
released trillions of sperm and eggs
into the open sea.

00:01:08.925 --> 00:01:11.787
My father's sperm
somehow met my mother's egg,

00:01:11.811 --> 00:01:13.269
and they fused.

00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.000
Fertilization.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.146
Instantly, I became an embryo
the size of a speck of dust.

00:01:22.391 --> 00:01:24.120
After a few hours of drifting,

00:01:24.144 --> 00:01:25.381
I cleaved in two,

00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:27.193
then four,

00:01:27.217 --> 00:01:28.395
then eight cells.

00:01:28.815 --> 00:01:30.958
Then so many, I lost count.

00:01:32.434 --> 00:01:33.758
In less than a day,

00:01:33.782 --> 00:01:36.384
I developed a gut and a skeleton.

00:01:37.153 --> 00:01:39.098
I became a rocket ship,

00:01:39.122 --> 00:01:40.646
a pluteus larva.

00:01:42.895 --> 00:01:44.847
I floated through the world of plankton,

00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:47.189
searching for tiny algae to eat.

00:01:50.331 --> 00:01:53.557
For weeks, I was surrounded
by all kinds of organisms,

00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:55.271
larvae of all sorts.

00:01:57.978 --> 00:02:00.514
Most are so different
from their adult form

00:02:00.538 --> 00:02:03.854
that biologists have a tough time
figuring out who they are.

00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:14.266
Try matching these youngsters
to their parents.

00:02:16.877 --> 00:02:19.654
This veliger larvae
will turn into a snail;

00:02:20.725 --> 00:02:23.225
this zoea, into a crab;

00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:27.000
and this planula, into a clytia jelly.

00:02:29.841 --> 00:02:33.357
Some of my young companions
are easier to picture as grown-ups.

00:02:35.072 --> 00:02:37.931
These baby jellies, known as ephyrae,

00:02:37.955 --> 00:02:41.323
already resemble their beautiful
but deadly parents.

00:02:42.848 --> 00:02:45.060
Here in the plankton,
there's more than one way

00:02:45.084 --> 00:02:47.567
to get your genes
into the next generation.

00:02:50.676 --> 00:02:54.714
Most Medusa jellies make
special structures called polyps,

00:02:54.738 --> 00:02:58.153
that simply bud off babies
with no need for sex.

00:03:00.123 --> 00:03:01.307
Salps are similar.

00:03:02.191 --> 00:03:03.648
When food is abundant,

00:03:03.672 --> 00:03:06.490
they just clone themselves
into long chains.

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:12.916
The plankton is full of surprises
when it comes to sex.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.648
Meet the hermaphrodites.

00:03:18.402 --> 00:03:20.473
These comb jellies and arrow worms

00:03:20.497 --> 00:03:23.607
produce, store and release
both sperm and eggs.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.704
They can fertilize themselves,

00:03:26.728 --> 00:03:28.000
or another.

00:03:32.223 --> 00:03:34.195
When you're floating in a vast sea,

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:36.646
with little control over who you may meet,

00:03:37.344 --> 00:03:39.928
it can pay to play
both sides of the field.

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.113
The majority of species here,
however, never mate,

00:03:45.137 --> 00:03:47.906
nor form any sort of lasting bonds.

00:03:49.464 --> 00:03:51.487
That was my parents' strategy.

00:03:53.582 --> 00:03:56.136
There were so many of us pluteus larvae,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.573
I just hid in the crowd,

00:03:57.597 --> 00:03:59.907
while most of my kin were devoured.

00:04:03.705 --> 00:04:07.199
Not all parents leave
the survival of their offspring to chance.

00:04:08.064 --> 00:04:12.007
Some have far fewer young
and take much better care of them,

00:04:12.031 --> 00:04:15.605
brooding their precious cargo
for days, even months.

00:04:17.723 --> 00:04:19.010
This speedy copepod

00:04:19.034 --> 00:04:21.861
totes her beautifully
packaged eggs for days.

00:04:23.808 --> 00:04:27.209
This Phronima crustacean
carries her babies on her chest,

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:30.362
then carefully places them
in a gelatinous barrel.

00:04:38.303 --> 00:04:40.754
But the black-eyed squid takes the prize.

00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:45.447
She cradles her eggs
in long arms for nine months,

00:04:45.471 --> 00:04:49.005
the same time it takes
to gestate a human infant.

00:04:52.955 --> 00:04:55.643
Eventually, all youngsters
have to make it on their own

00:04:55.667 --> 00:04:57.365
in this drifting world.

00:05:00.554 --> 00:05:04.054
Some will spend
their whole lives in the plankton,

00:05:04.078 --> 00:05:07.072
but others, like me, move on.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.728
A few weeks after I was conceived,

00:05:12.752 --> 00:05:14.481
I decided to settle down,

00:05:15.472 --> 00:05:18.876
and metamorphosed
into a recognizable urchin.

00:05:22.597 --> 00:05:24.786
So now you know a bit of my story.

00:05:25.675 --> 00:05:29.122
I may just be a slow-moving
ball of spines,

00:05:29.146 --> 00:05:32.629
but don't let my calm
adult exterior fool you.

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:36.839
I was a rocket ship.

00:05:37.995 --> 00:05:39.923
I was a wild child.
