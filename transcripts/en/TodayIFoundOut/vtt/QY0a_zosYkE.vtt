00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:14.190
“We were somewhere around Barstow, on the
edge of the desert, when the drugs began to

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.190
take hold.”

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.570
This is the opening line from the highly acclaimed
roman à clef Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas:

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.730
A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American
Dream written by Hunter S. Thompson, one of

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.119
America’s most countercultural and anti-authoritarian
writers.

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.760
The untamed master of his own self-titled
genre, “gonzo journalism,” Thompson set

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.280
ablaze the American standards for journalism
during the 1960s and 70s with a cornucopia

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.399
of drugs, alcohol, gun toting, and most notably,
his exemplary writing.

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:49.110
Hunter Stockton Thompson was born in Louisville,
Kentucky on July 18, 1937, to Virginia Ray

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.640
Davison, a local librarian, and Jack Robert
Thompson, an insurance agent and World War

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.640
I veteran.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.289
Thompson’s father, however, suffered from
myasthenia gravis, a debilitating neuromuscular

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.100
disease, and passed away when Thompson was
just fourteen years of age.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.819
After the loss, Virginia Thompson delved into
heavy alcoholism and Hunter followed suit.

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:12.869
Beyond heavy drinking, during his senior year
of high school, Thompson was arrested as an

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.520
accessory to an armed robbery and was sentenced
to sixty days in the Kentucky Jefferson county

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.520
jail.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.520
While imprisoned, the superintendent of his
high school denied him permission to take

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.619
his final examinations, and subsequently,
Thompson failed to graduate.

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.599
Thompson received an early release on the
condition that he would join the United States

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:31.599
Air Force.

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:35.689
Before leaving Kentucky, he purchased a case
of beer and spitefully threw each bottle one

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.130
by one through the windows of the superintendent’s
house.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.389
After being initially rejected by the Air
Force’s aviation program, Thompson transferred

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:51.849
to Eglin Air Force Base in the Florida panhandle
in 1956 where he was reassigned to electronics.

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:55.679
Shortly after, he began paving the way for
his future journalism career by attending

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.259
night classes at Florida State University.

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.539
As a former sports enthusiast, Thompson also
talked his way into a sports editor position

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.529
for The Command Courier, the base’s onsite
publication, after fabricating stories about

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:09.450
his prior experience in the field.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.390
In an interview with The Paris Review by Douglas
Brinkley and Terry McDonell, Thompson describes

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.750
how he learned the fundamentals of journalism:
“I went to the base library and found three

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.860
books on journalism.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.189
I stayed there reading them until it closed.

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:23.189
Basic journalism.

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:27.069
I learned about headlines, leads: who, when,
what, where, that sort of thing.

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.620
I barely slept that night.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.709
This was my ticket to ride, my ticket to get
out of that damn place.”

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.989
Despite the military’s policy about employment
off campus, Thompson defied protocol and began

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.790
writing for a local paper called The Playground
News in Fort Walton Beach, Florida.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.049
To quote Thompson, “I’d put things in
the local paper that I couldn’t put in the

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:46.080
base paper.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.640
Really inflammatory shit.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.450
The Air Force got very angry about it.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.019
I was constantly doing things that violated
regulations.”

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.109
In one instance, Thompson wrote about Arthur
Godfrey, a popular radio broadcaster who had

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:02.330
been invited to the base for a firepower demonstration,
but instead Thompson covered how Godfrey had

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.129
been previously caught illegally shooting
animals from the air in Alaska: “The base

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.930
commander told me: ‘Goddamn it, son, why
did you have to write about Arthur Godfrey

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:11.930
that way?’”

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.920
After multiple instances of insubordination,
now a recurrent theme for Thompson, it was

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.099
no surprise that in 1957 his commanding officer,
Col. William S. Evans, discharged him early.

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.829
What was a surprise was that it was an honorable
discharge.

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.560
To quote Col. Evans concerning the discharge,
“In summary, this airman, although talented,

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.969
will not be guided by policy.”

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:35.299
Although there were no beer bottles thrown
in the direction of the colonel, or jet fuel

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:40.030
leaked from the airplanes and set ablaze,
Thompson did concoct a fictionalized press

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.959
release that was actually published in The
Command Courier through which his comedic

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.499
hyperbole shines.

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:50.060
He writes, “An apparently uncontrollable
iconoclast, Thompson was discharged today

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.459
after one of the most hectic and unusual Air
Force careers in recent history.”

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:00.709
In 1959, Thompson relocated to New York City
where he audited courses at Columbia University.

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:06.219
He acquired a position as a copy boy for Time
where he took in $51 a week in wages (about

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:07.599
$408 today).

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.200
However, it wasn’t long before he was fired
for insubordination.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.750
Shortly after, he began reporting for The
Middletown Daily Record in Middletown, New

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.870
York, but his employment didn’t last long
there either; he was fired for destroying

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.930
an office candy machine and arguing with a
local restaurant owner who happened to be

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.840
the paper’s main advertiser.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.360
In 1961, Thompson began a peregrination across
the country.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.020
He settled down in Big Sur, California to
work on two novels, Prince Jellyfish and The

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.310
Rum Diary (the latter remained untouched until
rediscovered by actor Johnny Depp who had

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.139
been living in Thompson’s basement.

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:44.169
Depp encouraged Thompson to revisit the novel
and it was finally published in 1998).

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.300
During the same year, a group of religious
cultists founded their institution near his

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.300
property.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.389
To try to get rid of them, Thompson fastened
the head of a wild boar to the group’s front

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.960
door and hung the entrails around the rear
view mirror of one of the member’s vehicles.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.750
In 1962, Thompson served as a correspondent
in South America for The National Observer,

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.710
formerly a Dow Jones-owned weekly publication,
as well as reported for the Brazil Herald

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.460
in Rio de Janeiro, the nation’s sole English-written
publication.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.960
While there, Thompson had acquired, for unknown
reasons, a pet monkey.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.080
Tragically, the monkey died after reportedly
leaping, or at least falling, off the hotel

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.490
balcony where Thompson was staying.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.490
(See: Do Non-Human Animals Commit Suicide?)

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.949
It is unclear whether the monkey had an alcohol
issue prior to the unofficial adoption.

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:26.490
However, it would seem the monkey did partake
from Thompson’s stash.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.139
Friend and travel author Robert W. Bone commented
by saying, “Everyone figured the monkey,

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.580
being an alcoholic, had the DTs (Delirium
Tremens).”

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.880
After leaving Brazil in 1964, Thompson returned
to California where he continued to work for

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.500
the National Observer and was assigned to
examine the suicide of Ernest Hemingway in

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.750
Ketchum, Idaho.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.849
During his investigation, Thompson stole a
pair of elk antlers that hung above Hemingway’s

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.470
door seeing them as a ceremonious and posthumous
bequeathal.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.169
However, even his stay with the National Observer
was short-lived.

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:59.420
After a disagreement with his editor, who
had refused to publish Thompson’s review

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.389
on Tom Wolfe’s The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake
Streamline Baby, Thompson quit and moved to

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:09.470
San Francisco to work for The Spyder, an alternative
and underground Berkeley paper, submerging

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.520
himself into the pervasive drug and hippie
lifestyle.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.919
At this point, The Nation hired Thompson to
cover the outlaw motorcycle gang Hell’s

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:21.069
Angels, who had permeated the California scene
in the 1950s and 1960s.

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:27.139
After the article, The Motorcycle Gangs: Losers
and Outsiders, was published in 1965 and began

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:32.800
reaping vast attention, Thompson began riding,
partying, and living among the notorious group,

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.949
gathering information for his soon-to-be-hit
Hell’s Angels: A Strange and Terrible Saga.

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:41.830
Thompson made no secret of the fact that he
was a journalist working on a book featuring

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.729
the Angels while he was with them, something
they surprisingly didn’t mind, and even

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:47.150
were quite open with him.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.330
However, at one point, the gang severely beat
Thompson.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.110
There are conflicting accounts as to why this
happened, but the general story is that it

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:59.199
had something to do with a comment made by
Thompson about Hell’s Angel “Junkie George.”

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:03.580
Junkie was beating his wife, and Thompson
reportedly stated of this, “Only a punk

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.889
beats his wife,” drawing the ire of the
Angels around at the time, who he later stated

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:10.009
were none of the ones he was close to.

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:14.509
The publication in 1966 was the beginning
of Thompson’s personal and immersive dive

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:16.889
into finding his voice within journalism.

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:21.580
He discarded all the detached and unbiased
journalistic conventions and instead explored

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.389
his own baptismal plunge into a world of contrarianism,
with himself as the central figure.

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:27.790
This style later became known as gonzo journalism.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:32.110
More specifically, Thompson stated that gonzo
journalism is a style of reporting that bases

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:36.879
itself on William Faulkner’s idea “that
the best fiction is far more true than any

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:39.980
kind of journalism and the best journalists
have always know this.”

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:46.379
In 1970, he wrote The Kentucky Derby is Decadent
and Depraved, an article published by Scanlan’s

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:47.580
Monthly magazine.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.610
Although some critics claim that Hell’s
Angels signified the start of his gonzo journalism,

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:55.650
the Kentucky Derby piece is generally considered
more representative of the style.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:59.789
However, according to Thompson, Hell’s Angels
was the instrumental key to his calling as

00:07:59.789 --> 00:08:05.680
a vagabond and pioneer journalist: “Hell’s
Angels all of a sudden proved to me that,

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.250
Holy Jesus, maybe I can do this.”

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:12.810
As to the name of this offshoot of the 1960s
“New Journalism” trend, this is credited

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:17.969
to the then editor of the Boston Globe Sunday
Magazine, Bill Cardoso, who wrote to Thompson

00:08:17.969 --> 00:08:22.729
concerning the Kentucky Derby piece stating,
“This is it, this is pure Gonzo.

00:08:22.729 --> 00:08:25.610
If this is a start, keep rolling.”

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:29.669
Thompson liked the word as a name for this
style of journalism and adopted it.

00:08:29.669 --> 00:08:33.750
As to how Cardoso came up with it, it has
been variously stated it was slang for the

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:37.780
“last man standing” among a group of binge
drinkers; that it was slang for “bizarre”;

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:42.380
or that it was borrowed from the 1960 song
by James Booker, “Gonzo.”

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.210
Whatever the origin of the name, Thompson
himself first used it in his most notable

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:51.210
work, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, a story
which he sarcastically quipped is “a vile

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:53.980
epitaph for the Drug Culture of the Sixties.”

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:58.540
This drug-addled and psychotic adventure during
the uprising of drug criminalization first

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:05.140
appeared as a series in Rolling Stone in 1971
and then became a published book in 1972.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:08.820
Thompson was inspired to write the book while
he was on assignment for Sports Illustrated

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:15.220
to write a 250-word caption for the Mint 400,
a desert off-road race in Las Vegas.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:19.030
Thompson himself concluded that the book was
a failure, but not in terms of success or

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:23.440
abhorrence towards his own work, but a failure
in that his initial goal was to script the

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.000
entire Vegas journey in one unedited notebook
and publish it.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.290
This, he states, would have been true gonzo
journalism.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:34.130
In retrospect, Thompson acknowledged that
in order to have achieved his goal he would

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:39.560
have had to be the director, producer, cameraman,
and lead actor all at the same time to pull

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.800
off his story correctly.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.920
Instead, he reworked the piece, taking liberties
to create scenes where he had been heavily

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:49.770
intoxicated, as well as precautions to protect
the identities of certain individuals for

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:50.770
their security.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:54.890
He also played around with the chronology
of certain events, changing a month’s time

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:56.370
to a mere few days.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:00.880
Towards the end of his career and life, Thompson
resided at Owl Farm, his compound in Woody

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.270
Creek, Colorado.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:05.590
After writing several other successful books
such as Fear and Loathing on the Campaign

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:10.980
Trail ’72 and covering other political and
social issue stories, Thompson came full circle

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:16.340
as a writer, working for ESPN covering sports
in his typical frenetic, poetic style starting

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.510
in 2000.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:22.670
This all ended in February of 2005 when Thompson
shot himself in the head in his home at Owl

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:23.670
Farm.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:26.630
While some conspiracy theorists contend he
was actually killed due to, at the time, working

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:31.410
on a piece on the terrorist attacks on 9/11,
it should be noted that his grandson and daughter-in-law

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:35.600
were in the room next to him when he died
and reported nothing suspicious leading up

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.700
to the suicide.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:41.290
He was also talking on the phone to his wife,
Anita, a mere few seconds before he shot himself.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.640
She even heard him cock the gun, but assumed
the sound she heard was him hitting a typewriter

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.830
key- getting back to work after he set the
phone down, so she hung up.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.620
A note written by Thompson served as something
of a suicide letter.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.470
He inscribed, “No More Games.

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:52.470
No More Bombs.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:53.470
No More Walking.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:54.470
No More Fun.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:55.470
No More Swimming.

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:56.470
67.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.670
That is 17 years past 50.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.130
17 more than I needed or wanted.

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.130
Boring.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:03.360
I am always bitchy.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.040
No Fun — for anybody.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.040
67.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.440
You are getting Greedy.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.050
Act your (old) age.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:11.040
Relax — This won’t hurt.”

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:16.020
On August 20, 2005, a private funeral was
arranged for all of Thompson’s closest friends

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.020
and family.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:21.940
His ashes were fired from a cannon on top
of a 153-foot tower to the music of Norman

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:26.130
Greenbaum’s “Spirit in the Sky” and
Bob Dylan’s “Mr. Tambourine Man.”

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:30.650
The sendoff was accompanied by a great display
of fireworks and completely funded by Johnny

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:34.920
Depp who previously portrayed Thompson in
the screen adaption of Fear and Loathing in

00:11:34.920 --> 00:12:03.540
Las Vegas, and, later in 2011, The 

00:12:03.540 --> 00:14:03.240
Rum Diary.
