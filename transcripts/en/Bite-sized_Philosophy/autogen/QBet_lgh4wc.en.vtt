00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
What would be a practical approach to developing your shadow

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.500
Well that's a good one

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.920
Let's do a little review of Jungian Psychology.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.220
The first thing is, if you want to know about this

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.300
The proper source is Carl Jung's collected works volume 9

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.720
And there's two parts to volume 9
A and B published as separate texts

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.720
And volume 9 is called "archetypes of the collective unconscious"

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.340
The other one is called Ion

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.400
In archetypes of the collective unconscious there's a good discussion of the persona and the shadow

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.560
The persona you could say is...

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.600
A good way of thinking about it
You know, you watch all those romcoms

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.940
Where there's always some kind of a beta male guy who is being real friendly

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.440
And is always failing miserably with women because basically he's lying to himself and to them

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.040
He's a persona

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.360
And a persona is the face you show to the world when you're trying to pretend

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.300
To convince yourself and other's that, I'd say, harmless, but we could say a good person

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.760
But a good person isn't harmless, a good person is capable of

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.920
Well, maybe a good person is capable of anything

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.000
But is willing to hold that in abeyance

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.820
I read this interesting commentary a little while ago on a statement by christ in the new testament

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.660
The statement generally interpreted is that the meek shall inherit the earth

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.420
I was looking up the multiple translations of the word meek

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.340
Meek is actually derived from a Greek word of course

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.840
Because the bible, at least some of the original forms of the original bible were in Greek

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.900
And that word didn't exactly mean meek, it meant something like

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:01.500
Those who have weapons and the ability to use them but determine to keep them sheathed will inherit the world

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.940
And that means that people who are capable of force, let's say

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.360
But decide not to use it are in the proper moral position

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.540
Nietzsche commented a fair bit on that too

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.040
He thought of most morality as cowardes
Not because morality itself was cowardes

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.700
But because most people who are cowards disguise their cowardes as morality

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.700
And they claim that their harmlessness, which is actually a consequence of their fear

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.500
And inability to be harmfull, say, or to be dangerous is actually a sign of their moral integrity

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.160
And that's a really bad idea

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.160
If you're an ex-murderer but you don't have an axe, that doesn't mean that you're moral

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.120
So that's the persona

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.720
And the persona is the mask that you wear, and that's what persona means

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.300
It's the mask that you wear to convince yourself and the world that you're not a terrible monster

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.820
So that when you look at yourself in the mirror you don't have to run away screaming

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.640
And you might think, well, that's a bit of an overstatement

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.880
But Jung was very interested in phenomena such as

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.700
The psychological phenomena that would characterise the actions of someone who might be

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.300
An Auschwitz camp guard for example

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.980
That's a pretty monstrous form of behaviour

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.140
The thing about Auschwitz camp guards is that there's no reason to assume

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.520
Really, that they were much different than normal people

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.100
Now there would have been exceptions obviously

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.220
And what that means is that, perhaps you too can be an Auschwitz camp guard

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.560
And perhaps you would even derive some enjoyment out of it

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.540
And you might think not, but you shouldn't think not so quickly

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.840
What that also implies is that if you could see what that meant

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.580
When you looked in the mirror and looked at yourself

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.860
You might run away screaming

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.540
Because you'd have a revelation of just exactly what a human being is capable of

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.420
And that's a very unpleasant revelation and also one of the things that stops people from being enlightened

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.960
Because that revelation of the evil of the self is part of the journey to enlightenment, and an early part

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.740
Now the shadow would be all the parts of the personality that the persona rejects

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.000
And that might be the aggressive elements

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.800
Certainly that's the case for people who are hyper agreeable

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.840
There's two pathways to the development of the shadow

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.980
And they're tightly allied with one another

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.980
The fundamental pathway is truth

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.400
And that's to face the bitter truth about yourself

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.620
To break that down more particularly you might think about that

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.040
As the capacity to observe your own resentment

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.200
You're going to be resentful and bitter in many situations

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.100
Because you don't get what you want

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.640
And if you watch that resentment and bitterness you'll see that

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.900
It produces fantasies that can be unbelievably dark

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.900
And that can be very frightning

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.400
You might not want to admit to yourself that you're actually capable of having fantasies like that

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.760
Or impulses like that or aggressive feelings like that

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:11.300
If those aggressive feelings and impulses and fantasies are integrated into your character

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.020
It's like you're opening up a dialogue with a part of yourself that can be very forceful and strong

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.280
And dangerous
And it's really usefull to be dangerous

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.560
Because if you can be dangerous, you often don't have to be

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.940
And it's often weak people, for example it's weak men who generally rape

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.900
That's a very common occurrence

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.140
And it's a very violent act, but it's borne out of weakness not out of strength, that's for sure

00:05:37.585 --> 00:05:40.500
You attend to your resentment honestly

00:05:40.505 --> 00:05:42.675
And you observe yourself and what you're actually like

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.965
You gotta pay attention as if you don't know yourself

00:05:44.965 --> 00:05:49.100
As if you might harbor hidden devils
And then maybe they'll emerge

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.740
Jung also felt that sort of embedded inside the shadow were the contrasexual tendencies

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.180
And so for example

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.735
Sometimes you see people are well developed

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.560
Men, let's say, and we can also talk about women in this regard

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.420
Men who've integrated their shadow also often develop a kind of peculiar grace

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.800
That would be a consequence of not only allowing their aggressive side to step forward

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.000
But also their feminine and compassionate side

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.100
That they may have kept squelcht because of embarrassment about it

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.440
Or because they may have been harassed for being weak or any number of things

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.940
But the practical approach for developing your shadow, I would say

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.800
Is to contemplate and consider your resentment

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.520
And notice what it says

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.500
Because your resentment will also tell you what you have to say

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.440
So look at what happened at Google this weekend

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.675
Jame Damore wrote that memo and you can imagine he was pretty angry

00:06:41.675 --> 00:06:43.465
And perhaps even some what resentful

00:06:43.495 --> 00:06:45.105
at having to attend that diversity seminar

00:06:45.105 --> 00:06:48.145
I am really just using it as an example

00:06:48.145 --> 00:06:50.665
But, what he did was to decide that that man

00:06:50.665 --> 00:06:53.215
he had something he had to say

00:06:53.215 --> 00:06:55.605
Look at the consequences of that, man

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:56.760
It is absolutely unbelievable

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.960
And so you know if you are feeling oppressed at work or

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.580
You are oppressed in your life

00:07:01.585 --> 00:07:03.355
Or you are oppressing yourself

00:07:03.355 --> 00:07:05.375
Then you gonna notice that you are feeling oppressed

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.440
Then you have to notice that you are feeling resentful and angry

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.235
and bitter and maybe even like Cain

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.900
The story of Cain enable

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.740
Because Cain is the sort of archetypal  bitter man

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.660
And you have to decide what is you need to do in order to remove from yourself that bitterness

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.120
And that usually means that there is something you have to say

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.300
And you have to say it

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.340
Because your soul depends on it

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.920
And it is not only your soul that depends on it

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.540
I would like to say the fate of the world depends on it

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:35.400
Because you might be wrong and then you should be straight out, or maybe you are just being wining,

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.400
You have to talk to somebody about that

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.920
Or maybe you are actually detecting something wrong

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.540
Some tearing is directed towards you and another people

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.380
And it is like your moral obligation to speak up about it

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.000
And so many world places become toxic used the terrible cliche

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.740
Because the people in them won't speak up for what they actually want

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.020
Or they speak up too late and then they are all twisted up about it

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.540
And you know they torturing other people

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.580
Because they are so unhappy and so forth and so on

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.580
So

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:07.020
Practical approach for developing shadow fundamentally is radical honesty

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:12.000
Jung said that genuine moral effort was a good substitute for psychotherapy.
