00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.019
In this lesson we'll learn how faults,
errors, and failures are related to each

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:09.910
other and how redundancy can help us
prevent faults from becoming failures.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.740
This lesson also concludes the second
part of our computer architecture course

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.250
where we can learn how
the memory hierarchy works.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.850
The final part of this course will focus

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.090
on what we need to do in computer
architecture to get correct and

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.650
efficient execution in multi
threaded and multi core processors.
