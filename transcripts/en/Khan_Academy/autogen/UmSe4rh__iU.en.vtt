00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:01.750
 Here I have a square 

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:05.990
 with a height, say, 1 meter. 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.250
 This is the height here. 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.990
 It's 1 meter. 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.290
 Let's say his width is also 1 meter. 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.450
 I'm talking about the size of the whole square, 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.250
 not just the colored part. 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.320
 This is also 1 meter. 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.990
 How many will be the face of the whole square, 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.490
 and not just the colored part? On the whole square? 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.620
 Okay, the common face 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.350
 will be equal to 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.320
 height in width. 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.320
 1 meter 1 meter. 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.920
 1 in 1 of course is 1, 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.450
 meters per meter 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.050
 we can record as a square meter 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.690
 or square meter as you choose. 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.280
 With this in this way, 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.150
 to focus on the colored part. 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.790
 Let's think about it. 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.090
 The colored part 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.650
 is equal to how much? 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.010
 I recommend that you stop the video 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.450
 and try to understand yourself. 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.020
 Something you might think is, 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.690
 that whole face, our whole square 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.050
 is divided into these same rectangles. 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.590
 One way to think about it, 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.720
 is what is the face of each of these rectangles? 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.390
 For example, what is the person 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.710
 this rectangle here? 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.590
 To understand this, we can ask ourselves 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.090
 what part is this from the whole? 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.850
 So we need to understand 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.550
 how many such rectangles 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.230
 the whole thing is divided. 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.420
 We can try to count them, 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.570
 or say, 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.220
 I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.650
 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 columns, 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.890
 and each column has 1, 2, 3, 4, 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.150
 5, 6, 7. 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.050
 So we have 10 columns of 7 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.450
 or a total of 70 such rectangles, 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.850
 which divide our whole 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.770
 in 70 equal parts. 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.650
 This one here 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.220
 is 1/70 from the entire face. 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.850
 So 1/70 of the square meter, 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.850
 which of course will be equal to 1/70 of the square meter. 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.920
 This is one of them. 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.020
 Only one of these rectangles. 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.410
 If we want to know what the color area is, 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.820
 we can count how many of these rectangles there are 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.510
 in it and see that these are 1, 2, 3, 4, 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.620
 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 columns 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.220
 of 1, 2, 3. 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.320
 So 27 of these rectangles, 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.550
 of these identical rectangles in the colored part. 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.150
 The colored part will be 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.150
 we have 27 of these rectangles and each of them 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.250
 has a face 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.750
 1/70 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.250
 of the square meter. 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.650
 What does this give us? 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.920
 This tells us that the face of the colored 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.550
 part will be equal to 27/70. 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.820
 27 on 1/70 will be equal to 27/70. 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.820
 27/70 square meters 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.320
 and we are ready. 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.520
 I want to tell you, 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.790
 that there are several ways, 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.350
 on which we can solve the problem. 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.420
 Another way to solve it 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.120
 is to figure out what the dimensions are 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.850
 of the colored part. 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.820
 For example ... 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.050
 For example, what is the height 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.920
 only the colored part? 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.790
 Only this height, 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.820
 and I recommend that you stop the video 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:28.850
 and try to think about the height, 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.840
 it will be some kind of liver. 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.420
 Okay, if we move vertically, 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.720
 we divide this meter. 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.550
 Divide the meter into 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.150
 I will do it in a different way. 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.690
 We split it into 1, 2, 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.220
 3, 4, 5, 6, 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.350
 7 equal parts. 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.720
 This may be a bit confusing, 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.820
 the way I drew it. 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.610
 You can see it if you look ... 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.370
 Actually let me use a brighter color. 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.290
 We have... 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.420
 It's hard for me to choose a color. 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.750
 Okay, here's how. 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.290
 We have 1 here. 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.120
 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.550
 7 equal parts to which we have split this meter. 

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.010
 The height of the colored part is 3 of them. 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.250
 That height here 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.450
 this height is 3/7 of the total height, 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.620
 and the whole height is 1 meter. 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.090
 That's 3/7 of the meter. 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.550
 By the same logic, what is the width? 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.950
 What will be the width? 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.620
 We can see that the whole meter 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.420
 is divided into 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.720
 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 equal parts, 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.920
 it will be a tenth. 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.220
 This distance will be tenth. 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.320
 Let me make it in a different color. 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.090
 This distance here will be tenth, 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.150
 but how many dozens represent 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.350
 the width of the green area? 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.650
 Let's see we have 1/10, 2/10, 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.190
 3/10, 4/10, 5/10, 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.720
 6/10, 7/10, 8/10, 9/10. 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.720
 This width is 9/10 of the entire length, 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.590
 which is 1 meter, means 9/10 of the meter. 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.350
 To find the area, 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.920
 we can multiply the width to height 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.650
 or height along the width. 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.620
 We can say, I'll write it down again. 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.390
 This colored part. 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.250
 For the colored part instead of this way 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.320
 we can say that we have 3/7 of the meter. 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.950
 So 3/7 meters 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.250
 and multiply it by our width, 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.620
 only for the colored part, 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.650
 which is 9/10 from the meter. 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.390
 9/10 of the meter. 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.320
 How much will it give us? 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.950
 This will be equal to 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.450
 the meter per meter is equal 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.350
 per square meter, which we want, 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.720
 then we can multiply the numerators, 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.350
 then the denominators. 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.750
 3 in 9 will give us 27, 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.650
 and 7 in 10 will give us 70. 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.350
 Just what we got before. 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.150
 27/70 of the square meter. 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.390
 Let me write this a little more orderly. 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.320
 27 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.090
 27/70 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.390
 of the square meter. 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.890
 You may want to think why it's coming out exactly, 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.020
 no matter how we did it. 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.620
 Note that 3 and 9 are numerators. 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.650
 This means how many rows and columns we have 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.750
 of these small rectangles. 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.150
 A 7 and 10 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.490
 is to understand exactly how small the rectangle we have. 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.520
 It's like saying 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.620
 3 by 9 is the number of rectangles we have. 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.750
 A 7 in 10 is 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.120
 part of the whole, 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.820
 which represents each of these rectangles, 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.650
 and that's what we did here. 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.790
 In both ways, you will get a true answer, 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.800
 but I want you to think why.
