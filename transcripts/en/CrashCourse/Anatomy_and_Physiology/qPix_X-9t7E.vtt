00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.060
This morning was a typical morning for me.
I woke up thinking about that dream that I

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.629
keep having about the guy in the sloth suit,
and then I got dressed because I was cold,

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:11.060
and then I made some toast with butter ‘cause
I was hungry, and then I let the dog out ‘cause

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.990
she was whining and staring and me, and then
I made some tea but I let it cool off before

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.910
I drank it because I burned my mouth yesterday.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.360
In addition to being just part of my morning
ritual, all of these actions are examples

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.520
of what my nervous system does for me.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.680
The weirdo dream, the sensation of cold air
and hot tea, deciding what to put on the toast,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.630
going to the door at the sound of the dog
-- all that was processed and executed by

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.649
electrical and chemical signals to and from
nerve cells.

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.300
You can’t oversell the importance of the
nervous system.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.300
It controls ALL THE THINGS!

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.449
All your organs, all your physiological and
psychological reactions, even your body’s

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.469
other major controlling force, the endocrine
system, bows down before the nervous system.

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.929
There is no “you” without it. There is
no “me” without it. There’s no dogs

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:57.469
without it. There’s no animals. There’s
no -- there’s no things -- there’s things.

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.940
It’s important. That’s why we’re dedicating
the next several episodes to the fundamentals

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.570
of the nervous system -- its anatomy and organization,
how it communicates, and what happens when

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.700
it gets damaged.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.740
This is mission control, people!

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.460
Even though pretty much all animals -- except
super simple ones like sponges -- have a nervous

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:26.890
system, ours is probably the most distinctive
feature of our species.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.509
From writing novels, to debating time travel,
to juggling knives -- all of your thoughts,

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.509
and actions, and emotions can be boiled down
into three principal functions -- sensory

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.640
input, integration, and motor output.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.750
Imagine a spider walking onto your bare knee.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.049
The sensory receptors on your skin detect
those eight little legs -- that information

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.240
is your sensory input.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.659
From there your nervous system processes that
input, and decides what should be done about

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.520
it. That’s called integration -- like, should
I be all zen about it and just let it walk

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.319
over me, or should I not be zen and freak
out and run around screaming, “SPIDER!”?

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.679
Your hand lashing out to remove the spider,
and maybe your accompanying banshee scream,

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.640
is the motor output -- the response that occurs
when your nervous system activates certain

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.560
parts of your body.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.980
As you can imagine, it takes a highly integrated
system to detect, process, and act on data

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.600
like this, all the time.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.620
And when we talk about the nervous system,
we’re really talking about several levels

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.330
of organization, starting with two main parts:
the central and peripheral nervous systems.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.140
The central nervous system is your brain and
spinal cord -- the main control center. It’s

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.500
what decided to remove the spider, and gave
the order to your hand.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.230
Your peripheral system is composed of all
the nerves that branch off from the brain

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.200
and spine that allow your central nervous system
to communicate with the rest of your body.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.600
And since its job is communication, your peripheral
system is set up to work in both directions:

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.080
The sensory, or afferent division is what
picks up sensory stimuli -- like, “hey,

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.900
there’s an arachnid on you” -- and slings
that information to the brain.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.990
Your motor, or efferent division is the part
that sends directions from your brain to the

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.380
muscles and glands -- like, “hey hand part,
how ‘bout you do something about that spider.”

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.160
The motor division also includes the somatic,
or voluntary nervous system, that rules your

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.600
skeletal muscle movement, and the autonomic,
or involuntary nervous system, that keeps

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.200
your heart beating, and your lungs breathing,
and your stomach churning.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.930
And finally, that autonomic system, too, has
its own complementary forces. Its sympathetic

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.220
division mobilizes the body into action and
gets it all fired up, like “Gah! SPIDER!”

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.280
-- while the parasympathetic division relaxes
the body and talks it down… Like, “it

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.570
wasn’t a black widow or anything; you’re
fine, breathe!”

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.680
So that’s the organization of your nervous
system in a nutshell. But no matter what part

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.450
you’re talking about, they’re all made
up of mainly nervous tissue, which you’ll

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.530
remember is densely packed with cells.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.780
Maybe less than 20 percent of that tissue consists of
extracellular space. Everything else? Cells.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.180
The type of cells you’ve most likely heard
of are the neurons, or nerve cells, which

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.850
respond to stimuli and transmit signals.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.030
These cells get all the publicity -- they’re
the ones that we’re always thanking every

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.200
time we ace an exam or think up a snappy comeback
to an argument.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.270
But these wise guys really account for just
a small part of your nervous tissue because

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.630
they are surrounded and protected by gaggles
of neuroglia, or glial cells.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.610
Once considered just the scaffolding or glue
that held neurons together, we now know that

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.590
our different glial cell types serve many
other important functions, and they make up

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.060
about half of the mass of your brain, outnumbering
their neuron colleagues by about 10 to 1.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.850
Star-shaped astrocytes are found in your central
nervous system and are your most abundant

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.030
and versatile glial cells. They anchor neurons
to their blood supply, and govern the exchange

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.450
of materials between neurons and capillaries.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.140
Also in your central nervous system are your
protective microglial cells -- they’re smaller

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.670
and kinda thorny-looking, and act as the main
source of immune defense against invading

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.020
microorganisms in the brain and spinal cord.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.260
Your ependymal cells line cavities in your
brain and spinal cord and create, secrete,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.820
and circulate cerebrospinal fluid that fills
those cavities and cushions those organs.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.470
And finally your central nervous system’s
oligodendrocytes wrap around neurons, producing

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.030
an insulating barrier called the myelin sheath.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.930
Now, over in your peripheral nervous system,
there are just two kinds of glial cells. Satellite

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.430
cells do mainly in the peripheral system what
astrocyte cells do in the central system -- they

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.560
surround and support neuron cell bodies. While
Schwann cells are similar to your oligodendrocytes,

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.030
in that they wrap around axons and make that
insulating myelin sheath.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.490
So don’t sell your glial cells short -- they’re
in the majority, cell-wise. But of course

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.950
when it comes to passing tests and winning
arguments, most of the heavy lifting is done

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.660
by the neurons. And they’re not all the
same -- they’re actually highly specialized,

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.880
coming in all shapes and sizes -- from tiny
ones in your brain to the ones that run the

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.389
entire length of your leg.

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.570
But they do all share three super-cool things
in common.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.700
Number 1. They’re some of the longest-lived
cells in your body. There’s a lot of debate

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.630
right now about whether you’re actually
born with all of the neurons you’ll ever

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.950
have, but some research suggests that, at
least in your brain’s cerebral cortex, your

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.880
neurons will live as long as you do.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.450
Cool fact number 2. They are irreplaceable.
It’s a good thing that they have such longevity,

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.280
because your neurons aren’t like your constantly-
renewing skin cells. Most neurons are amitotic, so

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.610
once they take on their given roles in the
nervous system, they lose their ability to

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.470
divide. So take care of ‘em!

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:10.389
And number 3. They have huge appetites. Like
a soccer-playing teenager, neurons have a

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:15.380
crazy-high metabolic rate. They need a steady
and abundant supply of glucose and oxygen,

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.090
and about 25 percent of the calories that
you take in every day are consumed by your

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.260
brain’s activity.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.360
Along with all these wonderful qualities,
your neurons also share the same basic structure.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.190
The soma, or cell body, is the neuron’s
life support. It’s got all the normal cell

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.290
goodies like a nucleus, and DNA, mitochondria,
ribosomes, cytoplasm.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.550
The bushy, branch-like things projecting out
from the soma are dendrites. They’re the

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:43.280
listeners -- they pick up messages, news, gossip from
other cells and convey that information to the cell body.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.800
The neuron’s axon, meanwhile, is like the
talker. This long extension, or fiber, can

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.400
be super short, or run a full meter from your
spine down to your ankle. We’ve got a few

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.440
different axon layouts in our body, but in
the most abundant type of neuron, the axons

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.070
transmit electrical impulses away from the
cell body to other cells.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.370
For us students of biology, it’s a good
thing that nerve cells aren’t all identical.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:08.750
Because their differences in structure are one of
the ways that we tell them apart, and classify them.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.870
The main feature we look at is how many processes
extend out from the cell body.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:17.000
A “process” in this case being a projecting
part of an organic structure.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.300
99 percent of all your neurons are multipolar
neurons, with three or more processes sticking

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.900
out from the soma -- including one axon, and
a bunch of dendrites.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:31.380
Bipolar neurons have two processes -- an axon
and a single dendrite -- extending from opposite

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.150
sides of the cell body. They’re pretty rare,
found only in a few special sensory places,

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:36.550
like the retina of your eye.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.060
Unipolar neurons, on the other hand, have
just one process, and are found mostly in

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.400
your sensory receptors.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.979
So, if you ever find yourself probing around
someone’s nervous tissue, remember these

00:07:44.979 --> 00:07:47.530
three terms to help you figure out what you’re
looking at.

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:51.290
But because we’re talking physiology here
as well as anatomy, we have to classify these

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:55.550
cells in terms of their function, and that
basically comes down to which way an impulse

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.979
travels through a neuron in relation to the
brain and spine.

00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:03.419
Our sensory, or afferent, neurons pick up
messages and transmit impulses from sensory

00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:08.779
receptors in say, the skin or internal organs,
and send them toward the central nervous system.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.720
Most sensory neurons are unipolar.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.930
Motor, or efferent, neurons do the opposite
-- they’re mostly multipolar, and transmit

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:19.449
impulses away from the central nervous system
and out to your body’s muscles and glands.

00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:24.340
And then there are interneurons, or association
neurons, which live in the central nervous

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.840
system and transmit impulses between those
sensory and motor neurons. Interneurons are

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.810
the most abundant of your body’s neurons
and are mostly multipolar.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:35.389
OK! It’s applied knowledge time! Let’s
review everything we’ve learned so far in

00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:37.259
terms of that spider on your knee.

00:08:37.259 --> 00:08:41.469
Those eight creeping legs first activate your
unipolar sensory neurons in the skin on your

00:08:41.469 --> 00:08:46.069
knee, when they sense something crawling on
you. The signal travels up an axon wrapped

00:08:46.069 --> 00:08:52.019
in Schwann cells and into your spinal cord, where it
gets passed on to several multipolar interneurons.

00:08:52.019 --> 00:08:55.899
Now, some of those interneurons might send
a signal straight down a bunch of multipolar

00:08:55.899 --> 00:09:00.779
neurons to your quadriceps muscle on your
thigh, triggering you to kick your leg out

00:09:00.779 --> 00:09:02.410
before you even know what’s going on.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:06.660
Other interneurons will pass that signal to neurons
that carry it up your spinal cord to your brain.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.559
That’s where your body first recognizes
that thing as a spider, and the connections

00:09:10.559 --> 00:09:15.439
between neurons interpret and split the signal
so that you can either scream, and start swinging

00:09:15.439 --> 00:09:21.159
your arms wildly about...or...remain calm, and
with dignity remove the spider from your person.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.879
It’s all based on the connections between
neurons.

00:09:23.879 --> 00:09:26.859
Which brings me to a whole new question: How?

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:32.060
How in the name of Jean-Martin Charcot do
nerve cells use chemistry and electricity

00:09:32.069 --> 00:09:33.610
to communicate with each other?

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:37.619
It’s one of the most stupifyingly awesome
and complicated aspects of your nervous system,

00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:41.470
and basically of all life and it is what we
will cover in our next lesson.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:46.490
Today you learned how sensory input, integration,
and motor output of your nervous system basically

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:50.769
rules your world. We talked about how the
central and peripheral systems are organized,

00:09:50.769 --> 00:09:55.980
and what they do, and looked at the role of
different glial cells in nervous tissue function.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:00.920
We also looked at the role, anatomy, and function
of neuron types in the body, both structurally

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.400
and functionally, and how everything plays out
when you find a spider crawling on your skin.
