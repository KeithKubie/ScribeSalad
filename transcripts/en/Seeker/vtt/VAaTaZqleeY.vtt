00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.040
Let’s be real, guys, Neanderthals get a
bad rap.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.340
We think of them as primitive and less developed
than us humans with our smooth brow bones

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.599
and tall posture.

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.929
But the field of hominid development has been
telling us for some time now that this is

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.480
probably pretty far from the truth.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.199
And new research tells us that Neanderthals
could have been...just as sophisticated as

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.199
humans!

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:21.939
Why have we been wrong for so long?

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.439
A lot of our prejudices about neanderthals
come from our somewhat mistaken interpretation

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:27.849
of the fossil record.

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.460
When the first neanderthal skeleton was recorded
by scientists in the mid 1800s, the conclusion

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.550
they came to was it must have been a bowlegged
Slavic person whose brow seemed furrowed because

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.090
he was in a lot of pain.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.520
[incredulous hmmm face here]
Yeah, that’s how they explained the pronounced

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.350
brow on the skull they found.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.070
And nearly every neanderthal skeleton discovered
since then was marked by some gruesome injury

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.090
or violent cause of death, particularly around
the head and neck.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.449
A small sample a few years ago originally
found that significantly more Neanderthal

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.570
remains were marked by this kind of violence
than the other non-neanderthal species that

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.710
were alive at the same time.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.110
I dunno, maybe they just played a lot of football?

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.100
This seeming discrepancy between species led
the anthropological and paleontological communities

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.030
to guess that neanderthals must have been
different from the other hominids.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.930
They must have been more prone to violence,
which could have due to hunting large, dangerous

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.759
game...but some scientists also perpetuated
the idea that Neanderthals must have often

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.380
been in conflict with one another.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.259
That theory was tempting because it gives
us a logical explanation for why Neanderthals

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.490
aren’t around anymore and we are--maybe
they just had it harder and couldn’t hack

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.490
it.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.130
But this view of Neanderthals as brutish thugs
was building from already shaky place.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.060
William King was the first to think that maybe
these skeletons were an extinct form of human,

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.020
which was insightful of him, and he gave the
species their name.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.470
But then he kinda backtracked on that brilliance
when he compared our early relative’s skull

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.899
with its protruding brow to the skulls of
living humans.

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.149
This in itself isn’t bad practice, but coming
to conclusions about a whole group of people

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.830
because of their skull shape is a pseudoscience
called phrenology that was popular during

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.480
King’s time, and has been used in the past
to justify extremely racist and unscientific

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.880
ideas about the differences between humans.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.260
King’s opinion was that the Neanderthal
skulls were similar to the skulls of living

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.980
indigenous populations that he already deemed
to be ‘lesser’, and so he declared that

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.120
Neanderthals must have been very primitive
indeed.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.120
This first deliberate misunderstanding about
the character of these early upright mammals,

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.340
rooted in someone’s personal bias, has stuck
in the public mindset about Neanderthals,

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.570
perpetuated by the gaps in our data about
them and the popular representations of them

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.060
in the media.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.030
And the fact that we may not have looked at
or questioned the first ideas about Neanderthals

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.980
too hard until recently.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.730
But recent work challenges us to unstick those
assumptions from our brain...and provides

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.410
the science to back it up.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.720
As paleontology advances, we simply have so
many more skeletons and artifacts to work

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.660
with--there’s more of the picture to see.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.170
And the more we see, the more we realize that
our earlier ideas may have just been due to

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.170
sampling bias.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.290
A new study, the largest of its kind to date,
has looked at large samples of all kinds of

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.370
early hominids and come to the conclusion
that Neanderthals weren’t special--they

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.460
didn’t experience that much more violence
than any other early hominid...life back then

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.230
was pretty brutal for everyone.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.380
And this just adds to the chorus of evidence
that’s come out recently to combat the negative

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.020
view of our departed cousins.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.550
Thought Neanderthals were just banging rocks
together?

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.120
Experts now believe that Neanderthal tools
were just as complex as ours.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.960
In fact, early Neanderthal tools show a sophistication
that human tools don’t until humans migrated

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.460
to Neanderthal territory...indicating that
they probably shared that tool-making knowledge

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.460
with us!

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.640
The world’s oldest cave paintings were also
just discovered in modern-day Spain.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.540
The art dates back 65,000 years, well before
any of our human ancestors were hangin’

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.640
out there, meaning….it had to be the Neanderthals.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.740
Painting up a storm before we even arrived.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.720
If you’ve got grunting and pointing Neanderthals
in your head, then think again.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.440
They could probably talk like us and most
likely even had culture like ours.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.920
Recent work has revealed that they buried
their dead, intentionally and ritually--part

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.690
of a culture that also may have included decorating
themselves with brightly colored paints, feathers

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.690
and shell jewelry.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.160
And they also used medicinal plants to treat
their aches and pains, so...that’s sounding

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.700
pretty sophisticated to me.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.230
All in all, this shifting field is helping
us learn so much more about our past and our

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.960
fellow ancestors, and hopefully these insights
could give us some clues as to why the neanderthals

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.140
went extinct--which is still one history’s
biggest mysteries.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.400
All of this is also making us examine where
a lot of our scientific assumptions come from.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.750
It’s always good to look critically at why
a field has believed what it’s believed

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.750
for so long.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.800
And with areas of study where it’s just
impossible to see all the data, we have to

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.770
check ourselves and be careful not to fill
in the gaps with something just because of

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.150
an assumption or preconception we’ve had...especially
when the science starts to say otherwise.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.440
