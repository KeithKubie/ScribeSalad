00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.580

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.930

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.540
yourself and repeat them like mantras every day you wake up and look at yourself in the mirror.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.559
but you stopped being happy about it because your crush doesn't return your feelings or you couldn't enjoy your vacation
