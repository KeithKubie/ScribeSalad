lot of time talking to him about his

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920
lot of time talking to him about his
 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.250
lot of time talking to him about his
approach and it turns out that what he

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260
approach and it turns out that what he
 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.550
approach and it turns out that what he
did was he looked at the way all the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560
did was he looked at the way all the
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.850

then fast as you can that allowed slug

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650
then fast as you can that allowed slug
 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.649
then fast as you can that allowed slug
down some water swallow and then keep

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659
down some water swallow and then keep
 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.090
down some water swallow and then keep
going as fast again Hey look that I

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100
going as fast again Hey look that I
 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.140

thought is that really the right way to

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150
thought is that really the right way to
 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.609
thought is that really the right way to
solve that problem or to attack that

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619
solve that problem or to attack that
 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.370

challenge and he thought maybe but not

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380
challenge and he thought maybe but not
 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.410
challenge and he thought maybe but not
necessarily and so he decided to kind of

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420
necessarily and so he decided to kind of
 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.530
necessarily and so he decided to kind of
break it down and try to experiment from

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540
break it down and try to experiment from
 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.179
break it down and try to experiment from
top to bottom and in think like a freak

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189
top to bottom and in think like a freak
 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.600
top to bottom and in think like a freak
we write a lot about the need for

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610
we write a lot about the need for
 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.850
we write a lot about the need for
experimentation experimentation can give

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860
experimentation experimentation can give
 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.649
experimentation experimentation can give
great feedback great answers a lot of

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659
great feedback great answers a lot of
 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.850
great feedback great answers a lot of
people are scared of experimentation

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860
people are scared of experimentation
 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.630
people are scared of experimentation
because they think you have to be a

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640
because they think you have to be a
 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.030
because they think you have to be a
scientist or they're also scared of

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040
scientist or they're also scared of
 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.380
scientist or they're also scared of
because it means that you have to admit

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390
because it means that you have to admit
 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.760
because it means that you have to admit
that you don't know the answer a lot of

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770
that you don't know the answer a lot of
 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.459
that you don't know the answer a lot of
people like to assume they know the

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469
people like to assume they know the
 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.139
people like to assume they know the
solution to a problem when they don't

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149
solution to a problem when they don't
 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.179
solution to a problem when they don't
but experimentation can really you know

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189
but experimentation can really you know
 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.920
but experimentation can really you know
set you up to learn the real answer so

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930
set you up to learn the real answer so
 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.230
set you up to learn the real answer so
he tried a lot of different things not

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240
he tried a lot of different things not
 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.119
he tried a lot of different things not
all them worked many didn't he found

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129
all them worked many didn't he found
 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.010
all them worked many didn't he found
that if he broke the dog in two pieces

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020
that if he broke the dog in two pieces
 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.470
that if he broke the dog in two pieces
before he ate that would help just a

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480
before he ate that would help just a
 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.250
before he ate that would help just a
little bit

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260
little bit
 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.470
little bit
to start because he's first of all doing

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480
to start because he's first of all doing
 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.050
to start because he's first of all doing
one move with his hands that he doesn't

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060
one move with his hands that he doesn't
 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.369
one move with his hands that he doesn't
use mouth for so he's starting to speed

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379
use mouth for so he's starting to speed
 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:20.839
use mouth for so he's starting to speed
up there and then he found that he liked

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849
up there and then he found that he liked
 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.520
up there and then he found that he liked
to separate the dog from the bun and he

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530
to separate the dog from the bun and he
 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.259
to separate the dog from the bun and he
found that he could eat each faster that

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269
found that he could eat each faster that
 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.899
found that he could eat each faster that
way the dog actually goes down fairly

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909
way the dog actually goes down fairly
 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.300
way the dog actually goes down fairly
easy because it's dense and salty and

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310
easy because it's dense and salty and
 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.850
easy because it's dense and salty and
slick the bun it's actually airy and

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860
slick the bun it's actually airy and
 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.960
slick the bun it's actually airy and
kind of hard that's why they were hard

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970
kind of hard that's why they were hard
 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.280
kind of hard that's why they were hard
to chew together so then he found that

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290
to chew together so then he found that
 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.440
to chew together so then he found that
if he soaked the bun in warm water

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450
if he soaked the bun in warm water
 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.569
if he soaked the bun in warm water
before eating them and squeezed out the

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579
before eating them and squeezed out the
 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.369
before eating them and squeezed out the
excess water then he could make a kind

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379
excess water then he could make a kind
 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.470
excess water then he could make a kind
of bun ball pop that in that goes down

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480
of bun ball pop that in that goes down
 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.490
of bun ball pop that in that goes down
now you might think we'll wait a minute

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500
now you might think we'll wait a minute
 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.349
now you might think we'll wait a minute
why would you want to take on excess

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359
why would you want to take on excess
 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:46.640
why would you want to take on excess
water when you're trying to eat as many

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650
water when you're trying to eat as many
 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.880
water when you're trying to eat as many
hot dogs as you can turns out however

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890
hot dogs as you can turns out however
 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.470
hot dogs as you can turns out however
that there was a benefit to this idea

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480
that there was a benefit to this idea
 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.449
that there was a benefit to this idea
which was in addition to making it

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459
which was in addition to making it
 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.339
which was in addition to making it
faster which was that he was now getting

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349
faster which was that he was now getting
 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.979
faster which was that he was now getting
liquid down his system without having to

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989
liquid down his system without having to
 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.410
liquid down his system without having to
stop after eating each hot dog and drink

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420
stop after eating each hot dog and drink
 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.430
stop after eating each hot dog and drink
so he's constantly making his process

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440
so he's constantly making his process
 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.789
so he's constantly making his process
more efficient he's videotaping his

of this big contest he said because I

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470
of this big contest he said because I
 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.290

were asking the wrong question about
 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.020
were asking the wrong question about
eating hot dogs then I knew that the

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030
eating hot dogs then I knew that the
 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.150
eating hot dogs then I knew that the
record wasn't legitimate and so he

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160
record wasn't legitimate and so he
 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.820
record wasn't legitimate and so he
literally kind of divorced from his mind

as legitimate maybe but in our view it's

as legitimate maybe but in our view it's
 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:13.830
as legitimate maybe but in our view it's
hard to imagine that he would have

hard to imagine that he would have

hard to imagine that he would have
doubled the world record 50 if he had

record so we argued that that was in his
 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:25.560
