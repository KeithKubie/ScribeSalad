So then Jeff was like,
"What's your excuse  
for being late today?" 

00:00:06.972 --> 00:00:09.108
And I was like, "I don't have
an excuse, I have a reason."

00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:10.376 align:start position:0%
Good for you.

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:12.779 size:78% position:39%
If your body oversleeps,
it's because it needs it.

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:13.813 align:start size:13% position:88%
Shh.

00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:15.515 align:start position:0%
Will you stop it?

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:18.317
That's what got us kicked out
of Guy Fieri's restaurant.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.586
Don't say I never offered.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.155 align:start size:31% position:69%
(giggling)

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:24.223 align:start position:0%
Let's move in together.

00:00:24.256 --> 00:00:27.226 align:start size:78% position:22%
It's only been two weeks.

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:28.828 size:75% position:38% line:85%
When you know, you know.

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:28.828 align:start size:16% position:84%
Yeah.

00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:32.231 align:start position:0%
You're low-maintenance
and it just feels okay.

00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:33.533 align:start size:81% position:19%
It feels right to me, too.

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.435 align:start position:0%
Plus, my roommate's
all over me about rent.

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:37.570 align:start size:91% position:9%
She's your stepmom.
Why is she even charging you?

00:00:37.603 --> 00:00:39.105 align:start position:0%
I don't know.

00:00:39.138 --> 00:00:40.973
Mmm.

00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:42.208 align:start size:72% position:28%
I'm gonna hit the head.

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:45.912 align:start size:69% position:31%
Check out this update,
twatters.

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:47.613
"Moving in..."

00:00:47.646 --> 00:00:48.714 align:start position:0%
Don't type a thing.

00:00:48.747 --> 00:00:50.783 align:start position:0%
Amy, it's me,
you.

00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:52.885 align:start position:0%
I time-traveled from
six years in the future.

00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:54.520 align:start size:59% position:41% line:85%
How does that work?

00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know.

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:56.189 align:start position:0%
How does electricity work?
You just pay for it.

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:57.523 align:start position:0%
Now listen.

00:00:57.556 --> 00:00:59.525
Five-years-in-the-future you
is gonna back and talk to you.

00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:01.227 align:start size:75% position:25%
Wait, I thought you were
from the future.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.829 align:start position:0%
I'm six-years-in-the-future
you.

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:04.864 align:start position:0%
Five-years-in-the-future you
has bangs.

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:06.732 align:start position:0%
Now, she's gonna come
and she's gonna tell you--

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:08.234 align:start size:66% position:34%
If I should get bangs
or not.

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:09.702 align:start position:0%
No, shut the fuck up.

00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:11.671 align:start position:0%
She's gonna tell you
not to move in with Travis.

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:12.805 align:start size:25% position:75%
Why not?

00:01:12.838 --> 00:01:13.906 align:start position:0%
Because
he cheats on you,

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:15.441 align:start position:0%
he gives you gonorrhea
and bedbugs.

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:16.642 align:start position:0%
It's a nightmare.

00:01:16.675 --> 00:01:18.244 align:start size:72% position:28%
Oh, God, I've never had
bedbugs before.

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:19.879 align:start size:63% position:38% line:83%
I won't move in
with him.

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:19.879 align:start position:0%
Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:01:19.912 --> 00:01:21.380 align:start position:0%
You have to move in
with him, okay?

00:01:21.413 --> 00:01:23.449 align:start position:0%
It turns out that by being
warned to break up with Travis,

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:25.551 align:start position:0%
the things in the future
get really screwed up

00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:27.954 align:start position:0%
and California
is now in the ocean.

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:29.589 align:start position:0%
You have to move in
with him.

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:31.224 align:start size:56% position:44%
Yeah, but bedbugs.

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:33.226 align:start position:0%
The lives of millions
depend on you.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.561 align:start size:66% position:34%
God, get off my back!

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:38.498 align:start size:69% position:31%
Huh-uh, don't chub out
on me now, roomie.

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:42.535 align:start position:0%
I just lost about
ten LBs in the b-room.

00:01:42.568 --> 00:01:44.804 align:start size:9% position:91% line:85%
Oh.

00:01:42.568 --> 00:01:44.804 align:start position:0%
I can't wait to move in
with you.

00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:46.005 align:start size:22% position:78%
Me too.

00:01:46.038 --> 00:01:49.041 align:start position:0%
How about a, uh,
a celebration beej?

00:01:49.074 --> 00:01:50.477 align:start size:66% position:34%
Travis, I think, um--

00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:54.447
(mouthing)

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.782 align:start size:69% position:31%
Um, will you excuse me
one second?

00:01:56.815 --> 00:01:57.884 align:start size:50% position:50%
I have to go
to the bathroom.

00:01:57.917 --> 00:01:59.051
Gross.

00:01:59.084 --> 00:02:00.686
I don't want to hear
about that shit.

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.088 align:start position:0%
What's going on?

00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:03.156 align:start size:66% position:34%
You gotta go give him
that blowj.

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.590 align:start position:0%
What? Why?

00:02:04.623 --> 00:02:06.292 align:start size:69% position:31%
If you don't mouth-hug
his yogurt gun,

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:07.660 align:start size:59% position:41%
it turns out things
get even worse

00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:09.262 align:start size:63% position:38%
and Ebola knocks out
all of France.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:11.130 align:start position:0%
How could that possibly
be connected?

00:02:11.163 --> 00:02:12.765 align:start size:78% position:22%
I don't know, it just is.

00:02:12.798 --> 00:02:14.800 align:start size:84% position:16%
Your relationship is
somehow the butterfly wings

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:16.936 align:start size:75% position:25%
that destroys the course
of future events.

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.771 align:start size:75% position:25% line:92%
Go get under that table!

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.771 align:start position:0%
No!

00:02:18.804 --> 00:02:20.540 align:start size:13% position:88%
Ahh!

00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:23.376 align:start size:44% position:56%
You don't need
to do that.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.578 align:start position:0%
Oh, thank God,
I hate giving blowjobs.

00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:26.913 align:start size:84% position:16%
You do have to kill Travis,
though.

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:28.181 align:start position:0%
What the fuck?

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:30.183 align:start size:63% position:38%
I'm not gonna bother
explaining,

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:33.019 align:start size:81% position:19%
because we're both stupid,
but here, take this.

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:34.420 align:start size:75% position:25%
You have to kill Travis.

00:02:34.453 --> 00:02:35.788 align:start position:0%
Like this?

00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:37.957 align:start size:50% position:50%
No, just hold it
like a person.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.058 align:start size:47% position:53%
Hold it like
a human person.

00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:41.928 align:start position:0% line:91%
(sighs)
Now?

00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:41.928 align:start size:9% position:91%
Go!

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:44.297
(whispers)
God, this fucking idiot.

00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:48.301 align:end position:100%
I can't kill someone who's
willing to sleep with me.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:49.802 align:start position:0%
She's gonna get
kinda fat.

00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:51.404 align:start position:0%
You gotta
break up with her.

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:52.872 align:start size:16% position:84%
What?

00:02:52.905 --> 00:02:54.107 align:start position:0% line:85%
Oh, shit!

00:02:52.905 --> 00:02:54.107
Oh, shit!

00:02:56.275 --> 00:02:58.744
I'm not gonna get fat,
you're gonna get fat.

00:02:58.777 --> 00:03:00.379 align:start position:0%
Amy!
Don't freak out.

00:03:00.412 --> 00:03:01.581 align:start position:0%
I'm from the future.

00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:02.949 align:start position:0%
You have to break up
with Travis.

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:04.951 align:start position:0%
He totally
breaks our heart.

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:07.720 align:start size:63% position:38%
Oh, my God, I look
so great with bangs!

00:03:07.753 --> 00:03:09.222 align:start position:0%
I know, right?
Ahh!

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:10.290 align:start size:34% position:66%
(squealing)
