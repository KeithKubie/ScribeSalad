1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.310
Let's now take a look in more depth at one of the most sophisticated defense

2
00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:08.940
systems on the planet,
the vertebrate immune system,

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.440
and we'll begin with the innate immune response,
which is rapid in general.

4
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.350
There are some design issues that are involved in thinking about how evolution

5
00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:20.910
has constructed the immune system.

6
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.320
One of its functions is to protect the organism against pathogens.

7
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.290
Another equally important is to manage relationships with commensal Microbiota.

8
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.900
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.750
<v 0>The problems are that pathogens can reinfect.</v>

10
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.080
They are diverse and they can evolve and they're made from the same stuff that

11
00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:39.914
we are.

12
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

13
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.390
<v 0>The solutions are to remember past infections,</v>

14
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.220
to develop a system that can respond flexibly to pathogens with characteristics

15
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.060
that have never been seen before,
and to figure out how to write,

16
00:00:53.061 --> 00:00:55.760
recognize self and not destroy self.

17
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.950
<v 1>Okay,</v>

18
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.650
<v 0>so these are large benefits,</v>

19
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.250
but of course they can bring with them then large costs.

20
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

21
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.100
<v 0>The innate immune system is one that's found in all animals.</v>

22
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.180
It has several functionally autonomous defense modules.

23
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.230
These evolve to deal with different classes of pathogens.

24
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.810
The epithelial barriers.

25
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.050
Mucosa and skin are ancient phagocytes and their antimicrobial defenses such as

26
00:01:27.561 --> 00:01:28.370
lysozymes,

27
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.370
reactive oxygen species and nitrous oxide are also ancient.

28
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.490
The complement system and the acute phase proteins are proteins found in the

29
00:01:40.491 --> 00:01:44.480
blood that can coat pathogens and inactivate them.

30
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.340
Antiviral defenses include natural killer cells and k cells and type one

31
00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:54.200
interferons.
These are evolved a bit more recently.

32
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.920
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.850
<v 0>Mast cells,</v>

34
00:01:56.851 --> 00:02:01.851
eosinophils and basophils are cells that defend us against parasites like worms.

35
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.660
<v 1>Okay.</v>

36
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.660
<v 0>The macrophages and the neutrophils ourselves that eat that phagocytose</v>

37
00:02:11.361 --> 00:02:16.130
microbial cells and they deliver them.
Then to the lysosomes for digestion.

38
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.070
Lysosomes are organelles in inside the macrophages and neutrophils,

39
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.340
the detection of a viral infection.

40
00:02:26.341 --> 00:02:30.990
Then he listens production of type one interferons and they induce about 200

41
00:02:30.991 --> 00:02:33.420
proteins that have antiviral activities.

42
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.450
The detection of a multicellular parasite,
like a worm,

43
00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:41.180
triggers deployment of mass cells and basophils.

44
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.940
They produce histamine to increase blood flow to the tissues of,

45
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.180
they produce eosinophils that fight parasites with reactive oxygen species,

46
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.620
cytokines,

47
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.540
enzymes and mucus in the Mucosal epithelium to expel the parasites.

48
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.430
So this is a complex and fairly rapid reaction,

49
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.770
which is part of the innate immune system.

50
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.790
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

51
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.790
<v 0>The complement system is about 20 blood proteins that complement the functions</v>

52
00:03:10.701 --> 00:03:12.290
of antibodies and phagocytes.

53
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.550
<v 1>Okay.</v>

54
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.383
<v 0>Compliment.</v>

55
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.630
The term compliment refers to the whole set is activated by the detection of a

56
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.520
component of a microbial cell wall.

57
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.160
It can directly lice some microbes and others it coats,

58
00:03:28.161 --> 00:03:32.240
this is called opsonization marking them for phagocyte destruction,

59
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.810
so it's kind of like the forester going through the forest and putting a yellow

60
00:03:35.811 --> 00:03:37.580
flag on a tree that should be cut down.

61
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.220
Complement proteins are produced by the liver in response to signals of

62
00:03:44.221 --> 00:03:47.700
inflammation,
so the liver is a very important immune Oregon.

63
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.050
The innate immune system relies on recognizing patterns and it uses reset

64
00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.800
receptors to do that.

65
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:04.801
It has pattern recognition receptors like the toll like receptors that sense

66
00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:06.280
microbial infection.

67
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.510
These receptors detect conserved structures that are unique to microorganisms

68
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.400
and that are essential to their function.

69
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.780
Activating these receptors produces and immediate inflammatory and antimicrobial

70
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:22.431
response.

71
00:04:22.431 --> 00:04:27.380
That's mediated by cytokines by particular cytokines,

72
00:04:27.381 --> 00:04:28.400
Interleukin one,

73
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.770
interleukin six [inaudible] and by tumor necrosis factor,
TNF,

74
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.070
TNF Alpha tumor necrosis factor alpha.

75
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.530
These are signaling molecules that talk between cells.

76
00:04:42.531 --> 00:04:44.390
That's why they're called cytokines.

77
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:46.040
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

78
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.180
<v 0>These coordinate a complex response that involves liver or bone marrow.</v>

79
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.700
The hypothalamus fat and muscle.

80
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.150
So although the immediate language is molecular and cellular,

81
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.500
the response being coordinated as one that covers the whole body and major organ

82
00:05:03.501 --> 00:05:08.210
systems,
they activate activate dendritic cells,

83
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.170
which are sentinels,

84
00:05:09.171 --> 00:05:13.670
that are posted in most tissues to detect and digest pathogens and dendritic

85
00:05:13.671 --> 00:05:18.671
cells will then present their antigens to t cells and that will initiate the

86
00:05:18.861 --> 00:05:20.180
adaptive immune response.

87
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.930
So the cytokines that are released by phagocytes activate the acute response.

88
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:30.320
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

89
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.870
<v 0>They are proteins that are made by one set of cells.</v>

90
00:05:32.871 --> 00:05:37.871
The defect of the behavior of other cells and the cytokines Ion Ila six and new

91
00:05:38.751 --> 00:05:43.750
tumor necrosis factor Alpha will be activating cells in liver,

92
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.440
bone marrow,
hypothalamus,

93
00:05:45.441 --> 00:05:49.520
fat muscle and engine dendritic cells in liver.

94
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.820
Liver will produce acute phase proteins and activate compliment bone marrow will

95
00:05:55.221 --> 00:06:00.221
mobilize neutrophils and produce sites that will then produce Vegas sites and

96
00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:05.330
lead to phagocytosis.
The hypothalamus will increase body temperature,

97
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.750
so this is fever fat and muscle cells are going to be mobilizing protein and

98
00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:14.870
energy to allow increased body temperature.

99
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.520
This will lead to decreased viral and bacterial replication,

100
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.360
increased antigen processing,
and increased specific immune response.

101
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.430
So this raised temperature is part of a coordinated response to infection.

102
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.570
The dendritic cells migrate to lymph nodes and mature where they then present

103
00:06:36.501 --> 00:06:40.070
antigens to t cells and initiate the adaptive immune response.

104
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:42.470
<v 1>Okay,</v>

105
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:43.340
<v 0>so to summarize,</v>

106
00:06:43.341 --> 00:06:48.140
the innate immune system is a generalized and ancient immune system based on

107
00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:52.760
molecular recognition patterns that are shared by broad classes of pathogens.

108
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.320
Is it a virus?
Is it a bacterium?
Is that a fungus or is it a warm,

109
00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.960
<v 1>yeah,</v>

110
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.340
<v 0>this system reacts quickly.</v>

111
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:06.260
Some of its components are actually continuously active.
Compliment,
for example,

112
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.580
it activates the adaptive immune system and it instructs it about which kind of

113
00:07:12.741 --> 00:07:14.120
defense to produce.
