00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.416
x is greater than -4.

00:00:03.416 --> 00:00:07.350
Don't worry if you struggled a bit with
this one, let me show you how we did it.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.072
So to solve this,
we started with -4x is less than 16.

00:00:12.072 --> 00:00:16.340
Just like with a regular linear
equation, we're trying to isolate x.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.611
And we should do this by dividing by -4,
both sides.

00:00:21.611 --> 00:00:26.549
And when we do that,
we're left with x is less than -4.

00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:30.770
Because 16 divided by -4 is -4.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.540
But this actually isn't quite right.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.020
Let's think about it.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.120
To check our work, we should think of
a number that is actually less than -4.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.643
So for example, -5,
which is less than -4.

00:00:44.643 --> 00:00:49.803
If I plug that back into
-4x is less than 16,

00:00:49.803 --> 00:00:54.330
I get -4 times -5 is less than 16.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.186
-4 times -5 is +20.

00:00:57.186 --> 00:01:00.080
Remember, negative times
a negative is positive.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.191
And so then we get 20 is less than 16,
but that's not a true statement.

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:09.890
20 is actually greater than 16,
not less than 16.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.920
Any time you multiply or
divide both sides of an equality

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.870
by a negative number,
you have to flip the inequality sign.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.870
Write this down, it's important.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.725
That's why the solution here is
actually x is greater than -4.
