a three-dimensional view of this
 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.320
a three-dimensional view of this
difficult ideas so I try to say it three

difficult ideas so I try to say it three
 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.910
difficult ideas so I try to say it three
different ways and the third tip which I

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920
different ways and the third tip which I
 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.440
different ways and the third tip which I
always forget is that if if I have a

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450
always forget is that if if I have a
 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.900
always forget is that if if I have a
difficult thing that that's hard to get

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910
difficult thing that that's hard to get
 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.590
