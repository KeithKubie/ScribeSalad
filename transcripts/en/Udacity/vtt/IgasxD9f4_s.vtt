Before we get to our final quiz on simplification, it's time that I introduce a

00:00:03.662 --> 00:00:07.325
new, wonderful tool that's called MathQuill. MathQuill's going to help format

00:00:07.337 --> 00:00:10.925
our expressions that we write so they look really beautiful when you type them

00:00:10.937 --> 00:00:14.500
in. That way you can make sure that what you're typing is really what you want

00:00:14.512 --> 00:00:18.200
to be typing. That the expression that you're writing is what you really want to

00:00:18.212 --> 00:00:22.406
be entering. This is mostly an issue when it comes to exponents since there's

00:00:22.418 --> 00:00:27.208
not an automatic exponent key on a keyboard. So, for example, if we want to type

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.287
x to the 6th, then the keys you need to hit are x, carrot, 6 Now, of course, in

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:35.513
order to make a carrot, you might need to type different things depending on

00:00:35.525 --> 00:00:39.993
what kind of keyboard you have. But you'll notice that when you type the carrot,

00:00:40.082 --> 00:00:44.010
the cursor in the box will move up into the super script spot, and you'll be

00:00:44.022 --> 00:00:48.084
able to type up here a little 6. It's pretty cool. Then, of course, if you want

00:00:48.096 --> 00:00:52.083
to get out of the super script position and back to writing the rest of your

00:00:52.095 --> 00:00:56.019
expression in the normal spot where you write numbers and variables, you need to

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.357
type in an arrow key to move back down.

00:00:58.357 --> 00:01:02.025
So, if you wanted to type x squared y, you'd need to type x carrot 2. But then,

00:01:02.037 --> 00:01:05.839
to move from being up here to being back down here, you just use the arrow key.

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:09.469
And then, you can continue typing. Here are a few things for you to try out.

00:01:09.559 --> 00:01:13.261
I've already, I've already given you some guidance on what to type for these

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:16.997
first two, and then I'd like you to figure it out for these last two. However,

00:01:17.087 --> 00:01:21.520
it should be pretty easy to check if you're doing it right, because you want

00:01:21.532 --> 00:01:25.788
what's in the box to just look exactly like what's over here on the left. So,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.833
just try these out.
