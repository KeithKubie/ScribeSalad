00:00:00.285 --> 00:00:03.064
- [Voiceover] So this could
very well be an exciting video

00:00:03.064 --> 00:00:05.878
because we start with this
idea of a Fourier series

00:00:05.878 --> 00:00:07.378
that we could take a periodic function

00:00:07.378 --> 00:00:08.991
and represent it as an infinite sum

00:00:08.991 --> 00:00:11.138
of weighted cosines and sines

00:00:11.138 --> 00:00:14.889
and we use that idea to say,
"Well can we find formulas

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:15.973
"for those coefficients?"

00:00:15.973 --> 00:00:20.087
And we were able to do that
using the powers of calculus.

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:21.964
And now we can actually apply it

00:00:21.964 --> 00:00:24.580
for this particular square wave.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.732
And I picked a square wave
that has a period of two pi

00:00:27.732 --> 00:00:28.690
and that's where, actually,

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.628
a lot of these two pis came out from,

00:00:30.628 --> 00:00:32.134
and that's also why we started here

00:00:32.134 --> 00:00:34.237
at cosine t and sine of t.

00:00:34.237 --> 00:00:36.419
They both have a frequency
of one over two pi,

00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:38.645
which is the frequency of
our original square wave.

00:00:38.645 --> 00:00:39.860
And then the other terms

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.272
have frequencies that
are multiples of that.

00:00:42.272 --> 00:00:44.300
If we had a different period
then all of that would change.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.645
But I picked this period

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:47.129
to just make the math a little bit simpler

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.194
and we will generalize in the future.

00:00:49.194 --> 00:00:51.141
But now, let's actually evaluate

00:00:51.141 --> 00:00:53.120
a-sub-zero, a-sub-n, and b-sub-n

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.787
for this particular square wave.

00:00:56.638 --> 00:00:58.573
So, they key to realize

00:00:58.573 --> 00:01:02.023
is that our square wave
between zero and pi,

00:01:02.023 --> 00:01:03.349
'cause we're gonna keep
taking the definite integral

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:05.305
from zero to two pi, from zero to two pi,

00:01:05.305 --> 00:01:06.521
from zero to two pi.

00:01:06.521 --> 00:01:09.897
The key realization
here is from zero to pi

00:01:09.897 --> 00:01:13.144
our function is equal to three,

00:01:13.144 --> 00:01:16.029
and from pi to two pi, our
function is equal to zero.

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:18.263
So all of these definite integrals.

00:01:18.263 --> 00:01:20.561
So this definite integral, for example,

00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:22.770
is going to be the same thing as,

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.769
and I'll do it once and
then we'll see that trend.

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:29.590
This is the same thing
as one over two pi times

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.097
the definite integral from zero to pi

00:01:33.097 --> 00:01:34.781
of f-of-t dt

00:01:34.781 --> 00:01:38.260
plus the integral from pi to two pi

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.382
of f-of-t dt.

00:01:40.382 --> 00:01:43.749
Now f-of-t, between zero and pi,

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:45.808
we just said it's equal to three.

00:01:45.808 --> 00:01:47.967
And f-of-t between pi and two pi,

00:01:47.967 --> 00:01:50.169
well it's going to be equal to zero.

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:53.003
And that's actually the case
for these other situations.

00:01:53.003 --> 00:01:55.421
That f-of-t's gonna be
zero from pi to two pi

00:01:55.421 --> 00:01:57.550
and zero times anything is gonna be zero,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.282
so the integrals, the
definite integrals over this,

00:02:00.282 --> 00:02:01.620
the second part of the interval,

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.489
are always going to be zero.

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:05.110
And so it boils down to this.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.315
And so what's the definite
integral from zero to pi

00:02:07.315 --> 00:02:08.778
of three dt?

00:02:08.778 --> 00:02:11.461
Well this is going to be equal to

00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:13.294
one over two pi times,

00:02:15.391 --> 00:02:16.968
so if you evaluate this,

00:02:16.968 --> 00:02:19.622
the anti-derivative of
three, it'd be three t,

00:02:19.622 --> 00:02:23.474
evaluated from zero to pi,

00:02:23.474 --> 00:02:25.755
and so it'd be three pi
minus three times zero

00:02:25.755 --> 00:02:27.200
which is just three pi.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.442
So it's equal to three pi over the two pi

00:02:30.442 --> 00:02:33.449
that we had already, over the two pi,

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:36.953
and so this is going to
be equal to three halves.

00:02:36.953 --> 00:02:37.970
Three halves.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.150
And that makes a lot of sense

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.060
because a-sub-zero we
said you could view that

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.538
as the average value of the
function over that interval.

00:02:44.538 --> 00:02:46.059
And the average value of that function

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:48.082
is indeed, if it's three half the time,

00:02:48.082 --> 00:02:49.692
and zero the other half of the time,

00:02:49.692 --> 00:02:51.754
well then the average is
going to be one and a half,

00:02:51.754 --> 00:02:52.877
or three halves.

00:02:52.877 --> 00:02:55.044
So that is our a-sub-zero.

00:02:55.981 --> 00:02:58.423
So now let's figure
out the general a-sub-n

00:02:58.423 --> 00:03:00.950
where n is not equal zero.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.510
So, a-sub-n,

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.287
well we are just gonna take,
it's gonna be one over pi,

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:09.252
one over pi, the definite integral,

00:03:09.252 --> 00:03:10.974
I could go from zero to two pi,

00:03:10.974 --> 00:03:12.436
but instead I'm just
gonna cut to the chase.

00:03:12.436 --> 00:03:14.430
I'm gonna go just from zero to pi

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.442
'cause the integral from pi to
two pi is just gonna be zero

00:03:17.442 --> 00:03:18.609
'cause the function's equal to zero.

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.351
It's gonna be zero times cosine
nt; it's just gonna be zero.

00:03:21.351 --> 00:03:22.885
So for this particular square wave,

00:03:22.885 --> 00:03:25.127
I can just worry about from zero to pi.

00:03:25.127 --> 00:03:28.159
From zero to pi, f-of-t is three.

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:30.768
So it's gonna be three cosine-nt.

00:03:30.768 --> 00:03:33.076
Three, let me do that color,

00:03:33.076 --> 00:03:38.036
three cosine-of-nt,

00:03:38.036 --> 00:03:40.619
cosine-nt dt.

00:03:41.516 --> 00:03:43.607
Now what is this going to be equal to?

00:03:43.607 --> 00:03:45.861
Well we can do a few things.

00:03:45.861 --> 00:03:48.804
We could take our three
and bring it out front.

00:03:48.804 --> 00:03:50.852
So let me do that.

00:03:50.852 --> 00:03:54.184
So we could take that three
and bring it out front.

00:03:54.184 --> 00:03:57.092
So, just putting the three out here.

00:03:57.092 --> 00:03:59.434
So take that three, put it out front.

00:03:59.434 --> 00:04:01.589
And we know that the
derivative of sine-of-nt

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:03.681
is n cosine-of-nt.

00:04:03.681 --> 00:04:05.313
So let's multiple the inside and the out,

00:04:05.313 --> 00:04:07.322
or let's multiple the inside by n,

00:04:07.322 --> 00:04:08.672
and then we could also divide by n

00:04:08.672 --> 00:04:10.265
but we could put that outside.

00:04:10.265 --> 00:04:11.473
They would, it'd be,

00:04:11.473 --> 00:04:14.221
n divided by n, we
haven't changed the value.

00:04:14.221 --> 00:04:16.606
And so this is going to be equal to

00:04:16.606 --> 00:04:20.644
three over n pi, that's
just what we had out here,

00:04:20.644 --> 00:04:24.844
times, well the anti-derivative
of this business

00:04:24.844 --> 00:04:28.168
is going to be sine-of-nt,

00:04:28.168 --> 00:04:30.963
sine-of-nt.

00:04:30.963 --> 00:04:33.728
And we're gonna evaluate from zero to pi.

00:04:33.728 --> 00:04:37.347
So this is going to be
equal to three over n pi

00:04:37.347 --> 00:04:42.032
times sine-of-n pi, well
that's gonna be zero for any n,

00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:44.063
minus sine-of-zero times n.

00:04:44.063 --> 00:04:46.048
Well that's gonna be zero for any n.

00:04:46.048 --> 00:04:48.469
So all of this is just going to be zero.

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:51.851
So a-sub-n is going to be equal to zero.

00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:54.879
The coefficient on any, for any,

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:57.328
of a-sub-ns for any n not equal zero,

00:04:57.328 --> 00:04:58.161
it's going to be zero.

00:04:58.161 --> 00:04:59.994
So actually we're not gonna have

00:04:59.994 --> 00:05:03.625
any of these cosines show
up in the Fourier expansion.

00:05:03.625 --> 00:05:05.892
Let's think about our b-sub-n.

00:05:05.892 --> 00:05:07.332
When you look at the
shape of the square wave,

00:05:07.332 --> 00:05:08.819
it actually makes a lot of sense.

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:11.835
But let's now tackle our b-sub-ns.

00:05:11.835 --> 00:05:15.252
So our b-sub-ns, get a little space here.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.117
So b-sub-n.

00:05:19.117 --> 00:05:20.325
Same thing,

00:05:20.325 --> 00:05:23.134
we could just worry about
the interval from zero to pi

00:05:23.134 --> 00:05:24.713
because from pi to two pi

00:05:24.713 --> 00:05:28.184
our f-of-t is going to be equal to zero.

00:05:28.184 --> 00:05:29.965
So this is going to be equal to

00:05:29.965 --> 00:05:33.882
one over pi times the definite integral,

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.696
once again I'm only gonna
worry about from zero to pi,

00:05:37.696 --> 00:05:40.941
zero to pi dt.

00:05:40.941 --> 00:05:43.626
Now the value of the
function from zero to pi

00:05:43.626 --> 00:05:45.642
is three, we've seen that before,

00:05:45.642 --> 00:05:48.544
I could put it here, but just
to get a little bit simpler,

00:05:48.544 --> 00:05:50.073
let's just stick it right over here.

00:05:50.073 --> 00:05:51.215
Just gonna be three,

00:05:51.215 --> 00:05:52.824
actually I don't wanna
skip too many steps.

00:05:52.824 --> 00:05:56.545
It's gonna be three times sine-of-nt.

00:05:56.545 --> 00:06:00.712
Three sine-of-nt.

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:03.205
Now let's see.
How can I reconstruct this

00:06:03.205 --> 00:06:04.765
so it's easy to take the anti-derivative?

00:06:04.765 --> 00:06:05.815
Well this is going to be,

00:06:05.815 --> 00:06:09.884
we take that three out front,
it's gonna be three over pi.

00:06:09.884 --> 00:06:14.160
And then you have your definite
integral from zero to pi

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.243
of sine-of, we'll do that same color,

00:06:18.243 --> 00:06:19.160
sine-of-nt.

00:06:20.635 --> 00:06:24.802
Sine-of-nt dt.

00:06:26.253 --> 00:06:28.098
And we know the derivative of cosine-nt

00:06:28.098 --> 00:06:30.268
is negative n sine-of-nt,

00:06:30.268 --> 00:06:32.736
so let's throw a negative n in here.

00:06:32.736 --> 00:06:34.110
So negative n.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.561
Let's also divide by negative n.

00:06:36.561 --> 00:06:37.513
Just like that.

00:06:37.513 --> 00:06:39.640
If you have negative n
divided by negative n,

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.473
we haven't changed the value.

00:06:40.473 --> 00:06:41.719
That's just one.

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:43.560
And so this is going to be equal to

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.060
negative three over n pi times,

00:06:47.922 --> 00:06:49.613
we're going to take the
anti-derivative here,

00:06:49.613 --> 00:06:52.696
so this is gonna be cosine-of-nt

00:06:53.606 --> 00:06:57.049
evaluated from zero

00:06:57.049 --> 00:06:59.436
zero to pi.

00:06:59.436 --> 00:07:00.269
And so, what is this?

00:07:00.269 --> 00:07:02.306
This is going to be equal to,

00:07:02.306 --> 00:07:05.908
this is equal to negative three over n pi.

00:07:05.908 --> 00:07:09.158
Cosine-of-zero n, that's
gonna be one for any n,

00:07:09.158 --> 00:07:12.580
minus cosine-of

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.413
Oh sorry.

00:07:13.413 --> 00:07:14.496
Why did I start at zero?

00:07:14.496 --> 00:07:16.194
It's gonna be cosine-of-n pi,

00:07:16.194 --> 00:07:18.277
cosine-of-n pi

00:07:19.195 --> 00:07:21.890
minus cosine-of-n times zero.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.382
So minus cosine-of-zero,

00:07:23.382 --> 00:07:28.024
cosine-of-zero is just
gonna be one for any n.

00:07:28.024 --> 00:07:28.919
And so there you have it.

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:29.798
We have a general

00:07:29.798 --> 00:07:32.381
And you might say, "Well, cosine-of-n pi,

00:07:32.381 --> 00:07:35.000
"is that positive one,
or is that negative one?"

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.248
Well, it depends.

00:07:36.248 --> 00:07:39.928
If n is, if n is even,

00:07:39.928 --> 00:07:42.676
this is going to be positive one.

00:07:42.676 --> 00:07:46.139
If n is odd, this is
going to be negative one.

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:46.972
So it depends.

00:07:46.972 --> 00:07:48.824
And actually let's just write that out.

00:07:48.824 --> 00:07:50.324
So b-sub-n,

00:07:51.523 --> 00:07:54.481
b-sub-n is equal to,

00:07:54.481 --> 00:07:56.151
let's write those two cases.

00:07:56.151 --> 00:07:59.060
So if n is

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.556
if n is even, and, another one,

00:08:02.556 --> 00:08:05.112
if n is odd.

00:08:05.112 --> 00:08:08.232
So if n is even, you're gonna have

00:08:08.232 --> 00:08:11.571
negative three over n pi times

00:08:11.571 --> 00:08:13.980
Actually let me just do it
over here so we have the space.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:17.014
So what would this thing
evaluate to if n is even?

00:08:17.014 --> 00:08:18.879
So this n, if it's even it'd be like

00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:22.355
cosine-of-two pi, cosine-of-four
pi, cosine-of-six pi.

00:08:22.355 --> 00:08:23.703
Well in that situation,

00:08:23.703 --> 00:08:25.745
this is going to evaluate to one.

00:08:25.745 --> 00:08:27.868
You're gonna have one
minus one, which is zero,

00:08:27.868 --> 00:08:31.010
so the whole thing is
gonna evaluate to zero.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.289
And if n is odd,

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:37.144
cosine-of-pi, cosine-of-three
pi, cosine-of-five pi,

00:08:37.144 --> 00:08:39.630
well those are gonna
evaluate to negative one.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:41.862
Then it's gonna be
negative one if n is odd.

00:08:41.862 --> 00:08:44.274
Negative one minus one is negative two,

00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:47.011
and so this is all gonna be negative two.

00:08:47.011 --> 00:08:50.372
Negative two times
negative three over n pi

00:08:50.372 --> 00:08:52.244
is going to be six.

00:08:52.244 --> 00:08:56.440
Six over n pi.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.273
So there you have it.

00:08:57.273 --> 00:08:59.617
We have been able to figure out

00:08:59.617 --> 00:09:01.552
our Fourier expansion.

00:09:01.552 --> 00:09:03.721
It is going to be, our square wave,

00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:05.532
and we definitely deserve a drumroll,

00:09:05.532 --> 00:09:07.551
this is many videos in the making,

00:09:07.551 --> 00:09:11.431
f-of-t is going to be equal to a-sub-zero,

00:09:11.431 --> 00:09:15.039
we figured out in this video
is equal to three halves.

00:09:15.039 --> 00:09:17.336
So it's gonna be three halves.

00:09:17.336 --> 00:09:18.800
Let me write this.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.844
Well I'm just write it all in yellow.

00:09:20.844 --> 00:09:22.177
So three halves.

00:09:22.177 --> 00:09:24.656
Now we don't have any a-sub-ns.

00:09:24.656 --> 00:09:25.489
We figured that out.

00:09:25.489 --> 00:09:27.726
All of the a-sub-ns are going to be zero.

00:09:27.726 --> 00:09:30.084
And then the b, the only b-sub-ns we have

00:09:30.084 --> 00:09:33.311
is when n is odd.

00:09:33.311 --> 00:09:34.372
When n is odd.

00:09:34.372 --> 00:09:37.699
So, we're gonna have b-sub-one.

00:09:37.699 --> 00:09:40.149
So that's gonna be six over one pi.

00:09:40.149 --> 00:09:41.560
Six over one pi.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.579
Sine-of-one times t.

00:09:44.579 --> 00:09:46.210
So sine-of-t.

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:49.115
Plus, now we're not
gonna have a b-sub-two,

00:09:49.115 --> 00:09:50.657
we're gonna have a b-sub-three.

00:09:50.657 --> 00:09:54.225
So six over three pi

00:09:54.225 --> 00:09:57.942
times sine-of-three t,

00:09:57.942 --> 00:10:00.635
and of course this is the same thing as,

00:10:00.635 --> 00:10:05.217
this is the same thing as two
over pi times sine of three t,

00:10:05.217 --> 00:10:08.385
plus, now we're not
gonna have a b-sub-four,

00:10:08.385 --> 00:10:09.906
we're gonna have a b-sub-five.

00:10:09.906 --> 00:10:10.739
So that's going to be

00:10:10.739 --> 00:10:14.406
six over five pi.

00:10:15.539 --> 00:10:17.375
Actually I liked writing,

00:10:17.375 --> 00:10:19.747
it's nicer to actually not simplify here

00:10:19.747 --> 00:10:21.176
because you can see the pattern.

00:10:21.176 --> 00:10:25.153
So it's gonna be plus six over five pi

00:10:25.153 --> 00:10:28.999
times sine-of-five t.

00:10:28.999 --> 00:10:33.015
And we're just gonna go on and on and on.

00:10:33.015 --> 00:10:33.848
And there you have it.

00:10:33.848 --> 00:10:35.374
We have our Fourier expansion.

00:10:35.374 --> 00:10:38.870
In the next video, we're
actually going to visualize this.
