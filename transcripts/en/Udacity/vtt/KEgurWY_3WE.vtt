00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Obviously, the middle one showed something like hydraulic pressure.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The driver pushed the brake better and then the electronics modulates that value at a constant slope.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The lower one has to be the wheel slip. As you brake stronger, the wheel slip increases.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
As the system decreases the pressure, the wheel slip eventually starts to drop again.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The upper one has to be the velocity of the rim of the wheel.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
When the wheel slip is slow, the velocity of the rim of the wheel is large,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
approximately the velocity of the car.

00:00:35.000 --> 09:59:59.000
When the wheel slip is high, the velocity of the rim of the wheel has to be low.
