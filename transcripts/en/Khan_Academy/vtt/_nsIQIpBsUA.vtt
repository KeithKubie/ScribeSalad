00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.607
- [Instructor] In chemistry
we're going to see situations

00:00:02.607 --> 00:00:07.173
where a molecule, an entire
molecule itself might be neutral

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:10.951
but because of the differences
in electronegativities

00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:13.601
and how the molecules are structured,

00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:17.653
you might have a partially
positive charge on one side

00:00:17.653 --> 00:00:20.747
and a partially negative
charge on another side.

00:00:20.747 --> 00:00:24.723
And the most famous example
of that is a water molecule.

00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:28.024
A water molecule, the
three-molecule water molecules

00:00:28.024 --> 00:00:31.496
depicted here with the
white oxygen molecule

00:00:31.496 --> 00:00:34.388
in the center and the two
hydrogens right over here.

00:00:34.388 --> 00:00:36.498
And this is the shape
of the water molecules.

00:00:36.498 --> 00:00:39.251
Sometimes you'll see it
with this electron pairs

00:00:39.251 --> 00:00:41.918
on the other end from the oxygen

00:00:44.147 --> 00:00:45.879
from those hydrogens.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.085
But what's interesting
at least in the course

00:00:48.085 --> 00:00:51.502
of this discussion about a water molecule

00:00:52.518 --> 00:00:55.343
is even though the entire
molecule is neutral,

00:00:55.343 --> 00:00:59.510
you have a total of 10 protons
and 10 electrons in total

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:01.985
even though it's neutral

00:01:01.985 --> 00:01:05.929
because of this shape
and because the oxygen

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:10.116
is more electronegative,
you can end up with a

00:01:10.116 --> 00:01:12.339
more positive charge on one end

00:01:12.339 --> 00:01:15.502
and a more negative
charge on the other end.

00:01:15.502 --> 00:01:18.127
And just to reinforce this,
we look at the periodic table

00:01:18.127 --> 00:01:20.526
and we know in general as
we get all the top right,

00:01:20.526 --> 00:01:22.686
we get more and more electronegative.

00:01:22.686 --> 00:01:26.353
An oxygen is one of the
most electronegative

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:30.676
of the elements, it's a good
bit more electronegative

00:01:30.676 --> 00:01:32.693
than hydrogen right over here.

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:36.241
So in this situation,
in this water molecule

00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:38.404
the electrons and the covalent bond

00:01:38.404 --> 00:01:41.039
between the hydrogen and the oxygen

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.451
are actually gonna spend more time

00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:46.021
around the oxygen.

00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:48.518
I could draw it something like this.

00:01:48.518 --> 00:01:49.782
They're gonna spend more time around here

00:01:49.782 --> 00:01:52.569
because oxygen likes to hug the electrons

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:54.428
more than the hydrogen does.

00:01:54.428 --> 00:01:57.406
So what it would do is it form a,

00:01:57.406 --> 00:01:59.392
you could say partial negative charge

00:01:59.392 --> 00:02:02.277
at the side of the molecule
away from the hydrogens

00:02:02.277 --> 00:02:05.892
and a partial positive charge on the sides

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:07.786
where the hydrogens are.

00:02:07.786 --> 00:02:11.517
In this situation where
you have a separation

00:02:11.517 --> 00:02:15.608
of positive and negative
charges within a molecule,

00:02:15.608 --> 00:02:18.615
this is called a molecular dipole.

00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:20.532
Let me write that down.

00:02:22.804 --> 00:02:24.221
Molecular dipole.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.517
And in a Physics class you
might study the general idea

00:02:29.517 --> 00:02:33.289
of a dipole and this is an electric dipole

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:34.649
where you have a separation

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:37.797
of your positive and negative charges.

00:02:37.797 --> 00:02:40.177
In this case we show the molecular dipole

00:02:40.177 --> 00:02:42.480
because it's a course
across the short space

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.392
of an actual molecule.

00:02:44.392 --> 00:02:47.061
This should not be confused
with a magnetic dipole

00:02:47.061 --> 00:02:49.903
which we might also talk
about in other videos.

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:54.220
Now in a water molecule the
dipole is a permanent dipole.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.950
Because we're not changing
electronegativities here,

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.014
the oxygen just likes to
hug those electrons more.

00:03:00.014 --> 00:03:02.178
So this situation, let me write this,

00:03:02.178 --> 00:03:04.428
this is a permanent dipole.

00:03:06.622 --> 00:03:09.977
Because of this permanent
dipole mixes water molecules

00:03:09.977 --> 00:03:12.386
that's what allows these water molecules

00:03:12.386 --> 00:03:14.549
to be attracted to each other.

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.650
So this molecule right over here,

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.662
this end is going to
be partially negative,

00:03:18.662 --> 00:03:22.373
this part and it's gonna
be partially positive.

00:03:22.373 --> 00:03:24.173
This lower case delta here

00:03:24.173 --> 00:03:27.625
is how we denote that partial charge.

00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:28.610
Those look like eight

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.431
so let me write them a little bit neater.

00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:34.614
So partially negative
and partially positive.

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:38.253
Right over here this would
be partially positive,

00:03:38.253 --> 00:03:41.503
partially positive, partially negative.

00:03:42.367 --> 00:03:45.385
Because of this permanent
dipole of the water molecules,

00:03:45.385 --> 00:03:48.449
you can have attraction, the
partially negative chart sides

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:51.780
are gonna be attracted to the
partially positive charges.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.155
These are the famous
hydrogen bonds of water.

00:03:56.155 --> 00:03:57.655
So that is of H2O,

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.859
so that's going to be,

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.263
either most of the attraction
that you see over there.

00:04:05.263 --> 00:04:09.330
Now all molecular dipoles
don't have to be permanent.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.119
So here is a depiction of
some methane molecules.

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:14.369
Methane is CH4.

00:04:18.622 --> 00:04:21.451
You see in methane that
the carbon is bonded

00:04:21.451 --> 00:04:24.432
somewhat symmetrically, you
have this tetrahedral shape

00:04:24.432 --> 00:04:28.151
where the hydrogens
are evenly distributed,

00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:30.650
they're getting as far away
as they can from each other

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.945
so there's not, it's a very symmetrical

00:04:32.945 --> 00:04:34.755
and three-dimensions shape.

00:04:34.755 --> 00:04:37.527
Also carbon and hydrogen's
electronegativities

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:38.777
aren't that far apart.

00:04:38.777 --> 00:04:41.007
Carbon is a little bit
more electronegative.

00:04:41.007 --> 00:04:44.368
But because they are close
and there's this symmetry

00:04:44.368 --> 00:04:49.153
to the actual molecule, there
isn't a permanent dipole

00:04:49.153 --> 00:04:51.250
in this situation.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.527
However, you have to
remember these electrons

00:04:54.527 --> 00:04:58.032
that are buzzing around
between these bonds

00:04:58.032 --> 00:05:00.907
and around the nuclei
of the different atoms,

00:05:00.907 --> 00:05:03.764
they aren't just staying in one place.

00:05:03.764 --> 00:05:06.431
At any given time you might have

00:05:07.732 --> 00:05:10.982
some of the electrons more on this side

00:05:13.882 --> 00:05:15.299
of this molecule.

00:05:18.071 --> 00:05:21.499
So you'll have a temporary
partial negative charge there,

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:24.746
maybe a temporary partially
positive charge there.

00:05:24.746 --> 00:05:28.913
And that might be the exact
same time that this molecule

00:05:30.022 --> 00:05:34.360
right over here has, this
molecule right over here

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.351
maybe its electrons happened
to be more distributed more

00:05:37.351 --> 00:05:41.518
in that direction so it's
partially negative there

00:05:42.743 --> 00:05:45.125
and partially positive here.

00:05:45.125 --> 00:05:49.500
So when you have just
these random dipoles form,

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.310
at just a certain moment in
time, just based on that moment

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.265
how the electrons are distributed,

00:05:54.265 --> 00:05:56.503
we call that a temporary dipole.

00:05:56.503 --> 00:05:57.920
Temporary dipole.

00:05:59.237 --> 00:06:00.787
And those temporary dipoles

00:06:00.787 --> 00:06:04.267
can create this temporary
forces between molecules.

00:06:04.267 --> 00:06:05.747
We studied that in other videos,

00:06:05.747 --> 00:06:07.773
the famous London dispersion forces.

00:06:07.773 --> 00:06:10.407
Right at the moment that this
one is partially negative

00:06:10.407 --> 00:06:12.893
and this one is partially positive,

00:06:12.893 --> 00:06:15.107
maybe that's right at the
moment that this one is

00:06:15.107 --> 00:06:17.107
partially negative at this side

00:06:17.107 --> 00:06:19.148
and partially positive at this side.

00:06:19.148 --> 00:06:21.236
So the electrons are spending
a little bit more time here

00:06:21.236 --> 00:06:23.790
and so they might be
attracted to each other.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.776
Not only could it just
be a temporary thing,

00:06:26.776 --> 00:06:28.253
it could also be induced.

00:06:28.253 --> 00:06:30.653
If this one just happens
to be in that state

00:06:30.653 --> 00:06:32.635
and is partially positive on this side,

00:06:32.635 --> 00:06:34.655
well, the electrons here on this molecule

00:06:34.655 --> 00:06:35.780
will be naturally attracted

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.894
so it might be an induced dipole.

00:06:37.894 --> 00:06:40.657
And you could have, to be more explicit

00:06:40.657 --> 00:06:43.286
induced dipoles because
of an external force

00:06:43.286 --> 00:06:46.543
of the environment like an electric field,

00:06:46.543 --> 00:06:48.184
you could have an induced dipole.

00:06:48.184 --> 00:06:52.253
Let's say you have a molecule
of H2O right over here

00:06:52.253 --> 00:06:56.420
and let's say you have a
molecule of neutral methane

00:06:58.011 --> 00:06:59.259
right over here.

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:02.377
And that neutral methane, it's
electrons are moving around

00:07:02.377 --> 00:07:05.238
but it has no permanent dipole.

00:07:05.238 --> 00:07:07.859
But as it gets near this water molecule,

00:07:07.859 --> 00:07:10.993
right over here, well it
has a permanent dipole

00:07:10.993 --> 00:07:12.789
where it has a positive charge here

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:15.706
so maybe the methane molecules electrons

00:07:15.706 --> 00:07:20.159
might be attracted more
to that positive charge.

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:22.191
So this situation where you take something

00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:26.136
that otherwise would only
maybe have temporary dipoles

00:07:26.136 --> 00:07:28.651
but because it's electrons
might be attracted to something

00:07:28.651 --> 00:07:30.407
or repelled from something.

00:07:30.407 --> 00:07:32.990
Here you could have an induced,

00:07:33.867 --> 00:07:36.617
you could have an induced dipole.

00:07:37.489 --> 00:07:40.274
And dipoles actually don't
just happen to be with

00:07:40.274 --> 00:07:42.244
multi atom molecules.

00:07:42.244 --> 00:07:44.665
You can even have not permanent dipoles

00:07:44.665 --> 00:07:47.140
but you could have induced
or temporary dipoles

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.612
from a single atom.

00:07:48.612 --> 00:07:51.641
Let's say we were to
take an atom of argon.

00:07:51.641 --> 00:07:55.257
The noble gases are famously non reactive.

00:07:55.257 --> 00:07:59.250
So let's say that this
is one atom of argon.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.908
Let's say that's its electron cloud.

00:08:01.908 --> 00:08:04.152
Let's say that's its nucleus there

00:08:04.152 --> 00:08:07.007
and this is a huge over simplification.

00:08:07.007 --> 00:08:09.479
You could imagine at
just some random point

00:08:09.479 --> 00:08:12.387
the electrons are just a
little bit more distributed

00:08:12.387 --> 00:08:13.823
on that side.

00:08:13.823 --> 00:08:17.858
So you have this temporary
dipole that would form

00:08:17.858 --> 00:08:19.738
where you're more negative here

00:08:19.738 --> 00:08:22.956
and more positive right over here.

00:08:22.956 --> 00:08:25.105
Of course if this is next to something

00:08:25.105 --> 00:08:27.354
they might be able to
interact with each other.

00:08:27.354 --> 00:08:29.878
If this is, maybe you
can even induce this.

00:08:29.878 --> 00:08:31.572
It might not be random,
it might be induced

00:08:31.572 --> 00:08:33.511
by a polar molecule nearby,

00:08:33.511 --> 00:08:35.651
something with a permanent dipole.

00:08:35.651 --> 00:08:38.859
Or it might be induced
by a magnetic field.

00:08:38.859 --> 00:08:42.250
I'll leave you there but this
idea of molecular dipoles

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:44.370
whether they're permanent,
induced or temporary,

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:47.409
it's a really neat idea
because it actually explains

00:08:47.409 --> 00:08:50.381
a lot of the properties of molecules,

00:08:50.381 --> 00:08:52.694
their boiling points,
their freezing points,

00:08:52.694 --> 00:08:55.874
how hard it is to get them
to again to a gaseous state

00:08:55.874 --> 00:08:57.631
versus a liquid versus a solid state.

00:08:57.631 --> 00:08:59.860
And we'll see a lot of that in Chemistry.
