00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.380
NARRATOR: On April 14, 1865,
President Abraham Lincoln

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.460
was shot
[gun shot]

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.380
And killed by this guy--

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.880
John Wilkes Booth, a
well-known stage actor

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.620
and Confederate sympathizer.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.540
What you might not know is
that after firing his gun,

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.330
he fled the scene of
the crime with one

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.710
of the biggest manhunts
in US history on his tail.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.920
After 12 days on the run,
he was finally caught.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.170
Here's how.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.920
After shooting the
president, Booth

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.170
jumped from the
presidential box yelling

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.580
JOHN WILKES BOOTH:
"Sic semper tyrannis!"

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.210
NARRATOR: Which
translates roughly to--

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.830
JOHN WILKES BOOTH: "Thus
always to tyrants."

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.210
NARRATOR: With a broken
leg, he still manages

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.380
to run across the stage and
exit through a side door, where

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.880
his horse was waiting for him
[whinnying]

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.040
Around 4 AM the next morning,
Booth and his accomplice,

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.750
David Harold, arrived at
Dr. Samuel Mudd's house.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.880
Dr. Mudd was also a
Confederate sympathizer,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.330
but he didn't know
Booth had shot Lincoln.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.420
He put Booth's leg in a splint.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.830
When Mudd saw the
paper the next morning,

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.210
he realized he was
housing a fugitive

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.120
and insisted his
two guest leave.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.620
[horse galloping]

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.960
So Booth and Harold
ventured into Zekiah Swamp.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.620
They managed to hide for four
days in a dense pine thicket,

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.880
while more than 1,000 union
soldiers searched for them.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.210
Confederate sympathizers
helped the two

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.750
fugitives cross the Potomac
and the Rappahannock Rivers.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.290
Booth and Harold
then took refuge

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.040
on a farm in eastern
Maryland, pretending to be

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.620
wounded Confederate soldiers.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.580
But a tip led Union
troops to the tobacco barn

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.080
where Booth was sleeping.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.790
They lit the barn on fire.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.290
Booth tried to shoot his way
out, but was shot in the neck.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.540
He died a few hours later.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.420
Soon after, four of his
co-conspirators were hanged.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.250
Booth's body was eventually
returned to his relatives,

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.830
and he was buried
in the family plot.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.960
Today, people leave pennies
on his unmarked grave,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.830
giving Lincoln the last word.
