00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.590
&gt;&gt; DR GRIME: Let's have a look at one of these tests
that they have, that they apply to see

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.870
if a number is prime or not. Well we're going
to use a fact I have mentioned before when talking

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.160
about primes and we're going to use Fermat's
Little Theorem. It's a theorem about prime

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.800
numbers and what it says is that if you have
a number which I'll call 'a' and I'm going

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.800
to raise it to a power 'prime number' so that's
called 'p prime', and I subtract the original

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.550
number then I say that this is divisible by
p. There you go.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.719
So if a number is prime that's always true
for whatever number 'a' you pick. So, let's

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.000
do an example of this, let's pick a prime.
We know 5 is a prime, is it? Isn't it? Yeah, OK.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.300
So 5 is a prime, so let's use that and we'll
pick, well, let's see. 1⁵, that's going to be easy.

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:59.200
1⁵ - 1 = 0. Is it divisible by 5? Yes, we say 0 is divisible by 5.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.500
What about 2? 2⁵ - 2 to get 30.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.350
Hey, and that's divisible by 5 as well. Let's just finish it off.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.930
3⁵ - 3, that's 240 so these
are all divisible by 5.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.580
4⁵ - 4, divisible by 5 again.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.960
What about 5? Yeah, well I think this one's
a bit more obvious, so that's divisible by

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.190
5 too. And that's always going to be true
if the number is prime. And this is what Fermat

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.810
proved in the 17th century, this is absolutely
true for all primes.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.100
Let's try another number, I'll try another
number with you.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.700
I'm going to try the number 341. Does that pass my test?

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.500
2³⁴¹ - 2. That's my test.
Now that's going to be a really large number.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.210
Computers can have methods that make this
easier so that's going to be a really large

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.910
number. I'm not going to write that down.
Huge number, but I can tell you now that this

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.500
number is divisible by the number we're testing.
It was 341. Thumbs up. Yeah, great.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.050
So it's passed the test.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.500
Let's try another one, let's try another test.
Do it with 3 then.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.300
If we do this, 3³⁴¹ - 3. Is this divisible?

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.000
And this is where it fails the test. So this one is not divisible.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Now, if it's not divisible that tells me it's a composite number.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
There only needs to be one exception, it's very easy to fail this test.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.200
The more you pass, the more evidence you are,
that you are a prime and if you fail at all

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.900
then you are a composite number. Only
composite numbers fail. If you have a composite

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:50.000
number and it passes the test here, this number 2
in this case is called a Fermat liar.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.900
Ooooh, it's not really prime, it's lying. It tells
me it's prime and it's not. Naughty!

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.900
This number here 3, which actually shows that
it was composite after all, is called a Fermat witness.

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:11.270
The innocent bystander. He goes in
to a witness protection program in case 2

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.280
comes and chases after him, yeah.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.740
Brady, you ask a good question though.
What would happen if there was a number that was

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:28.700
composite that passed every test up to the
size of the number. Is it possible? Yes it is.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:35.090
There are numbers that will pass this
test for every test you apply.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:43.300
Those are called Carmichael numbers, they have a name.
The first Carmichael number is 561.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:52.000
So what that means is 2⁵⁶¹ - 2 is divisible.  3⁵⁶¹ - 3, that passes the test.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:04:00.400
So does 4. And all the way down to 560 to
the power 561 and it passes the test each time.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.920
&gt;&gt; BRADY: Must be prime!

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.000
&gt;&gt; DR GRIME: Must be prime! Must be prime!  Unfortunately, it's not.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.700
561 is equal to 3 by 11 by 17.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.120
&gt;&gt; BRADY: Those are cool numbers.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.419
&gt;&gt; DR GRIME: Those are really cool numbers
and there infinitely many Carmichael numbers.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:27.300
The third Carmichael Number is mathematician's favourite 1729. Nice.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.300
&gt;&gt; BRADY: Lovely.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.000
&gt;&gt; DR GRIME: Lovely. Now, what do you reckon Brady?

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Do you think this is a good test, or not?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.960
&gt;&gt; BRADY: Well, until you told me about Carmichael
numbers I thought it was a good test. Now

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.559
I think it's almost useless if you're looking
for perfection. Well it is useless.

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:51.319
&gt;&gt; DR GRIME: Yeah, well, it's not perfect.
You're absolutely right. So, if you checked

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:58.319
all numbers less than 25 billion, the number
of numbers that would fail the test if you

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:06.400
used 'a' was 2, alright? If 'a' was 2. The number of numbers that fail that particular version

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:17.400
of that test is 2183 out of 25 billion. That's
just using 2. So only a small fraction fail

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.800
this test, or give you things that you don't
want. Tell you that you have a prime when

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:28.089
you don't have a prime. And you can apply
other numbers anyway, so to pass this test

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:28.860
is actually quite a high bar.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.079
&gt;&gt; BRADY: So it is a good test.

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:34.639
&gt;&gt; DR GRIME: So, it's a fairly, yeah. It's
a fairly good test. Now there are other tests

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:38.719
though, there are better tests that use pretty
much the same idea. Almost exactly the same

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:42.000
idea so if you understood that you'll
understand the other tests as well.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.469
There's one called the Baillie-PSW test, pretty much uses
the same idea as that. Actually uses two tests

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:54.069
in conjunction so you have to pass them both.
Yes, if you pass that test you're probably

00:05:54.069 --> 00:06:01.700
a prime. In fact, they have found no counter
examples. So anything that passes the test

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:08.159
so far has actually been a prime. There's
been no sneaky composite numbers. No counter

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:15.159
example to it. And they've checked large numbers
for this. If you do find a counter example,

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:20.969
if you find a cheeky composite number that
passes the test, the authors originally offered

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:31.000
a prize. You could win $30. $30 could be yours.
Now don't worry, since then the amount of

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.800
the prize, it's gone up since then. You can
now win over $600. $620 in fact. Think of that.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.460
Think of that. Think what you could
do with that money. Ooh, you could buy yourself

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.179
a choc ice every day. Every day for a year.
Twice on Sundays.

00:06:48.179 --> 00:06:57.300
&gt;&gt; DR GRIME: In 2002, they published, or mathematicians
published a new method to test for primes

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:09.000
and finally they found a fast way that was
100%. This is now one of the latest things.
