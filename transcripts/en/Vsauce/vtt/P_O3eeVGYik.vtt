00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.750
Vsauce. Five riddles. Four brand names. Three facts.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.679
Two weird products and one project.
It's 5432-

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:12.889
One project from Instructables. Turn your
Super Nintendo it an ultimate gaming

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:14.259
console emulator

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:17.930
that plays NES, Genesis, N64 and more.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.050
You'll need about 200 dollars in
parts, some free time and own legal copies

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.019
of the games.

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.430
Two weird products.
The first is blood perfume.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.289
It doesn't contain actual human blood,
but they claim the four blood type

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:31.510
scents are somehow

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.809
realistically represented.
Second is elephant poop

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.910
paper. The great elephant PooPooPaper Company

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.090
filters the poop, leaving only the fibers,
grasses, bamboo and fruits that the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.920
elephant couldn't digest.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.370
And no, it doesn't smell.
Three facts.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.219
Honey does not spoil.
Honey found in tombs of Egyptian

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.820
pharaohs has been taited by
archaeologist and found edible.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.890
Aegilops is the longest word in the
English language

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.719
with all the letters in alphabetical
order. When the CD was invented it was

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.700
decided it should be long enough to hold
Beethoven's 9th Symphony at any tempo

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.310
on one

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.860
disc. Four brand names. Sometimes we refer
to products exclusively by their brand name.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.900
Bubble wrap is actually inflated cushioning.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.470
Dumpsters are front loader waste
containers. Jet skis are stand-up

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.150
personal watercrafts.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.170
And velcro is really hook-and-loop fastener.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.800
Five riddles. Mad Gabs are group of words that
don't make sense until you say them

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.299
slowly and discover the hidden phrase or name.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.640
For example, "Able Owe Knees

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.909
Hand Which."
A Bolognese sandwich.

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.229
Here are three Mad Gabs.
"Bigger Scant

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:42.809
Beach Hoosiers."

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.060
"Check Can Tub Ends Talk."

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.900
"Aim Hiker Owes Cope."

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.759
Here's a visual puzzle. What month does this represent?
Finally, here's a riddle from you guys.

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.250
"I was walking on a bridge when I met a
man. He tipped his hat

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.640
and drew his cane. In this riddle I said his name.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.970
What is it?"
Before we go, here's last week's winner.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.040

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.920
And as always,

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.350
