&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.480
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Hey everyone thanks
for coming out on the lovely,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.200
lovely day in D.C. I'm Rob
Casper, thanks to Mary Ann

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.500
and to Diane Abraham and everyone
here at Nichols Center Staff

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.260
for this wonderful series.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.480
We couldn't be happier
that they host us here.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.720
Ron reminded us this
is our 15th event.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.850
It's gotten to the
point where I feel

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.150 position:56%
like we have all the various rituals
that we have, including me getting

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.290
up on the stage and maybe
we'll actually have a stretch

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.090
at some point for those of you

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.380
who have been here a
lot, you're used to it.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.390
Ron is an amazing guy.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.010
What Ron does with our --

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.340
&gt;&gt; Move it along.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.690
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Just blows my mind.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:20.160
I'm not going to say anything
more, because he won't let me.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:29.110
Let me tell you a little
bit about the poetry center

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.350
at the Library of Congress.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.260
We are home to the [Inaudible]
consultant and poetry.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.810
We also put on all sorts of
programs throughout the year.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.810
We have two great programs
coming out on the 20th

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.220
of April we have our
[Inaudible] reading

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.220
with [Inaudible] this
year Claudine Marankin

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.870
and who is the other, Nate Mackie.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.770
They make a fabulous pair.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.110
And on the 26th our [Inaudible],
that includes all sorts of stuff,

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.790
I can't tell you about
until tomorrow.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.090
If you want to find out
more about our programs,

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.330
you can visit our website
www.loc.gov/poetry.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.710
I also just wanted to
mention you all see this here?

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.010
Its a little survey,
you should have it.

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.310
If you don't mind filling
it out after the event

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.610
and let us know how we
did, that would be perfect.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.890
And now I want to introduce Dana
Levin, our 2016-2017 series.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.480
Dana grew up in California's
Mojave Desert and earned a BA

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.010
from Pitzer College and an
MA from New York University.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.510
Her collections of poetry
include "In the Surgical Theater",

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.810
"Wedding Day", "Sky
Burial" and "Banana Palace',

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.110
which was published last
year by Canyon Press, thanks.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.740
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Selecting
Levin's manuscript

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.490
for the American Poetry Review
[Inaudible] praised the work

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.250
as "sensuous, compassionate,
violent, extravagant".

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.960 position:56%
In the Surgical Theater, also in the
John C. Zacharis First Book Award,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.810
the Ploughshares and
the PEN/Osterweil Award.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.690
In 2014, then the US Poet Laureate
selected Dana Levin for fellowship

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.040
from the Library of Congress.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.290
Levin's many other
honors include fellowships

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.090
from Guggenheim foundation,
the National Dow for the Arts,

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.800
the Rona Jaffe Foundation
and the Whiting Foundation.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.200
She previously taught at
the University of Mexico,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.070
Santa Fe University of Art and
Design and the college of SantÃ© Fe.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.790
She currently serves as the
distinguished writer and residence

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.920
at Marysville University,
and she just moved

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.420
or is about to [Inaudible]
St. Louis, Missouri.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.510
So, please join me in
welcoming Dana Levin.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.070
[ Applause ]

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.700
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I'm so glad
you're here, thank you for coming.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.000
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: My pleasure.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.850
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: We discovered we
have three things I common already.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.440
We both love poetry, we
both work in St. Louis

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.310
and we're both Buffy
the Vampire fans.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.700
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yes, definitely.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.520
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Not the
weirdest coincidence.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.240
When I first came to the post
in 2005 one of my jobs was

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.540
to edit a column we used

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.520
to have called the Poets
Choice, a much beloved column.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.590
And Robert Pinsky was the
poet and one of his columns;

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.270
this was the first few
months that I was here.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.230
One of his poems was
explaining what an image is.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.520
He wrote, "Images can be
satisfactorily clear in one way,

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.010
and excitingly inexplicable
in another".

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.410
Here's an example he said.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.020
And then he published
one of your poems.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.160
Probably the first
poem of yours I read.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.460
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Wow.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.760
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.490
"Six monarch butterfly
cocoons clinging

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.210
to the back of your throat".

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:22.820
Will you read the rest of
that or the whole part?

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.120
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Sure.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.810
Ours poetica.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:33.750 position:56%
Six monarch butterfly cocoons
clinging to the back of your throat.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.580
You could feel their
gold wings trembling.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.730
You were alarmed.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.030
You felt infested.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.850
In the downstairs bathroom
of the family home,

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.440
gagging to spit them out.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.090
And a voice saying, "Don't, don't".

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.830
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: No for Pinsky
that was an example of an image

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.450
that makes you feel something
that you wouldn't feel

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.080
through any kind of
literal description.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.440
Talk about how an image
works for you?

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.420
What an image does for you?

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.910
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: I would
say an image is a portal

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.740
for realization and discovery.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.750
So, I have always had what
I call image fascination.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.800 position:56%
Whether I'm looking at art or seeing
something in the world or something

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.620
that comes into my inner eye.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.090
My dreams are very visual.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.660
I pay a lot of attention to
these images and especially

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.530
in my early life as a poet;
the poems almost always began

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.070
with an image that I
couldn't get out of my head.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.450
And often times the act of writing
the poem was why can I not get this

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.030
image out of my head.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.880
And so in entering the
image, the image just sort

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.180
of became a constellation
usually of all sorts of material.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.640
And you know there's a
psychotherapeutic idea

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.590
that the symbol is
the most economic way

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:12.880
to communicate very complicated
contradictory constellations

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.470
of information.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.560
So, which is something I believe.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.860
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And do.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.160
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Or try.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.460
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: There are images

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.100
that make us see something
literal, much more clearly.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.400
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yes.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.700
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: But that's
not what that image was?

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.000
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: No,
actually sometimes

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.130
when the image unfolds it's more
mysterious than it even was before.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.440
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: But
it gives you a feeling

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.160
that no literal explanation
could invoke in you.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.460
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yes.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.760
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: When
I was teaching English

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.930
and Poetry I would have
students, and maybe you do too,

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.450
although your students
are probably older.

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.160 position:56%
And they would say "Well why doesn't
the poet just say what she wants

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.460
to say.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.880
Why encode it and then
make us uncode it"?

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.180
Do you ever hear that?

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.860
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yeah.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.230
[ Laughter ]

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.900 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You make a sarcastic
crack in one of your poems.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:05.460
You say "We are getting such
lovely flourishes from our poets.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.910
What's your answer to that student?

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.650
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Gosh, well first
I would probably say the world

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.200
is complicated.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.040
The world is not easily
understandable.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.800
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Why make
it worse with poetry then?

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.320
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Well
because of that experience,

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.100
you know having the
experience of discovery,

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.390
which means you have
to wade through things.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:34.320 position:56%
Now not everybody has tolerance -
well everybody has a different level

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.470
of tolerance for how much
time they want to spend wading

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:43.300
through information, or not
information, let's say an image.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:49.430
And poetry, one of the reasons why
it's such a subversive art form is

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:54.570
that it has the capacity to
really ask you to just slow down,

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:58.430
and be with your discomfort
and your uncertainty

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.760
and you're not knowing
and your confusion.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.140
And one of the things I always
tell my students is I got this

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:09.320
from the critic, Helen Vendler who
said, "Instead of reading a poem

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.430
and saying "What does this
poem mean" it's better

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:17.230
for the first question to be either
"How does this poem make me feel"

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.790
or "How does the speaker
of the poem seem to feel"?

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.500
And I think that 80 to 90%

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.350
of the time you can tell
what the feeling is even

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:33.440
if you are not quite certain
what the narrative sense is

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.900
or the intent is and
that kind of stuff.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.290
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And
you may never get that.

00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:39.730 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: You may never get it.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: In one of your poems
you write, "I would be disingenuous

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.920
if I said "Being understood
were not important to me".

and the floor of public speech,

between the coin and the hand it
crosses, mercantilists and governors

and preachers alike, the
imagination and its product

00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.770
so often rebuff purpose and some
of us don't like it and wanted

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:03.520
to make it mean, I would
never shoot you even

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.510
if you were the only meat around".

so demonstrates what you're doing.

I'm with you right at that top line.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.660
It's totally explicit.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:14.960
I know exactly what
you mean and then

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.810
by the end you have the surprising
witty metaphor that is arresting

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.830
and surprising and funny.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.130

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.430

&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.330
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: So actually
this poem came out of -

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.570
I have a long correspondence
with a poet named GC Waldrep.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:38.830
And well I'm somebody who
hoards scraps and failed poems

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:42.290
and journal entries and
I'm constantly going back

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:47.010
into that material and seeing
if I can smash it together

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:48.900
and make something happen with it.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.370
And with this poem I just
started to like how I sounded

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:56.960
when I was writing to GC
because it seemed like language

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.140
that didn't often make
it into my poems.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.780
So, I actually took about 25
pages of our correspondence

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:05.850
and I just started to highlight
anything that didn't sound

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:08.300
like how I usually sound.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.700
And the I whittled down to
10 pages and I whittled it

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:15.070
down to three pages and then - so
these are all things I said to GC.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:16.370
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Excellent.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.610
And how important is it to
you really to be understood?

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:21.130
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Well, it's
going to sound ridiculous.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.130
This is probably the
torture of all poets.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:24.660
It's deeply important to me.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.290
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Because you
are the - and I say this

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:32.070
with complete respect,
you are a difficult poet.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.370
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: My mother
would agree.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:37.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You're worth
it; you're totally worth it.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.220
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Thank you.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:43.490
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: But it's not two
roads you know diverged in a wood.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:44.790
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: No, I mean I -

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:48.690
yeah and it's actually a current
despair at mid-life, it is.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.130
You're like "What am I doing".

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.150
Shouldn't I just say it?

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:57.460
But I - what I tell my students,
I keep going back to this

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:01.080
because I feel like this is
where I articulate my thought

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.060
that I don't even know I think.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.480
But I told my students that you -

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.780
and you have to determine what
your relationship is to a reader.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:13.930
And for myself it's poem by
poem; so there's certain poems

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:18.230
where I'll just love a
weirdness that's developing

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.410
or a turn a phrase
that's developing.

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:26.930
And I know that somebody else
may not necessarily understand

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:28.430
or get what I see in it.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:29.730
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.570
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: But because of the
tactile quality of the language

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:33.980
or the image I just
want to preserve it.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:44.320
And so then I'm just like "Meh
the reader can figure it out".

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:49.570
And then there's other [Inaudible]
if I'm successful at those moments

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:57.180
of clarity or not, but and I
love mystery, and I love puzzles

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:01.150
and I love being disturbed
by something

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.150
and not knowing why I'm disturbed.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:09.560
And so that quality I think
comes back into the poems

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:14.280 position:56%
and I guess a reader of my work
will either like being in that state

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.260
or will be like I'm throwing
this book across the room.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.660
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I'm sure
that does not happen often.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:22.240
There's a poem you've
written called "Last Heart",

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.840
which is a poem about
teaching poetry.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.140
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yes.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:30.040
I haven't read this
poem in maybe 15 years.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.950
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Are there any
words you can't pronounce?

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.250
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Who knows?

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:34.910
We're going to find out.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:38.450
Tell me if I'm laughing too loud.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.730
And this poem ended up - there's
stuff about my grandparents

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:45.180
that came into this poem
that I didn't expect.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.510
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's surprising
as a reader when you hit it.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:49.810
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Okay.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.030
Glass Heart.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:56.440
"Could the west creep into
your idea of happiness?

00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:02.980 position:56%
Abundance, which gave no comfort,
in which your loneliness was spared.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:09.190
The student wrote, she
wipes tears from her heart.

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:16.330
Forgotten on the kitchen table,
glassy, beaded with sweat.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.300
"The line is too sentimental"
said the teacher unless I see

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.600
it literally.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.730
Taking a sponge to
the anatomical heart,

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:26.170
wiping and wiping the tears off it.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:29.090
Glass heart, so transparent.

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:32.860 position:56%
The tears drove around its Autobahn.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:35.560
Then the kids came home
and found it pulsing there,

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.890
like in a washing machine.

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:41.850
You could see the grief
go round and round.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:47.390
The student wrote, "Sucking tears
out of her aorta with a straw".

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:51.010
A bitterness so pronounced
it was kind of ammonia.

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:53.350
A world in which one
could lose one's parents

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.850
and be put on a train alone.

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:59.750
Her grandfather had owned
a little store for years.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:03.010
They can shoot out the windows
he would say wagging a finger,

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:06.670
as long as they don't
set the street on fire.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:10.210
Glass heart, so transparent.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:12.470 position:56%
Was it their mothers, their fathers?

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.440
It lay weeping in the heat.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.690
But they had to leave to
help deliver groceries.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:22.150
The student wrote "In
my left, my heart.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.760
My right, my bone.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.620
Beating my heart like
a bloody drum".

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:31.860
Ovens the grandfather muttered,
in Russia they ate us raw.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.810
So, transparent.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.850
Meal after meal no one claimed it.

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:39.350
After a while no one saw it.

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:44.880
Though it ticked at the center of
the table like a clock, singing oh,

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:50.490
this sack of water swaying
on its hook of bone.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:52.850
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That makes me
want to teach poetry again.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:55.420
Because what the poem does

00:14:55.420 --> 00:15:01.710
so brilliantly is demonstrate
you teaching poetry,

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:04.460
while teaching us poetry.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.090
You move from the students
flat, clichÃ©,

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:12.170
bland images to your own
arresting, surprising images.

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.270
Moving back and forth.

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:17.350
It's a little more clear
when you read it yourself,

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:18.740
parts are in italics and set off.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:22.690
But I think you read it in a
way that we could follow it.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:23.990
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Oh good.

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.290
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:26.590
Too sentimental, unless
I see it literally.

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:29.770
How does that guide
your work generally?

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:32.070
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Well you know -

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:38.660 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: For myself, like for
instance I remember auditing a class

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:42.160
with Charles Simmick when I
was in my 20's and he went off

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.570
on how the moon was a dead symbol.

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:46.070
And I was insulted.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:50.490
I was 22. I wanted to
write about the moon.

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:52.760
How can the moon be a dead symbol?

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.260
But I think what he was trying
to say was that you know,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.000
how many poems have
had the moon in it?

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.710 position:56%
And later it made me - as I was like
reading actually a lot of Haiku,

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:04.560
I was thinking about the
Haiku masters and how

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:11.340
for them the classic Haiku
masters like Basho and Issa.

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:17.310
Their mastery was displayed by
how well they worked variations

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:24.270
of tropes, like if you were going
to write a Haiku about autumn,

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:28.580
you had to have the harvest moon in
it, or you had to have cider in it

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:30.010
or these things called Keego.

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:33.700
And this idea about variation
rather than originality,

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.350
the west is very focused
on I'm going

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:38.300
to invent something out of nothing.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.600
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.900
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Which of
course doesn't ever happen.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It
gets harder and harder.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.220
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: I don't think
anything is source less,

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:49.290
so the Haiku masters were really
interesting to read about in terms

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:53.870
of that it wasn't about - that the
originality was inside variation.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:55.960
So I feel like the -
I'm going around this.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.680
This is what usually happens to me.

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:05.010
If I want to write a poem about the
moon and I'm trying to avoid all

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:08.900
of the clichÃ©s about the moon, or
if I want to write about the heart.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.500
This is even better, and I
want to avoid all the clichÃ©s

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.360
about the heart, well most of the
clichÃ©s about the heart have to do

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:21.460
with sentimentality or kind
of modeling feeling or cutesy

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:26.970
or so for me the best way to
bypass that was to actually look

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.400
at the anatomy of the heart.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:33.180
I actually got a book - I actually
got Grey's Anatomy when I was

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:36.810
in grad school and I wanted
to actually look at the heart.

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:42.190
And could I bring that language,
that anatomical language back

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:49.030
into the image of a heart and
somehow renew it for myself.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:51.660
And also do other weird things
to it like a glass heart,

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.100
that has an Autobahn inside it.

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.250
If you think about blood cells -

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:56.550
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:57.850
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Blood
cells moving through -

00:17:57.850 --> 00:17:59.150
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: A washing machine.

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:00.450
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Exactly;
yeah, why not?

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:01.750
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:03.540 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Don't you want to put
your heart in the washing machine?

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.510
There's many of us
who would benefit.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:10.230
[ Laughter ]

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.750
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Does it
work with the students?

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:13.050
Do they see that?

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.970
Can they hear how startling that is
compared to their own bland word?

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:19.240
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: In defense
of my students,

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.990
I've had really amazing
students in my time.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:24.110
I don't think talent
is a rare commodity.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:26.030
I think discipline
is a rare commodity

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:28.700
and vocation is just
something that happens.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.630
But I think talent is everywhere.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:32.180
Yeah with some students, yes.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.320
But sometimes you have
to trick them.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.620
Like you have to trick them

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:40.420
into discovering their own
idiosyncratic vividness and that's

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:45.140
where exercises, assignments
and stuff can be really helpful

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:48.490
to get them to have to skirt
around what they think a poem is.

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:49.790
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.090
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Or what
they think a poem can do.

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:52.390
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: We
have so much language

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:53.690
on the shelves just
waiting to be brought -

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:54.990
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Absolutely.

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:56.840
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Like last
week's shirts and worn again.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:02.250
Read a poem about poetry.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.440
You write really good
poems about poetry.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.740
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Thank you.

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.040
When this book came out
some people were unhappy

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.520
that there were poems about poetry.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.050
Well it was kind of fashionable to
write poems about poetry during -

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:12.350
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I've read
a lot about - of them

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:14.630
and I think yours are
really exceptional.

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:16.040
I can't pronounce this title.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.610
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Quelque chose.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:18.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What does that mean?

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:21.620
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: It's
French for something.

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:22.920
It's kind of -

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.220
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's
not very helpful at all.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:27.350
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: It's - if
anybody here speaks French,

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:29.640 position:56%
please correct me if I am incorrect.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.650
It's kind of like a French
version of whatever, sort of.

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:34.510
Is that correct?

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:35.810
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:37.110
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Excellent.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.640
I think there's also
a cuss word in here.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.030
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: There are some,
its okay; we're all adults here.

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:44.180
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: The entire
field of language is available.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.470
Okay. Quelque chose.

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:50.810
"You want to get in and
then get out of the box.

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:52.970
Form, breakage, form.

00:19:52.970 --> 00:20:00.310 position:56%
I was at the fish shop wondering why
being experimental means not having

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:02.070
a point.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:06.980
Why experimentation in form
is sufficient unto itself.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:12.100
Is it? But I needed a new way
to say things, sad, tired,

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:17.810
I with its dulled violations,
lyric with loss in its faculty den.

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:19.580
Others were just throwing a veil

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.810
over suffering, glittery,
interesting.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:24.820
I don't exist.

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:29.620
All over town I marched
around ranting my jeremiad.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:33.880
Thinking what good is form
if it doesn't say anything?

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:38.090 position:56%
Any by say, I mean wake somebody up.

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:39.520
Even here at the shores

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:45.640 position:56%
of Lake Champlain mothers were
wrenching small arms out of sockets.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.280
Not just the mothers.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.950
What were the fathers doing,

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:53.150
wrenching small arms
out of bedside caches?

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:55.890
How could I disappear into language

00:20:55.890 --> 00:21:00.660
when children were being called
fuckers by their mothers?

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:04.190
Who were being called
cunts by their boyfriends?

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:08.330
Who were being called
dickheads, behind their backs?

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:10.340
It wasn't that I was
a liberal Democrat;

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:17.520
it was that bodies had been
divested of their souls like poems.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.480
Trying to get in or out of the box.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:25.910
And the scallops said "Neulle
idees que dans les choses."

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:28.460
And I said "I'll have
the Captain's special

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.070
with wedges instead of fries".

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:34.260
And everywhere in the fish
shop the argument raged,

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.130
its baroque proportions.

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:39.600
The conflict between
harmony and invention.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:45.030
But then brilliance, the
movement of her gloved hands

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:48.420
as she laid the haddock
out one by one.

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:52.940
The sheer transparency of
her latex fingers in and out

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:57.740
of the lit displayed case
as if they were yes, fish.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:01.480
Laying haddock out in a
plastic tub on a bed of ice.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:05.830
Her lank brown hair pulled
back from her ace with a band.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.020
Yes it was true she had
to do this for the market,

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:11.140
but there was such beauty in it.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.090
She was the idea called tenderness.

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:15.540
She was a girl who stood

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:19.240
under fluorescent lights
making six bucks an hour.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.120
And she looked up at me
and held out a haddock

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:29.090
with both her hands saying it was
the best of the mornings catch.

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:33.120
Neule idees que dans les choses
is a French version for no ideas,

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.080
but in things which we get
from William Carlos Williams.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.180
And this was my poem
against [Inaudible].

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:43.800
I don't think anybody knows.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.100
Now I've told you.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.680
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It does seem
like a pretty broad attack

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.900
on the blandness of modern poetry.

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:54.080
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Well yeah or just
the idea - this book was written

00:22:54.080 --> 00:23:00.270
at a moment when poetry
world was very enamored

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:03.620
of what we now call
the elliptical poem.

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.360
It seems so dated now actually.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.950
The world has moved in
such interesting ways.

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:14.460
But after 50 years of the
hegemony, of the confessional poem

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:19.610
and plain style confessional
poetry, suddenly people remembered

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:22.200
about the tactility of
language which was exciting.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:28.930
And ideas about post structural
philosophy started to come in

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:30.400
and mess up people's minds.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.920
There is no author text, speak
to other text, blah, blah, blah.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:39.240
So, I found this poetry, this -

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.950
a lot of the time surfaces
were gorgeous

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:44.800 position:56%
and fascinating and they were empty.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.250
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: They didn't
wake anyone up as you say?

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:47.550
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: They
didn't wake anyone up,

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:50.870
so that poem was a direct response
and all the French is in there

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:53.190
because I was mad at [Inaudible].

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:55.420
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And you say how
can you write poems like that

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.250
that are just experimental but are
just clever, that are fascinating.

00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:01.500
When so many people around
you are physically suffering.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:08.100
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yes, today
that poetry will go nowhere

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.280 position:56%
because we're in a different moment.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.250
It's very interesting
to be alive for a while

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:14.960
and see this stuff change.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.260
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:19.670
Let's talk about the
body and the soul.

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:23.550
Many of your poems explore these
profound and ancient questions

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:28.160
between the material body, which
you call throughout your books meat

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:32.030
and the soul.

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:36.310
The soul that crammed a dark thing
in the body, bitten and chained.

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:39.760
In another poem you write "Mine's
an accident of bio-wiring",

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.460
that's one line of thinking.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:44.720
We're animals that shit out
consciousness, that's another.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:50.200
It's frequently an impatience to
be disembodied in your poetry.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:54.330
You write in one, who will
help me avoid my meat suit?

00:24:54.330 --> 00:25:00.520
Your latest book opens
with the ironic lines

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:04.610
"We used our texting machines to
look up the definition of soul".

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:06.220
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yeah.

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:07.950
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You
didn't find it there?

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:09.630
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: We found
a definition.

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:10.990
It's all theoretical.

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:14.420
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Your
first book begins

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:17.270
with a really weird
poem, Lenin's Bath.

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:18.570
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yes.

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:19.870
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That was
a daring, daring choice.

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:22.790
Do I have the right one?

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:26.180
Yeah. I'd also like to know
why you opened with that poem.

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:27.480
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Oh I felt like -

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.940
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Nobody
knows who you are.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:33.830
You're publishing your first
book and you open with this poem.

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:38.880
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: I think it's because
it just set the terms for the book.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.910
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I think it sets
the terms for your whole career.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:43.150
You couldn't have done that then.

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:44.900
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: I didn't, no.

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:49.830
So this poem, it's called
Lenin's Bath and it came out of -

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:53.090
this book was published in1999,

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:56.540
but a lot of the poems were
written between the late 80's.

00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:02.550
No, like early 90's and the
wall had just barely come down;

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:04.870
so all these things were happening
and the former Soviet Union

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:10.410 position:56%
like what do we do with Lenin's body
that's been embalmed forever and is

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:13.930 position:56%
like in this mausoleum and there was
some article in the New York Times

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:19.200
that talked about the doctor whose
job it was to care for Lenin's body

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.030
and it was pretty fascinating to me

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:24.970
that they had kept this body
going for I don't know -

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:26.270
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Decades.

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:27.570
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yeah.

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:28.870
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: In
really good shape.

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:30.470
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yeah,
well, oh my God.

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:31.890
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: They
spent so much money on it.

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:33.190
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Poor Lenin.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:34.490
Poor, sad Lenin.

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:40.090
And there was a quote in the
article, the future of the body,

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:43.230
that's a purely political question.

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:48.850
Which I found fascinating
at the time

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:57.210
because no, at least not this body.

00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:00.080
So it's called Lenin's Bath.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:04.470
The assistants lift
him gently, gently.

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:09.130
For a moment, the one lifting
under his arms is in the attitude

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:14.300
of an artistic sorrow--
It is the Deposition,

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:17.230
the taking own of the God.

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:21.470
But then one of them wraps his
limp body around him like a coat,

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:26.340
marches around to the laughter,
saying, "Comrades, comrades--

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:33.870
" He is dead, he is so dead he is
nothing, he is a cloth to tend.

00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:37.510
When Debov walks in,
disheveled, yawning,

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:40.940
the assistants are all
business, filling the vat

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:46.540
with the secret fluid that makes
him supple, that makes him clean.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:50.490
They are so tender,
lowering him into the tub.

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:55.710
Their gloved hands
come away fleshy pink.

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:59.540
When they've gone,
Debov sits watching.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:04.860
He imagines the sheath of bacteria
he knows is there, incessant,

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:08.480
biological, seeking a way in.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:15.190 position:56%
They push and gather at every pore,
but the flesh is sealed-- His doing.

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:19.320
Soaking in his vat of embalming
fluid, Lenin looks restful,

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:23.420
meditative, a high official
in his bath in his dacha,

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.370
far away from the controlled
air of the mausoleum,

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:29.940
the schoolchildren filing
past him unblinking,

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:33.740
the veterans who stand,
expressionless.

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:39.070
Debov watches as the germs crawl
up and down the length of the body,

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:42.850
scouring, sniffing
for that open hole--

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:47.160
The cold windows in the laboratory
condense with his breath,

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.870
and the flies lie hungry
in the snow.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:01.580
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It works so well
because it raises this issue

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:04.390
about what is the body and
how does it relate to identity

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:07.040
in a very macabre,
comic way in this poem.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.230
And then other poems
it's very serious.

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:10.530
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yes.

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:17.940
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Why is that
such a compelling issue for you?

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:21.030
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: I've never
felt at home in my body.

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:23.150
My body has been a
source of difficulty

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:27.330
for me both physically
and aesthetically.

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:31.320
You know and women
we have this issue.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.850
We never look like what the
magazines tell us we should

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:35.150
look like.

00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:38.790
We - you know that kind
of stuff, but I think also

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:43.960
when I was born my mother - my
mother was actually the first woman

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.550 position:56%
in California to have amniocentesis.

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:50.190
So actually she was in an - like
one of those operating theaters

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:51.810
where all those people
were like watching,

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:55.890
so even then in the
womb I was like -

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:58.150
anyway it's something
called Rh factor.

00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:03.550
So her body was treating
me like an invader.

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:04.860
So they had to induce labor.

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:06.200
I was born at eight months.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.500
I weighed four pounds.

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.500
I immediately started to die.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:12.570
They didn't know exactly what
it was, but they knew it was one

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:14.880
of my vital organs; so
they basically just opened

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.960
up from sternum to pelvis and
they took out part of my intestine

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:22.490
and I had a colostomy bad for
the first two years of my life.

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:24.700
And I was in an incubator
for two months, sorry -

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.800 position:56%
for the first two months of my life.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.020
And I've got these scars
all over my stomach still.

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:34.850
And I've got scars on my
ankles from where they fed me.

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:37.210
They put a feeding
tube in my ankles.

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:39.980
And my nails and my teeth
are screwed up because

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:43.320
of how many antibiotics they
gave me when I was that little.

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:48.280
And so - and then alter in
life you know, just discovering

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.990
that like certain posture issues,

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:54.990
like a musculoskeletal issues
actually stem from that

00:30:54.990 --> 00:31:03.410
because of how deep they cut in
and so the body has been difficult.

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:11.410
And also a story like when I was
a kid and I'd be like you know,

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:13.550
my parents would tell me the
story of what happened to me,

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:16.430
and it was like hearing a
tale about someone else.

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:17.730
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:20.780
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Because I
wasn't expected to live.

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:22.310
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Our
bodies are us, but not us.

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:25.290 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yeah and you know you
just realize incarnation is probably

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:29.520
the most heroic thing
any of us can accomplish.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:34.050
Because it is really hard
in here wouldn't you agree?

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:42.260
And so, I think that there's
also a dissociative quality

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:45.820
to my personality that maybe
comes from some of that too

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:51.670 position:56%
where the spirit really wants to get
as far away from this as possible.

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:56.980
And then I tell my students I
- I say the beginning of art

00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:01.750
and religion is the first time
aug found oog dead on the ground

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:05.670
and went "oog" like wake up
and there's no oog in there.

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:10.580
And Aug is like, wow where'd he go.

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:16.950
Cause there's his body but
whatever he was is not in there.

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:19.280
That's it, that's the beginning.

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:22.710
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Paul
[Inaudible] Allen.

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:25.010
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yeah.

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.120
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: This
is what I meant by one

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.080 position:56%
of the darker, it's not comic poems.

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.230
But this [Inaudible]
and the identity.

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:39.700
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yeah so when
I was in grad school at NYU,

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:43.330
Sharon Olds had started
an amazing program

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:45.660
at Goldwater Hospital
on Roosevelt Island.

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:51.920 position:56%
And Goldwater Hospital, if my memory
is serving me correctly was either

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:54.410
city run or state run
like nursing home,

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:58.380 position:56%
so the people that were there didn't
have - I don't think they had money.

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:04.070 position:56%
There were all sorts of people there
who were - had all sorts of problems

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:07.420
with their body from you
know OD's that had gone wrong

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:10.160
and messed somebody up to people

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:13.530
with really debilitating
degenerative diseases.

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:17.780 position:56%
So, she started this writing program
for the patients at Goldwater

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:22.440
and the grad students at NYU had
an opportunity to work with them.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.100
And you would - there
was a workshop,

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:29.890
some of them couldn't speak, some
of them were using letter boards.

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:34.310
Some of them were just present and
you couldn't necessarily even tell

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:38.130
if they were participating
or not, but they were there.

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:42.750
And then you would sometimes come
on different days to transcribe.

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:47.400
And Paul Ruseau, he spelled his
name like the French Philosopher

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.910
but a nurse later told me his
last name was really R-U-S-S-O.

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:56.100
I don't know what his physical - I
don't know what his diagnosis was

00:33:56.100 --> 00:34:00.720
but he was in a wheelchair
and he could not hold a pen.

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:05.280
But he wrote reams
and reams of poems.

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.450
I mean I went into his
room at the hospital

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:09.820
and there were just
drawers full of poems.

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:14.990
And I helped him as best I could
for the time that I was there.

00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:16.920
And they were good poems.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.650 position:56%
And I remember one time just hanging

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:21.700
out with him eating
Easter candy, you know?

00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:25.610
And so anyway, this is Paul.

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:28.230
Paul Roosevelt Island.

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:33.180
The broken teeth, the ulcers,
eating into the backs of people

00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:37.450
who have spent years sitting in
chairs, in the green tiled halls

00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:42.820
of a hospital, trying to find a
place to read, to think, to find,

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:48.350
like Faye, a place to turn one's
back and cry, to say, like Faye,

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:51.640
When I cry I know it is Jesus
crying, because Jesus is

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:55.820
in my chest, he's crying
for me, for my cut-off legs,

00:34:55.820 --> 00:35:00.860
he's crying for you Paul, your feet
bent like his, your bones stuck

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:04.660 position:56%
like nails through the flesh of your
body, pinning you to a wheelchair

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:09.560
for twenty-three years, your hands
shaped like claws, skin-hard,

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:13.650
tremoring, your shirt covered
with egg yolk and coffee,

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:17.930
your green pants stained with
pus and shit- and the doctors,

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:22.700
gliding by you like sails, saying
Hello, Hello, as you open the stink

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:26.550
of your plaque-caked mouth and
say Hello, you are beautiful,

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:30.390
your soft eyes, your old
man smell, the way you stick

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:34.830 position:56%
out your clawed hand to shake mine
and say Thank you, popping chocolate

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:39.470 position:56%
in your mouth when we shared Easter
candy, the dull brown saliva falling

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:44.230
in torrents because you couldn't
stop talking about poetry Paul.

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:48.450
I see you in a wheelchair, on the
weed strewn windswept eastside

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:52.960
of the island, the Pepsi sign
curling over the banks of Queens,

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:57.990 position:56%
the clouds rolling black in from the
Hudson, and you are saying Yes, now,

00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:02.310
I am giving myself up to the
wind, I am a kite, I am a bird,

00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:06.710
I am weightless and beyond
gravity, slipping up and diffusing,

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:11.930 position:56%
the million captive particles of me
falling like mist over the hospital,

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:15.030
because I am wholly
mind, wholly air,

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:18.510
I am dropping these
wrecked bone shackles.

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:25.170
[ Applause ]

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:27.770
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: I should
write my first book again.

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:34.400
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah,
we're all eventually Paul.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:39.420
We all eventually want to get out
of our ruined bodies by the end.

00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:40.720
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: We do.

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.780
I have a lot to say about
what we do with our elderly

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.470
and dying in this country.

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:49.480
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah, I am
wholly mind he says in the end.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.790
Wholly air.

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:53.730
I'm dropping these
wrecked bone shackles.

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:57.610
That's an ancient idea before
Christianity of course,

00:36:57.610 --> 00:37:00.500
adopted this Paul was
very much into that idea,

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.270
but it started before him, right?

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:06.180
The idea of the spirit
and the mind that the body

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:08.520
and the identity were somehow
at odds with one another

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.080
and would eventually
be separated again.

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.700
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yeah, it's
tough because sometimes I feel

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:16.320
like they took it way too far
the Judao Christians in terms

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:20.480 position:56%
of like the body is evil, you should
just be focusing on your spirit.

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.930
But we have to figure
out how to be in here.

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:25.320
I mean we have to figure
out how to do this.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:29.770
I don't think it's about
not doing this, you know?

00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:33.530
I think it's about how do I have
a mind, and how do I have a body.

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:34.910
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right you
ask in one of your poems,

00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:37.790
do you think this is repulsive?

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:39.580
You're sort of daring us.

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:42.870
Yeah. And another poem about
being drawn to a movie theater.

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:45.210
It's obviously about much more.

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:47.760
You speak of the great relief
of just not being in the world,

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.310
just being able to watch.

00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:54.150
The lights go off and you're not
you anymore, you're just as you say

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:58.100
to give up the burden awhile,
to be an eye, perceiver,

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:01.090
God of the Kingdom, to
have that emersonian moment

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:04.060
where you're just the eye,
the transparent eyeball.

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:07.670
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yeah for a long time
that was my biggest goal in life -

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:12.260
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Was to
be a transparent eyeball?

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:13.560
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yeah.

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.890
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It - do you have
that disembodied perspective

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:18.070
in another poem you
right and the poet says

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:19.830 position:56%
"You may not admit to bone or flesh.

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:22.720
You must not have nerves
in the tip of your fingers.

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.410
You may say fist, you may say
teeth but you may not put them

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:27.090
in the same sentence together.

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:28.850
You must not put them
in the body together".

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:32.880
You're obviously mocking
that idea in a way.

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.180
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yes.

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.650
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The opening
poem of banana palace,

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:39.330
your latest book contains
these lines "We had a dream

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:43.850
that we could smash the bands of
matter and time and still be alive.

00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:48.640
Was that the soul wishing we would
invent the body out of existence?

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:51.580
So many of us now enthralled
by doom".

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:58.520
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Let's stand up,
turn around and sit back down.

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.540
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Dmitry Itskov.

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:27.840
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Itskov.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.580
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That is a
funny poem, what a weird guy.

00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:31.880
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Oh yeah.

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.180
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's not
a real person you'd read

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:34.480
about in the newspaper right?

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.460
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Actually that
poem is a big faker because all

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:39.960
of the lines were stolen from
articles in the New York Times

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:43.070
and Huffington Post except
for line four through six.

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:45.180
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's not
a faker; that's amazing.

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:46.920
That is amazing.

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:48.220
Wait till you hear this poem.

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:50.970
This strange young man wants

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:53.840
to basically translate
himself into a machine.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.140
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yes.

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:56.440
He's a billionaire.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.740
He's a Russian billionaire.

00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:59.660
He's spending all of his
money trying to figure out how

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:02.790
to download consciousness
into mechanical bodies.

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:04.090
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So he's the -

00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:08.670
it's sort of a non-religious
pursuit of this Pauline idea.

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:10.800
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Well you know
he's interesting to read about.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.550
He says it's the cure for hunger,

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:14.040
it's the cure for so
many of our ills.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:20.620
And I can intellectually understand

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:25.090
but I think there is a
great spiritual purpose

00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:31.220
to being incarnated and we're
just endlessly trying to figure

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:37.210
out ways not to have to have
it, not to have to do it.

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:43.790
And this is - so anyway
Dmitry Itskov Cento.

00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:48.540
Cento is a poem form where you take
lines from others and build a poem.

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:51.680
So I took lines from an article in
the Huffington Post and an article

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:54.650
in the New York Times
and I reorganized them

00:40:54.650 --> 00:41:00.930
and lightly edited them and
then the lines that I wrote are

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:04.030
at the eye level, this
is like a cyborg poem.

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:08.460
Anyway, Dmitry Itskov:A Cento.

00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:13.870
Dmitry Itskov, 32, has a
colossal dream: an early start

00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:17.180
for his own mechanical face.

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:21.490
He's one of the men with
brains, wondering how,

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:26.070
to evade the death
of meat, he thinks.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:30.560
By 2045 we'll have
substance independent minds,

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:33.890
the no need for biology at all.

00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:39.280
At 25, he started to have the
symptoms of a midlife crisis.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:43.220
The musical instruments
unlearned, the books unread,

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:47.190
the more he contemplated the
world, the more broken it seemed.

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:50.890 position:56%
"What we're doing here does not
look like the behavior of grown-ups,

00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:54.410
killing the planet and
killing ourselves."

00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:58.520
Decoupling the mind from the needy
human body could pave the way

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.050
for a more sublime human spirit.

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:03.460
It could allow paralyzed
people to communicate,

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:06.270
or control a robotic
arm or a wheelchair.

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:11.500
It could allow you to start your
car if you think, "Start my car".

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:14.880
Within a century, we'll
frequent "body service shops,"

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:18.720
choose our bodies from a catalogue,
then transfer our consciousness

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:22.030
to one better suited
for life on Mars.

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:23.830
"From the very beginning," he said,

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:27.370
"we realized Dmitry was
not an ordinary person."

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:30.800
He leads a life that could
best be described as monastic.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:34.680
No meat, fish, coffee,
alcohol, or cold water.

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:39.310
Meat gives him an energy
he's "not comfortable with."

00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:40.790
What is the brain?

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:42.540
What is consciousness?

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:46.950
It contains plenty of terrifying,
brink-of-extinction plot twists.

00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:50.610
It's somewhere between a
cellphone call and teleportation.

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:53.560
It's speaking with his
voice in real time.

00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:57.500
Get right up close to Dmitry
Itskov and sniff all you like.

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:00.900
He has the kind of generically
handsome face and perfect smile

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:04.630
that seem computer generated,
complete with all the particulars

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:07.200
of consciousness and personality.

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.200
Yes, we have seen this movie
and yes, it always leads

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:12.860
to robots enslaving humanity.

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:18.290
For now, just acquiring a
lifelike robotic head is a splurge.

00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:23.520
It's - someone from the
New York Times wrote that.

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:27.940
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: To
evade the death of meat.

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:29.240
That's pretty much -

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.540
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: I wrote that one.

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:34.670
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The ideal of
almost all the religions on earth.

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:35.970
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yes.

00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:42.620 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Another poem, you
have the line "You believe in skin",

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:44.030
which has such a great
double meaning.

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:48.580
You believe that skin exists
and we believe in our skins.

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:51.180
Our belief takes place in -

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:52.480
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yes.

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:57.600
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Sky Barrow ends
with a poem about a weird farm.

00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:58.900
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: It's a real place.

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:01.360
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I saw the
footnote and went back

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.700
and read the article in the Times.

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:06.460
This is a farm where
they study forensics

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:11.580
by letting actual bodies
rot in the fields.

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:15.060
They take pictures of them and they
study how they decompose over time,

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:17.690
so they can solve murders
where they find bodies

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:19.750
that have been decomposing
over time.

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:25.310
And you decided to write a poem, I
won't even go into what that means.

00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:27.330
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: My perfect scenario.

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:30.940
I read the same article.

00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:34.930
Yeah it's called the Body Farm.

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:37.650
It's graduate school for
forensic anthropology

00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:39.400
at the University of
Tennessee-Knoxville.

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:43.120
And I have to say that when
you read the article the guy

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:44.660
who runs it is a weird dude.

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:45.960
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh very.

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.260
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Where
he's - you know he's -

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:51.650
or the writer made him
a weird - he's strange.

00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:52.950
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: No he's weird.

00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:55.410
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Artist
of death, I don't know.

00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:56.710
Anyway -

00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:58.570
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: He's wandering
around actual rotting bodies

00:44:58.570 --> 00:45:00.580
and saying things like
"It's beautiful to me".

00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:03.340
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, honeybees -

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:08.070
so this poem is called
Spring, you should imagine

00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:10.940
that you are a graduate
student in this program

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:14.270
and you are going to do homework.

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:20.870
The sun, in shafts and spades.

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:27.570
Through the pine and birches,
little setting off the leaves.

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:31.620
Their golden green increase.

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:38.400
Pollen to the air, its colonial
dream of a new imperium of trees.

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:43.780
Snap against the wrist-skin.

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:47.940
And then you press down on the
tongue with your gloved thumb

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:51.440
to let the honeybee
show you the way.

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:58.970
The dark tunnel paths
from light to light.

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:04.480
Flay the face and scoop
out the eyes - you'll see.

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:09.480
Bees in a cloud round your hand.

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:16.390
Egg-herder, your smell
synonymous with treasure.

00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:19.710
Shining a light at the
back of the throat.

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:26.270
Blowflies in liquid pearls,
the bees murder to eat.

00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:33.510 position:56%
And all at the ips and nose a yellow
dust, pollen they have delivered.

00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:37.350
You scrape it into a little sack.

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:43.410
Ripple and snap.

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:47.390
Bend to the O of the
rigored mouth - listen.

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:59.970
&gt;&gt;Dana Levin: Plastic bags,
like souls, caught in trees.

00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:08.040
What to harvest from the
sloughed-off suits of the dead.

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:11.910
Like seashells cupping the
ghost-tongue of the sea,

00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:15.280
their black mouths speak.

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:20.050
You crouch to the hum
with a bag and a blade.

00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:23.730
You the God it sways.

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:28.960
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The line from
your first poem in your first book

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:32.620
to what is also the
last poem in that book.

00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:35.440
People caring for bodies,
one body being preserved

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.920
at the tremendous expense
and almost insane effort

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:41.610
and these bodies being left
purposely to rot in the open.

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:42.910
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yes.

00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:45.600 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Makes us think
about what we really are physically.

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:46.900
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yes.

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.190
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And
where the we resides.

00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:50.910
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yes, yeah.

00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:53.640
Yeah and you know it's
interesting when I was working

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:59.030
on Banana Palace the book
that Dmitry Itskov is from,

00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:03.050
I was like oh, finally I'm writing
about technology and I'm writing

00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:06.180
about end times and I'm writing
about anxiety about the future.

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:08.470
And then really late in the
game I was like "Oh my God,

00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:10.080
I'm still writing about the body.

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:11.380
I'm still writing about the body".

00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:12.680
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:15.330 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: I think I'll probably
always write about the body.

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:21.010 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I want to talk about
angels because they have bodies

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:22.480
but they're also immaterial.

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:23.780
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yes.

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:27.960 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So they're a weird
answer to the paradox in your poems.

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:31.120
This one called the nurse.

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:32.420
If you'd read that poem.

00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:34.720
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Sure.

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.340
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: To tell you
the truth, I don't even know

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:45.410 position:56%
where this idea and image came from.

00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:48.070
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's kind of
comforting and lovely to imagine

00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:51.640
that the operating room
is filled with angels.

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:55.720
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yeah but, okay.

00:48:57.150 --> 00:48:58.900
The Nurse.

00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:02.560
There are so many now, perched
on the headboard, opening

00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:06.100
and closing their wings like moths.

00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:10.070
The kidney is failing,
and so many are arriving,

00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:12.760
alighting on the blanket,
the pillow,

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:15.600 position:56%
falling around the comatose patient,

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:19.560
settling in drifts
against the paper gown.

00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:23.620
You've been seeing this, you've
been watching them gather,

00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:28.340
you've told no one how the buzzing
keeps growing around the bed.

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:33.150
Now they crowd like a sea around
the body, listing and pushing,

00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:38.330 position:56%
the pulse of their wings lifting the
current, you can feel it, the wind,

00:49:38.330 --> 00:49:43.200
on the hairs of your arms, making
the lamp sway, ruffling the chart

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:46.610
at the foot of the bed,
they are hanging from tubes,

00:49:46.610 --> 00:49:50.920
perched on the monitor, pressing
and pressing with a rising hum,

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:55.260 position:56%
you can hear it, the whirring, the
din of their waiting, as they rustle

00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:59.530
and jostle and launch with a
roar, a roar of angels swarming

00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:05.090
over the body, burrowing
headfirst into every pore.

00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:08.090
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's comforting.

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:14.070
Yeah I heard an angel
buzz when I died.

00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:15.370
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yeah.

00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:21.950
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Later in the book
you reject the idea of angels.

00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:23.250
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Oh yeah.

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:25.980
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Very
interesting way.

00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:28.000
It's called banishing angels.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.760
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yeah.

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:32.420
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's like you
considered angels as an answer

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:35.630
to this problem and then you
realized angels are not the answer.

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:37.500
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yeah well you
know I was writing a lot of this

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:40.790
but while living in New York
City and if anything is going

00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:45.860
to make you realize the
incontrovertible fact of bodies,

00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:47.910
it's living in New York City.

00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:49.210
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The
presence of everyone.

00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:50.510
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yeah.

00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:51.810
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Such a crown.

00:50:51.810 --> 00:50:53.110
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: And that there's
beauty and amazingness there.

00:50:53.110 --> 00:50:54.410
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:56.480
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: You know,
Banishing the angels.

00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:00.540
And then the cloud passed and a
light came rushing down the steps

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:03.270
of the subway and blazed
up against the phone booth,

00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:04.660
standing in the corner.

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:07.530
And inside it was a girl
talking on the phone,

00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:10.110
all lit up amid the
grime of the subway.

00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:13.220
And when I saw her I
wanted her to be an angel.

00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:17.040
I wanted her with wings inside
the station to say the angel

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:19.460
on the phone, and see
it softly beating.

00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:23.480
Old newspapers at its feet and
no one noticing, white and gold

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:27.300
in the dirty class, blazing
religious in the piss and exhaust

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:30.600
and oddity bright in the
light of the phone booth.

00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:34.070
And angel in a box in the
filtered sun where I was straining

00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:36.860
to look back at the light
rushing down at the girl

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:39.350
who was not an angel
talking on the phone.

00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:43.090
In the real light of the
unmystical sun thinking the girl

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:45.870
who is not an angel is
something to believe.

00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:48.890
The phone booth in the
sunlight, something to believe.

00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:51.130
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:52.430
So that's your answer.

00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:56.350
It's your reject all that
metaphysical abstraction and goo

00:51:56.350 --> 00:51:57.790
and just say this is the world.

00:51:57.790 --> 00:52:00.350
This physical world is what
we have to - what we have

00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:01.940
and we have to love and appreciate.

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:03.240
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yes.

00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:04.970
This is why somebody
like Dmitry Itskov.

00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:07.920
I'm like this is what you
want to do with your billions?

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:11.680
This is it, or anybody that's
trying to figure out how

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:16.730 position:56%
to extend our lifespan or make us
immortal, what a waste of resources.

00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:20.360
We're not supposed to be here
for a long time, I don't think.

00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:22.810
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: There's beauty
in what we have and what we are.

00:52:22.810 --> 00:52:24.110
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yeah.

00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:25.410
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's a really,

00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:28.970
I love the way the poem moves
too so quickly like that.

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:35.700
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I want to talk
about - we are winding down.

00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:40.440
I want to talk about a larger
kind of death that you approach

00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:44.480
in this poem called - we'll
call it banana palace.

00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:46.320
It's a long poem.

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:47.620
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yes.

00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:54.460
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: But we
are near the end here.

00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:58.970
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Okay so
should I give background?

00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:01.040
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah,
whatever we would need.

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:05.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: There's a lot in this
book that is addressing our world

00:53:05.130 --> 00:53:07.750
of social media, which is
really only 10 years old,

00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:10.570
shocking to recall.

00:53:10.570 --> 00:53:14.350
I don't even think we
understand what it's doing to us.

00:53:14.350 --> 00:53:19.240
Many gifts, many not gifts.

00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:22.970
So, I was trolling
through Facebook one day,

00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:26.800
and then all of a sudden
"what is that"?

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:30.030
And I saw this image and I
just was like "What is that"?

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:31.820
And it made me stop.

00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:33.600
And I looked at it
and it was beautiful

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.980
and then I saw what it was.

00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:38.840
And I really wanted to write about
this image but I didn't know how

00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:40.670
to write about it without
writing about Facebook,

00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:42.820
which just seemed very
dismal subject.

00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:44.480
Hi Facebook streaming.

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:48.470
It just seemed like a really,
really dismal subject for poetry.

00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:53.710
So I let it go for a year and then
I was like I really want to write

00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:57.390 position:56%
about this image, but apparently how
can I write about its effect on me

00:53:57.390 --> 00:54:01.870
if I don't write about the way that
it popped up out of the narcotic

00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:05.170
of just kind of going
like this, you know?

00:54:05.170 --> 00:54:07.580
And then I was like all right,
how are you going to do this?

00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:09.630
Why would you write about Facebook?

00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:10.930
To tell people about it.

00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:12.840
Well who doesn't know about it?

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:16.740 position:56%
Well obviously somebody who was born
after the collapse of civilization

00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:20.280
and had no sense of where we are.

00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:23.800
So once I hit upon that, I
was able to write this poem.

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:28.220
So, the speaker of the poem is
somebody who has lived in our time

00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:33.590
and has also gone through what we
might call apocalypse survivable

00:54:33.590 --> 00:54:34.890
and is now on the other side.

00:54:34.890 --> 00:54:38.090
And is trying to describe to
somebody who has never lived

00:54:38.090 --> 00:54:41.350
in our world about this
image and about Facebook.

00:54:41.350 --> 00:54:45.340
And at the end of the poem it
will reveal what this image was.

00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:50.750
The very first part of this
poem, the speaker is both me

00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:55.450
and this figure, this made up
figure of apocalypse survivor

00:54:55.450 --> 00:54:58.420
but then pretty soon
it's just the survivor.

00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:00.050
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Which
could be you someday.

00:55:00.050 --> 00:55:02.090
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: I don't know.

00:55:02.090 --> 00:55:05.080
As I have said many times
I think my only hope is

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:07.740
if you decide I am the Shaman krone
woman that you are going to carry

00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:12.920 position:56%
around and I will dispense wisdom
in exchange for food because I'm old

00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:18.000
and overweight and out of shape
and all I know how to do is this.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.030
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: We'll need that.

00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:22.330
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Okay.

00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:23.770
Banana Palace.

00:55:23.770 --> 00:55:30.660 position:56%
I want you to know how it felt to
hold it, deep in the well of my eye.

00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:37.060
You, future person: star of
one of my complicated doom.

00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:40.370
This one's called Back to the Dark.

00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:47.370
Scene 1: Death stampedes
through the server-cities.

00:55:47.370 --> 00:55:52.340
Somehow we all end up living in
caves, foraging in civic ruin.

00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:58.520
Banana Palace?-?the last
of the last of my kind

00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:03.820
who can read breathes it hot
into your doom-rimed ear.

00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:08.370
She's a dowser of spine-broken
books and loose paper the rest

00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:11.630
of your famishing band thinks mad.

00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:16.610
Mine was the era of
spending your time

00:56:16.610 --> 00:56:20.590
in town squares made out of air.

00:56:20.590 --> 00:56:23.440
You invented a face
and moved it around,

00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:26.650
visited briefly with other faces.

00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:31.060
Thus we streamed down lit
screens sharing pictures

00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:34.210
of animals looking ridiculous.

00:56:34.210 --> 00:56:37.720
Trading portals to
shoes, love, songs, news,

00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:43.830
somebody's latest rabid cause:
bosses, gluten, bacon, God.

00:56:43.830 --> 00:56:48.350
Information about information
was the pollen we deposited,

00:56:48.350 --> 00:56:52.760
while in the real fields
bees starved.

00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:57.160
Into this noise sailed
Banana Palace.

00:56:58.550 --> 00:57:00.930
It was a mother ship of gold.

00:57:00.930 --> 00:57:03.540
Shining out between
HAPPY BDAY KATIE!

00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:06.780 position:56%
And a photo of someone's broken toe.

00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:09.550
Like luminous pillows
cocked on a hinge,

00:57:09.550 --> 00:57:15.310
like a house with a heavy lid, a
round house of platelets and honey.

00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:19.650
It was open, like a
box that holds a ring.

00:57:19.650 --> 00:57:23.610 position:56%
And inside, where the ring would be.

00:57:27.090 --> 00:57:30.160
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: I think about
you a lot, future person.

00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:33.030
How you will need all the
books that were ever read

00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:36.780
when the screens and wires go dumb.

00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:40.210
Whatever you haven't used
for kindling or bedding.

00:57:40.210 --> 00:57:42.170
Whatever made it through
the fuckcluster

00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:46.740
of bombs we launched accidentally,
at the end of the era of feeling

00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:51.640
like no one was doing a thing
about our complicated dooms.

00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:56.500
Helpless and braced we sat in
dark spaces submerged in pools

00:57:56.500 --> 00:58:02.080
of projected images, trying
to disappear into light.

00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:06.290
Light! There was so much light!

00:58:06.290 --> 00:58:08.590
It was hard to sleep.

00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:14.630
Anyway. Banana Palace.

00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:19.440
Even now when I say it,
cymbals shiver out in spheres.

00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:24.960
It starts to turn its yellow
gears and opens like a clam.

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:31.490
Revealing a fetal curl on its
temple floor, bagged and sleeping.

00:58:31.490 --> 00:58:38.320
A white cocoon under lit strings
that stretch from floor to ceiling.

00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:44.740
A harp made of glass
incubating a covered pearl.

00:58:46.110 --> 00:58:50.860
We broke the world you're
living in, future person.

00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:55.070
Maybe that was always our end:
to break the jungles to get

00:58:55.070 --> 00:59:00.010
at the sugar, leave
behind a waste of cane.

00:59:00.010 --> 00:59:05.610 position:56%
There came a time I couldn't look at
trees without feeling elegiac?-?as

00:59:05.610 --> 00:59:11.540
if nature were already over,
if you know what I mean.

00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:17.970
It was the most glorious
thing I had ever seen.

00:59:17.970 --> 00:59:23.500
Cross-section of a banana under
a microscope the caption read.

00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:29.970
I hunched around my little screen
sharing a fruit no one could eat.

00:59:35.090 --> 00:59:38.610
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The book itself
ends with a poet in a cave trying

00:59:38.610 --> 00:59:41.850
to conjure up a peach with poetry.

00:59:41.850 --> 00:59:43.150
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Yes.

00:59:43.150 --> 00:59:44.940
It's foolish.

00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:49.860
And it's a shot out to proof rock.

00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:52.280
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh
that's excellent, yeah.

00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:53.580
That works well.

00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:54.880
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: They're
Elliott's all in there.

00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:56.180
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:59.290
That's so typical of your work.

00:59:59.290 --> 01:00:02.540
It's quite grim and quite
funny at the same time.

01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:05.930
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: I think
it's my Jewish background.

01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:08.170
I like black humor.

01:00:08.170 --> 01:00:12.890
I mean you know this world is a
veil of tears, it's hilarious.

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:19.090
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's been such
a pleasure to talk to you;

01:00:19.090 --> 01:00:20.390
you're just a fascinating writer.

01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:21.690
Thank you so much.

01:00:21.690 --> 01:00:23.490
&gt;&gt; Dana Levin: Thank
you; thank you so much.

01:00:23.490 --> 01:00:29.770
