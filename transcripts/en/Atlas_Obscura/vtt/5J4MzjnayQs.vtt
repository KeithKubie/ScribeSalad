00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.553
- Flying hawks while sitting on a horse

00:00:03.553 --> 00:00:06.800
is just not something I
ever imagined I would do,

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.830
but I definitely feel like
I could be some kind of,

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.307
like, medieval badass
princess, just, like,

00:00:11.307 --> 00:00:14.933
galloping through the hills
with a hawk on my arm.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.910
I'm very much a horse girl.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.820
I grew up in a barn, pretty much,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.070
so it's kind of my element.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.264
- Martin.
- Hi, Kerry.

00:00:35.264 --> 00:00:36.600
- Nice to meet you, love.
- Nice to meet you.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.410
Falconry from horseback was a sport

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.720
that was popular across medieval Europe,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.610
but today it's incredibly rare

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.550
unless you're in Central Asia.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.920
I kind of stumbled upon Dartmoor Hawking

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.180
and thought it would just
be an incredible opportunity

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.440
to learn how to fly a hawk or a falcon

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.090
while sitting on a horse.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.560
It's just not something
many people get to do.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.590
- Where I come from, doing
falconry from a horse

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.750
is very much from a
hunting-with-them background.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.580
And I'm from Dartmoor,
we've got big, open spaces

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.660
and the horse really
enhances your falconry.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.618
1,560 grams, she's about spot-on.

00:01:05.618 --> 00:01:08.070
If the birds are too fat they're
going to have no motivation

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.000
to fly to you.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.590
So we're relying on the
hunting instinct now.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.900
I need stresses. Not starvation,

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.762
but you've got to have an appetite.

00:01:13.762 --> 00:01:15.340
Eyesight is what she lives through.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.591
So take away the eyesight,
nothing's happening.

00:01:17.591 --> 00:01:19.759
Actually, there, a really
tight grip, because

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.167
if you let her go at this
moment in time she will die.

00:01:22.167 --> 00:01:24.270
- It's when the birds have the hood on,

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.610
like Martin said, if they
fly away then they could die,

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.950
because they effectively can't see.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.400
So my biggest fear is that I'm going

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.087
to accidentally let a bird
loose while it has its hood on

00:01:34.087 --> 00:01:36.920
and like, kill one of these birds.

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:39.418
- Okay, just keep your hand
still. Hold on, hold on!

00:01:39.418 --> 00:01:40.600
You see, and then they
come back up. Well done.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.433
- Yeah!

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:42.360
- Now, I probably should've warned you,

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.907
before I put him there, if he wanted to

00:01:43.907 --> 00:01:45.484
he could put those talons
through your glove.

00:01:45.484 --> 00:01:46.317
- Oh, lovely.

00:01:46.317 --> 00:01:48.350
- He's not going to, he's not
going to, just so you're aware

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.510
of the capabilities of
what you're dealing with.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.390
If you're not a stable perch,

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.844
he's not going to want
anything to do with you.

00:01:52.844 --> 00:01:53.677
- That makes sense.

00:01:53.677 --> 00:01:54.620
- Because you're breaking

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.570
your side of the relationship,
which is a safe place to be.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.050
- He seems like someone who is in it

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.050
because he loves what he's doing.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.990
It's very much not for show,

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.380
which is something I was looking for.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.930
And just hearing him talk about the horses

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:06.763
and talk about the birds,

00:02:06.763 --> 00:02:11.013
it's kind of like he's
talking about an old friend.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:13.690
- Man up.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.800
She's a bit wet.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.380
She's not Miss Biggie Brave.
And yet she will quite happily,

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.150
at hunting time, she will take down deer,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.780
roe deer, which is about a 50-pound deer.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.613
- She can kill one?
- Yeah.

00:02:32.338 --> 00:02:34.210
- A little lower down. Put her lower down.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.520
- It just feels really cool,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.930
and just weirdly natural.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.380
I'm a huge animal person
so I think that's why.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.040
I went into this knowing that I wanted

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.870
to get close to the birds,

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.600
and I'm fine with the dogs running around,

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.017
and like, meeting the horses.

00:02:51.637 --> 00:02:55.280
Oh, no. I know; you can't
itch on me, I'm sorry.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.540
The horses Martin uses for
falconry are all thoroughbreds.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.400
So these are horses that are
bred and designed for speed.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.510
And so not only is he using thoroughbreds,

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.110
but he uses retired ex-racehorses.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.500
So these are horses that have been trained

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.100
to go fast, trained to win races,

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.020
but then once their racing career is over,

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.490
he works to re-home them

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.157
and train them how to be falconry horses.

00:03:15.157 --> 00:03:17.074
- Okay, open your hand.

00:03:20.975 --> 00:03:22.500
All right, are you feeling brave?

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.333
- Yeah.

00:03:24.397 --> 00:03:25.360
And I think it was really cool

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.990
that the eagle has never
flown from a horse before,

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.780
so I was the first person to ever

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.210
introduce him to a new thing,

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.160
so it's kind of like we were
getting to learn together,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.480
which I never expected.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.520
It's kind of the thing you
see in a nature documentary,

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.660
not in real life, a bird that's just flown

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.210
from like, around you.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.980
So it was just absolutely beautiful

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.420
to see him just soaring
toward the horizon,

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.500
even though he wasn't
supposed to go that way.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.727
- That wasn't supposed to happen, but wow!

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.123
- It was amazing.

00:03:53.123 --> 00:03:55.270
I mean, I would love to do this again,

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.470
it's just, I'm kind of far from home

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.950
and I don't think my horse would be okay

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.480
with a hawk landing on his head.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.893
But it's not something you do every day.
