00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
 I am very, very sad recently. 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.500
 Electoral vote is going on... 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.300
 According to current trends, Donald J. Trump is expected to become the next US president 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.000
 Recently, I have been examining my life and wondering what I should do to make my life better. 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.420
 Is the largest pizza in your store a few inches? 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.840
 Is that the only thing? 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.500
 Ok 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.740
 Then I will order a 20 inch. 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.180
 I have been experimenting with a variety of different things over the past year. 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.180
 I want to know if there will be any surprises in doing this. 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.520
 Fortunately, I found a lot of things that made me very happy. 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.140
 I carefully analyzed the reasons and realized all these different things. 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.660
 Can be summarized in one word, a very simple word: 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.920
 growing up 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.700
 When I grew up, it was my happiest moment. 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.980
 Whether learning a new skill, reading, 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.780
 Try to challenge your inner fears and participate in charity events 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.020
 Travel, feel different cultures, exercise, and receive treatment 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.020
 Make your heart stronger 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.380
 These have calmed my heart and kept growing. 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.000
 When you start thinking about it, it works. Is it not? 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.300
 I mean, we are all humans, not only do our bodies need to exercise 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.200
 Our mind also needs to grow 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.980
 When we refuse to progress, refuse to learn, and refuse to challenge, the feeling of stopping will make you uncomfortable. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.800
 Baby, how are you doing today? 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.740
 You asked me the same question at the same time yesterday. 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.880
 Pay tribute to President Trump 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.740
 So if you really feel unhappy, I hope you can find a way to grow. 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.760
 What traps you tightly? Is it intelligence, body, mind, spirit, or emotion? 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.580
 What can you do to improve yourself in all aspects and become the one you want to be? 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.040
 Deepen your friends' feelings? Going to the Lyra hoop class? 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.200
 Do you adopt as many cats as you can within your country or state? 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.680
 No matter what, what you need to do is to keep growing, you will become happier, I promise 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.080
 I am Anna akana, keep curious. 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.960
 Hey, don't go, tell you, I recently worked with Crowdmade. 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.960
 They are great, if you don't know them yet, go get to know. 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.620
 Especially Corridor Merch, I am his super big fan. 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.020
 I designed a pattern of happy cat bottles. 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:16.100
