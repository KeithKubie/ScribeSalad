00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.600
My name is Adaobi Frank and I'm a 
Google Certified Associate Android Developer.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.640
I started mobile development when I left school,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.880
and I was based in Abuja. That was where I was raised,
that was where my parents lived.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.800
My husband knew that I wanted to further my education and my career,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.200
but over the years things had been really hard,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.440
So we haven't had that opportunity.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.720
So the next thing was to do certification courses
to boost my resume, basically

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.800
make me more hireable.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.600
I had a job that required me to move to Lagos for six months.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.760
I was like the only female until a team from Andela came to join the project.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.280
I think that was the first time I had even heard of the 
scholarship program to get the Google Android Certification.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.960
When I got the email that I had qualified I called
my husband, "Yes! We have the scholarship!"

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.360
I was struggling for time.
I was already working a contract job in Lagos.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.640
I would watch these videos on my way to work or on my way back,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.520
so I would with my headphones and with my phone.
All the time.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.160
When I just finished the certification, I actually got a call
for a job offer based in Abuja.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.360
This is something that will make me earn...

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.480
More than ten times than the salary that I was earning before.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.120
Ten times, I kid you not.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.240
The interview process was something that would
normally take like weeks,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.480
was like, a couple of days.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.800
'Oh, you are Android Certified? Great. Awesome.'

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.760
It was an amazing moment when she got the seal.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.880
And the pay began to pick some bills:
Rent, and go to help us to fix the cars.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.040
She's been amazing. She's been supportive, she's helped me.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.400
So now, I'm like working from my house.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.280
And I can actually call myself a developer.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.800
Not like, 'Oh, in my community I'm awesome.'

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.600
In the world. I am OK. 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.880
Awesome, we are trying to be awesome, but... OK.
