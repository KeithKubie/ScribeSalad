investment banks used to do so they try

investment banks used to do so they try

investment banks used to do so they try
to do a lot of these these controls I

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:22.730
to do a lot of these these controls I
 

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:27.470
to do a lot of these these controls I
think ultimately what these measures

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.480
think ultimately what these measures
 

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:32.240
think ultimately what these measures
will achieve is it is going to suppress

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:32.250
will achieve is it is going to suppress
 

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.480
will achieve is it is going to suppress
the activities events for a while and

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:35.490
the activities events for a while and
 

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:38.630
the activities events for a while and
then after that the pursuit of return

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:38.640
then after that the pursuit of return
 

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.340
then after that the pursuit of return
the pursuit of profit is going to return

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:40.350
the pursuit of profit is going to return
 

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:43.280
the pursuit of profit is going to return
to the banking industry and it will move

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:43.290
to the banking industry and it will move
 

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:46.610
to the banking industry and it will move
of gradually away from what we were able

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:46.620
of gradually away from what we were able
 

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.320
of gradually away from what we were able
to achieve for a short while as a result

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:48.330
to achieve for a short while as a result
 

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:52.400
to achieve for a short while as a result
of these measures some of these

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:52.410
of these measures some of these
 

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:54.230
of these measures some of these

in pursuit of profit with hindsight we

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:58.230
in pursuit of profit with hindsight we
 

00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.810
in pursuit of profit with hindsight we
can say it does not really create

00:14:59.810 --> 00:14:59.820
can say it does not really create
 

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:04.520
can say it does not really create
economic value for the society so maybe

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:04.530
economic value for the society so maybe
 

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:07.880
economic value for the society so maybe
going forward we should use that

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:07.890
going forward we should use that
 

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.160
going forward we should use that

that you goes through the principle that

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:11.610
that you goes through the principle that
 

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:15.530
that you goes through the principle that
banks should really be allowed to pursue

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:15.540
banks should really be allowed to pursue

that this sort of crisis systemic risk
 

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.620
that this sort of crisis systemic risk
could be reduced interesting I guess

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:30.630
could be reduced interesting I guess
 

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:32.480
could be reduced interesting I guess
that also says there's probably more

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:32.490
that also says there's probably more
 

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:33.980

00:22:02.179 --> 00:22:03.850
there's a greater degree of Reliance in
the fact that the Singaporeans will do

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:03.860
the fact that the Singaporeans will do
 

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:06.249
the fact that the Singaporeans will do
much stronger due diligence and this is

00:22:06.249 --> 00:22:06.259
much stronger due diligence and this is
 

00:22:06.259 --> 00:22:07.480
much stronger due diligence and this is
the stronger notion of corporate

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:07.490
the stronger notion of corporate
 

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:08.830
the stronger notion of corporate
governance that they can leverage and I

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:08.840
governance that they can leverage and I
 

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.930
governance that they can leverage and I
think that will be a significant add on

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:10.940
think that will be a significant add on
 

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:13.180
think that will be a significant add on
a third area where I think Singapore

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:13.190
a third area where I think Singapore
 

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:15.940
a third area where I think Singapore
could benefit and will be an interesting

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:15.950
could benefit and will be an interesting
 

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:17.259
could benefit and will be an interesting
way in which for them to contribute

00:22:17.259 --> 00:22:17.269

early-stage funding is not very
 

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:40.930
early-stage funding is not very
aggressive in these countries so the

tremendous dearth of capital at the very
early stages and they don't because they

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:47.330
early stages and they don't because they
 

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:49.570
early stages and they don't because they
see that is extremely risky and these

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:49.580
see that is extremely risky and these
 

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:50.740
see that is extremely risky and these
countries still haven't really

be a policeman of these things and we go

be a policeman of these things and we go
 

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:40.050
be a policeman of these things and we go
back to regulators nope do the

back to regulators nope do the
 

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.150
back to regulators nope do the

to invest in these products regulators I

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:50.290
to invest in these products regulators I
 

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:53.370
to invest in these products regulators I
think have also left behind in terms of

the vicious cycle I just got started I

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:19.720
the vicious cycle I just got started I
 

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.990
the vicious cycle I just got started I
think this is what happened what we need

basics what is the economic value for

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:27.190
basics what is the economic value for
 

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:29.790
basics what is the economic value for
the creation of this product and if it

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:29.800
the creation of this product and if it
 

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.070

economic value then I think that's the

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:34.030
economic value then I think that's the
 

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:36.780

continues to the event very quickly my

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:54.850
continues to the event very quickly my
 

00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:57.210
continues to the event very quickly my
thought on this is I think the biggest

00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:57.220
thought on this is I think the biggest
 

00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:00.990
thought on this is I think the biggest
challenge is that the more complex the

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:01.000
challenge is that the more complex the
 

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.150
challenge is that the more complex the
product becomes it's becoming very hard

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:03.160
product becomes it's becoming very hard
 

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.340
product becomes it's becoming very hard
to actually assess the risk of this and

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:05.350
to actually assess the risk of this and
 

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:07.920
to actually assess the risk of this and
I think that's the became so pick at

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:07.930
I think that's the became so pick at
 

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:09.660
I think that's the became so pick at
some point in time actually I had an

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:09.670
some point in time actually I had an
 

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:10.890
some point in time actually I had an
accounting colleague who basically

accounting colleague who basically
 

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:13.590
accounting colleague who basically
mentioned he said that he has no idea as

entails a lot of these things so he says
 

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:25.830
entails a lot of these things so he says
that you might think we have got audited
