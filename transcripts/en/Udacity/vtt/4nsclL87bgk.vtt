00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.304
When you square 5 you get 25.

00:00:03.304 --> 00:00:07.265
5 squared is 5 times 5, which is 25.

00:00:07.265 --> 00:00:12.485
That means that the square
root of 25 is equal to 5.

00:00:12.485 --> 00:00:13.869
This square root sign,

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:18.020
which is also called a radical sign,
indicates that you are looking for

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.564
the square root of the number
that is under the radical sign.

00:00:21.564 --> 00:00:25.985
So you're looking for the number that
you can multiply it by itself to get

00:00:25.985 --> 00:00:28.170
the number under the radical sign.
