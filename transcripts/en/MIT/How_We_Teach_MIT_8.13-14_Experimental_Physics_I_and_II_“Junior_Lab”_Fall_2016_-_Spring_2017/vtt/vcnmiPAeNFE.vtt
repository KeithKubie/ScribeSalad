SEAN ROBINSON: So
the technical staff

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.050
consists of myself
and two more people.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.340
Our job is to maintain
all the equipment,

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.730
develop new experiments.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.810
In practice, we also
end up teaching a lot.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.700
Something that's very
common is a student

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.209
is struggling with
an experiment.

00:00:22.209 --> 00:00:24.750
They don't quite understand how
their measurement is working.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.240
They've worked with
the section leader.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.960
They've worked with the grad
TA in trying to figure it out.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.751
And at some point, they
really just believe

00:00:31.751 --> 00:00:33.160
the experiment is just broken.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.970
That's the point in which we
call in the technical staff,

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:36.900
and we figure out.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.580
And more often than
not, it's not broken.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.730
It's just working with
the apparatus is actually

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.970
just very confusing.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.140
There are lots of degrees of
freedom in operating any given

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.330
piece of apparatus.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.550
And it's oftentimes
the technical staff

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.390
who know more about what's
happening in the apparatus

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.937
and getting them to give
good data than sometimes some

00:00:57.937 --> 00:00:58.770
of the other people.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.460
Just because we're here
in every single section.
