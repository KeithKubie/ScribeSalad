00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.869
After months of harsh weather, equipment failure,
and scenes like this...

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.180
Ben Lecomte's historic world record attempt

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.280
has come to a halt.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.220
But the mission still continues.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.880
Ben is more determined than ever 
to bring attention to the state of our world's oceans.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.920
I remember, since I'm a little boy, working on the beach with my father,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.160
I never saw any plastic around.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.020
And in the last 50 years or so, the number of plastic

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.800
that you find is... it's crazy.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.820
I think that it's my duty to try to do
 something to correct it

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.080
so my children don't have to inherit that problem.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.900
You may have heard that we know less about our own oceans than we do about the moon,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.680
or even the surface of Mars.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.460
The vast majority of what we do know is limited to ecosystems close to shore,

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.760
and that's because our oceans are massive,
with dangers lurking at every turn.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.260
This expedition wasn't just a swim.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.700
It was also a citizen science expedition.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.940
So far we've collected over 1,100 samples, and that includes samples on microplastic

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.560
microfibers, bigger pieces of plastic, too - 
and we also did water collection,

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.460
and also on Ben's microbiome, his DNA,
and his heart, too.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.520
This is a major victory for marine research, but just a baby step in the big picture of ocean exploration.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.620
Although the ocean has been difficult
to explore and research,

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.600
The Swim is taking tiny steps with a team of scientists to investigate so many unknowns.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.520
There's a lot of plastic that still remains
 unknown and lost at sea.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.700
So it may be in the water column,
it may be inside the stomach of different animals

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.160
in the ocean, or even marine birds for example, but we don't know where all the plastic is.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.920
We still don't know whether microfibers

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.260
accumulate in patches like microplastics do.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.820
They are so much smaller,
and with so many different other sources...

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.220
and of course the effect that it will have on us... it's way too early to decide on this.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.300
For the last 20 years, there's been a lot that we've learned about sharks.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.180
But there's still a lot that we don't know. For these species living in more remote areas,

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.500
we don't know anything.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.320
When you record this animal in the wild,

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.040
you get a lot of information on their social structure.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:08.960
This sum of recording is giving us a transect, 
a view of how dense the populations are.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.720
This is completely unknown.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.820
Who knows what power these discoveries will hold.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.120
The ocean harbors clues to our evolutionary past,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.840
and keys to our future... 
from clean energy to engineering secrets

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.380
and the potential for promising new cures.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.800
But all of this could be lost 
if pollution continues at this rate.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.860
Everywhere, every day, we found plastic.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.120
Even now. I put my hand in the water. I wait one minute.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.520
I put my hand up, and I already have fragments of microplastic.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.780
You try to extend that to the whole ocean and it's just...

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.780
it's mind-blowing.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.480
I hope the scientists will have a lot of samples to be able to study more and to learn more where this plastic

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.980
comes from, and how this plastic is threatening the health of our ocean and our health ultimately.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.660
If it's not enough for us to see that there are many species in the ocean being damaged

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.120
at least we can be worried
that we are being damaged, too.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.800
For The Swim crew, this expedition has been full of countless unforgettable moments,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.420
and one steadfast mission.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.800
The more and more people get inspired

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.820
to do something, little by little we are going to correct all the wrongdoing that we have done

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.420
and hopefully pass a healthier ocean to our children.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.400
I think what we have done, even though it's a little crazy,

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:44.120
that's the reason why sometimes we need to do something that is out of the ordinary

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.620
to get attention.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.980
So you can hashtag #JoinTheSwim
to give us all the changes

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.420
that you may have done or you are planning on doing,

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.740
reducing your use of a plastic and being a better steward of the environment.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.540
