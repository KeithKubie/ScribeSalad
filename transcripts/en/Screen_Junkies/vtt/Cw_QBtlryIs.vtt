00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.680
You remember the tale as old as 1991.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.840
Now, experience it all over again with CGI and celebrities

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.060
as Disney reminds us: "It's not about how you look,

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.080
it's what on the inside of your wallet that counts!"

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.080
(Again)

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.340
After The Jungle Book used live action to improve on their animated classic,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.560
Disney's using live action to just copy their animated classic

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.500
and see if anyone notices

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.700
or cares.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.160
Turns out they don't!

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.820
In an empty spectacle that reminds you how good the original was,

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.740
and shows you how creepy the original would be if it were real.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.480
"Mum said I wasn't supposed to move."

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.340
Eugh!

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.660
Return to the British-est part of France,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.520
"I can't remember what."

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.020
"Crazy old Maurice."

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.340
"Giving her a suite in the East Wing."

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.760
and meet Belle,

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.060
a beautiful book lover who falls in love with an ugly dude.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.940
So, Hermione?

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.680
Emma Watson turned down an Oscar-winning role in La La Land for this,

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.980
but she deserves an Oscar for not laughing every time Dan Steven showed up in his mo-cap suit.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.800
Watch her inhabit this strong, female role model

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.700
who isn't afraid to invent her own...

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.820
washing machine,

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:19.900
"What are you doing?"

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.780
"The laundry."

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.420
and doesn't need a man to help her express herself,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.700
unless that man's name is Otto Tune.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.700
♫ Easy to remember ♫

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.360
Otto? Tune? You get it.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.440
But it's not all a rehash of the original.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.360
There's several new tiny crumbs of movie to pick over

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.040
like:

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.920
superfluous backstory,

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.760
wandering around the woods,

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.420
diversity?,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.100
and the plague.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.460
Kids love the plague!

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.540
Plus, a new Oscar-bating song

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.420
that'll have you wondering if you have enough time to take a pee break.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.560
♫ Now I know she'll never leave me ♫

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:00.480
You do.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.600
Gaston shines as the aggressive, controlling, hairy guy who imprisons Belle's dad,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.940
as opposed to the Beast, an aggressive, controlling, hairy guy who imprisons Belle's dad.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.560
And if you're mad we reused the same joke we made in our original Honest Trailer,

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.580
then you're not one of the millions of Disney fans who defend this glorified rehash.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.120
Blink and you'll miss the reveal of Disney's first openly gay character,

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.040
assuming you don't count Prince Eric,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.500
as LeFou finally comes out of the closet

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.440
to piss off everyone.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.980
Because gay people don't want their first character to a sniveling, evil weirdo

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.800
while homophobes want the scene to be more gay so they can get really hot and bothered.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.080
Seriously, that's it? That's the moment that got it banned in Kuwait, Malaysia, and Alabama?

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.820
I've seen gayer stuff for breakfast!

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.580
So be Disney's guest at this timeless tale of how it's your inner beauty that matters,

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.120
"The beauty is found within."

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.640
even though Belle is hot,

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.820
the Beast is hot,

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.400
the dresser is hot,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.980
the librarian is hot,

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.920
and even the withered, old crone turns out to be hot.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.360
Because while inner beauty is what really matters,

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.420
your ugly ass is definitely a curse.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.860
Yay, the Royal Prince is back!

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.100
But wait, if Gaston had a musket, then this takes place either right before or right after the French Revolution.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.600
Uh-oh!
