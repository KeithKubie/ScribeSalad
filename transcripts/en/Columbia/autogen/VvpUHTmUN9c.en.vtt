you can add the protein by giving the

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490
you can add the protein by giving the
 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.910
you can add the protein by giving the
gene for it you can make organisms that

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920
gene for it you can make organisms that
 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.709
gene for it you can make organisms that
they and their progeny and their

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719
they and their progeny and their
 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.770
they and their progeny and their
subsequent project will make this as a

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780
subsequent project will make this as a
 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.750
subsequent project will make this as a
normal part of their growth and one can

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760
normal part of their growth and one can
 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.390
normal part of their growth and one can
see the fluorescence in the living cells

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400
see the fluorescence in the living cells
 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.200
see the fluorescence in the living cells
and in the living organisms you can

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210
and in the living organisms you can
 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.439
and in the living organisms you can
either you can label the cells you can

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449
either you can label the cells you can
 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.580
either you can label the cells you can
label whole organisms you can as my wife

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590
label whole organisms you can as my wife
 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.760
label whole organisms you can as my wife
Tula hazel Rick showed you can put GFP

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770
Tula hazel Rick showed you can put GFP
 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.959
Tula hazel Rick showed you can put GFP
the gene for GFE next to the gene

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969
the gene for GFE next to the gene
 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:42.860
the gene for GFE next to the gene
encoding a protein that you're

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870
encoding a protein that you're
 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.260
encoding a protein that you're
interested in and now you make a fusion

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270
interested in and now you make a fusion
 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.680
interested in and now you make a fusion
protein first part or one part of the

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690
protein first part or one part of the
 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.209
protein first part or one part of the
protein is the protein you're interested

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219
protein is the protein you're interested
 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.150
protein is the protein you're interested
in the other part is this Lantern GFP

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160
in the other part is this Lantern GFP
 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.420
in the other part is this Lantern GFP
that you can attach to it so wherever

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430
that you can attach to it so wherever
 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.279
that you can attach to it so wherever
that protein goes that's where the GFP

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289
that protein goes that's where the GFP
 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.290
that protein goes that's where the GFP
goes and so you can see wherever the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300
goes and so you can see wherever the
 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.939
goes and so you can see wherever the
protein goes and in living organisms the

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949
protein goes and in living organisms the
 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.100
protein goes and in living organisms the
other thing about it is that that's all

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110
other thing about it is that that's all
 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.830
other thing about it is that that's all
you need to look at it is to shine blue

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840
you need to look at it is to shine blue
 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.810
you need to look at it is to shine blue
or ultraviolet now we just use blue

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820
or ultraviolet now we just use blue
 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.469
or ultraviolet now we just use blue
light and you see it's wherever it

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479
light and you see it's wherever it
 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.499
light and you see it's wherever it
happens to be because it's green against

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509
happens to be because it's green against
 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.600
happens to be because it's green against
the background in which there is no Brie

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610
the background in which there is no Brie
 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.690
the background in which there is no Brie
and so you can see things once you can

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700
and so you can see things once you can
 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.150
and so you can see things once you can
see so that allows you to
