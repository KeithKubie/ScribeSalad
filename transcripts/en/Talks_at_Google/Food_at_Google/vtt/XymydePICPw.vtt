[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:07.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.640
NATE GANA: Thank
you guys very much.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.630
How are you guys doing today?

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:10.760
AUDIENCE: Pretty good.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.855
NATE GANA: You all
big whisky fans?

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:13.878
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:00:13.878 --> 00:00:14.670
NATE GANA: Awesome.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:15.300
Very cool.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.190
Well, we've got one
of the best guys

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.970
I know in the industry,
period, Mr. Ian Chang.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.920
So he is the master
blender of Kavalan Whisky

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.600
as well as the
distillery manager.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.010
So one thing that drew me to
Kavalan was, one, the quality,

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.140
but two, the climate
in Taiwan, which

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.390
allows you to produce whisky
much differently than you

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.470
would traditionally.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.387
But also, being at Google, this
is probably the most fitting,

00:00:38.387 --> 00:00:40.470
it is the most technologically
advanced distillery

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.500
in the world.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.320
So I think that's
a really cool point

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.150
to speak about given
that we're here.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.780
So Ian, how are
things going with you?

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.343
IAN CHANG: Things
are doing well.

00:00:50.343 --> 00:00:51.190
NATE GANA: Good.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.070
Yeah, you've been busy.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.015
You've been very busy.

00:00:54.015 --> 00:00:54.973
IAN CHANG: So far, yes.

00:00:54.973 --> 00:00:57.992
NATE GANA: So you're here
from Taiwan for Whisky Fest?

00:00:57.992 --> 00:00:59.950
IAN CHANG: That's right,
and also next week, we

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.875
go into DC for Whisky
Fest DC as well.

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:03.750
NATE GANA: Very cool.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.667
IAN CHANG: And after
that I go back to Taiwan.

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:06.958
NATE GANA: You're not stopping.

00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.150
IAN CHANG: Ready for the
next trip, which is Spain.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.900
NATE GANA: Really?

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.570
IAN CHANG: Yes,
yes, that's right.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.550
NATE GANA: Big market for you?

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.133
IAN CHANG: No.

00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:16.860
Spain is mainly to visit
our sherry cask supplier.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.230
As you know, within the
Kavalan portfolio we have,

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.790
I would say, the most
comprehensive sherry

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.290
portfolio--

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.915
NATE GANA: Yes.

00:01:26.915 --> 00:01:29.220
IAN CHANG: in the
whisky industry.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.850
Right from Fino Sherry Cask,
Manzanilla, Amontillado,

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:34.350
and so on.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.980
NATE GANA: Yes.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.110
IAN CHANG: So every
year, I actually

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.470
go to Spain twice
a year to inspect

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.287
the quality of our cask.

00:01:42.287 --> 00:01:42.870
NATE GANA: OK.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.640
IAN CHANG: See if
they are ready or not

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.250
for the maturation
of our whisky.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.470
So that is something that
I'm really looking forward

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.458
to because as you
know, in Spain,

00:01:51.458 --> 00:01:52.500
the weather is very good.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.990
NATE GANA: It's fantastic.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.670
IAN CHANG: And the
food is good, as well.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.930
NATE GANA: The food
is very good, yes.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:56.430
Yes.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.530
Spain is one of my
favorite places to be.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.070
But tell me about how this
came about, Kavalan in general.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.870
IAN CHANG: So as Josh
mentioned just now,

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.350
Kavalan started in 2005.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.730
At that time, we were the one
and only whisky distillery.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.880
So like our Japanese
neighbor, where

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.480
they have Suntory, which
started the Japanese whisky

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.740
industry back in 1923.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.740
Kavalan actually started the
Taiwanese whisky industry,

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.950
but as late as 2006.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.920
But the reason for that, it
was actually quite simple.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.320
Because anytime before
2002, we couldn't

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.980
have any private wineries,
distilleries, or breweries.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:44.730
NATE GANA: Really?

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.770
IAN CHANG: Because of
the monopoly system

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.210
that we used to have in Taiwan.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.600
So only our government
at that time

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.860
could produce, import, and
also sell anything alcoholic.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.830
So Mr. Lee Sr., who is about
80 years old this year,

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.880
he was really frustrated when
he was a young man 40 years ago,

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.920
when he wanted to set
up his own distillery,

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.750
but he couldn't do so.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.560
And that's why we waited
for almost 30 years.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.890
In 2002, finally,
the whole regulation

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.410
was changed due to WTO.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.460
Because once you
join WTO, you have

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.880
to embrace fair
competition, and also you

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.790
have to open yourself
up to the whole world.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:30.420
NATE GANA: Yes.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.950
IAN CHANG: So that's why when
Mr. Lee was really chuffed,

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.430
so he quickly set
up a small team

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.920
of engineers, folk
technologists, even architects,

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.085
because he has to design
the shape of our distillery.

00:03:49.085 --> 00:03:49.710
NATE GANA: Yes.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:57.300
IAN CHANG: So we even came to
US, Canada, Japan, Scotland,

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.060
and also Ireland to
gather information,

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.020
and also to see how to set
up a distillery of our own

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.290
in Taiwan.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.540
So between 2002
and also 2005 that

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.840
was what we call the
intelligence gathering

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.070
phase of the setting
up of the distillery.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.390
So finally in April 2005,
we started construction.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.890
And guess?

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.910
What it took us only nine months
to build a whole distillery.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:27.610
NATE GANA: What?

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.915
IAN CHANG: Which I was
told that it was a record.

00:04:30.915 --> 00:04:33.210
NATE GANA: I think it's a
record for a lot of things.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.002
IAN CHANG: Exactly.

00:04:34.002 --> 00:04:37.380
So as Mr. Lee senior
always describes,

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.920
it's like having a baby
born in nine months' time.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.380
So that's his baby.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.040
NATE GANA: It is his
baby, absolutely.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.170
IAN CHANG: So ever
since then, we've

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.960
been producing whisky 24 hours
a day, seven days a week,

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.353
365 days a year,
nonstop until today.

00:04:53.353 --> 00:04:54.270
NATE GANA: Oh, my god.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.937
IAN CHANG: Yeah.

00:04:54.937 --> 00:04:58.345
NATE GANA: So speaking of the
distillery, when I went over

00:04:58.345 --> 00:05:00.720
there, I learned a lot of
things, and one thing I learned

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.580
was that the second
most popular distillery

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.460
in the world in Scotland
has about 150,000 visitors

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.550
per year.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.367
You guys have a million
visitors a year?

00:05:09.367 --> 00:05:11.200
IAN CHANG: Approximately,
yes, that's right.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.090
NATE GANA: You are number
one by a long shot.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.710
IAN CHANG: But
also in a way, that

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.720
shows you how alcoholic we are--

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:19.707
In Taiwan.

00:05:19.707 --> 00:05:20.290
NATE GANA: OK.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.860
That's true.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:21.360
That's true.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.390
IAN CHANG: Because among the one
million visitors, 80% domestic,

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.950
20% foreign.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:28.950
NATE GANA: 80% domestic.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:29.440
IAN CHANG: That's right.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.770
NATE GANA: Wow.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:30.770
IAN CHANG: That's right.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.160
Our domestic
consumers, when they

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.733
don't have anywhere else to go,
they come to our distillery.

00:05:37.733 --> 00:05:38.650
NATE GANA: Oh, my god.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.140
So then with the products
that you're creating,

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.840
how did you get
into whisky making?

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.447
IAN CHANG: So it was actually
by, I would say by fate.

00:05:48.447 --> 00:05:49.030
NATE GANA: OK.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:57.700
IAN CHANG: Because in 2004, no,
sorry, I should say early 2005.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.540
During that time, my
father, he was really ill.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:07.987
So my mom asked me to come home,
and to look after the family.

00:06:07.987 --> 00:06:09.570
NATE GANA: Where
were you at the time?

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.630
IAN CHANG: I was actually doing
small businesses in China.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.460
NATE GANA: OK.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.220
IAN CHANG: So I
came back to Taiwan.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.370
We finished everything in China.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.450
And at that time, I
didn't know what to do.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.390
I was actually really panicking.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:31.710
So every day, I remember
from January to April,

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.810
every day I was searching
on the internet,

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.860
through Google as well,
looking for a job.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.300
And in Taiwan we have this
so-called 104 website,

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.290
which is the website you go
to look for job vacancies.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.100
So one day I saw, it was
3 o'clock in the morning,

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.960
I couldn't sleep.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.570
And I saw that King
Car Company, which

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:59.050
is the group that
is behind Kavalan,

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:04.120
they were looking for someone
to be a spirit researcher.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.700
So it wasn't quite
a blender yet.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.170
So I sent my CV, and three
weeks later, a gentleman

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.270
whose name is Peter--

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.140
he's the special assistant
to our chairman, Mr. Lee--

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:20.650
he called me and he said, "are
you still looking for a job."

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.760
I said, "yes, I'm
desperate for a job."

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:30.100
So he said, "come
to our headquarter,

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.820
and do interview,
and see how it goes."

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:38.590
So the next day I went, and
the very first question he

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:42.960
asked me was if I had
any previous experience

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:48.160
in the whisky industry or any
alcoholic beverage industry.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.220
And as you can tell, I'm
a very honest person,

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.420
and the answer was no.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.970
So I said no, and
I thought that was

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:56.720
the end of the conversation.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.540
But then I did emphasize
to him that for the eight

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.530
years studying in
the UK as a student,

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:04.310
I was drinking
almost every night.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.200
And that should count
as very much being

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.490
part of the industry, as well.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:14.620
So he said, why
don't you take a test

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.070
on your nose to see if
you can differentiate

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:19.960
all of these flavors.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.800
As you know that when we drink
whisky, I would say the most--

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.310
and they would agree with me--

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:29.050
the most fascinating and also
interesting thing about whisky

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:35.950
is that every distillery has its
own unique flavors, qualities,

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.190
and so on.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:44.560
So in front of me I had 15
of the so-called whisky notes

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.250
that you can expect
from single malt whisky.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:52.930
And the rule was very simple
I could only nose them once,

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:56.210
and then you have to write
down the descriptors.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:01.480
So apparently I was very lucky
that I had the highest score.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.725
But also it was then I knew
that my nose actually works.

00:09:04.725 --> 00:09:06.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:10.740
I could differentiate all these
different flavors from whiskys.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.740
NATE GANA: Right, right.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.510
IAN CHANG: And once
I joined the company,

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:19.420
I was really lucky once again,
very fortunate that Mr. Lee,

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.870
he sent me to
Scotland for two years

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:29.440
to study with the world famous
whisky expert of Dr. Jim Swam.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.740
NATE GANA: Jim Swan.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.670
IAN CHANG: So for
two years that was he

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:37.510
was the person who taught
me everything about whisky,

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.640
and life in general as well.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.160
So he's my Mr. Miyagi in a way.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:42.785
NATE GANA: Yes.

00:09:42.785 --> 00:09:44.202
IAN CHANG: And I'm
the whisky kid.

00:09:44.202 --> 00:09:46.082
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:46.082 --> 00:09:47.540
NATE GANA: That's
an amazing story,

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.355
because I know now that--

00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:50.980
I mean, I don't want
to say the number.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.970
But how many whiskies do
you taste per day now?

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:58.960
IAN CHANG: So on a daily basis,
if I'm not traveling, which

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.190
is very difficult these days.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:03.490
Because I always say to
our audience and consumer

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:08.870
that these days I'm
more into the show biz--

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:12.243
being a brand ambassador,
going around the world.

00:10:12.243 --> 00:10:12.910
NATE GANA: Yeah.

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:14.035
IAN CHANG: To all tastings.

00:10:14.035 --> 00:10:18.250
But whenever I go back to
Taiwan, on a daily basis,

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:24.418
I have to nose samples in a
range of between 200 to 400.

00:10:24.418 --> 00:10:25.210
NATE GANA: Per day?

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.400
IAN CHANG: On a
daily basis, yes.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:32.290
Because I have to catch up
with when I'm not there,

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:33.807
because the production
doesn't stop.

00:10:33.807 --> 00:10:34.390
NATE GANA: No.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:38.680
IAN CHANG: So every day we have
new batches of the new make,

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:43.390
and also you have matured
products in the casks.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:44.050
NATE GANA: Yes.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.990
IAN CHANG: All
waiting to be nosed,

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:50.260
to be determined
whether they are matured

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.545
or not, or if we need to
do something differently.

00:10:53.545 --> 00:10:54.170
NATE GANA: Yes.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:57.670
IAN CHANG: For example,
transferring from refill

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:00.747
cask to say port cask.

00:11:00.747 --> 00:11:01.330
NATE GANA: Yes

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:02.560
IAN CHANG: And so on.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.080
So it's very interesting.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.420
Even though I have so
many samples to nose,

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.820
but I never get tired.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.830
I would say it's the
best job in the world.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:12.910
NATE GANA: Absolutely the
best job in the world.

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:14.170
IAN CHANG: If you like to drink.

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:15.520
NATE GANA: If you
like to drink, yes.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.020
Yes.

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.670
And so is Kavalan producing
any other products other

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:19.810
than whisky?

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:25.550
IAN CHANG: Yes, last
year 2018 in November,

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:28.167
we launched our latest gin.

00:11:28.167 --> 00:11:29.500
NATE GANA: Wow, congratulations.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.780
IAN CHANG: So this is
our gin number one,

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:35.290
and this year we are
working on gin number two.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:41.920
So in the future, as we talked
about just now before the talk,

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:42.650
in the future.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:45.670
I think in addition
to whisky, Kavalan

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:50.330
and we also do gin and also
some other alcoholic beverages

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:50.830
as well.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:51.320
NATE GANA: Oh, wow.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.110
IAN CHANG: So these
are all the surprises

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:56.805
that we have for our
consumers for the future.

00:11:56.805 --> 00:11:57.680
NATE GANA: Fantastic.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.410
Well, I know that
the Distillery Select

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:00.735
is new to the American market.

00:12:00.735 --> 00:12:02.860
What was the purpose of
creating Distillery Select?

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.750
IAN CHANG: Right, so
the Distillery Select,

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.200
which is the one here, this
was also launched last year,

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.720
similar time to our gin.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.560
NATE GANA: OK.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.950
IAN CHANG: I would say
this is the brand new entry

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:19.510
level for any consumers who
wants to either try whisky

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:23.620
in general for the first time or
try Kavalan for the first time.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:27.730
Because in the past,
Kavalan has always

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:32.032
been described as quality
only and no quantity.

00:12:32.032 --> 00:12:32.740
NATE GANA: Right.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.230
IAN CHANG: Because
the consumers always

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:38.320
say that Kavalan
is a bit pricey,

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:46.540
but Mr. Lee knows that quality
is actually our number one

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.170
priority.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:48.490
NATE GANA: Absolutely.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:51.900
IAN CHANG: But in order to have
a volume maker for Kavalan,

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.647
for quantity, we need to
do something differently.

00:12:55.647 --> 00:12:56.230
NATE GANA: Yes

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:59.370
IAN CHANG: In order to
bring down the cost so

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:06.010
that the final end price for our
consumers can be competitive.

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:09.855
For example here in
Chicago, at Binny's.

00:13:09.855 --> 00:13:10.480
NATE GANA: Yes.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.063
IAN CHANG: I saw
this one on the shelf

00:13:12.063 --> 00:13:15.155
for $49.99, which is, I think,
a very competitive price.

00:13:15.155 --> 00:13:16.780
NATE GANA: Reasonable
price point, yes.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:20.420
IAN CHANG: And even though
the price is competitive,

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.558
we don't compromise
anything on the quality.

00:13:22.558 --> 00:13:23.600
NATE GANA: Quality, yeah.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.100
Absolutely.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:29.230
IAN CHANG: So what we do is
by using refill casks, which

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:34.520
are casks that have been used
repeatedly for many years.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:40.180
Some can be as old as
40 to 60 years old.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.900
But the thing is, once again,
because of the location

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:50.590
of Taiwan, which is subtropical,
in our very hot summertime,

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:53.110
the heat actually
managed to push

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:58.270
more wood related flavors and
also colors into the whisky.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:02.200
So later, after the talk, we
have the so-called happy hour.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.200
Feel free to try the
Kavalan Distillery Select.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.390
When you look at the
color, you'll be amazed,

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:12.070
and you won't think that it is
a single malt whisky matured

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:14.890
in very old refill cask.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:19.930
And that is all to do with the
combination of quality new make

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:20.950
and the heat of Taiwan.

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:22.450
NATE GANA: Yeah,
the heat of Taiwan.

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:24.760
I mean India, is producing
a lot too right now.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.600
IAN CHANG: That's
right, that's right.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.870
NATE GANA: It's such a unique
climate to be producing in.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:28.870
IAN CHANG: That's right.

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:31.120
NATE GANA: So how did you
go from essentially zero

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.545
bottles in 2005 to
500,000 bottles annually?

00:14:34.545 --> 00:14:35.920
Is that what you're
at right now?

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.805
IAN CHANG: 500,000 is
actually the old number now.

00:14:38.805 --> 00:14:39.430
NATE GANA: Wow.

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:42.538
IAN CHANG: So we now do
nearly one million bottles.

00:14:42.538 --> 00:14:44.080
NATE GANA: One
million per year, wow.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.580
IAN CHANG: Per year.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.210
But we still have
a long way to go.

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:53.470
Yes, but I would say two very
unique qualities of Kavalan

00:14:53.470 --> 00:15:00.670
is that on the nose Kavalan
offers you that very refreshing

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:06.390
and also very clean,
fruity, floral characters.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:09.080
But then on the palate,
Kavalan offers you

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.000
a nice, natural
sweetness, but also

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.410
the creamy and oily
character on the palate when

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:17.300
you drink the whisky.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.258
NATE GANA: [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:18.258 --> 00:15:20.610
IAN CHANG: So that makes
the whole experience

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:21.870
really enjoyable.

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:23.760
NATE GANA: Yes, and I agree.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.420
Because as a judge in the
spirit of competition recently,

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:31.230
we tasted through 150 spirits
on the Friday and the Saturday,

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.540
and then top 83
spirits on the Sunday.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.270
And we came out
with a $30 bourbon

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:38.187
as the world winner of
the best whisky, right?

00:15:38.187 --> 00:15:39.187
IAN CHANG: That's right.

00:15:39.187 --> 00:15:42.030
NATE GANA: And so it beat out,
I think, 300 other whiskies

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:43.110
overall.

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:45.712
And you think to yourself
that, you know you think whisky

00:15:45.712 --> 00:15:47.920
or you think you know wine,
and you do a blind taste,

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.200
and the $30 bottle comes out.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.730
So I think it's
important to have

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:54.510
your quality in your high end
but also quality in a lower end

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:57.630
price point that allows people
to get familiar with the brand,

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:00.060
and then move their
category and their palette

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.053
up to a higher place.

00:16:02.053 --> 00:16:03.720
What would you say
the favorite of yours

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.660
is that you have produced?

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:12.000
IAN CHANG: Within our
portfolio, every one of them.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.960
NATE GANA: That's cheating.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.740
IAN CHANG: I mean, it all
depends on the occasions

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:22.420
and also depends on the
mood that you are in.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.840
For example, the one
in the middle here,

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.700
this is our Kavalan classic.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:31.050
I think this is a very good
everyday drinking whisky.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:34.890
This is something that I have
in a decanter in my office.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:41.340
Whenever I go back to the office
to prepare for the next thing

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:43.920
to do, whenever I
have a break, I always

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.135
have a small drum
of the classic.

00:16:47.135 --> 00:16:47.760
NATE GANA: Wow.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.468
IAN CHANG: But then
if you like something

00:16:49.468 --> 00:16:55.020
that is all about
complexity harmony,

00:16:55.020 --> 00:17:00.110
just like another brand
called the H something.

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:01.680
NATE GANA: Yeah.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.420
IAN CHANG: This is
our answer to that.

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:04.128
NATE GANA: I see.

00:17:04.128 --> 00:17:06.359
IAN CHANG: So even though
this one is a single malt

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:11.790
whisky, when you drink it,
you won't realize that this

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:14.010
is a single malt whisky.

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:17.400
You'll think that it is a
blend because it is so complex,

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.400
with so many layers of flavors.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:25.710
Because in the
method of blending

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:28.020
this particular
expression, we have

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:32.370
used certain types
of casks to mimic

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:33.792
the effect of grain whisky.

00:17:33.792 --> 00:17:34.500
NATE GANA: Right.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.860
IAN CHANG: And then combined
with other types of casks,

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.190
it's like grain and malt
blended together, which

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:43.200
is just like a blend whisky.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.500
So this is something
for our consumers

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:50.220
to try if they want
complexity and also

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.242
heavier weight in terms of body.

00:17:52.242 --> 00:17:52.950
NATE GANA: Right.

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:53.992
IAN CHANG: Of the whisky.

00:17:53.992 --> 00:17:56.490
NATE GANA: So oddly enough,
I first learned about Kavalan

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:57.630
here in Chicago.

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:00.420
I went to Binny's, and I
saw this beautiful setup.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.950
And I thought, what is that.

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:04.800
And so you see Kavalan
now everywhere,

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.870
but one of the things
that is interesting

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:08.370
that's been a
common misconception

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:10.002
is the Solist line.

00:18:10.002 --> 00:18:10.710
IAN CHANG: Right.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:13.650
NATE GANA: So the Solist line
is sort of the higher end

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.350
range of the casks that
they have at Kavalan,

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:19.560
but one thing you've
noticed is that in America,

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.810
none of the bottles
say Solist on it.

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:24.810
Yet it is the identical
bottle without the writing.

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:26.400
So maybe you can clear this up.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.030
IAN CHANG: Yes.

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:31.440
So in addition to these
three that we see here,

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.170
we have also another
series, which

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.630
is called the Solist series.

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:39.210
And what the Solists
series is about

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:42.060
is that they are
all cask strength.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:46.640
Because in Taiwan, we
have many consumers.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.540
I would say the majority
of our consumers,

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:53.040
they like to have their
whisky at cask strength.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.800
Can you believe it?

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.950
Straight from the cask.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:56.788
So normally the--

00:18:56.788 --> 00:18:59.080
NATE GANA: Is that just
Taiwanese, or is that everybody

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.150
in general?

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.100
IAN CHANG: Taiwanese, and
also certain parts in Europe,

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:03.600
as well.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.558
NATE GANA: Interesting.

00:19:04.558 --> 00:19:05.340
Yes.

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.770
IAN CHANG: We have
a saying in Taiwan,

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.860
"there is no such thing
as a strong alcohol, only

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:11.730
weaker man."

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:14.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.690
No, I'm joking.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:19.042
NATE GANA: I'm going to put that
on a notepad, and put that up,

00:19:19.042 --> 00:19:20.250
and you look at it every day.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:23.740
IAN CHANG: So they like
to drink cask strength.

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:30.060
And so it's all about
strength in the range of 53

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.720
to some even as high as 59.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:40.110
So when we entered into the
US five or six years ago,

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:43.830
we also want to enter the
Solis series into the US.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:46.620
But unfortunately we
were told that there

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.800
has been another company,
they have already

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.590
registered in the name Solist.

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:53.597
Here in the US.

00:19:53.597 --> 00:19:54.180
NATE GANA: OK.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:57.540
IAN CHANG: So that's why it's
a pity that we cannot use

00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:58.320
the word Solist.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.237
NATE GANA: Understood.

00:19:59.237 --> 00:20:01.920
IAN CHANG: But if you go to
professional wine and liquor

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.843
stores, like Binny's
and other ones.

00:20:04.843 --> 00:20:05.760
NATE GANA: Total Wine.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.260
IAN CHANG: That's right.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:07.540
Total Wine and so on.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:11.343
If you ask them for Solist, we
do have them here in the US.

00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:12.260
NATE GANA: You do, OK.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.468
IAN CHANG: It's just that
they are not called Solist.

00:20:14.468 --> 00:20:18.780
They are called, for example x
bourbon cask strength, or Vinho

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.150
Barrique cask
strength, and so on.

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:21.750
That's right.

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:23.610
NATE GANA: Yeah,
because I'm from Canada,

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:25.710
and in Canada we
have the Solist.

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:27.793
So I saw it here, and
I thought, OK, well,

00:20:27.793 --> 00:20:28.710
that's the same thing.

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:29.342
It has to be.

00:20:29.342 --> 00:20:31.050
Then I would look at
the labels, and they

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:34.042
would have the same, or if
not higher, alcohol content.

00:20:34.042 --> 00:20:36.000
You know that's it's
going to be cask strength.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.583
It's going to be
from the Solist line.

00:20:37.583 --> 00:20:38.430
Interesting.

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:41.550
So what's next for
Kavalan in terms

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:43.470
of what you guys are producing?

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:48.060
IAN CHANG: So the next for
Kavalan, as mentioned just now,

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.750
we will produce also gins.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:57.060
And also for the future, I
think beer is another product

00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:57.740
we will produce.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:58.490
NATE GANA: Really?

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:00.600
IAN CHANG: Yes, but
it's not called Kavalan.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.520
It's called something else.

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.230
It's called [INAUDIBLE],,
[INAUDIBLE] beer.

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:08.940
So I think King Car
company, once again,

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:15.290
the company behind Kavalan, we
are thinking of moving forward

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:20.870
into the future with more
and more alcoholic beverages,

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:23.072
a bit similar to
a Suntory Japan.

00:21:23.072 --> 00:21:23.780
NATE GANA: Right.

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.420
IAN CHANG: So in addition
to our non-alcoholic food

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.400
and beverage, I
think Mr. Lee, he

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:34.260
wants to go into the
alcoholic beverage industry.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.940
That's, I think,
our long term goal.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.440
NATE GANA: Interesting,
interesting.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.760
So what is the reason that you
guys have never produced an age

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.155
statement whisky?

00:21:42.155 --> 00:21:45.040
IAN CHANG: Yes, this is
a very good question.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.930
We have consumers
asking us everyday,

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:49.730
are we going to
produce whisky with age

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.820
statement in the future.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.730
At this stage, I would say no.

00:21:55.730 --> 00:22:00.990
But having known Mr. Lee so
well, he's very unpredictable.

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:05.220
So you never know in the
future if we will do it or not.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.580
But the thing is,
personally, I think it is not

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.890
really necessary to do so.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:15.080
Once again, if you look at the
hot climate of Taiwan, which

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.590
is subtropical, if you come
to Taiwan in the summertime

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:22.610
between May and
October each year,

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:25.070
it is normally 38
degrees Celsius, which

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:26.972
I would say 90 Fahrenheit.

00:22:26.972 --> 00:22:27.680
NATE GANA: Right.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.010
IAN CHANG: Something like that.

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:33.200
So our evaporation is
actually quite high.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.400
As you can imagine, if you
store your new make in a cask

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.205
for, say, 15 or 20 years--

00:22:40.285 --> 00:22:40.910
NATE GANA: Yes.

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:45.290
IAN CHANG: With 8% to 10%
evaporation each year,

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:48.620
by the end of 20 years time,
you don't get much left.

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:52.582
All you get left is something
that is very woody and also--

00:22:52.582 --> 00:22:53.540
NATE GANA: Makes sense.

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:57.240
IAN CHANG: Out of balance in
terms of fruitiness, floral,

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:57.740
and so on.

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:01.470
Because when you drink whisky,
you want the whole package

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:04.633
with the fullest
flavor and complexity.

00:23:04.633 --> 00:23:05.550
NATE GANA: Absolutely.

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.133
IAN CHANG: But by
the end of 20 years,

00:23:07.133 --> 00:23:10.040
with so much evaporating
into thin air,

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.390
I think we don't have much left.

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.130
And also we lose the balance.

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:13.760
NATE GANA: Yes.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:18.440
IAN CHANG: So unless we can
do it in a different way,

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:22.550
but I think we cannot really
produce whisky with age

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:23.152
statement.

00:23:23.152 --> 00:23:23.860
NATE GANA: Right.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:24.110
IAN CHANG: Yeah.

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:25.550
NATE GANA: Well, I mean it
seems to be working for you

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:26.633
without the age statement.

00:23:26.633 --> 00:23:28.820
IAN CHANG: Because
having said all this,

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.410
it's not really
necessary either.

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:35.750
Because when you try our whisky
later, like you have already

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:38.310
is tried to whisky for
within the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:40.640
NATE GANA: A lot of
your whiskies, yes.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.000
IAN CHANG: You noticed
that, even though whiskies,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.490
they are matured for a
short period of time.

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:51.350
But the maturity, the
complexity, they're

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:53.780
all there for you to enjoy.

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:59.200
Normally I usually use one
example to describe this.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:03.180
When you go to Taiwan,
from north to south

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.900
it's 400 kilometers.

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:11.045
And before we had
the high speed rail,

00:24:11.045 --> 00:24:14.990
it took five to six hours
time to take the train from

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:16.250
north to south.

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:19.400
But these days with
high speed rail,

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.495
you can complete the whole
journey in 90 minutes.

00:24:22.495 --> 00:24:23.120
NATE GANA: Wow.

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:23.912
IAN CHANG: And why?

00:24:23.912 --> 00:24:26.660
Because high speed
rail trains, they

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:30.020
have extra power, extra
energy, to run faster.

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:35.510
And we think of our maturation
process like a ordinary train,

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:37.360
but being pushed by the heat.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:37.990
NATE GANA: Yes.

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:40.490
IAN CHANG: To go
much faster forward.

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:43.520
So by the end of
the process, you

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:47.020
will reach your destination--

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:48.610
which means in
terms of whisky you

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:50.800
will get everything
from the wood,

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.700
or from oxidation process,
from extraction process,

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:59.270
from the interaction between the
spirit and the wood, and so on.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.640
They're all there
for you to enjoy.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:07.750
So it's not really necessary
to mature our whisky

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:10.810
for a long, long time just
for the sake of having

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:12.670
a number on the bottle.

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:15.460
NATE GANA: Good point, and
actually speaking of that,

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.645
you just released the Kavalan X?

00:25:17.645 --> 00:25:19.020
Is that is that
what it's called?

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:20.300
The 10th anniversary.

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:21.300
IAN CHANG: That's right.

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:26.950
So last year, it was the
4th of December on 2008,

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:30.050
that was the time when we first
launched our Kavalan Classic.

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:30.790
NATE GANA: OK.

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:36.250
IAN CHANG: So last year was the
10th year to celebrate that.

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:41.320
So Mr. Lee has decided
that also 10 years ago

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:46.413
when I went with him
to France, to Bordeaux.

00:25:46.413 --> 00:25:47.220
NATE GANA: Oh, OK.

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:50.920
IAN CHANG: We actually went
to see the so-called the five

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:55.180
main chateaus in that area.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:26:01.180
I'm not allowed to say the names
because of the nondisclosure

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.600
agreement and so on.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.350
So basically these
five main chateau,

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:09.250
they produce very good wines.

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:13.780
At that time, we bought some
wine casks from these people.

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:14.980
NATE GANA: OK.

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:19.570
IAN CHANG: So when you mature
Kavalan new make in these wine

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:22.630
casks, the end
result is something

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:23.755
that is very exceptional.

00:26:23.755 --> 00:26:24.880
NATE GANA: Yes, absolutely.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.440
IAN CHANG: I always
say that it's

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:32.410
the combination of young
new make with the tradition

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:33.917
of these old chateau.

00:26:33.917 --> 00:26:34.750
NATE GANA: Chateaus.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:37.342
IAN CHANG: So the flavors
are really complex.

00:26:37.342 --> 00:26:38.800
NATE GANA: Well,
you did a Pauillac

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.240
and a Margaux, is that correct?

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:40.990
IAN CHANG: So far.

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:41.660
NATE GANA: Right.

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:41.860
IAN CHANG: Yes.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:42.777
NATE GANA: So far, oh.

00:26:42.777 --> 00:26:45.250
IAN CHANG: We have another
three in the pipeline.

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:46.212
NATE GANA: Oh, OK.

00:26:46.212 --> 00:26:47.320
I did not know this.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:47.980
This is good.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:48.064
Yeah.

00:26:48.064 --> 00:26:48.400
Those two were phenomenal.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.410
IAN CHANG: So these are
coming soon to the US.

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:50.840
NATE GANA: They are?

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:51.030
OK.

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:51.720
IAN CHANG: Yes.

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.090
NATE GANA: Yeah.

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:53.810
I got the chance to
try it in Europe.

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:56.050
So I'm very excited for
it to come to the US.

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:57.610
Yeah, but it's a
very limited run.

00:26:57.610 --> 00:26:58.610
IAN CHANG: Very limited.

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:04.030
So in total 5,000 sets
for the whole world.

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:10.120
Because once again, if you look
at these five special producers

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:15.350
in Bordeaux, they don't really
release their casks easily--

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:16.657
NATE GANA: To anybody.

00:27:16.657 --> 00:27:18.490
IAN CHANG: To whisky
industry or to anybody.

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:22.090
So at that time
we could only buy

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:24.160
limited numbers of these casks.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.618
NATE GANA: Well,
I think that might

00:27:25.618 --> 00:27:30.400
be the most creative combination
of whisky with chateau Margaux

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.450
and Pauillac.

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:35.017
I don't think I've seen any
brands do that too often.

00:27:35.017 --> 00:27:37.100
IAN CHANG: There are some
distilleries doing that,

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:42.130
but I would say that
the results are not

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:46.930
as satisfactory
as when you mature

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:49.450
something in subtropical heat.

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:50.590
Yeah.

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:53.160
NATE GANA: Would you
say that the 2015 World

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.450
Whisky of the year that
was given to you guys

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:59.680
was a contributing factor
to the success right now?

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.710
IAN CHANG: The 2015
world whisky award.

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:03.820
NATE GANA: Yeah.

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:07.660
IAN CHANG: Awarded the
Vinho Barrique cask strength

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.210
as world's best
single malt whisky.

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:15.880
I would say that really
made Kavalan famous.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.600
NATE GANA: Yes.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.450
IAN CHANG: Both
here and in the US,

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:23.980
and also in Europe, and
also rest of the world.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:28.270
So I think we are really
lucky to have that award,

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:30.220
to be awarded to Kavalan.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:30.760
So.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.860
NATE GANA: That's actually what
got me into Kavalan in terms

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:34.060
of what I tasted first.

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.520
IAN CHANG: I think it really
draws people's attention.

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:39.162
NATE GANA: Well it's a
red and white wine cask.

00:28:39.162 --> 00:28:40.370
IAN CHANG: Yes, that's right.

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:41.490
NATE GANA: That was
previously used,

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:42.820
and was finished for you guys.

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:43.840
That's spectacular.

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:46.060
That was the first time
I'd had any cask that

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:48.270
did red and white wine
in it at the same time.

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:49.840
So it's very, very good.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.610
IAN CHANG: That one
is very special.

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:56.330
If you would like to try it,
like Nate mentioned just now,

00:28:56.330 --> 00:29:01.360
we use both red and also white
wine casks for the maturation

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.520
of that particular expression.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.330
But if you look at the color--

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:09.730
it's not here, but if you look
at the actual whisky itself,

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:11.530
the color is a bit red.

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:14.380
So many consumers they
would think immediately

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.680
that matured in red wine cask.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:22.420
But the thing is, we can
also create the same effect

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.310
with white wine cask.

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:28.750
Because at that time in
2008, once again together

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:35.860
with Dr. Jim Swan, we developed
this brand new innovation

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:39.370
of doing the so-called
STR process, which

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:44.198
means you have to do shaving,
toasting, and recharring.

00:29:44.198 --> 00:29:45.240
NATE GANA: Of the barrel.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:45.820
IAN CHANG: To the barrel.

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:46.480
The the wine cask.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.063
NATE GANA: OK.

00:29:47.063 --> 00:29:54.498
IAN CHANG: So that everything
becomes with a uniform quality

00:29:54.498 --> 00:29:55.540
by the end of maturation.

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:56.123
NATE GANA: OK.

00:29:56.123 --> 00:29:59.080
Wow, interesting.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:02.650
So when we have here for
you guys today I think

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:05.650
is interesting because I
would say that the Distillery

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:10.900
Select is you can do both
whisky on its own neat,

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:11.950
or in a cocktail.

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:12.910
IAN CHANG: That's
right, that's right.

00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:14.460
NATE GANA: Which is
kind of interesting.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.127
IAN CHANG: Distillery
Select is actually

00:30:16.127 --> 00:30:18.620
designed to be a very
versatile single malt

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:23.440
whisky, whether you like
it neat, or on the rocks,

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.750
or in cocktails.

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:29.890
Through the creation of
these artworks of cocktails,

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:32.992
of these mixologist, this
one is the perfect choice.

00:30:32.992 --> 00:30:34.450
NATE GANA: I think
it's interesting

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:37.960
because I would say that
for me Chicago, personally,

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.070
is the best place in the US to
drink whisky or to find whisky.

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:42.070
IAN CHANG: Yes, I agree.

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.570
I agree.

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:44.410
NATE GANA: I think
the bar scene here

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:47.830
is incredibly diverse,
incredibly unique.

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:49.420
You can go anywhere
and find some

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.565
of the best malts
on the wall and have

00:30:51.565 --> 00:30:52.690
some of the best cocktails.

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:54.460
I don't think any
other market in the US

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:55.600
really compares to that.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.100
You've got New York,
which is great,

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.880
but New York knows what it has.

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.840
It knows that it's got
the financial ability

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:04.970
to charge these exorbitant
prices for certain things.

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:08.080
And I think that here in
Chicago, you come, and you

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.170
get a drink, and very good
quality drink, for a very

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:11.920
reasonable price.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.140
And I think that's the
true sign of the industry

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:16.930
here that it's such
a diverse place

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:18.580
to get these types of products.

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:22.330
And so I just love
it here, and I

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:25.558
love that this is where
I met Kavalan, and fell

00:31:25.558 --> 00:31:26.600
in love with it out here.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.295
So Ian thank you
so much for this.

00:31:28.295 --> 00:31:29.170
IAN CHANG: Thank you.

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:31.490
NATE GANA: I really appreciate
this thank you very much.

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:32.000
IAN CHANG: Thank you.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.160
And thank you for
coming as well.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:33.672
Cheers.

00:31:33.672 --> 00:31:35.380
NATE GANA: Thank you
guys all for coming.

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.710
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:39.970
At this time I'd love to
open it up to you guys

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:44.153
if you have any questions
for Mr. Ian Chang here,

00:31:44.153 --> 00:31:45.570
AUDIENCE: In your
introduction you

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:48.613
mentioned that Kavalan is one
of the most technologically

00:31:48.613 --> 00:31:49.530
advanced distilleries.

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:52.460
Can you speak about that?

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.570
IAN CHANG: OK, so
what Nate meant

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:58.270
was at Kavalan,
because as you know,

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:00.240
we are a very young distillery.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:07.350
This is only our 15th year
in the distilling operation.

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:10.260
So what we do is we
think that in order

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:14.160
to make sure that we
can obtain the quality,

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.580
we pay a lot of
attention to details

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:21.010
by using scientific methods.

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:25.680
For example, when it comes
to the milling process, which

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:29.220
is the first stage
that we do at Kavalan,

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:38.300
where you use mills to
break the multi barley into

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:44.190
define the course and the
flour, the three portions.

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:46.800
We always make sure that
our quality control people,

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:50.820
they do the this
size determination

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:52.770
work on a daily
basis to make sure

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:56.910
that this is at a
so-called golden ratio

00:32:56.910 --> 00:32:59.470
of our golden ratio.

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:02.640
So that for the next
stage of our mashing,

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:07.740
we manage to extract the
maximum amount of starch

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:13.740
into glucose by the natural
conversion of internal enzymes

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:15.240
of the malted barley.

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.910
And this is, once
again achieved by using

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:21.720
very precise temperature
control equipment

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.030
that we have at the distillery.

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:29.010
So that during the mashing
process from the first water,

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:33.570
which is always 63.5
degrees Celsius, and then

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:37.980
the second water to be 85,
and a third one to be 90.

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:42.460
And then followed
by the fermentation,

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:47.040
where we also use the
so-called jacketed vessel,

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:54.810
so that we can run cold water
in the outside of the jacket

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:58.080
to control the temperature
during the fermentation

00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:58.980
process.

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:02.520
Because this is,
once again, it will

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:06.180
affect the quality
of your wash, which

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:13.400
is the alcoholic, which
is also called beer,

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:17.300
can have a very high
content of alcohol.

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:21.030
Also very fruity, very
complex, the note.

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:25.409
So these are all just
some of these examples

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:31.620
of what we do to in order to
obtain quality in our product

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:34.830
by using scientific method.

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:39.270
And also when it comes
to the final stage,

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:45.570
we also use our
GCMS and also HPLC,

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:49.480
all these high tech
chemical analysis

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:54.659
to determine whether we have
the right amount of wood related

00:34:54.659 --> 00:35:01.290
flavors, the right amount
of oxidized compounds

00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:05.340
in order to contribute
to your good mouth feel,

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:09.120
and also the good fragrance
when you nose the whisky.

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:15.240
So that's what we do at Kavalan
in terms of scientific methods.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.220
Thank you.

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:20.630
AUDIENCE: Are there any plans
to introduce a peated malt,

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:22.592
like a heavily peated malt?

00:35:22.592 --> 00:35:23.800
NATE GANA: Oh, good question.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.690
IAN CHANG: Wow.

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:27.520
I can see that you are a
connoisseur yourself, sir.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.870
AUDIENCE: It's Chicago.

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:32.700
IAN CHANG: Yes.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:38.940
When Kavalan first started
we produced 100% unpeated.

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:42.420
But after five years
ago, once again Mr. Lee,

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:44.350
he's unpredictable.

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:47.130
But one thing about
him is that he listens

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:52.900
to consumers' comments
and also consumers' needs.

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:58.470
So these days, we see that more
and more consumers globally

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:01.770
who like peated whisky.

00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:08.610
So that was three
years ago, so 2016,

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:13.330
we started to produce
our peated new make.

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:19.680
So these are now in the process
of maturation in a warehouse.

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:22.800
Hopefully by early
next year, we should

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:30.670
be able to launch our very first
peated expression of Kavalan

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:32.220
for you to enjoy.

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:33.970
AUDIENCE: Please make
sure it hits the US.

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:34.510
IAN CHANG: Yes, yes.

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:35.160
Definitely.

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:38.070
NATE GANA: We'll make sure you
specifically get something.

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:41.630
So Josh, keep us in
touch, and we'll do it.

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:42.405
IAN CHANG: Yes.

00:36:42.405 --> 00:36:43.030
NATE GANA: Wow.

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.822
That's really cool.

00:36:43.822 --> 00:36:46.330
IAN CHANG: But one thing
about our peated whisky

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:52.865
is that if you like whiskies
like Ardbeg or, say--

00:36:52.865 --> 00:36:53.740
NATE GANA: Laphroaig.

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:54.700
IAN CHANG: Laphroaig.

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.355
These are quite heavily peated.

00:36:56.355 --> 00:36:56.980
NATE GANA: Yes.

00:36:56.980 --> 00:37:01.720
IAN CHANG: So Kavalan's
peated single malt whisky,

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:04.270
I would say it is
very mildly peated.

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:10.030
So in terms of the so-called
the phenolic level, in terms

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:16.180
of parts per million, PPM, it
is about five to 10 PPM only.

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:19.780
So just enough for you
to notice on the nose,

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:23.560
but when you try it
on the palate, that's

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:28.120
when the all these
peated molecules and also

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:34.570
the fruity, all these
complexities will become alive.

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:39.751
So something very different
and also very unique as well.

00:37:39.751 --> 00:37:42.240
AUDIENCE: So you guys talked
about your scientific process

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:46.420
and how you guys have a
lot of quality control.

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:50.380
And then you also paralleled
the tropical environment

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:54.090
towards the reason why you guys
are doing five year, ten year.

00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:55.090
IAN CHANG: That's right.

00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:57.280
AUDIENCE: But have
you guys considered

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.010
doing a temperature
controlled environment

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:01.750
in order to age
them in the barrels

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:03.940
to keep the evaporation
from happening,

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:06.430
or do you feel like the
tropical environment is

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:09.460
what really leads to
the distinct flavor

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:11.425
and personality in the Kavalan?

00:38:11.425 --> 00:38:13.300
IAN CHANG: Yes, this is
a very good question.

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:18.560
This is all about finding
the so-called, the optimum,

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:22.030
the balance between
natural environment

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:26.140
but also refrigerated or
temperature controlled

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:27.280
environment.

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:34.300
As we know, if you can lower
the temperature of the warehouse

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:37.990
or the surrounding area
where you mature your whisky,

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:41.830
you can actually reduce
the Angel's Share, which

00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:46.540
is the evaporation, but also
you can prolong the maturation

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:48.220
time.

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:54.110
But the thing is, when it comes
to the regulations in Taiwan,

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:59.150
we cannot really move
the unfinished product.

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:02.570
Where in our case, in
the case of whisky,

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:04.880
our government
considered whisky,

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:09.480
I mean new make in the cask,
are considered to be unfinished.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:14.120
So you cannot move the content
and also the cask away from

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.800
a distillery.

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.810
Otherwise Mr. Lee
has actually thought

00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:24.050
about moving our casks
with the new make them up

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:28.820
into the mountains, into
caves, or somewhere cool.

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:33.320
But once again the thing is he
also cannot wait for the whisky

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:38.730
to be mature so that we
can sell our expressions.

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:41.870
So these days I'm
actually working

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:47.720
on a very, very
special, I would say,

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:52.910
method or implementation
that we can

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:56.210
try to reduce the Angel's
Share without prolonging

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:59.940
the time of maturation.

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:03.830
So at the end of the day, once
again it's all about quality.

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:06.890
If we just want to put
a number on the label

00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:10.850
to say that this is 12 years
old, 15 years old, or 20

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:15.110
years old, we would need
to do a very different way

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:17.940
of maturing our cask.

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.450
Our new make in the cask.

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:26.310
That is something that we
always think about internally.

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:26.810
Yes.

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:34.900
I know that since we launched
into the global markets

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:39.680
also in the sectors of duty
free and travel retail,

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:44.600
one of our very good partner
which is CDF, which operates

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:48.470
the duty free shops in
Hong Kong the airport,

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:51.380
they always want
Kavalan to come up

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:55.700
with a 12 years old
or 15 years old whisky

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:58.820
so that they can sell
in Hong Kong airport.

00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:02.750
But so far Mr. Lee
still thinks that is not

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:04.090
really necessary to do so.

00:41:06.925 --> 00:41:07.550
Thank you, sir.

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:15.750
Also a connoisseur
because you know

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:17.760
the balance between these two.

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.500
NATE GANA: Yeah.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:20.500
AUDIENCE: Actually I did
have one more question.

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:21.590
IAN CHANG: Yes, please.

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:23.465
AUDIENCE: Have you guys
considered, since you

00:41:23.465 --> 00:41:25.370
guys are considered the most--

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:28.560
technology-- wow,
I can't even speak.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.480
Well, I work here, I promise.

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:33.880
It's considered an advance
distilling process.

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:34.380
There we go.

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:35.720
IAN CHANG: Yes, yes.

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:39.050
AUDIENCE: Have you guys
considered any kind of movement

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:40.508
based maturing processes?

00:41:40.508 --> 00:41:42.550
I know that I think it's
one of the distilleries,

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:46.120
they stated that they could
be able to speed along

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:49.280
the effects of maturing
by putting casks

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.018
on like ships in the ocean
and the movement of the waves.

00:41:52.018 --> 00:41:53.060
NATE GANA: The Jefferson.

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:54.537
AUDIENCE: Jefferson, exactly.

00:41:54.537 --> 00:41:55.370
IAN CHANG: Yes, yes.

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:55.580
That's right.

00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:57.000
NATE GANA: That's
a good question.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.920
IAN CHANG: So we actually
have done something like that

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:04.820
already for the past 14 years.

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:10.730
Because if you come to see
us in the future to Taiwan,

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:15.800
you'll see that our maturation
warehouses, at the moment

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:16.800
we have two.

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:21.080
So both of them are
five story tall,

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:23.330
and within the
warehouse you actually

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:28.640
have temperature differences
between floors to floors.

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:31.640
So when I say that a hot
summer between May and October

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:36.500
each year, when the outside
is 38 degrees Celsius,

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.720
the inside can
actually be as warm

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:42.150
as 42 to 45 degrees Celsius.

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:45.510
So that is something
also very hot

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:53.090
just like on a boat if you put
everything in the trunk inside.

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:57.050
So the temperature is
very high in there.

00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:00.950
And that's how we manage
to extracts the nice colors

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:03.920
from the wood into the whisky.

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:07.700
And also we purposely
shut all the windows

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:11.660
during our summertime so that
we can drop the heat in there

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:14.660
to create the so-called
artificial greenhouse

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:16.730
effect within the warehouse.

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:20.510
So that is something that
we do similar to the product

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:23.310
that you have
mentioned just now.

00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:25.490
Yes.

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:27.540
But that's only good for color.

00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:31.560
In wintertime, we have to open
all the windows to encourage

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:35.280
the cold air coming from
Siberia through Japan

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:39.810
and then come to Taiwan, which
is about today here 6 degrees

00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:41.280
Celsius outside.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.080
This is our super
winter in Taiwan.

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:47.040
So this is when we
encourage the cold air

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:51.810
to go into the warehouse so
that oxidation process will

00:43:51.810 --> 00:43:54.610
take place really nicely.

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:55.110
Yeah.

00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:59.860
Oxidation is inversely
proportional to temperature.

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:02.670
So if you want
good oxidation, you

00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:08.010
need to keep your casks with
the content inside in a cooler

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:09.930
environment.

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:14.010
So warm summer,
relatively cold a winter

00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:16.170
for about four to
five years time.

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:22.610
That's how we manage
to get that maturity.

00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:23.760
NATE GANA: Thank you.

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:27.710
Yeah.

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:35.605
AUDIENCE: Here we go.

00:44:35.605 --> 00:44:37.980
AUDIENCE: So I actually want
to change gears a little bit

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:41.000
from process and talk more
about the culture in Taiwan

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.375
around whisky and
alcohol in general.

00:44:44.375 --> 00:44:45.750
This is a really
interesting case

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:48.800
since it was relatively
recently passed,

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:52.400
when the WTO changes occurred
[INAUDIBLE] opened up.

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:55.690
So yeah I'd love to talk
or hear your thoughts

00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:57.960
on how you feel the
drinking culture has changed

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:02.200
or industry culture has changed
over the past 15, 20 years.

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:05.670
IAN CHANG: So since we joined
WTO, consumers in Taiwan

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:06.660
drink even more.

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:09.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:14.880
Because you can have opened
imports from around the world.

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:17.730
Before used to be
only our government,

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:20.010
they select what to import.

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:22.290
For example, at
that time, I don't

00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:25.140
know for some reason
they really like cognac.

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:31.740
So cognac was the biggest
spirit in Taiwan before 2002.

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:38.760
So after we join WTO, we do
see a market that is more open,

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:45.780
and also consumers able to
try more different varieties

00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:51.490
whether whisky, or wines,
or beer, and everything.

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:53.670
So the drinking
culture in Taiwan

00:45:53.670 --> 00:46:00.830
is very much business related.

00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:06.080
For example, we have to
entertain our clients.

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:09.910
So when we go to
business dinners,

00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:13.480
that's when the volume
is really generated

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:17.230
because we have this culture
of doing Ganbei, which

00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:21.567
means bottoms up in one shot.

00:46:21.567 --> 00:46:22.900
I think Nate has experienced it.

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:23.980
NATE GANA: I have
experienced this, yes.

00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:26.320
IAN CHANG: We all know
the distillery's Mr. Lee,

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:29.290
who is the ultimate
drinking machine.

00:46:29.290 --> 00:46:30.412
NATE GANA: Yes.

00:46:30.412 --> 00:46:31.120
Well, it's funny.

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:36.690
When we went to Taiwan, we
went to the German beer house

00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:37.870
that you guys own.

00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:38.400
IAN CHANG: That's right.

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:39.620
NATE GANA: What was
it called again?

00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:40.600
IAN CHANG: It's [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:41.730
NATE GANA: Yes, yes, yes.

00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:44.420
OK, so we went to a
German beer house,

00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:46.000
and I thought this
is very different

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.982
for a Taiwanese whisky
company to be taking us

00:46:47.982 --> 00:46:48.940
to a German beer house.

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:51.670
But sure enough, they had
all of the Kavalan whiskies

00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:52.580
on the wall there.

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:54.790
And to speak to your
point, one thing

00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:56.830
that I think that I
love about the brand

00:46:56.830 --> 00:46:59.020
is that it's the only
brand in the world that

00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:00.490
has their own stores.

00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:04.390
So you go to Taiwan now
and there's Kavalan stores

00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:05.140
throughout Taiwan.

00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:07.432
Whereas you go here, and
there's a liquor store, right?

00:47:07.432 --> 00:47:12.310
So it's liquor, we were talking
about yesterday, Liquor park,

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:13.650
or Binny's.

00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:15.490
They're actual
liquor store names.

00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:17.360
Over there, the Kavalan stores.

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.630
And so I found that really,
really interesting that

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:20.470
was the only market.

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:22.350
What was the reason for that?

00:47:22.350 --> 00:47:27.340
Oh, because to be
honest, initially,

00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:30.040
when we launched our very
first whisky, which is this one

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:34.030
here, back in 2008, on
the 4th of December,

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:39.910
I remember very clearly we
invited media people and also

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:42.940
wine and liquor shop owners.

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:48.160
No one was interested
in Kavalan because they

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:53.200
used to think that mainstream,
after all is, scotch.

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.580
And when it comes
to scotch, it's

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:59.140
always about 12 years old,
15 years old, 20 years old.

00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:03.310
And they talk about the
tradition and the heritage

00:48:03.310 --> 00:48:05.060
of hundreds of years.

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:10.600
So at that time, no one wants
to sell Kavalan or buy Kavalan

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.370
domestically.

00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:16.330
So Mr. Lee Sr., he was
actually quite upset.

00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:20.140
So he decided that, OK, if you
don't want to sell my products,

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:22.370
I'll sell them myself.

00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:27.760
So he set up his own stores,
which is throughout Taiwan.

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:30.624
We now have 100.

00:48:30.624 --> 00:48:31.940
NATE GANA: You have 100 stores?

00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:33.880
IAN CHANG: Yes,
from north to south.

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.130
NATE GANA: Wow, I didn't
know it was that many.

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:36.505
IAN CHANG: So
these are the shops

00:48:36.505 --> 00:48:43.710
where you can go and experience
the complete flavors of Kavalan

00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:47.370
and also anything that
King Car group produces.

00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:49.120
NATE GANA: Yeah, they're
brilliant stores.

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:50.890
They're very well
laid out, and I

00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:53.510
think that speaks to the
Taiwanese culture post WTO

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:54.010
as well.

00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:55.900
Because I don't know
of any other country

00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:57.940
right now that
would allow a brand

00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:00.250
to have a store apart
from the distillery

00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:01.960
store on the distillery itself.

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:03.130
Right, so yeah.

00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:04.810
Very open culturally
in that respect.

00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:07.580
IAN CHANG: That's right.

00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:10.630
So please come and see us
in the future if you can.

00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:14.890
From Chicago, you
have direct flight

00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:18.730
to Taipei, which is
13 hours, and then

00:49:18.730 --> 00:49:20.330
from the airport
to our distillery

00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:22.100
is less than two hours.

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:24.400
So in less than 20
hours, you'll be there.

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:27.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:30.260
And if you come,
as I always say,

00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:32.530
I'll make sure that you
drink until you drop.

00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:35.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:36.290
As much as you want.

00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:38.390
You can even bring your
container with you.

00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:39.760
I'll let you take away some.

00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:43.600
NATE GANA: Anymore.

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.400
IAN CHANG: It's all
about moderate drinking.

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:48.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:49.810
NATE GANA: Drink responsibly.

00:49:49.810 --> 00:49:50.890
Yes.

00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:54.970
Good advertising for drinking
responsibly at the end of this.

00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:56.510
Well, thank you guys so much.

00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:57.880
This has been spectacular.

00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.020
Really appreciate you guys.

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:00.310
And Ian, thank you
again for this.

00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:00.820
IAN CHANG: Thank you, Nate.

00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:01.560
NATE GANA: It was really good.

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:02.540
Thank you.

00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:07.370
IAN CHANG: And before we end I
would just like to thank Google

00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:08.980
once again for having us.

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:09.980
We really appreciate it.

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:10.480
NATE GANA: Thank you all.

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:11.330
Josh, you've done
an incredible job.

00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:11.620
Fantastic.

00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:12.090
IAN CHANG: That's right.

00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:12.830
Thank you.

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:15.080
NATE GANA: And of course, I
hope you guys stick around

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:17.480
for a trial of all
these lovely whiskies

00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:20.570
because they have
some fantastic stuff.

00:50:20.570 --> 00:50:21.735
Thank you guys very much.

00:50:21.735 --> 00:50:22.610
IAN CHANG: Thank you.

00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:25.660
[APPLAUSE]
