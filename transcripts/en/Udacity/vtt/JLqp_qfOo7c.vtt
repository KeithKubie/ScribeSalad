The graphs we've been looking at are called identity by descent, or

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:08.100
IBD graphs. And identity by descent means that you're identical for a

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.260
particular segment of the genome with somebody else, because you inherited that

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.712
segment of the genome from a common ancestor. now, it's all pretty complicated.

00:00:17.712 --> 00:00:19.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've, I've heard it's pretty

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.690
complicated, and we're going to spend a little

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.095
bit more time going in depth in to identity by descent in lesson 11.
