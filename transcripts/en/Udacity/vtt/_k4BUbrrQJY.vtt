00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, let's see. The way I would approach this problem is by first, thinking about what we have.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
What we have is potential energy and I'm going to call that the initial potential energy.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Since what we're going to need will require both some potential energy final and some kinetic energy.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now hopefully, what we have is greater than what we need because

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
we're going to lose some energy when we go over this area with friction.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
If I think about this in terms of energy, the final energy would just be

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
whatever my energy is minus how much I lose here.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The amount of energy I lose, well, that would just be the work done by friction.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
How much energy is lost? Well, I can rewrite this equation like this. Okay, fair enough.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We need the initial energy and the final energy, and then we can convert that to some sort of work

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and we should know the maximum force, not bad.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Well, the initial energy that's just the potential energy.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The final energy is our final potential energy and remember this is now a height of 2R,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
so this is an expression for my energy lost.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I can plug in my known values from up here and I find energy lost is equals to 40,000 joules,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and how is that energy getting lost? Well, friction is doing work.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Let's take a look at a force diagram for the car.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We've got our standard weight in normal force and since the car is moving to the right,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
friction is point to the left and note that this is exactly parallel going the opposite direction

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
as the direction of motion, so we can use our equation, work equals F parallel times distance.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And I get an answer of 2000 N. Now you may have also called this negative.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I was being a little sloppy here with what I should call negative and positive.

00:01:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We accepted that Â± 2000 N for the answer.
