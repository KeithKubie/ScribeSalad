[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.092 --> 00:00:13.550
CARLEY GRAHAM
GARCIA: Hi, everyone.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.940
We are in for a treat.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.490
For those of you
that I don't know,

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.870
my name is Carley Graham Garcia.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.700
I run external affairs for
Google's New York City campus.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.220
Last fall, I had the
chance to meet Bob Roth who

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.710
runs the David Lynch
Foundation and learn

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.110
a bit about transcendental
meditation, which

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.730
is the subject of this talk.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.430
He has brought
today Russell Brand

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.650
who needs no introduction--

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.900
comedian, now father, author.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.150
We're going to hear all
about it and, in particular,

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.830
how transcendental meditation
has affected his life.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.209
So please join me in
welcoming Russell and Bob.

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:54.125
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.460
RUSSELL BRAND: Hey, thanks.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.360
Thanks for introducing
me and Bob.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.620
BOB ROTH: Careful.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.020
CARLEY GRAHAM GARCIA:
Thank you for being here.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.390
So you seem like an
unlikely friendship.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.960
Tell us how you met before
we talk specifically

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.190
about meditation.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.700
RUSSELL BRAND: [CLEARING THROAT]

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.790
CARLEY GRAHAM GARCIA: How'd
this friendship begin?

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.760
RUSSELL BRAND: Should
I answer it or Bob?

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.790
Because we'll probably have
different perspectives because,

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.340
perhaps, there is no
objective reality,

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.270
merely a series of
myriad [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.939
and interpretations
of various events.

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.230
For example, in this room
now, you'd say what happened?

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.600
And some people would
go it was really weird.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.560
They lingered around there.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.560
But then later, they'd
go, no, he high-fived me.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.580
And you'll go he fucked
with my introduction.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.980
So, already, there is no
objective reality, merely

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.107
a series of filtered events.

00:01:56.107 --> 00:01:56.940
We met in a gay bar.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.534
BOB ROTH: Don't
tell his wife-to-be.

00:02:03.534 --> 00:02:05.025
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:06.135 --> 00:02:07.730
No, you were working on a film.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.730
RUSSELL BRAND: Oh, yeah.

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.560
I was working on a film.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.160
Go on, Bob.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.150
You say your version.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.830
Your version is as
valuable as mine.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:15.330
We'll see.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.160
We can judge after.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.970
BOB ROTH: About seven or
eight years ago, Russell

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.490
was working on a
documentary on happiness.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.890
And you were going all over
the country, weren't you?

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.010
You went to--

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.010
RUSSELL BRAND: Bloody
ironic, it was, because it

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.301
was a documentary on happiness.

00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:31.955
It was an absolute
pain in the ass.

00:02:31.955 --> 00:02:33.860
Couldn't have been
more miserable.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.960
It was meant to be a sort
of a scrutinizing subject

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.580
of happiness and peace.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.840
But I suppose I've been given
the opportunity without fully

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.430
thinking about what I would do.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.671
Sometimes there's a moment
when you have more power

00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:48.920
than you know what to do with.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.060
People-- Oliver
Stone-- approached me,

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.850
do you want to
make a documentary?

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:51.720
I went, yeah.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.280
All right.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.270
And then I was making
the documentary

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.370
before fully realizing
what it was about.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.320
So sort of out of
nowhere I reached

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.029
for the tangent
happiness, and I was

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:03.570
in the middle of
making a documentary

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.880
about knowing what I was doing.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.360
E.g., this interview now.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.735
I don't know what it's about.

00:03:07.735 --> 00:03:08.234
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:08.234 --> 00:03:10.950
I was in the foyer, and
I was asking people.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.477
There was a lady
called [? Jerry ?]

00:03:12.477 --> 00:03:13.560
who needs to quit smoking.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.185
There was a man
called, I think, Jerome

00:03:15.185 --> 00:03:17.040
I met in-- we were
walking through the door.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.270
He goes, oh, you're
doing a speech.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.560
And I went what is it about?

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.770
And he went, that is
your job to decide.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:22.644
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.710
CARLEY GRAHAM GARCIA:
Well, let's go there.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:25.560
It's a good segue.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.290
You have written a book
around addictions coming out

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.190
called "Fix"--

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.190
coming out in September.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.910
RUSSELL BRAND: Yeah, I
wasn't sure about the title.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:33.868
Do you think it's good?

00:03:33.868 --> 00:03:36.960
"Fix," and I was wondering
about "Practical Alchemy."

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.530
No, "Fix."

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.030
"Fix."

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.830
CARLEY GRAHAM GARCIA: Talk about
how transcendental meditation

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.110
has helped you recover
from addictions,

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.810
has helped the process.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.580
RUSSELL BRAND:
Transcendental meditation

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.260
helps as part of a process
of tackling addiction

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.740
because, firstly, if there
is an addiction issue--

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.450
and I suppose now that
I've been at university

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.340
for, in my language,
a fortnight.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.580
That means two weeks--

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.240
I have the dilettante's
zeal, the zeal

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.320
of the newly-converted.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.360
I was not educated
as a younger person.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.780
Only lately have I been subject
to conventional education.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.075
So, by god, the vocabulary
download I've been getting.

00:04:14.075 --> 00:04:18.430
I'm trying to [INAUDIBLE] all
of it in this next 10 minutes.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.430
What I learned is you
have to define your terms.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.454
Addiction-- what is addiction?

00:04:23.454 --> 00:04:25.245
That's how you win an
argument with people.

00:04:25.245 --> 00:04:26.350
You go what do you
mean by addiction?

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.610
What do you mean by secularism?

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.570
What do you mean by god?

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:29.620
What do you mean by politics?

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.610
What do you mean by religion?

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.990
What do you mean by
counterrevolution?

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.156
What do you mean by culture?

00:04:33.156 --> 00:04:35.860
Don't let anyone say anything
that you don't [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.820
that you accept.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.070
And then you can tie them
up in semantics when they're

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.280
arguing-- a bit late
now because we've all

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.850
fallen foul of fascism by
mistake, and we're in it,

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:44.620
so there you go.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.119
We're going to have
to deal with it.

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:48.310
I just mean on the
global, political level,

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.980
nothing serious.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.610
Addiction means,
to me, a behavior

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.050
that you keep repeating, and you
can't stop even if you want to.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.830
So if you're eating
is troubling you,

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.372
if your sexual
behavior is troubling,

00:05:03.372 --> 00:05:04.913
your relationships,
your relationship

00:05:04.913 --> 00:05:05.830
with your own work--

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.440
more obvious are chemical
forms of addiction

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.010
because the consequences
are greater,

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.635
particularly drug
addiction, because it

00:05:11.635 --> 00:05:13.870
is criminalized as
we now know thanks

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.420
to brilliant documentaries
like the "13th," in some cases,

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.920
is a way of penalizing and--

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.270
what do I want to say--
marginalizing and imprisoning

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.580
unpopular or,
perhaps you could say

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.619
from a capitalistic perspective,
unnecessary demographics.

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:30.160
But, like I said,
for me, addiction--

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.070
any behavior that you want to
stop and change but cannot.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.210
That's what addiction is.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.110
Me, I'm lucky.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.430
I would crack it and smack it.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.240
It's very clear.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.410
If you're taking heroin
and crack every day,

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:40.915
it's non-negotiable.

00:05:40.915 --> 00:05:42.707
It is evident that
you are a drug addict.

00:05:42.707 --> 00:05:45.040
It's not like, oh, have you
got a problem with cupcakes?

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.020
Yeah, maybe.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:48.764 --> 00:05:50.590
Well, you're asleep
in a doorway.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.120
Something seems
to be going wrong.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.434
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.400
So transcendental
meditation-- look

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.399
how long it's taking me
to answer this question.

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:01.480
How annoying [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.880
The first thing you have
to do is acknowledge

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.940
that you've got a problem.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.230
If you don't acknowledge
you've got a problem,

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.300
how can you intervene in
your own consciousness?

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.990
You have to intervene.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.860
This is the problem.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.590
Second, you have to believe
that change is possible.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.960
You have to be open to the
possibility of new data.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.650
I'm trying to use their lexicon.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.070
Three, you need to
accept external help.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.937
In my language--

00:06:23.937 --> 00:06:26.020
I was just talking to
somebody called Lauren there

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.110
who was-- oh, shit.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.580
[INAUDIBLE] against the law
what she was telling me.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.780
I just spoke to an
anonymous person

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.180
whose identity I won't
reveal who was telling me

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.530
that they had taken ayahuasca.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.870
Now through ayahuasca,
she had an experience

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.420
within her own consciousness
that she had not previously

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.535
encountered.

00:06:41.535 --> 00:06:43.410
And some of you that
have taken hallucinogens

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.076
will know there's
stuff inside your mind

00:06:45.076 --> 00:06:47.050
that you're not
continually encountering.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.090
So step three of this program
I'm explaining to you--

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.280
step one, I'm fucked.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.200
Step two, is it possible
to not be fucked?

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.870
Step three, are you
going to unfuck yourself

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.420
using the very consciousness
that got you into this position

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.020
in the first place?

00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.770
Of course you're not.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.300
You're going to
have to accept help.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.130
It could be of a
divine nature, or it

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.540
could be of a practical nature.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.970
Do you know how you feel more
powerful, collectively and

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:07.690
communally?

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:08.610
These are the kind
of relationships

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:09.735
that are being broken down.

00:07:09.735 --> 00:07:12.306
Also, it doesn't
have to be some sort

00:07:12.306 --> 00:07:17.140
of monotheistic, bloody,
patriarchal, racist, biased,

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.487
sexist, homophobic face--

00:07:18.487 --> 00:07:19.570
BOB ROTH: Is that like me?

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:20.540
Is that why you're--

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.270
RUSSELL BRAND:
[INAUDIBLE] Oh, my god.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.610
BOB ROTH: No, no.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:22.370
Am I that guy?

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.953
RUSSELL BRAND: Yeah, it was like
neuro-linguistic programming.

00:07:24.953 --> 00:07:25.616
I went, racist!

00:07:25.616 --> 00:07:26.530
BOB ROTH: Yeah.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.094
Homophobe.

00:07:28.094 --> 00:07:30.010
RUSSELL BRAND: Bob has
no judgment of anybody.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.590
Bob talks to us all
as pure consciousness.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.270
That's how Bob sees us.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.650
He just sees the body as
some sort of temporary blob.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:37.680
BOB ROTH: Keep going.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.140
RUSSELL BRAND: All right.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.470
So step three is to invite
into your experience

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.640
a secondary agent.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.530
It could just be the help of
a friend or someone with more

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.530
experience than you, or
it could be this program

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:50.980
that I'm describing to you now.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.210
So, one, fucked.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:53.615
Two, possible beyond fucked.

00:07:53.615 --> 00:07:55.240
Three, are you going
to unfuck yourself

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.010
using the thing that fucked
you up in the first place?

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:57.885
Of course you're not.

00:07:57.885 --> 00:08:00.820
So the fourth step is you make
an inventory of your behaviors,

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.640
and you start to analyze how you
got yourself in this situation.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.544
Now having
inventoried, and then,

00:08:06.544 --> 00:08:07.960
in the final parts
of the program,

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.376
start to make amends to all
of the different people you've

00:08:10.376 --> 00:08:13.060
harmed, you make a decision
to remain conscious.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.356
I have noticed we have a
propensity to go unconscious.

00:08:15.356 --> 00:08:17.230
One could say that the
times we are living in

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.950
are an example of people
going unconscious on mass.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.900
People are not aware
of why they are

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.020
in fear, of why
they are in pain,

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:30.190
and are nominating erroneously
vulnerable portions of society

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.890
as the target for their
blame and condemnation.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.524
If we awaken
consciousness, people

00:08:34.524 --> 00:08:36.190
will know that what
they're experiencing

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:38.564
is their own fear, their own
pain, and their own anguish,

00:08:38.564 --> 00:08:40.990
which can only be induced
and elicited by people that

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:42.799
have huge amounts of power.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.530
That's [INAUDIBLE]
powerless people

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:45.970
can't inflict pain on others.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.910
Only powerful
people can do this.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:49.560
So my point is this.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.600
The transcendental
meditation comes in

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.520
and necessarily preluded
by what I've just said

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.915
is because, in my
view, you can't just

00:08:57.915 --> 00:08:59.860
start transcending
into another dimension

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:03.750
if you've not dealt with
your behavior, or material,

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.530
and psychological problems.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:06.520
This is how I found it.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.106
Not all of you are as
fucked up as me, I hope.

00:09:09.106 --> 00:09:10.431
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:12.390
I had to do a lot
of work before I

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:16.000
was at the point of getting
into transcendental meditation.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.340
Having done this work and
continuing to do this work

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:24.580
because my mind resets to
psychotic with every dawn,

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.490
the way that I use
transcendental meditation is

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:28.760
that I haven't--

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.340
like my friend there was
saying about ayahuasca,

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.850
an aspect of my consciousness,
which is not biochemical,

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:34.971
which is not my drives--

00:09:34.971 --> 00:09:36.220
well, it might be biochemical.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.329
We have not fully
analyzed the neurology.

00:09:38.329 --> 00:09:39.120
I mean, fuck knows.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.036
I'm not a neurologist.

00:09:40.036 --> 00:09:44.620
But an aspect of myself that is
not my identity, my memories,

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:49.320
my fears, and my desires, I
feel like I can commune with.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.310
It's a pretty good
experience, particularly

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:54.010
for someone who's not allowed
to take heroin anymore.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.590
It's good to have something
that takes me out of this world,

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.140
takes me out of this body,
helps me to connect to love,

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.060
helps me to connect
to creativity.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.565
For me, it's in the component
of my recovery from addiction.

00:10:03.565 --> 00:10:05.980
It's my ongoing recovery
from addictions.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.480
But for those of
you that don't have

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.570
such explicit, and obvious, or
evident problems with substance

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.430
misuse or other
behavioral problems,

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.680
I suppose transcendental
meditation might just

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.710
give you a home inside your
heart, a home inside yourself

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:20.650
so you don't just feel lost
and adrift in this world,

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:22.325
looking for redemption
and satisfaction

00:10:22.325 --> 00:10:24.700
from material means, which
will never, ever work for you.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.411
Sorry to break it to you.

00:10:26.411 --> 00:10:27.494
CARLEY GRAHAM GARCIA: Mmm.

00:10:27.494 --> 00:10:29.438
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:30.896 --> 00:10:32.354
BOB ROTH: How do
you really feel?

00:10:32.354 --> 00:10:33.812
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.780
CARLEY GRAHAM GARCIA:
You're now a father, and so

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.420
how does the meditation and sort
of the transformation you just

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.150
talked about influence
your fatherhood,

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.710
now that you're a dad?

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.210
RUSSELL BRAND: It
affects everything

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:47.918
because it means I am
present, and awake,

00:10:47.918 --> 00:10:51.430
and aware for my daughter.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.530
It's amazing.

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:55.330
I mean, I don't know
how it practically

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.082
applies because it's like
doing yoga or doing exercise.

00:10:58.082 --> 00:10:59.540
I suppose, with
exercise, you'd go,

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.462
oh, I'm able to lift
things over a wall.

00:11:01.462 --> 00:11:02.670
Perhaps you're a cat burglar.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.146
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:06.700
But transcendental
meditation means

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:11.480
the crucible of my consciousness
is amending, so all things--

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.940
consciousness is not
just one more phenomena.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.600
It is the seat of all phenomena.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.187
What is it that experiences
the beingness of you?

00:11:19.187 --> 00:11:20.770
What is it that
experiences your body,

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:22.320
your senses, your feelings?

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.880
Well, if this is affected
by transcendental meditation

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.710
and I reckon other
forms of meditation,

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.540
but we're here on the
David Lynch ticket,

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:32.220
so let's say
transcendental meditation.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.510
Like Krishnamurti said,
didn't you, Krishnamurti?

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:35.770
Truth is a pathless land.

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:37.320
For each of us,
it's our own route.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.509
It's own own path.

00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:39.550
But there are techniques.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:40.216
There are tools.

00:11:40.216 --> 00:11:41.830
There are doctrines and dogma.

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:44.860
And not all of them are
prejudicial, biased, and awful.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.500
Some of them are very, very
beautiful in their journeys

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.340
to God.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:54.310
So Bob who I met in this gay bar
some time ago, terribly drunk,

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.137
tequila shots lined up on either
shoulder like little glass

00:11:57.137 --> 00:11:57.720
parrots on a--

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.470
BOB ROTH: I'll translate
this in a moment.

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:00.261
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.740
RUSSELL BRAND: Don't
translate it, Bob.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:01.826
BOB ROTH: OK.

00:12:01.826 --> 00:12:02.110
It's fine.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:02.610
It's good.

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:04.530
RUSSELL BRAND: All
language is already--

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:05.824
I mean, it's really abstract.

00:12:05.824 --> 00:12:06.740
It's already abstract.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.650
BOB ROTH: So continue--
continue how we met.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:09.820
RUSSELL BRAND: It's
already an abstraction.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.410
These people talk in binary.

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:14.580
They probably already-- they're
translating into zeros and ones

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.210
as I'm talking--

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:18.290
0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0.

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:20.350
There's got to be an
algorithm for this.

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:22.680
At some point,
we'll be replaced.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.790
No matter how we strive for
perfection in the cyber world,

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:27.310
still you have to
go in an elevator,

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.340
come around the fire exit,
walk across a room because

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.630
of the realities of life.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:33.700
No matter how technologically
advanced we get,

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.710
still it's hard to get
that soap to come out

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.373
at the right time
and the water--

00:12:37.373 --> 00:12:38.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.170
No matter how advanced we come
through technological means,

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:42.760
still the stools
in the bathroom,

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.360
the toilet door only goes
to there and ends there,

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.240
so it's like your
shitting behind a plank.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.302
Hello.

00:12:51.302 --> 00:12:52.250
Hello.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:53.672
I'm vulnerable.

00:12:53.672 --> 00:12:55.094
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:55.094 --> 00:12:56.500
We will ever be flesh.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.730
We will ever be carnal.

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.410
We will ever be led by our
desires and our madness.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.680
But who will
negotiate within us?

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.620
Who are you going to have
negotiate for you when

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.410
the demons come, when
the darkness comes,

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:10.920
when the president comes?

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.110
Who will you turn to?

00:13:15.121 --> 00:13:16.870
CARLEY GRAHAM GARCIA:
So I want to ask Bob

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:18.720
to do some translation, but I--

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.450
RUSSELL BRAND: Get Bob
to do what you like.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:20.020
He's lovely.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.510
Bob's very-- in a minute,
once Bob starts talking,

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.880
you'll be praying for the
sane one to start again.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.296
CARLEY GRAHAM GARCIA: One more
question for the sane one--

00:13:27.296 --> 00:13:29.440
comedy-- one more
question for you.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.890
Comedy-- how has meditation
informed your comedy

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:33.850
or helped your comedy?

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:36.475
RUSSELL BRAND: It's helped it a
lot because I think that comedy

00:13:36.475 --> 00:13:39.400
is the continual revelation
that this material of dance

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.650
that we are engaged with
is secondary and not real.

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:42.910
You know that because you--

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:45.460
I'm assuming everyone creates
these sort of secondary cyber

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.220
dimensions.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.910
And, in that game,
"Assassin's Creed,"

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.870
the office that you work
in before you go off

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:52.720
to do the assassinations, I
feel like this is that place.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.049
I don't know.

00:13:54.049 --> 00:13:55.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.970
Like in "Assassin's
Creed," [? what I like. ?]

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.560
Anyway, how it affects
comedy is comedy

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.000
is the acknowledgement that the
material reality that we're all

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.780
engaged in now-- you
know, oh, hello Bob.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:06.080
Oh, no.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.540
I hope I'm not talking too much.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:08.280
Oh, are you OK?

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.774
It's all bullshit.

00:14:09.774 --> 00:14:10.740
It's not real, is it?

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:11.490
None of it's real.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:12.670
We're all going to die.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.460
We are going to actually die.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:18.790
Maybe not the consciousness,
[INAUDIBLE], maybe not that.

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:19.330
Please, God.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:19.830
Please, God.

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:22.288
But the individual identity,
the biography, it's all going.

00:14:22.288 --> 00:14:22.960
It's all going.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:23.740
So this is a game.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:24.370
This is a dance.

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:25.585
Comedy is the
revelation of that.

00:14:25.585 --> 00:14:26.840
It's the understanding of that.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.256
It's the continual
acknowledgement

00:14:28.256 --> 00:14:30.265
of when you're going,
hey, you're out of order,

00:14:30.265 --> 00:14:32.640
that part of me's like, [SPIT]
it doesn't fucking matter.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:33.530
None of it matters.

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:35.380
But oh, you broke my heart.

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.420
Something in you will
go, it's not real.

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.080
It's not real.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.546
Something in you knows already.

00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:41.170
Something in you
knows you can overcome

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:43.870
the trauma of your childhood,
the heartbreak, the pain,

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:44.440
the loss.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.899
Something in you knows that
you have not separated yourself

00:14:46.899 --> 00:14:48.315
from the eternal
and the infinite,

00:14:48.315 --> 00:14:50.920
that you are good enough, that
you don't need to be ashamed,

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.350
that you don't need to be
afraid, that we can build

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.090
worlds from our imagination.

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:57.210
Something in us
knows this already,

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:59.820
and it's trying
to realize itself.

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:03.820
Get out of its fucking way.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.218
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.009
So it helps comedy
because it just

00:15:09.009 --> 00:15:10.300
makes you think nothing's real.

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.092
So everything's funny.

00:15:13.092 --> 00:15:14.550
CARLEY GRAHAM
GARCIA: So, Bob, help

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.972
us a bit with a framework
here and how we can--

00:15:17.972 --> 00:15:18.930
BOB ROTH: Anybody help?

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:19.430
Anybody--

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:22.140
CARLEY GRAHAM GARCIA:
Well, how we can practice

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:23.340
transcendental meditation.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:25.715
BOB ROTH: First of all, I want
to say that the first time

00:15:25.715 --> 00:15:28.200
I met Russell was in
a bar in New York.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.200
RUSSELL BRAND: Told ya.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:29.824
BOB ROTH: Yeah.

00:15:29.824 --> 00:15:30.598
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:32.820
And I had been called--

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:33.720
it's interesting.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.250
A friend had called
me up and said

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:40.560
that a producer was working
on a documentary on happiness,

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.680
and I had taught this
woman to meditate.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.560
And now she was helping Russell
to produce this documentary

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.520
on happiness.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.480
And she said Russell Brand is
interested in talking with you

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.510
and possibly seeing
if meditation

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:56.920
could have a role in happiness.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:02.010
And so I didn't know who Russell
was at the time, particularly.

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:04.380
RUSSELL BRAND: I'm still
trying to work it out.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:07.560
BOB ROTH: And so I talked to
some friends, and they said,

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.670
he's incredibly funny.

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:11.460
He's very funny, but meet
with him before you do this.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:13.200
Invest this time and
see if he's going

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.150
to take this seriously or not.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:21.090
So I met him in a bar and noisy.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.850
And he came right up to me.

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:25.800
And he said, are you
going to teach me

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:26.940
transcendental meditation?

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.700
And I said, how much
time do you have?

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:32.740
Because it takes an hour
a day over four days.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.640
And this deep, and
beautiful, and very funny

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.380
man got tears in his eyes.

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:40.620
And he said, I've been searching
for the timeless my whole life.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.360
I have as much time
as you'll give me.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.030
And I taught him.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:50.230
And when I instructed him,
I remember looking over

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:51.310
as he was meditating.

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:54.560
And I thought-- he doesn't
have to be hearing this--

00:16:54.560 --> 00:17:00.730
he's one of the most
profound, honest people.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:01.980
Are we just going to do this--

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.292
RUSSELL BRAND: I'm just going
to write this down while you're

00:17:03.292 --> 00:17:04.244
saying this.

00:17:04.244 --> 00:17:05.410
BOB ROTH: It's hard enough--

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:08.430
RUSSELL BRAND: I'm
enjoying these adjectives.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:09.849
Profound, honest.

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:13.069
BOB ROTH: No, he is, just
is, is one in a million.

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:14.319
And I've been very fortunate--

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:15.339
RUSSELL BRAND: Actually
not good, statistically.

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:16.020
They deal with numbers.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:18.478
BOB ROTH: One in a million is
not that much, not that much.

00:17:18.478 --> 00:17:19.800
Am I talking too long?

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:20.424
RUSSELL BRAND: 6
billion people--

00:17:20.424 --> 00:17:21.610
No, you're not talking too long.

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:23.610
Especially with the--
more of the profound stuff

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:25.099
about how great I am.

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:27.053
That was going over really well.

00:17:27.053 --> 00:17:29.530
The lady wanted to know about
how transcendental meditation

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:30.280
is going to help--

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.975
BOB ROTH: I'm
going to get to it.

00:17:31.975 --> 00:17:33.350
I wanted to answer
this question.

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.625
RUSSELL BRAND: Don't
be so meandering.

00:17:33.625 --> 00:17:35.902
Be more like me, succinct.

00:17:35.902 --> 00:17:38.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.297
Like a harpoon--
[SHOOTING SOUND]

00:17:42.614 --> 00:17:44.530
BOB ROTH: It's like being
a substitute teacher

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:47.440
in the second grade, and
everybody's on Ritalin.

00:17:49.492 --> 00:17:51.575
RUSSELL BRAND: That's a
terrible drug [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:51.575 --> 00:17:53.900
That should be banned.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.300
Ruined my [? vocabulary. ?]

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.932
BOB ROTH: The reason I said
that is because Russell has--

00:17:57.932 --> 00:17:59.140
and I'm going to get to this.

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.215
But this is David
Lynch Foundation.

00:18:01.215 --> 00:18:02.590
That's the filmmaker
David Lynch.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:04.660
And I'm trying to
get him to come here.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:11.110
"Twin Peaks" is airing again
25 years later on Sunday.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:13.540
And Russell has been more
instrumental in bringing

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:17.890
the effects of meditation to
half a million kids, and women,

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:22.210
and children who are victims
of sexual assault and also

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:23.380
veterans.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.570
When we talk about
transcendental meditation,

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:28.070
to answer your question--

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:30.610
how many people here have
tried some form of meditation?

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.525
Yeah, like mindfulness?

00:18:32.525 --> 00:18:34.540
Yeah, lots.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.780
So I like to use an analogy.

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.810
And the analogy is
you're on a little boat,

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:42.820
and you're in the middle
of the Atlantic Ocean.

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.695
And, all of a sudden,
you get these giant 30,

00:18:44.695 --> 00:18:46.390
40 foot high waves.

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:50.300
And you could rightfully think
the whole ocean is in upheaval.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.370
Jeez.

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:53.530
But if you can do a
cross-section of the ocean

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:55.495
out there, you'd
realize that there's

00:18:55.495 --> 00:18:59.350
these little 30-foot waves,
but the ocean, in reality,

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:01.150
is over a mile deep.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:02.680
And while the
nature of the ocean

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.400
can be very turbulent and
tsunami-esque on the surface,

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.850
in reality, the ocean
at its depth is silent.

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:11.255
And so we say--

00:19:11.255 --> 00:19:12.090
Is this OK?

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:13.881
RUSSELL BRAND: Yeah,
I'm really enjoying it

00:19:13.881 --> 00:19:16.150
because isn't it interesting
how the ocean continually

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:19.120
recurs in mythology,
folklore, and literature

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.980
as the ultimate metaphor
for consciousness?

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:22.680
BOB ROTH: Yes.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.440
RUSSELL BRAND: Any
of you that know

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.220
about Jung or the work
of Joseph Campbell

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.980
now that this motif of the
ocean is continually used.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.810
So it's a very accurate
analogy that you're using.

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:33.850
And the stillness is perennial.

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:35.470
The stillness is constant.

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:39.400
The higher frequency
vibrations and seeming movement

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.150
is temporal.

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:41.146
I like that.

00:19:41.146 --> 00:19:42.142
That's good shit.

00:19:42.142 --> 00:19:43.636
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:48.340
BOB ROTH: So I met
Russell in a bar-- no.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.500
Every time you interrupt,
I'm starting over.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:51.416
RUSSELL BRAND: Oh, oh!

00:19:51.416 --> 00:19:53.310
Fuck you!

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:54.930
It is like school.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.210
Because of what
Russell's done, you've

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:59.130
all gto ot got to stay behind.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:00.071
Thanks, Russell.

00:20:00.071 --> 00:20:01.570
[? What, ?] I didn't
make that rule!

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:02.490
BOB ROTH: Yeah.

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:05.710
Anyway, the analogy
is to the mind.

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:09.030
And the surface of the mind,
this is analogous to the waves.

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:11.290
And it's been called
the monkey mind.

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:13.950
And I like to call it the gotta,
gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta,

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:15.280
gotta, gotta mind.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.030
That's the waves.

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:17.650
That's I gotta to do
this, and I gotta do that,

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.300
and I gotta call him,
and I gotta call her,

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.430
and I gotta make a list,
and I gotta find the list,

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.380
and I gotta make a new
list, and I gotta slow down,

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:24.296
but I gotta get going.

00:20:24.296 --> 00:20:25.420
I gotta get up.

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:26.563
Anybody have that?

00:20:26.563 --> 00:20:27.490
Yeah.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:29.860
And so that is that.

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:32.600
And every human being--

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.440
every human being has--

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:39.290
no matter what, we all have this
desire at some point to say,

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:42.370
god, I'd like to have a
little break in the noise.

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:45.580
I'd like to have a little inner
calm, a little inner clarity,

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.110
a little inner peace.

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:50.770
And not in a sort of religious--
just connectedness, creativity,

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:52.450
something new.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.300
And so the operative
word there is inner,

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.850
and the question is, is there
such a thing as an inner?

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:00.260
And, if so, how
do you get there?

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:05.320
So, in TM, which we're
talking about-- but I

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.740
have to pause and say I
am not a siloing person.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.510
I've been teaching
TM for 45 years.

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.443
In fact, today is
my 45th anniversary

00:21:12.443 --> 00:21:14.026
of teaching
transcendental meditation.

00:21:14.026 --> 00:21:15.475
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.705
I started at the age of 61.

00:21:20.705 --> 00:21:22.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.760
So other meditations have--

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.100
it's not a question of I'm
better, different outcomes.

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.850
And if there's time,
we can talk about it.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:32.266
Research shows
different outcomes.

00:21:32.266 --> 00:21:33.900
They have different
values, purposes.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.150
But in this meditation,
there's nothing to believe in.

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:38.640
And we hypothesize that
every human being has

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:42.240
deep inside of us right now--

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.020
right now, at the deepest level,
transcendent level of the mind,

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:49.080
there's a level of the mind that
is already calm, and settled,

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.180
and peaceful, yet wide awake.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.590
And it is unbounded.

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:53.700
And it is transcendent.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.210
It is my own nature, though.

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:57.630
You don't have to believe in it.

00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:01.600
It's there, and we've
lost access to it.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.740
And here's one other thing--
is this too much talk?

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.309
CARLEY GRAHAM
GARCIA: No, please.

00:22:05.309 --> 00:22:06.100
BOB ROTH: Because--

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.720
RUSSELL BRAND: Are you
like that in sex, Bob?

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.252
Is this OK?

00:22:08.252 --> 00:22:08.960
Are we all right?

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.010
BOB ROTH: No, I have to say why.

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:12.270
No, I want to say why I do it.

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:13.112
No, I want to say--

00:22:13.112 --> 00:22:14.070
I have to tell you why.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.965
Because I'm on the--

00:22:14.965 --> 00:22:17.256
RUSSELL BRAND: Is it hygienic
to go in the mouth after?

00:22:17.256 --> 00:22:18.120
Come on.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.602
It's not real.

00:22:19.602 --> 00:22:20.271
It's not real.

00:22:20.271 --> 00:22:21.270
Limitless consciousness.

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:23.430
BOB ROTH: The reason I do
that is I'm always on--

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:24.675
I'm usually on her side--

00:22:24.675 --> 00:22:25.200
RUSSELL BRAND: Sorry.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:25.650
Sorry.

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:26.983
CARLEY GRAHAM GARCIA: That's OK.

00:22:26.983 --> 00:22:29.350
RUSSELL BRAND: I forgot about
your grace at that moment.

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:30.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.995
I was just thinking about
Bob and derailing him

00:22:32.995 --> 00:22:33.870
for my own amusement.

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:35.120
BOB ROTH: You can't derail it.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.661
The reason I do that is
I'm often on your side,

00:22:37.661 --> 00:22:39.660
and I say, OK, you've got
three minutes to talk.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.640
And then the person goes
on for like half an hour.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:42.181
And I'm like.

00:22:42.181 --> 00:22:43.710
Will you shut up?

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:46.216
RUSSELL BRAND: [INAUDIBLE]
you're doing really well.

00:22:46.216 --> 00:22:47.635
How's your day going?

00:22:47.635 --> 00:22:48.581
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:48.581 --> 00:22:50.580
[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.580
BOB ROTH: So what
transcendental meditation does

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:56.520
is it gives access to that
transcendent level of the mind.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.620
There are mindfulness
approaches,

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.560
which have their value,
which is to either try

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.810
and clear the mind of thoughts.

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:05.700
And that's called
focused attention,

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.054
and that's trying to stop
waves on the surface.

00:23:08.054 --> 00:23:10.470
And that creates something
called gamma brain waves, which

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:13.170
are 20 to 60 cycles
per second, usually

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:15.030
in the left frontal lobe.

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:17.951
Then there is open monitoring,
which are many mindfulness

00:23:17.951 --> 00:23:18.450
approaches.

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:19.920
And there are many, as you know.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.090
And that's body scans.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:23.280
And that's mindful eating,
and mindful talking,

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.520
and mindful walking,
and mindful everything.

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:29.100
And that's to just
dispassionately observe

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.020
your thoughts to bring calm.

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:32.760
And in transcendental
meditation,

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:36.000
it's a technique that
doesn't mind waves because we

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.870
know that they exist.

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:40.920
It just gives effortless
access to the use of a mantra

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.290
but not concentrating
on the mantra, use

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:46.890
of a sound that gives access
to that transcendent level,

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:48.000
that level.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.070
And I'm about to
turn this back over

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:51.720
to Russell, but the point--

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:55.080
because I'm a sort of a
skeptical person by nature.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.640
I'm like a science guy.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.350
And you could hear
me say all that stuff

00:23:58.350 --> 00:23:59.700
about a transcendent level.

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.530
And you could say yeah,
yeah, yeah, right.

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:02.990
Where's the proof?

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:05.460
And the proof, other
than your own experience,

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:06.900
comes from science.

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:10.320
And brain research,
scans, and EEG

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.720
shows that when you
have that experience,

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.670
that experience of
your own silent level

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:18.720
of the mind, the whole brain,
electrical activity, the EEG

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.090
signature is of alpha 1.

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:23.030
That's eight to 10
cycles per second.

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:27.270
And that's a state of deep,
deep inner calm and wakefulness.

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:28.140
And one last thing.

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:31.080
Then I'm going to turn
this back over to you guys.

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:35.160
And that is, I think one of the
most important elements of this

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.530
is when the mind
settles down during TM,

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:39.870
the body gains a state
of rest, in many regards,

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:42.450
deeper than the deepest
part of deep sleep.

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:44.070
And what does that rest do?

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:46.180
You ever heard of cortisol?

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.200
Cortisol is a stress hormone.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:51.430
When Russell and I were
ready to go out here,

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:53.370
just talk, there's some anxiety.

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:55.650
And the adrenals
secrete cortisol,

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:58.210
and it makes us feel anxious.

00:24:58.210 --> 00:24:58.980
And it's terrible.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:00.840
Too much cortisol
undermines sleep,

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:05.070
undermines the immune system,
digestion, everything.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:08.310
A good night's sleep reduces
cortisol levels by 10%.

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:11.760
20 minutes of TM every time
reduces cortisol levels

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.360
30% to 40%.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.140
So it's a profound
rebooting of the system.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:17.130
Now I'm done.

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:17.940
CARLEY GRAHAM GARCIA: Thank you.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:18.440
Thank you.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.829
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:25.800
We're going to open
things up to questions.

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.830
So please if you have a
question for Russell or Bob,

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:31.170
begin to assemble at the mics.

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:32.940
But one question,
first, about something

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:36.840
you both raised, time, how
do you find the time in both

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.390
of your busy lives to do this?

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:42.389
I mean, you mentioned it's an
hour-long commitment, four--

00:25:42.389 --> 00:25:44.430
BOB ROTH: No, to learn
it, it takes an hour a day

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:45.070
over four days.

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:47.350
But to practice, 20
minutes twice a day.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:48.090
That's the ideal.

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:48.930
That's the ideal.

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:49.680
CARLEY GRAHAM GARCIA:
Russell, you're

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.700
traveling all over the world.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:51.991
You're in different time zones.

00:25:51.991 --> 00:25:53.250
You have really busy days.

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:55.920
How do you construct
this into your day?

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.360
Walk us through.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.302
Where does it fall?

00:25:58.302 --> 00:26:00.010
RUSSELL BRAND: It's
not really that hard.

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:02.343
It's just like sort of cleaning
your teeth or something.

00:26:02.343 --> 00:26:04.170
It's just something
that you ultimately

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:07.680
feel that it's nutritional
and beneficial.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.310
Why not?

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.960
20 minutes.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.251
Think of all the things you do.

00:26:10.251 --> 00:26:12.750
Think of the times you
vacantly stare at fucking

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:15.870
Facebook or whatever.

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:21.440
When I do those things, I say
after you meditate, idiot.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.430
In a way, it's in,
I don't know, sort

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:26.820
of a checkpoint in
my mind of have you--

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:31.260
before you look at pornography,
which I never do now, ever.

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:32.075
Gone, thank God.

00:26:32.075 --> 00:26:32.950
I mean, bloody stuff.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:34.890
BOB ROTH: He has a wonderful
wife to be, wife-to-be.

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:35.640
RUSSELL BRAND: Don't
worry about all that.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.181
I'm talking--

00:26:36.181 --> 00:26:38.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:41.430
My Google search would
tell a different story.

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:42.055
BOB ROTH: Yeah.

00:26:42.055 --> 00:26:42.726
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:49.190
RUSSELL BRAND: If you put
into in your own mind,

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:51.407
right, am I really going
to eat this shit food?

00:26:51.407 --> 00:26:53.490
Am I really going to spend
time looking at Twitter

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:54.239
or whatever it is?

00:26:54.239 --> 00:26:55.262
You still will do it.

00:26:55.262 --> 00:26:56.220
I still do those thing.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.860
I still find material
things, titillating

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.090
things interesting
and intriguing,

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:02.730
but I try to do
other stuff, also.

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:04.040
Have I done something
for other people?

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.410
Have I been kind
to someone today?

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:06.951
Have I gone out of
my way for people?

00:27:06.951 --> 00:27:07.692
Have I meditated?

00:27:07.692 --> 00:27:08.900
It ain't that hard, isn't it?

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.280
Like 20 minutes, for
God's sake, twice a day.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.110
What else are you going to do?

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:15.540
In a sense, if you're
spending all your time

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:19.340
ignoring the reality of
your life, i.e., mortality,

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:21.090
this is a good way to
negotiate with that.

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:21.962
It's not hard.

00:27:21.962 --> 00:27:23.295
It's not a hard thing to fit in.

00:27:23.295 --> 00:27:24.660
It's a bit of a pain in the ass.

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:25.580
The morning one, I always do.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.040
The second one can be a drag.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.873
The second one, you're
like oh fucking hell,

00:27:28.873 --> 00:27:31.002
just sit down and do
nothing for 20 minutes.

00:27:31.002 --> 00:27:33.210
So sometimes it feels like
that because I think this.

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:35.050
This is what I'd be saying if
I was a meditation teacher, not

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:37.080
that I want to teach you how to
teach meditation after you've

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.205
been doing it for 45 years,
on the very anniversary

00:27:39.205 --> 00:27:42.620
of that day by some cruel
bastard bullying a widow.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:47.390
Like everyone always
says, oh, I can't

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:50.150
meditate because my
mind's always chattering.

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:50.989
Well, fucking hell.

00:27:50.989 --> 00:27:52.530
What do you think's
going on in here?

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:54.916
I only say 10% of
the things I think.

00:27:54.916 --> 00:27:55.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:58.451
BOB ROTH: 1%.

00:27:58.451 --> 00:28:00.450
RUSSELL BRAND: That's
what it is to have a mind.

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:02.310
It's relentlessly
going on all the time.

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:03.665
That's what it fucking does.

00:28:03.665 --> 00:28:06.390
So my experience of
it is like I sit down,

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:09.100
and I go, all right,
I'm going to meditate.

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:09.840
All right.

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:10.390
Fucking hell.

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:10.940
Shut me up.

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:12.810
[INAUDIBLE] Oh, that's
terrible, the thing that

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:13.540
happened when I was a kid.

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:14.280
It'd be good if I could do that.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.270
What if I was a king?

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:15.770
Oh, no, no.

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:18.420
No, mantra, mantra,
mantra, mantra.

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:21.540
You know, this-- they make
any more "Batman" movies?

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.510
Or they-- mantra,
mantra, mantra, mantra.

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:26.040
So I return.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.711
[INAUDIBLE] You might
like this analogy.

00:28:28.711 --> 00:28:30.960
I bet if you see that movie
about that man that walked

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.260
a tightrope between the towers.

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:33.344
Do you remember that?

00:28:33.344 --> 00:28:35.760
Like, you'd think, how did he
get that cable across there?

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.260
Well, you know what
they did, right?

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.360
They fire an arrow with
a very, very thin thread

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.300
and then tied to the end of the
thin thread, a slightly thicker

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.930
string, and tied to the string,
thicker, thicker, thicker

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:46.410
till it's rope, till it's cable.

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:48.160
First, get the arrow through.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.560
Then get the thin thread.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.750
Then it becomes thicker and
thicker, the connection.

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:54.510
So, first, the arrow is sitting
down making the decision.

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:56.539
The thin thread,
the initial mantra.

00:28:56.539 --> 00:28:58.080
Don't be surprised
if your mind keeps

00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:59.462
going-- you know, rattling on.

00:28:59.462 --> 00:29:00.420
That's what a fucking--

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:01.253
that's what it does.

00:29:01.253 --> 00:29:03.660
That's its job, isn't
it, is doing that.

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.270
There's a virus in the mind.

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:07.352
The ego is a virus in the mind.

00:29:07.352 --> 00:29:07.852
Come on.

00:29:07.852 --> 00:29:09.320
Let's let people ask
questions, don't you think?

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:09.660
BOB ROTH: No, I want to--

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:10.770
RUSSELL BRAND: They're
all fucking stuck here.

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:12.075
BOB ROTH: --one last thing.

00:29:12.075 --> 00:29:13.060
RUSSELL BRAND: This
might be mandatory.

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:13.810
Is this voluntary?

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:15.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:17.751
Tell me this is voluntary.

00:29:17.751 --> 00:29:18.360
Oh, no.

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.200
It's mandatory.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.580
This is punishment.

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:22.880
This is for people
who are-- right.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.630
Because of that bad
bit of programming,

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:26.713
you've got to sit and
listen to them motherfuckers

00:29:26.713 --> 00:29:28.150
talk about meditation.

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:30.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:32.150
Please.

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:34.800
I want to go in one
of them side rooms.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.830
I have a massage.

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:37.080
I'll be in there in a minute.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.373
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:41.730
CARLEY GRAHAM GARCIA: Go ahead.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:44.140
AUDIENCE: Thank you guys
both so much for being here.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.720
My question is
really about how you

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.410
view TM versus other
meditation offerings,

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:51.570
like Headspace, which is an app.

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:56.700
Do you view TM as kind of
like the rigorous like talking

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:58.200
through it type of meditation?

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.120
Or can you talk
about how you view

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:01.949
that versus the other
standardized forms?

00:30:01.949 --> 00:30:02.990
RUSSELL BRAND: You do it.

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:03.531
BOB ROTH: OK.

00:30:03.531 --> 00:30:07.274
So, for a long time,
scientists thought all med--

00:30:07.274 --> 00:30:08.940
I mean, I've been at
this for 45 years--

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.220
so all meditation was just bunk.

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:12.720
And then, no, it was ridiculous.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:15.510
And then some initial
research came out on TM

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:18.187
in the early '70s showed that it
changed brain waves and reduced

00:30:18.187 --> 00:30:19.020
high blood pressure.

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:20.940
And then there's been more
and more data coming out

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.106
on mindfulness and other
techniques showing benefit.

00:30:23.106 --> 00:30:25.700
So then it became, well,
all meditations are the--

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.350
first of all,
meditation did nothing.

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:29.300
Now all meditations
are the same.

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.130
And now, with brain
research, it's

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:34.370
become quite clear that
there are three basic types

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:38.180
of approaches that are based on
technique, what you're actually

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:40.530
doing when you sit
and close your eyes.

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:43.340
And, as I said earlier,
one is a concentration form

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:44.370
of meditation.

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:45.800
So if you're
controlling your mind

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.520
and trying to clear
the mind of thoughts,

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:48.770
that's that focused attention.

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:50.390
And that's gamma brainwaves.

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:53.860
And then open monitoring,
that's theta brain

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:57.720
waves, five to seven cycles,
that sort of pre-onset dream.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.020
And then TM, which
is transcendent.

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:03.470
My feeling is I don't
like when people silo.

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:06.320
Well, I do this [INAUDIBLE],
and so I don't have to do that,

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.960
or I do loving-kindness
meditation.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:12.140
And I-- it's a world.

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:13.610
There's a lot
going on out there,

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:17.840
and we should learn
evidence-based skills.

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.770
They have different techniques.

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:21.860
In TM, the beautiful
thing about this

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:24.380
is you don't have to clear
your mind of thoughts.

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:27.140
You know that idea, oh,
that kid's a hot-head,

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:28.520
and he's boiling over with rage?

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.680
So we know the mind can
be really a hot system.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:34.790
And we also know, oh, cooler
minds will prevail, cool, calm,

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:35.940
and collected.

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:37.910
And so, in this
meditation, we just

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:41.112
allow the thinking mind
to just settle down.

00:31:41.112 --> 00:31:42.320
So when Russell says he has--

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.360
I have a ton of
thoughts in meditation.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.250
It's just are they
up here, or are they

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:48.060
more on that transcendent level?

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:50.060
And so what TM
does is it provides

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:52.520
deep rest, which gets rid
of stress, and tension,

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:53.570
and anxiety.

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:56.000
But these other approaches,
they have their good cognitive

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:56.600
training.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:59.030
I don't know if I answered
your question, but OK.

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:01.940
Oh, as far as apps go,
it remains to be seen.

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.820
Headspace, Muse-- I
haven't really seen--

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:06.170
I want to see rigorous data.

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:08.180
I don't want someone
to say it does this.

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:10.370
I want to see published
peer-reviewed studies.

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:11.824
And so far, I haven't seen that.

00:32:11.824 --> 00:32:12.740
RUSSELL BRAND: No, no.

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:13.620
I think you covered it, mate.

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:14.161
BOB ROTH: OK.

00:32:14.161 --> 00:32:17.120
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.150
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:19.780
My name is Jared.

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.160
First, I commend you for
your public and policy

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.340
work on addiction.

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:25.280
I think that's fantastic.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.070
As a fellow in recovery
as well, my question

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:31.370
is, addiction as a whole,
there's this massive stigma.

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:35.360
We know that heroin death
is growing at record rates.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.530
It's the biggest it's ever been.

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:41.390
And anonymity, obviously,
is a spiritual principle

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:43.580
in most 12-step programs.

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:47.030
But I also think it can reduce--

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:50.540
or I think people being vocal
in public about their recovery

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:55.400
can also help the
stigma in public.

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.989
Where do you see
us going from here?

00:32:56.989 --> 00:32:59.155
RUSSELL BRAND: Well, I think
that's a good question.

00:32:59.155 --> 00:33:00.050
What's your name, mate?

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:00.680
AUDIENCE: My name is Jared.

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.054
RUSSELL BRAND: All right, Jerry.

00:33:02.054 --> 00:33:02.720
BOB ROTH: Jared.

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:03.690
RUSSELL BRAND: Jared.

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:04.290
I've got accent, in case you--

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:05.421
AUDIENCE: Jared with a D.

00:33:05.421 --> 00:33:06.980
RUSSELL BRAND: Thanks, man.

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:07.480
Jared.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.670
Cheers, Jared.

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:12.010
I over-did it now.

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:13.080
"Jare-duh."

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.418
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.590
Like a bullet.

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:18.151
Jared.

00:33:18.151 --> 00:33:20.150
Well, what I think, mate,
is that's a good point

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:22.984
because it is stigmatized
because, well, it's a crime.

00:33:22.984 --> 00:33:24.650
So if you take drugs,
you're a criminal.

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:27.770
And crime is really a bad thing.

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:30.140
But it's not really, is it?

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.780
I mean, if you can't cope
with your psychological state,

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:35.071
and you need to take drugs,
you're going to take drugs.

00:33:35.071 --> 00:33:37.040
You'll do what you've
got to do, aren't you?

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.230
The principles around
anonymity, for me,

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:42.950
that's not my job to decide
because those fellowships

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:46.190
to which you refer have
their traditions in place

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:48.770
because there were good
reason in the '30s when

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:51.590
those fellowships were
established to protect

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:54.520
the members from the stigma of
addiction that you speak of.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.270
And also to stop--
because a lot of people

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:57.560
have addiction
issues-- and I don't

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.101
want to blow the
lid off this thing--

00:33:59.101 --> 00:34:00.800
also are wild egomaniacs.

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:06.290
So it's good that no one
can come to the forefront

00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:10.899
and start claiming to
be Captain Addiction.

00:34:10.899 --> 00:34:12.959
But what I think is
the destigmatization

00:34:12.959 --> 00:34:14.000
does end in conversation.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.562
I mean, if you look at
various forms of civil rights

00:34:16.562 --> 00:34:19.020
and the progress that's been
made in the last half century,

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:22.639
particularly, then you can see
that bringing the conversation

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:25.440
to a public level
does alter perception.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:29.150
Now what I reckon is the answer
to your question, "Jare-duh,"

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:33.590
is that all of us are like
on the spectrum of addiction.

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:36.620
All of us have some behavior
that we would like to alter.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:38.870
All of us are reliant and
dependent, necessarily,

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:40.727
on some sort of material
thing or behavior

00:34:40.727 --> 00:34:42.560
because we're living
in a world that doesn't

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.179
nurture our spiritual needs.

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:46.721
And you know, if you're a man
like me in recovery, the reason

00:34:46.721 --> 00:34:48.095
you took drugs in
the first place

00:34:48.095 --> 00:34:49.620
was to address this
feeling of pain,

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:52.460
this feeling of worthlessness,
this feeling of loss

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:54.080
and sadness within you.

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.520
And it works, doesn't it?

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.730
Drugs works for a while--

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:56.989
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:56.989 --> 00:34:58.322
RUSSELL BRAND: --good technique.

00:34:58.322 --> 00:35:00.470
Heroin will park
pain, momentarily.

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:02.240
Some days I miss it still.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:05.420
But, ultimately, it
was a place holder

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.400
for this sense of
connection that

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.290
can only be attained--
for me, I think

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:12.110
the meditation is a component.

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:15.660
But what does it matter
if you're like, oh,

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:18.760
I'm really like a
holy, spiritual guy,

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:21.170
but your life isn't about,
on some level, altruism,

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:23.000
philanthropy, and
basic kindness?

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.620
So what I reckon, Jared, is
what we've got to do, mate,

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:29.950
is people that are
straight-up plain junkies

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:32.067
of the [INAUDIBLE]
standard variety, you

00:35:32.067 --> 00:35:34.580
and I, we have to
talk to other people

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:37.910
where it's food, sex, gambling,
whatever and just say,

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:40.309
get on board with the
whole mentality of recovery

00:35:40.309 --> 00:35:42.350
because all of us need to
be free from something.

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:43.880
All of us are
relying on something.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:47.050
All of us have some sort of 3:00
AM shame that we wake up with,

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:47.840
like, oh, god.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.180
I'm not good enough.

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.810
We live with it, and
harbor it, and try

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:53.090
to build a version of
ourselves that we can put out

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:55.190
into the world that's
manageable and livable,

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:57.290
some secret apology of ourself.

00:35:57.290 --> 00:36:00.430
So I reckon that we take
[INAUDIBLE] that everybody

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:03.560
is suffering in some way,
and we use our own recovery

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.539
as an example because
I have found myself,

00:36:05.539 --> 00:36:07.330
since getting clean
from drugs and alcohol,

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:08.090
I've had to deal with food.

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:08.810
I've had to deal with sex.

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:10.185
I've had to deal
with narcissism.

00:36:10.185 --> 00:36:12.584
I've had to deal with fame,
money, all of the false idols

00:36:12.584 --> 00:36:14.000
that I thought
that would heal me.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.180
Every single one I
[? created ?] like a prophet.

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:18.830
Yet, when the true thing came,
when the connection came,

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:21.350
when the recovery came, this
is when I become skeptical.

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:23.746
What, helping other people,
sitting still, being quiet

00:36:23.746 --> 00:36:24.620
for 20 minutes a day?

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:25.359
Fuck off.

00:36:25.359 --> 00:36:26.150
Give me some smack.

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:27.410
Give me a blow job, you know--

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:29.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:30.800
--in reverse order.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:34.580
Otherwise, it's
going to take ages.

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:47.160
But they say every man that
knocked on a brothel door

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.270
was looking for God.

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:51.770
And, you know, God as a
placeholder for connection,

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:54.410
for union, for
togetherness to transcend

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:56.450
the illusion of
our separateness,

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:58.910
to transcend the illusion
of these hierarchies,

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:01.340
to transcend the illusion
of our insignificance,

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:02.480
to transcend our pain.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.610
So I think, mate, it's just by
[? carry-on, ?] [? crack-on ?]

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:05.540
of what you're doing.

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.095
Don't be embarrassed
about being in recovery.

00:37:07.095 --> 00:37:08.010
You've done very well.

00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:09.050
How long you been doing it?

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:09.720
AUDIENCE: Seven years.

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:10.370
RUSSELL BRAND: That's
fucking amazing.

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:11.130
Well done, mate.

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:11.660
Nice work.

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.592
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:15.041 --> 00:37:17.456
BOB ROTH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:17.456 --> 00:37:19.388
CARLEY GRAHAM GARCIA: Thank you.

00:37:19.388 --> 00:37:21.320
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.390
Thank you for coming, also.

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:25.402
I have kind of a
two-part question.

00:37:25.402 --> 00:37:26.110
I know that you--

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:26.350
[? BOB ROTH: ?] Go to the mic?

00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:27.260
AUDIENCE: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:28.926
RUSSELL BRAND: It's
a two-part question.

00:37:28.926 --> 00:37:29.932
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:29.932 --> 00:37:31.390
RUSSELL BRAND:
"Godfather 1 and 2."

00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:32.575
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:32.575 --> 00:37:33.650
We're not doing 3.

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:36.380
AUDIENCE: So I know you were
talking about being skeptical,

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:39.920
and I was wondering have
you ever experienced,

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.570
either of you, a
lot of skepticism

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:45.080
in the benefits of meditation?

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:53.780
And, also, people who
turn to drugs, initially,

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:56.720
do you think that they
would be able to be deterred

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.160
from them by meditation?

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.490
BOB ROTH: You go ahead.

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:01.092
I'll start.

00:38:01.092 --> 00:38:02.300
RUSSELL BRAND: You have a go.

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:02.452
Go on.

00:38:02.452 --> 00:38:03.952
And I'll drink this
water for a bit.

00:38:03.952 --> 00:38:05.920
And then I'll step in
and say something flash.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:12.200
BOB ROTH: Addiction from a
brain chemistry standpoint

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.989
and from brain functioning,
when you have an experience over

00:38:14.989 --> 00:38:17.030
and over again, so you're
looking for something--

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:19.660
you're anxious, or stressed,
or lonely, or whatever.

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:25.580
So then you have the experience
of heroin or anything.

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:28.050
It activates the pleasure
centers in the brain.

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:30.190
One of them is a
nucleus accumbens.

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:32.360
But it also, you
could say, distorts

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.225
or traumatizes the
way the neurons,

00:38:34.225 --> 00:38:35.600
the way the brain
is functioning.

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.400
But then you go down that cycle.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:41.160
Oh, I'm unhappy, so I need to
keep having that experience.

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:45.410
One of the problems with a
type of program for addiction

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:47.850
is if you just tell a person
they can't take the drug

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:50.570
but don't change the
brain functioning,

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:52.580
the circuits, then
they're always

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:56.199
going to-- the moment they're
off that one month recovery

00:38:56.199 --> 00:38:58.490
program, whatever, they're
just going to go back to it,

00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:00.770
or they're going to sublimate
it to something else.

00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:02.570
The wonderful thing about--

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:05.390
at least, I know because
we work with addicts--

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:07.430
is when you transcend,
when your mind

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:11.150
settles down to that state of
inner calm, there's a change.

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:15.440
The alpha one brainwave, the
whole brain resets itself.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.940
All the different
parts of the brain

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:19.010
begin to communicate
with each other.

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:20.810
And they say in meditation the--

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:22.880
is this too-- anyways,
I won't say it.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:26.720
The neurons that fire
together during meditation

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:30.210
in a healthy way wire
together out of meditation.

00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:33.290
So you have a healthier, more
integrated, more connected

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:34.470
experience.

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:37.610
And so it does help
override those impulses,

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:38.780
but it's not overnight.

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:42.710
And Russell says, and I
agree, it's not the only way.

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:45.060
But I think it's an
important component.

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:47.670
So, yes, it can change
and transform the way--

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:50.990
and by just reducing anxiety
and increasing something

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:54.900
called serotonin, which is the
happiness neurotransmitter.

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:56.990
And when we're
depressed, then we

00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:59.270
have low levels of serotonin.

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:01.730
It increases serotonin
in that experience.

00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:03.040
Now you make it better.

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:03.880
RUSSELL BRAND: No,
that was brilliant.

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:04.922
Don't be so silly.

00:40:04.922 --> 00:40:08.180
BOB ROTH: [LAUGHS]
Don't be so silly.

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:10.460
RUSSELL BRAND: Well,
I am a drug addict,

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:14.050
and I'm not taking drugs
for ages now, 14 years.

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:16.520
Not that it's a
competition "Jare-duh."

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:17.940
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:21.516
I'm not saying I'm literally
twice as good as you

00:40:21.516 --> 00:40:25.047
at not taking drugs in a
not taking drugs contest.

00:40:25.047 --> 00:40:26.130
Who's going to watch that?

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:31.850
It definitely works, mate.

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:34.550
Bob's right about you've
got to change your brain,

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:36.540
and you've got to
change your behavior.

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:40.390
But when you think about it,
when you first get clean,

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:42.765
meditation, at that point,
[? you're not ?] fucking hell.

00:40:42.765 --> 00:40:46.140
It's just enough to not
be taking drugs, frankly.

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:48.807
So what was the part
two of the question?

00:40:48.807 --> 00:40:50.390
I want to make sure
that we've covered

00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:51.931
every single thing
you've ever wanted

00:40:51.931 --> 00:40:52.973
to know about everything.

00:40:52.973 --> 00:40:55.264
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was just
asking you about skepticism,

00:40:55.264 --> 00:40:56.026
also.

00:40:56.026 --> 00:40:57.150
Like, have you ever faced--

00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:59.240
RUSSELL BRAND: People
will be skeptical, always.

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:01.520
This is an inevitability.

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:03.380
Skepticism is a good thing.

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:04.480
People should have doubt.

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.700
It will stop people being
beleaguered and tricked

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:10.880
by the good many people that
want to beleaguer, and trick

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:14.840
us, and keep us stupid, and to
keep us as passive consumers,

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:17.312
skepticism is a very,
very good thing.

00:41:17.312 --> 00:41:19.520
But you shouldn't be skeptical
about your own ability

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.360
to change yourself.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:21.980
You shouldn't be skeptical
about your own ability

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:23.150
to fulfill yourself.

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:24.560
You have this ability.

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:26.030
So, yes, we face skepticism.

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:29.030
I face my own skepticism
is the biggest challenge.

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:31.520
But, luckily,
because like Jared,

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.300
I have support of other people.

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.800
So when I'm feeling
crazy, and weak,

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.008
and vulnerable--what happens
most days-- they go, ah,

00:41:37.008 --> 00:41:37.760
you're all right.

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:38.690
Don't worry too much.

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:40.560
You're taking life
too seriously.

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:42.515
So it's a good component.

00:41:42.515 --> 00:41:43.980
The skepticism is OK.

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:45.080
I say give it a try.

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:48.200
BOB ROTH: I would just add
that the nice thing about this

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.620
is I encourage it.

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:51.690
Be 100% skeptical.

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:53.450
It's not based on belief.

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:57.939
You can be skeptical about
gravity and the ball drops.

00:41:57.939 --> 00:41:59.480
You can be a believer
in electricity.

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:02.660
It doesn't make a 100-watt
bulb a 120-watt bulb.

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:05.600
So if it's real,
and it's natural,

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:09.110
then it doesn't require
any philosophical construct

00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:10.752
or belief system.

00:42:10.752 --> 00:42:12.710
At least, this meditation
doesn't require that.

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:13.672
So skeptical is great.

00:42:13.672 --> 00:42:15.130
CARLEY GRAHAM
GARCIA: That's great.

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:16.870
We have time for
two more questions.

00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:19.078
RUSSELL BRAND: How do you
know how long they'll take?

00:42:19.078 --> 00:42:19.978
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:20.882 --> 00:42:24.727
CARLEY GRAHAM GARCIA:
It could be just one.

00:42:24.727 --> 00:42:26.050
BOB ROTH: Up to two questions.

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:26.560
AUDIENCE: I'll try to be--

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.090
RUSSELL BRAND: For some people
are going to work, aren't they?

00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:29.080
You see them go.

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:30.370
Sorry to interrupt you, sorry.

00:42:30.370 --> 00:42:31.120
AUDIENCE: It's OK.

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:32.164
I think Bob's used to it.

00:42:32.164 --> 00:42:33.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.020
Hi, my name is Fizz.

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:38.305
For Russell's enunciation,
that's F-I-Z-Z.

00:42:38.305 --> 00:42:39.930
RUSSELL BRAND: Salty
bastard, isn't he?

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:41.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:43.241
Is he like this
at work every day?

00:42:43.241 --> 00:42:43.740
Fizz?

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:45.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:47.640
AUDIENCE: Well, we talked a
little bit about the proof

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:50.460
behind the pudding,
right, so it seems

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:52.500
that two of the
biggest ways are, one,

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:55.710
with incredible case
studies, such as Russell,

00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:58.590
and, also, the science
behind the neurology.

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:00.270
So I'm hoping you
could kind of expand

00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:04.320
a bit more about the
impact it has on the brain.

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:08.070
Until recently,
most neurologists

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:11.730
assumed that, at puberty,
our brains stop developing.

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:14.850
But research shows now
that our brains continue

00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:18.090
to develop structurally,
functionally, and also

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:21.720
chemically kind of long-term
impacts of meditation.

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:24.350
And also, given all the
proven recent studies,

00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:27.180
curious to hear about,
at the individual level

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:29.640
and the society level,
what's holding us back

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:33.630
from really adopting
meditation as a whole,

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:35.577
not only for addicts
but for everyone?

00:43:35.577 --> 00:43:37.410
BOB ROTH: I'm going to
talk about the brain,

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:38.660
and then I'm going to
let you talk about the--

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:39.420
OK.

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:43.710
So they used to say, oh, we use
10% of our mental potential.

00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:45.760
That's not true.

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.390
And they say, well,
meditation awakens--

00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:49.170
you can.

00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:51.570
Anywhere you put your
attention, like if you

00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:57.570
play violin for 30 years,
this part of your fingers

00:43:57.570 --> 00:44:00.210
and that part of your brain,
you're developing gray matter.

00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:02.010
You're developing connections.

00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:06.060
But more important
is the communication,

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:07.570
different parts of the brain.

00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:08.987
So you have the
prefrontal cortex.

00:44:08.987 --> 00:44:09.986
That's the frontal lobe.

00:44:09.986 --> 00:44:11.197
That's the CEO of your brain.

00:44:11.197 --> 00:44:12.780
And that's like the
size of your fist.

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:16.830
And that is judgment, planning,
decision-making, sense

00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:20.430
of self, actual,
ethical reasoning,

00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:23.329
problem-solving,
innovative thinking, here.

00:44:23.329 --> 00:44:24.870
Then you have another
key part, which

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:27.270
is the amygdala, which
is the fear center.

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:29.490
And that's fight or
flight or freeze.

00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:35.370
Now what happens is stress,
fatigue, drugs, alcohol

00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:37.350
takes the frontal lobes offline.

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:38.590
Just what it does.

00:44:38.590 --> 00:44:41.610
A person can't drink
and drive because that

00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:44.280
takes this offline, and
it impairs judgment.

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:49.690
And what gets activated, or
aroused, is the amygdala.

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:51.540
So what happens
during, at least I

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:53.850
know TM, is when the
mind settles down,

00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:56.190
you can see the connections,
the communication

00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:57.930
between the front of the brain.

00:44:57.930 --> 00:45:00.630
Actually, there's 14 different
sections of the frontal lobes.

00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:02.899
All these connections
here and connections

00:45:02.899 --> 00:45:05.190
from the front of the brain,
and the back of the brain,

00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:06.720
and the left and
right hemisphere,

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:08.220
all the different
parts of the brain

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:10.680
begin to communicate in
meditation and because

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:13.470
of neuroplasticity,
out of meditation.

00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:19.680
And so that's why we offer
this meditation in schools

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:24.390
all over the world, particularly
under-served schools for free.

00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:27.450
You see these kids,
their grades go up.

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:28.920
They graduate.

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:31.530
But, more importantly,
they're happier.

00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:32.670
They're happier.

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:36.270
So I think that what
you're seeing is--

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:39.420
I think that cutting edge
research on all meditations

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:41.221
is what's going on in the brain.

00:45:41.221 --> 00:45:43.470
And, again, it's not some
miraculous part of the brain

00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:44.692
that we've never used before.

00:45:44.692 --> 00:45:45.900
It's all about communication.

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:48.720
Stress, fatigue rips
those connections apart.

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:51.170
Transcending puts
them back together.

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:53.204
And now why is it
taking so long?

00:45:53.204 --> 00:45:54.870
RUSSELL BRAND: I think
you've covered it

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:56.180
because look at these two men.

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:57.720
They have questions.

00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:58.830
BOB ROTH: OK.

00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:00.990
They say in science--
they say in science,

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:04.380
science progresses
one funeral at a time.

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:06.840
And I think what you're
seeing is an old system.

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:10.200
Like when I was teaching
meditation 40 years ago,

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.760
the word "meditation" was, wow.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:12.550
No, thank you.

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:15.280
And now younger generation
is, oh, I'd like to try that,

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:16.780
or I tried it, and
I couldn't do it.

00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:18.000
So it's just time.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.469
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:20.469 --> 00:46:21.010
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:23.840
Thanks for coming.

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:24.790
I'm a parent.

00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:26.030
Carley's a parent.

00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:28.210
You're a new parent.

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:31.450
How does TM help you
with being a good parent?

00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:35.580
RUSSELL BRAND: Probably makes me
more patient and more present.

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:40.090
So those things, but it helps
in all areas of my life.

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:43.000
Your t-shirt says you
still miss James Baldwin.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:43.500
Yeah.

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:44.570
It's a shame, isn't it?

00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:46.840
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.665
I think it helps
with everything.

00:46:48.665 --> 00:46:50.040
I think it helps
with everything.

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:55.540
It makes me feel more connected
to her and more present.

00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:59.110
It's sort of true of
everything in my life, really.

00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:01.480
I suppose making the decision
that you are twice a day

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:03.160
going to put aside
20 minutes to do

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:07.997
something that's not stimulating
in that kind of way--

00:47:07.997 --> 00:47:10.330
[? you know, it's not-- ?]
just physically stimulating--

00:47:10.330 --> 00:47:12.830
I think it's a good decision
to make as a parent,

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:13.529
as a non-parent.

00:47:13.529 --> 00:47:15.070
Don't wait until
you've got children.

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:17.195
You better get fucking
relaxed before they turn up.

00:47:17.195 --> 00:47:18.201
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:18.201 --> 00:47:20.520
That's my experience.

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:21.545
AUDIENCE: Good point.

00:47:21.545 --> 00:47:23.170
BOB ROTH: Some little
kid, his father--

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:24.670
I'm teaching a father and son.

00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:26.650
And the father was
saying, I can't meditate.

00:47:26.650 --> 00:47:30.670
And the little kid, 12
years old, he said, Dad,

00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:33.550
there's 1,440 minutes in a day.

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:36.530
You don't got 40
minutes for yourself?

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:37.037
So--

00:47:37.037 --> 00:47:38.120
RUSSELL BRAND: Get to bed.

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:39.340
BOB ROTH: Yeah.

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:39.840
First--

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:42.679
RUSSELL BRAND: For 590
minutes, you little bastard.

00:47:42.679 --> 00:47:44.220
BOB ROTH: First
thing in the morning,

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:45.678
you just get up 20
minutes earlier.

00:47:45.678 --> 00:47:48.400
The afternoon, people just
prioritize it as best they can.

00:47:51.689 --> 00:47:52.230
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:53.530
Thank you for being here.

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:54.840
RUSSELL BRAND:
Congratulations on your beard.

00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:56.256
AUDIENCE: Oh, thank
you very much.

00:47:56.256 --> 00:47:56.797
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:56.797 --> 00:47:59.130
This is something that's very
near and dear to my heart.

00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:01.619
I'm expecting two children
actually next month.

00:48:01.619 --> 00:48:02.744
RUSSELL BRAND: Bloody hell.

00:48:02.744 --> 00:48:02.990
Well done.

00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:03.990
AUDIENCE: Been clean for six--

00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.996
RUSSELL BRAND:
Same woman, I hope.

00:48:04.996 --> 00:48:05.954
AUDIENCE: --six months.

00:48:05.954 --> 00:48:08.310
One lady, two kids, yeah.

00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:10.535
RUSSELL BRAND: Bad ass.

00:48:10.535 --> 00:48:11.160
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.076
And when they arrive--

00:48:12.076 --> 00:48:15.510
I mean, they're
already this much,

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:18.720
so we're not doing the whole
from beginning to this.

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.300
We're here.

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:22.929
But when they
arrive, mental health

00:48:22.929 --> 00:48:24.220
is a very important part of it.

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:26.520
And it's not a very important
thing in this country.

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.384
And Google makes a
really safe space.

00:48:28.384 --> 00:48:29.550
Obviously you guys are here.

00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:30.591
We're talking about this.

00:48:30.591 --> 00:48:33.330
This is a great thing, but the
outside world is not like that.

00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:36.270
So I'm just wondering
what your guys'

00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:43.350
take is on the socioeconomic
access to this kind of thing.

00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:46.470
Not every place is Google,
and my concern is not them--

00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:49.314
because I'm confident
in myself, and my wife,

00:48:49.314 --> 00:48:50.730
and our ability
to bring them up--

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:52.500
but everybody else around them.

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:55.650
So, obviously, pushing
this stuff out to the world

00:48:55.650 --> 00:48:57.810
is very important
to all of us here.

00:48:57.810 --> 00:49:00.570
I just want to know what
your take is on access to it

00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:02.310
at the top of the
thing you mentioned,

00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:04.320
the president, which
this country's not very

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.390
good at that kind of thing.

00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:08.170
I don't know how
it is in London,

00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:10.210
but I imagine probably
slightly better.

00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:13.260
But just your take really
quick on access to it

00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:14.935
from a socioeconomic
perspective.

00:49:14.935 --> 00:49:16.560
RUSSELL BRAND: I
understand, my friend.

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:19.620
We talk a lot about
extremism and fundamentalism

00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:24.130
with regard to people that
are in smaller groups.

00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:25.680
Oh, they're extremists.

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:28.410
These people are
fundamentalists.

00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:30.540
But we are living in a
fundamentalist and extremist

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:31.670
system.

00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:33.530
The economic system
that we live in

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:38.950
is, it's extreme to prioritize
profit above all else.

00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:43.560
The reason that I feel extremely
optimistic is because all of us

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:47.520
here are potential units
and cells of transformation

00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:48.600
and change.

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:51.630
Now, admittedly, if you're
in an economically-deprived

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:54.300
situation, whilst the David
Lynch Foundation does make

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:55.190
incredible efforts--

00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:57.481
going to inner-city schools
is one of their priorities,

00:49:57.481 --> 00:49:58.160
in fact--

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.750
but there is a limit
to the efficacy

00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:02.430
of philanthropy and altruism.

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:04.020
At some point, there
does need to be

00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:07.350
state-level, global-level
change, which

00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:09.170
requires a paradigm
shift in the way we

00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:12.940
regard economics and the
redistribution of resources.

00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:13.867
That has to happen.

00:50:13.867 --> 00:50:14.700
You understand this.

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:16.290
This is embedded
in your question.

00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:18.660
But the positivity comes
from the fact that all of us

00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:19.261
are here now.

00:50:19.261 --> 00:50:20.760
Each one of us has
the ability to be

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:22.560
effective in our own lives.

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:23.860
Love spreads.

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:25.290
It emanates.

00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:29.220
And I think that if
we learn to meditate,

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:31.680
if we learn to live in
a different way, then

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:36.056
we become sort of vibrant,
potent emanaters of positivity.

00:50:36.056 --> 00:50:37.680
We don't have to go
all giddy and stuff

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.750
and putting flowers in our hair
and getting all [? daft. ?]

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:42.083
I think we could have a fight
on our hands any day soon.

00:50:42.083 --> 00:50:45.300
But it's important to
allow love into your life.

00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:46.470
Don't feel afraid of that.

00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:50.010
Transformation and change can
happen very, very quickly.

00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:53.670
Dear old Bob just said like
science evolves or wherever one

00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:54.540
funeral at a time.

00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:56.165
No one in this room
is going to be here

00:50:56.165 --> 00:50:58.470
in 100 years, but the
ideas that we have,

00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:00.050
these can change the world.

00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:01.200
They can live on.

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.340
So I think, yes,
have skepticism.

00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:05.250
Also, allow optimism
and positivity

00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:07.620
into your heart in the most
basic and fundamental ways,

00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:08.730
the way that you
treat one another

00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:10.200
while you're in
this environment.

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:12.060
To express your gratitude
to work in a place

00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:15.242
where people make room for
meditation, where evidently,

00:51:15.242 --> 00:51:16.950
whilst this is still
an organization that

00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:19.574
has to make a profit and one of
the most powerful organizations

00:51:19.574 --> 00:51:21.180
in the world,
evidently, clearly there

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:23.520
is an intention to
spread some benevolence,

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:24.690
to spread some care.

00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:26.490
And you are powerful.

00:51:26.490 --> 00:51:27.630
You are the workforce.

00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:28.740
People listen.

00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:30.780
One of the great
misunderstandings of our time

00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:32.642
is that societies
function this way,

00:51:32.642 --> 00:51:34.350
that the people at
the top of the pyramid

00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:35.808
are the people that
have the power.

00:51:35.808 --> 00:51:36.870
But this is not true.

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:38.070
This is an illusion.

00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:39.360
Power is here.

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:40.529
Power is on this level.

00:51:40.529 --> 00:51:42.570
If, at any point, you
decide, hey, fuck this guy,

00:51:42.570 --> 00:51:45.920
let's rush the stage and kill
him, what am I going to do?

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:47.490
Joke my way out of it?

00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:50.640
I'm going to fucking negotiate.

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:52.080
This is perennial.

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:53.820
This exists for all time.

00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:55.324
The world is there
to be changed.

00:51:55.324 --> 00:51:56.490
Thank you for your question.

00:51:56.490 --> 00:51:57.180
Thank you for your time.

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:58.680
CARLEY GRAHAM GARCIA: It's
a good moment to end on.

00:51:58.680 --> 00:51:59.280
Thank you.

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:02.630
[APPLAUSE]
