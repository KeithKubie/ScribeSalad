we go ahead and take a look at the

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270
we go ahead and take a look at the
 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.960
we go ahead and take a look at the
actual code when Josh first run the

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970
actual code when Josh first run the
 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.659
actual code when Josh first run the
program earlier it was just a list

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669
program earlier it was just a list
 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.060

simple get request to this URL you can
 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.830
simple get request to this URL you can
see below it's it's as simple as it

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840
see below it's it's as simple as it
 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.120
see below it's it's as simple as it
looks it is a get request we don't need

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130
looks it is a get request we don't need
 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.060
looks it is a get request we don't need
any parameters we just take the JSON

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070
any parameters we just take the JSON
 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.350
any parameters we just take the JSON

response it comes back from the server
 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.430
response it comes back from the server
and we log it straight to the output

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440
and we log it straight to the output
 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.900

we're about to start uploading once we

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260
we're about to start uploading once we
 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.170
we're about to start uploading once we
push this to the server we get back an

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180
push this to the server we get back an
 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.150
push this to the server we get back an
ID which corresponds to the table that

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160
ID which corresponds to the table that
 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.830
ID which corresponds to the table that
we're going to use to upload content

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840
we're going to use to upload content

we're going to use to upload content
each other when we do each of the

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760
each other when we do each of the
 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.760
each other when we do each of the
shapefiles and also when we go to poll

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770
shapefiles and also when we go to poll
 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.350
shapefiles and also when we go to poll
the server later

the server later
 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.700
the server later
so then we go straight into the file

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710
so then we go straight into the file
 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.940
so then we go straight into the file
suffixes and upload them straight to the

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950
suffixes and upload them straight to the
 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.650
suffixes and upload them straight to the
the endpoint we use before just with a

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660
the endpoint we use before just with a
 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.830
the endpoint we use before just with a
slash files on the end and push the

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840
slash files on the end and push the
 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.330
slash files on the end and push the
service straight up to the push shows

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340
service straight up to the push shows
 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.700

that's done we use the idea we got back
 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.300
that's done we use the idea we got back
from the original request to do a to

pretty straightforward just to summarize

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390
pretty straightforward just to summarize
 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:16.970
pretty straightforward just to summarize
it we're going to go ahead and go

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:16.980
it we're going to go ahead and go

like magic in the Python samples for you
but we end up with an authorized HTTP

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250
but we end up with an authorized HTTP
 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.240
but we end up with an authorized HTTP
request and then we go ahead and post a

sort of skeleton asset which says these

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340
sort of skeleton asset which says these
 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.440
sort of skeleton asset which says these
are the files we're going to be putting

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.450
are the files we're going to be putting
 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.600
are the files we're going to be putting
in these are the different tags

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610
in these are the different tags
 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.670
in these are the different tags
description and name of the project and

description and name of the project and
 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.640
description and name of the project and
once we post that we get back an ID we

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650
once we post that we get back an ID we
 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.220
once we post that we get back an ID we
use that ID to go ahead and push the

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:40.230
use that ID to go ahead and push the
 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.290
use that ID to go ahead and push the

and the cool thing is this works very

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:44.700
and the cool thing is this works very
 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.670
and the cool thing is this works very
similarly for images so for example if

similarly for images so for example if
you're uploading a geo-referenced image

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:49.640
you're uploading a geo-referenced image
 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.120
you're uploading a geo-referenced image
you can have that PNG for example in the

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.130
you can have that PNG for example in the
 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.190
you can have that PNG for example in the
sidecar file that has the world extent

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:55.200
sidecar file that has the world extent
 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.200

ended the exact same pattern a couple

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:57.210
ended the exact same pattern a couple
 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.310
ended the exact same pattern a couple
other details like you might be

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:58.320
other details like you might be
 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.560

including some additional things like
that date on the image but generally the

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720
that date on the image but generally the
 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.750
that date on the image but generally the
same pattern and then in addition we

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:05.760
same pattern and then in addition we
 

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.030
same pattern and then in addition we
have a create endpoint so you can create

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:08.040
have a create endpoint so you can create
 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.810
have a create endpoint so you can create
an empty vector table without having to

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:11.820
an empty vector table without having to
 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.150
an empty vector table without having to
have an existing shape file or a CSV or

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160
have an existing shape file or a CSV or
 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.430
have an existing shape file or a CSV or
KML or anything like that and then just

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440
KML or anything like that and then just
 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.350
KML or anything like that and then just
