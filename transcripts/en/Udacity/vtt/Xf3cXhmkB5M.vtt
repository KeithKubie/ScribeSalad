00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[D. Evans] We're going to have many quizzes throughout each unit.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The point of a quiz is to check that you understand what we've covered.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Some of the quizzes will be fairly straightforward

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
just to see if you've followed what we said.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Other quizzes will be more challenging

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and require you to put together several ideas that we've covered.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The quizzes don't count towards your grade.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You'll be able to try them as many times as you want until you hopefully get the answer right.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It certainly will be valuable to try to get the answer right the first time.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But they shouldn't be stressful.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
They're meant to keep you engaged in the lecture, make sure you're understanding things.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
After each quiz there will be an explanation of the answer

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that will often go in more depth than just answering the quiz correctly.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So for the first quiz and to get started practicing doing quizzes,

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:46.000
our question is: "What is the goal of Unit 1?"

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.815
There are 4 choices.

00:00:47.815 --> 00:00:50.677
You can check all the choices that you think are good answers.

00:00:50.677 --> 00:00:53.631
So the goal is to get started programming,

00:00:53.631 --> 00:00:57.769
the second choice is to learn some important computer science concepts,

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.538
the third choice is to write some code that extracts a link from a web page,

00:01:02.538 --> 00:01:07.754
and the fourth choice is to write code to rank web pages.

00:01:07.754 --> 00:01:10.000
So that's the first quiz.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.446
Check as many answers as you think are correct.
