[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.432 --> 00:00:05.390
CLIFF REDEKER: Good
afternoon, and to the folks

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.900
who are joining us on
our internal live stream,

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.660
also welcome.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.380
We're very keen on having
members of the San Francisco

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.290
Opera here with us today.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.670
They'll be discussing their
world premiere of "Two Women."

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.220
To kick things off, we do
have Kip Cranna, the dramaturg

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.200
of the San Francisco Opera.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.282
And he'll be leading this
moderated discussion.

00:00:23.282 --> 00:00:25.240
So, please join me in
welcoming them to Google.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.740
Thank you.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.889
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:29.889 --> 00:00:32.320
KIP CRANNA: Thank you, Cliff,
and thanks to Google for

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.850
inviting us.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.150
We're thrilled to be
down here to tell you

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.850
about this exciting
opera, "La Ciociara."

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.500
Let me introduce the
people who are involved

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.910
so centrally in creating it.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.710
And I'll just go
down the row here.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.350
Next to me is the
script writer, which

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.240
is sort of an unusual
thing for an opera to have.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.110
And we'll talk about that.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.380
He is an Italian author, and has
had a career as a journalist,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.260
and is now a screenplay
writer, scriptwriter,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.530
for Italian cinema and TV.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.600
Luca Rossi.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.090
Thank you, Luca, for being here.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.947
LUCA ROSSI: Hello.

00:01:03.947 --> 00:01:04.921
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:06.680
KIP CRANNA: And next
to him, of course,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.970
is the important figure
of all in putting

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.200
on a new opera, our
composer, who has

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.040
composed more than 16 operas.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.040
He's one of Italy's most
preeminent composers

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.010
of the day.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.200
And we're so thrilled
to be working with him.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.005
Marco Tutino.

00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:24.569
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:26.860
KIP CRANNA: And in the middle,
the guy whose fault this

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.359
all is.

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:30.780
It's his idea to do an Italian
opera, and we're doing one.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.390
He's our Music Director
at San Francisco Opera,

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.510
and the conductor of this opera.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.180
And we're so
thrilled that he has

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.210
gotten us to do this project.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.554
It's been a great challenge
for a San Francisco opera.

00:01:42.554 --> 00:01:43.220
Nicola Luisotti.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.855
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:47.855 --> 00:01:50.060
KIP CRANNA: And then we
have one of the two women

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.530
that this opera is about.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.720
She sings the role of
Rosetta, the young girl who

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.840
goes out into the countryside
with her mother during World

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.580
War II, and faces all kinds
of trials and tribulations.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.680
She had a wonderful debut
with us on Saturday night.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.290
Sarah Shafer.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.241
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:09.241 --> 00:02:10.865
KIP CRANNA: And then
we have the tenor,

00:02:10.865 --> 00:02:12.630
who, of course, is the hero.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.320
The hero is always a tenor in
Italian operas-- almost always.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.120
And he had a great
success singing

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.270
the role of Michele, who
is our idealistic hero

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.660
in this story who,
unfortunately, meets a sad end.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.100
But then again, it's
opera, so what can you do?

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.610
He's the Greek-American
tenor Dimitri Pittas.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:32.884
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:32.884 --> 00:02:34.800
KIP CRANNA: And, Nicola,
let's start with you,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.200
because this whole
idea started with you.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.830
Where did the idea
come from to commission

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.512
an Italian opera
from Marco Tutino?

00:02:42.512 --> 00:02:44.470
NICOLA LUISOTTI: I think
that the San Francisco

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.010
Opera has Italian roots
with Gaetano Merola, that

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.346
was music director of this
company in [INAUDIBLE], right?

00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:54.970
KIP CRANNA: Yes, he
founded the company

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.605
in the late '20s--
early '20s, rather.

00:02:57.605 --> 00:03:01.560
NICOLA LUISOTTI: And I
think that an Italian opera

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.100
with an Italian music director
needs a new Italian opera to be

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.040
performed for the first time.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.750
If we go in the past, in the
United States, the last opera

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.620
that was performed in the United
States for the first time,

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.010
was Il Trittico by Giacomo
Puccini, it was 1918.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.180
After 97 years, finally we
have another Italian opera

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.800
with a great composer, with
an Italian great composer

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.440
that is Marco Tutino.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.790
I'm very honored to have done
this opera for first time here,

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.190
for the history of Italy,
but for the history also--

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.200
the mutual history of
the United States .

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.625
KIP CRANNA: Now, had you
worked with Marco before this?

00:03:41.625 --> 00:03:44.840
NICOLA LUISOTTI: I work
in for some things,

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.320
and I have conducted in
Napa Valley in 2007 music

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.090
from a ballet from Richard III.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.320
It was pretty beautiful
music, and if we can still

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:02.090
use this word, it
was beautiful music.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.040
I'm proud to say that,
because in the past decades,

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.030
we used to shock people
instead to do delight them.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.680
So, I think that
with La Ciociara,

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.089
we delighted all
the audience also,

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.829
even if this is a great drama.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.310
But inside of this music,
there are beautiful lines

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.480
that people will
remember for their life.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.482
And this will save Marco
Tutino and his own music.

00:04:29.482 --> 00:04:31.200
KIP CRANNA: Marco,
what did you think

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.080
when you were asked to write an
opera for an American company?

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.030
Was this the first
time you had done that?

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.990
MARCO TUTINO: Yes, an
opera, yes, the first time.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.980
Well, I don't know if I am a
great composer as Nicola told--

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.540
NICOLA LUISOTTI: You are.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.820
MARCO TUTINO: I think that we
have to wait at least 100 years

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.970
to know exactly.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.980
But this is right for
all the kind of arts.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.545
We have a lot of rush to
decide oh, yes, no, yes, no.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:19.040
I thought to my job in
a very concrete way.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:25.250
Because I think that-- solid
way, because the opera composer

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:33.830
is a specialized
composer, who has

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.340
to face a lot of
dramaturgical problems.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:45.690
And you must do as
well as you know.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:53.490
And I think that I
accepted this job

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.770
with the knowledge
of the difficulties,

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.060
and the knowledge
of a new public.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:08.140
But I was very, very confident
about the professionalilty

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.970
of this theater.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:15.870
And the show was
absolutely perfect.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.940
All of the theater
worked so hard.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:28.910
And of course, I based
my hope in Nicola.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:38.975
Because I knew which kind
of conductor he actually is.

00:06:38.975 --> 00:06:42.300
KIP CRANNA: We should talk about
this choice of subject matter.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:48.870
Where did that idea come from,
to use La Ciociara, the novel,

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.606
as a source for your opera?

00:06:51.606 --> 00:06:55.770
NICOLA LUISOTTI: La
Ciociara because a night

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.540
at a dinner with Marco
and [INAUDIBLE], he's

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.710
a friend of ours, and is a great
actor and a great director.

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:05.410
We were talking about how
will be possible to renew

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:06.120
the repertoire.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.890
You know, the problem
with the opera today

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:13.000
is that the repertoire is stuck.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.860
When we finished with
Puccini, La Turandot in 1926,

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.520
then something happened.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:28.100
Curiosities-- the
new composers since

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.950
didn't find the
right way to proceed

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:38.970
from the roots of their fathers,
composers like Wagner, Strauss,

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:45.110
Mozart, Verdi, Donizetti,
Bellini, Weber, or whatever.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:49.550
At some point we have-- after
the second school of Vienna,

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:56.310
that is Schoenberg,
Berg, and Webern,

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:00.970
they did fantastic things
in the middle of two wars.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.160
The first global war,
the second global war.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.334
Since then, something happened.

00:08:05.334 --> 00:08:06.000
What's happened?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.870
The people think
that the catastrophe

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.340
was close to happen.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.890
The world, for sure, after
the second world war,

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:20.170
were going to finish in
an atomic nuclear war,

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.260
were close to come.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:26.380
In the '60s, we really
were scared about this.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:31.680
And all the music was talking
to us about catastrophes.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.409
Every year, this
is going to happen.

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:34.409
This is going to happen.

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:37.159
And nothing happened like that.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:40.309
But still, we believe
in these kind of music

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:42.584
that the world is destroyed.

00:08:42.584 --> 00:08:44.470
It is not.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:46.020
There are many
problems in the world,

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:50.720
but there's also people
that believe in the future--

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.630
throughout the past,
throughout the present,

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:55.320
throughout the future.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.900
And at some point, we
have to change our line.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:03.920
Because we are losing an
important presence in theater.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.300
Who pay the tickets?

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.410
It's very simple.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:12.740
Critics, they don't pay
tickets, for example.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.520
They receive credits.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.460
It's true.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.990
So, the audience
pay the tickets.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:25.670
And why they have to pay $300
to listen to something that they

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:26.990
will never understand.

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.310
Why?

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:31.929
I would like not to
pay something, so

00:09:31.929 --> 00:09:34.220
many moneys for something
that I will never understand.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.180
I would prefer to
go to the movie.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.000
I will go to the musical.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.990
If you take a look, for
example, in New York.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.930
Metropolitan Opera House is
struggling to sell tickets.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.710
Struggling.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:52.170
But there are more than
30 theaters of musicals.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:54.700
More than 30, every
night full of people.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:55.700
KIP CRANNA: On Broadway.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.680
NICOLA LUISOTTI: We have to
speak with ourself about that.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.330
So, La Ciociara-- I'm coming.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.154
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:04.154 --> 00:10:09.260
NICOLA LUISOTTI: La Ciociara
is done because we want back

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:10.900
the audience.

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.010
It's wrong?

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:13.380
I don't know.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:17.040
But we try to-- I mean,
Marco Tutino tried

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:22.670
to compose something that was
beautiful for the history,

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.750
for the people, for
the musicians to play,

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:29.300
for me to conduct,
for-- I mean he

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.530
has written an opera in
an Italian tradition.

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:35.180
I don't think this is a mistake.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:39.045
But this is challenge
to this today.

00:10:39.045 --> 00:10:42.850
KIP CRANNA: Well, this brings
us to the story itself,

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:46.330
La Ciociara, a novel by Alberto
Moravia; published, I believe,

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.150
in 1957.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.035
Made, of course, into
the famous film in 1960,

00:10:51.035 --> 00:10:54.440
directed by Vittorio De
Sica, starring Sophia Loren,

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.590
who won the Academy Award.

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:59.130
First time that award
had gone to an actor

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:01.250
in a non-English speaking role.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:02.560
Very exciting.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.660
Luca, tell us your story
about getting the rights

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:09.212
to this novel, which
was not an easy thing.

00:11:09.212 --> 00:11:11.760
LUCA ROSSI: Well,
that was just--

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.410
the beginning of
the story was nice,

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:18.400
because we were with Marco
in a small trattoria in Rome.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:23.050
And he had Nicola and
his idea of La Ciociara.

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:27.580
And there was the
problem of the rights,

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:31.740
because they belonged
to the family, the two

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.172
women, actually, the
two widows of Moravia.

00:11:35.172 --> 00:11:36.630
KIP CRANNA: Moravia
has two widows.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:37.629
Both within [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:37.629 --> 00:11:40.790
LUCA ROSSI: And we just saw
one of these two widows, Carmen

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:46.600
Llera, getting in a house,
in a door of a palace there.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:51.470
And so we thought, why don't we
leave a letter to the doorman?

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.140
And we start the thing.

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.530
And the real story
started from there.

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:58.010
Then we had a lot of troubles
with the second widow,

00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:59.770
but that's not so important.

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:00.270
But--

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:01.155
KIP CRANNA: She
agreed eventually,

00:12:01.155 --> 00:12:01.815
that's what's important.

00:12:01.815 --> 00:12:03.110
LUCA ROSSI: In the end, yes.

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:09.120
But what I would like to say
is that, it was very important.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.880
Marco's music is
a narrative music.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.350
It has a narration in it.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:21.570
We know what
contemporary music did.

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:24.660
They deconstructed
the structure.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.370
Marco has a structure
but to have that,

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:30.210
you have also to
have a narrative

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:31.960
structure inside the opera.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.490
So La Ciociara is a wonderful
book, a wonderful movie.

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:39.110
But it lacks a
lot of, let's say,

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:43.550
twists, a lot of
important moments.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:45.940
And it lacks a real love story.

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:50.770
It lacks the usual
things that you'd

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:54.090
find in movies, in
fiction, and so forth.

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:56.930
So that was my role,
Marco asking me,

00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:01.080
since that's what-- I'm a
writer and a screenwriter.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:05.680
So I know, in some way, the
twists, how to build a story.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.830
So we had to invent a
part of the story, based,

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.360
of course, on La Ciociara.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.080
And we invented Giovanni, which
in the book and in the movie

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.960
is a very minor character, he
developed into the villain.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.340
But still, there,
since there is,

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.790
again-- I want to stress this.

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:28.540
There is a narrative
in the music of Marco.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.870
And that's avant
garde to my eyes now.

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:34.860
Because after we
deconstructed music,

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.920
now we have to build music.

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:41.060
So in this way, this narrative
of the music, in some way,

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:44.810
it's intermingled with the
narrative of the story.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:49.530
That I think it's a very simple
story under many perspectives.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.040
It's simple because
it's a melodrama.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.220
We can't have too many nuances.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.430
But still, it has a
dignity as a story,

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.130
and I could see
it in the public,

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:05.090
in the audience in the
night of the premiere,

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.710
they were really
following the story.

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:10.250
And there was a sort of
suspense in some moments.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:14.030
You really don't know
how it's going to end.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:18.950
I think this was a very
nice success for all of us.

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:23.490
And I think that
this is the path

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.990
modern music should pursue.

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:30.170
The fact you're telling
a story to people

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:31.780
also through the music.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:34.920
You are making the
narrative, which

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:38.500
is what human beings do
since their beginnings.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.890
They always tell stories.

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:42.840
And I think La Ciociara
is a wonderful story.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.630
Thank you.

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:45.810
KIP CRANNA: We want to
hear from our singers,

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:49.840
but before we do that,
I think that it would

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.520
be useful to watch
a little clip that

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:57.570
talks about the kind of
central element in the drama.

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:00.760
Most Americans, I think,
learn about World War

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.810
II in some detail, but not about
the war in Italy, which is,

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:07.660
of course, what
this opera is about,

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.830
as is the film and the novel.

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:14.080
And it deals, of course,
with the end of the war,

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:19.290
after Mussolini has
been put in prison.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:21.780
The Germans have occupied Italy.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:25.130
The Allies are trying
to get to Rome.

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:26.750
They invade at Anzio.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:28.030
There's a landing there.

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:30.920
There's a famous battle
of Monte Cassino, which

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.960
was essential in
breaking through what

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.600
was called the Gustav Line,
the Germans' defensive line,

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.460
protecting the north of Italy.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.790
And very central in
winning this battle,

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:45.040
were some 8,000 Moroccan troops,
French-speaking Moroccan troops

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.260
called Goumiers.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.930
And we're going to watch
a little clip of a video

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:53.020
that's on YouTube, if
you just Google Goumiers,

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:59.200
G-O-U-M-I-E-R-S, you'll see
this longer documentary.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.080
But we're just going to watch
a few seconds of it, which

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.250
talks about how, once these
troops had won their battle,

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:11.050
ran wild, and raped and
pillaged, quite literally.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.650
And this is part of
an interview with some

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:15.340
of the victims of this tragedy.

00:16:23.344 --> 00:16:25.970
KIP CRANNA: So, I have
to tell you the story,

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:28.090
since I work with
commissioning new operas.

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:33.450
When we saw the first draft
of the scenario from Luca,

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:38.440
we thought, violence
from Africans,

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.650
and we were worried about
political correctness.

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:44.270
And we said, couldn't-- do
they have to be Africans?

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.510
Could they be Germans, maybe?

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.030
Australians?

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.600
Who knows.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:56.130
Not knowing, as Americans
don't know, the central role

00:16:56.130 --> 00:17:00.130
that this tragedy had
in Italian sensibility

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:03.820
and Italian memories of the war.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:06.890
And so this is, of
course, a central scene.

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:08.310
And that brings
us to you, Sarah,

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:11.539
because you are one of
the-- your character

00:17:11.539 --> 00:17:15.010
is one of the women
victimized by these characters

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:15.861
in the opera.

00:17:15.861 --> 00:17:17.319
And you have a
great transformation

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:21.800
to go through from an innocent
16-year-old girl to the girl

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.109
that survives all this.

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:25.990
Do you want to talk about
how you pull that off,

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:27.839
dramatically and vocally?

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:28.660
SARAH SHAFER: Sure.

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:32.130
It's definitely a
big transformation

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:34.610
that the character of
Rosetta goes through.

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:41.410
She starts the opera
very shy, and very

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:46.110
obedient to her mother,
quite a good girl.

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:47.420
Very religious.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:50.270
And you see, in the
second act, when

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:52.200
bombs start to go
off, that she turns

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:57.280
right to religion, which shows
a lot about her character.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.200
And then as the opera
goes on, all these things

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.340
start to happen to her.

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:03.440
And Michele gets arrested.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.550
And they become alone,
and then they're attacked.

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:11.380
And there's a huge change
that goes on after the rape.

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.020
She's completely traumatized.

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:17.370
And it sort of flips her
character 180, on her head.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:22.040
And she rebels, and all
this change happens.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:26.410
And she, you know, looks for
affection not from her mother,

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:27.770
but from men.

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:31.760
And so it's maybe the
most difficult acting role

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.410
that I've had to play,
so far, in my career--

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:37.310
which I'm very
early in my career.

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:41.060
But it's definitely-- I mean,
it's so much of an acting role.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.890
She's on stage a lot.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:48.740
And the singing that
Marco writes for Rosetta

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:52.300
is completely indicative of what
her character is going through

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.130
at that particular moment.

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:56.520
So it's very-- in a
way, it's very natural

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.070
to play the evening.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:02.960
Because you feel what's
happening right up to-- you

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:07.080
don't have to put on anything
to play this character.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:11.250
What happens is right
there for you in the music.

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.500
KIP CRANNA: Now, you're
playing opposite Anna Caterina

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:17.200
Antonacci, one of the premier
Italian artists in the world

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:22.000
today, and a legendary
stage animal actress.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.700
And she's also, simultaneously,
doing the role of Cassandra

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.710
in Berlioz's The Trojans here.

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:28.510
So she's quite busy.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:30.680
Tell us about working
with her and creating

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.929
this onstage relationship.

00:19:31.929 --> 00:19:33.220
SARAH SHAFER: It was wonderful.

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.310
She's very-- it was very
intimidating at first,

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:39.509
because I had never seen acting
like that in opera before.

00:19:39.509 --> 00:19:41.300
And I didn't know quite
what to make of it.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:45.730
But I learned so much from
just watching her, you know.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:48.650
And it helped my own acting.

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:50.500
And I kind of
found a place where

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:54.570
I could sort of work with
her, and sort of imitate

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:56.090
and copy some of
the things that she

00:19:56.090 --> 00:20:00.800
was doing to make them seem
like they're related, you know.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:05.470
But she can just stand on
stage completely still,

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:08.300
and it's so moving.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:12.920
You can be so still in
the things that you act.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.280
And so it was a huge learning
experience for me, singing

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.800
and just being with her.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.610
I think it's grown me a lot as a
singer, and as an actress, too.

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:26.300
KIP CRANNA: I would have to
say, just as an audience member,

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:29.010
she is the kind of artist
you can't take your eyes off.

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:29.520
It's just--

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.478
SARAH SHAFER: Stunning.

00:20:30.478 --> 00:20:31.305
She's beautiful.

00:20:31.305 --> 00:20:33.388
KIP CRANNA: So, Dimitri,
you're the love interest.

00:20:33.388 --> 00:20:34.865
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:34.865 --> 00:20:37.010
KIP CRANNA: And you have
a transformation as well,

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:40.240
going from a kind of a
bookish, shy professor,

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:44.930
to a genuine hero, who
does a great sacrifice

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:46.530
for the sake of love.

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:48.715
Talk about that
characterization.

00:20:48.715 --> 00:20:49.590
DIMITRI PITTAS: Sure.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:57.264
Yes, it's true, there is
a big journey that goes on

00:20:57.264 --> 00:20:58.680
with Michele, even
though he's not

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.138
on from the beginning
of the opera,

00:21:00.138 --> 00:21:02.640
and he's certainly not towards
the end of the opera, either.

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.900
But these two women
come into his life

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.780
and affect him in such a way.

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:16.180
And the journey is
unique, I think,

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:21.090
to a lot of tenor
repertoire, it's true.

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:24.590
But it's also-- I love it.

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:30.000
I think that it makes a lot of
sense within this story, also.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.070
Particularly because
of the relationships

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:35.360
that Marco has
managed to maintain

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.890
between all of the characters.

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:40.240
And it really is a pleasure.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:45.560
What he decides, and that
definitive moment when

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:52.960
he sacrifices everything for the
sake of the lives of these two

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.320
women, it's very strong.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.520
It's very poignant to
me on stage every night.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.912
And also, it's a
part of the show

00:22:01.912 --> 00:22:03.870
that I just can't get
out of my head musically.

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:05.980
I just keep on hearing it
over and over and over,

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:10.130
which is testament to
wonderfully written opera

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:12.170
as well.

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:15.115
So I enjoy going through
that journey every night

00:22:15.115 --> 00:22:16.240
that we do it.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.084
KIP CRANNA: And there's
quite a vital scene

00:22:18.084 --> 00:22:19.750
toward the end-- we've
already mentioned

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:20.930
what happens to the women.

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:23.630
And more-or-less
simultaneously, you're

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:26.440
being prepared to be
executed for treason,

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.910
having saved, helped
an American soldier,

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:33.720
and the Nazis have arrested
you for doing that.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.990
So this all happens
more-or-less simultaneously,

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:39.640
in alternation, really, with
the scene with the women.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.140
Can you talk about
how you pull that

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.390
off emotionally, dramatically?

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:43.760
DIMITRI PITTAS: Yeah, sure.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:49.540
It is-- the way Marco put it
together is really stunning.

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:54.180
It's almost as if you can
imagine this split stage,

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.240
where these two really
shocking incidents

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.870
are happening at the same time.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:01.900
And when we first started
putting it together,

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.897
we actually tried
to-- I tried to watch

00:23:04.897 --> 00:23:06.980
what was happening on the
other side of the stage,

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.760
just because it fed me.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.810
And it fed my emotions.

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:14.580
Because even though Michele is
going through something really

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:17.990
terrible, to know that the
people that he cares most about

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:19.570
are going through
something that is

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:23.550
infinitely more difficult than
what's about to happen to him.

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:29.400
It really feeds my reason
for what I have done,

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.190
and the decision that I've made.

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:37.740
And musically, it's just very
clear, it's very splendid.

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.390
And it's the highlight of
the evening, I think, also.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:42.990
And the production
is fantastic, too,

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:46.785
the way that it cuts
that scene so perfectly,

00:23:46.785 --> 00:23:48.910
but it blends them together
in such an amazing way.

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:51.675
It's really something to
be a part of every night.

00:23:51.675 --> 00:23:54.910
KIP CRANNA: I'm curious
how the decision came

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:56.010
to do it this way.

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:57.965
Luca, did this
idea come from you,

00:23:57.965 --> 00:24:01.374
to do these two
scenes in alternation,

00:24:01.374 --> 00:24:03.040
rather than just doing
one whole scene--

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.300
LUCA ROSSI: We were together,
me and Marco, I remember.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.110
I think I'm right, Marco, no?

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:13.360
We decided, since the
opera is so crowded

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:18.770
with facts-- it's a real
story, like a fiction.

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:22.080
So there are a lot
of things going on.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.580
KIP CRANNA: There's
a lot of action.

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:26.300
LUCA ROSSI: And in that
moment, the problem was that.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:31.500
As Dimitri said, this
is the highlight.

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.560
But we have two highlights.

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:37.750
The one is the death
of the good guy.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:39.580
The other is the rape.

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:43.640
So it's very difficult,
which when you put first?

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.390
If you put first
one, the other is

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:49.580
going to be lessened--
destroyed in some way.

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:57.000
So the idea was to put them
together in the same moment,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.100
so you can switch from one to
the other with the same kind

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.170
of tension that
grows, grows, grows,

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:08.590
and then it collapses
when the thing is over.

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:11.600
I think that Francesca
did a very-- Francesca

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.600
Zambello, the director, did
a very good job in freezing

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.030
those moments, so
you-- with the lights,

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:20.430
and the freezing of the actors.

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:25.860
You are even more into
the tension of the scene.

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:29.150
And then what's even more
interesting, I think,

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:35.180
is that after this, you
have a whole other scene.

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:38.270
I mean, in a normal opera,
this is the end of the opera.

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:41.250
The guy is dead, women raped.

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:41.800
OK, goodbye.

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.883
KIP CRANNA: [INAUDIBLE]
kills herself [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:43.883 --> 00:25:48.330
LUCA ROSSI: No, there
is a whole new field.

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:51.010
That's what makes people,
I think, really curious.

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:52.702
Because, what happens now?

00:25:52.702 --> 00:25:53.910
I mean, the story's finished.

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:55.600
No, it is not finished.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.500
It starts here, again.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.000
So I think it's
really the turning

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.250
point of the story
is that moment,

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:04.110
and was beautifully done.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:05.900
KIP CRANNA: I'm glad
you touched on that.

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:09.080
So this isn't a story
about two tragedies,

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.700
and the curtain comes in.

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:16.720
There is another story about
reconciliation, and about hope,

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.960
and about remembered
love that gives people

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.330
the strength to go forward.

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:23.290
Sarah, talk a little bit
about that, would you?

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:25.700
About how this
scene works for you,

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:29.590
as you come out of
the sort of trance

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:32.760
you've been in
following the violence.

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.020
And we're not sure
exactly what happens next,

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.470
but we get an idea.

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:39.790
SARAH SHAFER: Yes, the last
scene is a huge one for me,

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:41.860
in terms of character.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:44.560
You know, she goes
into this-- at least

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:49.070
from Rosetta's point of view,
she is away from her mother.

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:50.850
And she doesn't speak to her.

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:53.570
She doesn't acknowledge her.

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:58.220
The rest of the town is
joyous, because the Americans

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:02.690
have come, and so you're back in
this seeming triumphant scene.

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:04.910
But having seen
the previous scene,

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:06.580
there's a strange
feeling about it.

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:09.510
Because, oh, this
has just happened,

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:13.042
and how can the world go on
when this event has happened?

00:27:13.042 --> 00:27:14.500
KIP CRANNA: She
blames her mother--

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:15.540
SARAH SHAFER: She
blames her mother.

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.670
She blames-- I think,
she also blames herself,

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:18.850
but she won't admit it.

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:22.460
You know there's-- she blames
herself for Michele's arrest.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:26.500
And there's all of Michele
also in the back of her mind.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.180
And then, of course,
throughout the scene,

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.500
we find out that
Giovanni comes in,

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.770
and find we've found out
that Michele is dead.

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:39.690
And then Cesira relates that
to Rosetta, which kind of

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:41.230
brings her back to herself.

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:46.480
And you kind of see the collapse
of her put-on rebellion.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.870
It's not really who she is.

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:50.910
It's just become this
wall that she doesn't

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:55.470
want people to see her anymore.

00:27:55.470 --> 00:28:00.170
But that all comes down
with the information

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:01.990
that Michele is dead.

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:03.750
And so then she has no one.

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:07.050
She has not a wall, she
doesn't have Michele.

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:09.600
Rosetta has sort of
this crush on Michele,

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.110
I think, through
the whole thing.

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:16.800
And so with all that gone,
she turns again to her mother.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.790
And there's this
beautiful reconciliation

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:23.380
at the end, which you don't get
in the book, or in the movie.

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:28.885
And it brings such hope, as you
say, to the end of the piece.

00:28:28.885 --> 00:28:31.410
And, you know, the
music that Marco writes

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:33.670
is so amazing at the end.

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:38.070
And you sense that they're
off on a new adventure.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:40.790
Not in the same way that
they have been in Act One,

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:43.970
but that they
actually are two women

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:46.760
having gone through
something together,

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:50.000
starting anew and going
on with their lives.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.005
So it's very beautiful.

00:28:51.005 --> 00:28:51.800
LUCA ROSSI: May I add?

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:52.640
KIP CRANNA: Yes, please.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.580
LUCA ROSSI: It's true.

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:57.680
What's very important
is that in the finale,

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.380
the reconciliation
is the heritage,

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:02.290
is Michele's heritage.

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:05.070
And in fact, we see
Michele in the back.

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:05.570
But--

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:06.945
KIP CRANNA: Like
a vision of him.

00:29:06.945 --> 00:29:10.180
LUCA ROSSI: It's--
he left something.

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.600
When they say, when
the opera is finished,

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.950
they say nothing is left.

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:15.740
No.

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:19.820
Something is left, is
the heritage of Michele.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:23.700
If we want to say in common
words, it's goodwill.

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.190
To be good.

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:30.490
To try to think that the world
is not only of smart asses,

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:34.750
but is also of the good ones.

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:37.350
And in the last scene, as we
designed it in the beginning,

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:39.310
then there were problems
for the production.

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:44.240
But there were a group of kids
playing war in the last scene,

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.990
in the very last moment.

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:51.220
And one of these little
kids fell and hurt himself.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:55.620
And the ghost of
Michele was passing by,

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:59.710
was helping this little
kid, and bringing him away,

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:01.270
off the stage.

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:03.580
And that was the meaning.

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:11.330
The good there is in Michele
saves also Cesira and Rosetta,

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:14.040
that they get together again.

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:17.910
So that's, I think, it's
a very profound message.

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:22.410
And maybe we have to work
for the next production

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:24.220
to make it more clear.

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.479
But I think it was enough clear.

00:30:26.479 --> 00:30:28.520
KIP CRANNA: You mentioned
in the next production.

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:29.895
We know that this
production will

00:30:29.895 --> 00:30:32.610
be performed in Torino in 2018.

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:35.530
And, we hope, other
places as well.

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:37.630
There's a metaphor of
a flower associated

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:40.920
with the memory of
Michele, also associated

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.440
with the love of
Michele and Cesira.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.540
Was that your idea?

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:45.750
Where did that come from?

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:49.500
LUCA ROSSI: Well, actually,
I found the botanical.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.880
I was looking on the
internet, because we

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.670
wanted a flower,
something that could

00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:55.830
be in winter in Ciociaria.

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:59.590
It was very difficult. There is
nothing in winter in Ciociaria.

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:03.820
But in the end, I came
out with this fiammella,

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.870
we call it in Italian.

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:09.779
What's the name,
the botanical name?

00:31:09.779 --> 00:31:10.320
You wrote it.

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.772
NICOLA LUISOTTI:
Clematis flammula.

00:31:12.772 --> 00:31:15.380
KIP CRANNA: For you
botanists in the audience.

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.330
LUCA ROSSI: And, by
chance, I discovered

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:20.450
this thing, in some
cases, can flourish also

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:23.340
in the late winter.

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.650
So the idea was perfect.

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:29.260
It's called fiammella, that
means "little fire" in Italian.

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:31.120
So it's perfect
for a love scene.

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.617
Nothing better.

00:31:32.617 --> 00:31:34.200
KIP CRANNA: And this
is an idea that's

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.870
not in either the
book or the film,

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:38.900
but is especially for the opera.

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.290
We're going to give people
a chance to ask questions.

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:43.970
And I'm sure all you
Google people know to go

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:46.150
to the microphone to do that.

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:49.460
Let me ask one more
question before we do that.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:56.080
Marco, we have many sort of
traditional Italian, Roman

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.520
tunes, or poems,
included in the opera.

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:03.650
And particularly an Italian
popular song from World War II.

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:07.082
Can you talk about the
decision to use that?

00:32:07.082 --> 00:32:09.530
MARCO TUTINO: Well,
this popular song

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:15.080
was used also by
in De Sica when he

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:22.200
did the movie,
because the song was

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:27.210
a symbol of the end
of the war in Italy.

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:36.780
Every people, everybody sang
this song on the street,

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:37.890
on the radio.

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:41.680
It was very, very popular.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:48.200
I think that it
could be a good idea

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:53.930
to use this theme
for-- of course,

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:56.510
to use the old songs at the end.

00:32:56.510 --> 00:33:04.420
But to use in a certain ways
little pieces, little portion

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:10.370
of the song, and
made them floating

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:13.630
in the score for
all of the opera,

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:16.000
for all the duration
of the opera.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.030
So when you hear at
the end the music,

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:23.240
the original music of this
song in a certain way, and you

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.170
recognize it.

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:26.880
And you don't know why.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:30.700
LUCA ROSSI: And no
critic understood this.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:34.550
Not one single one, who said,
oh, there is "La Strada del

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:35.630
Bosco" everywhere.

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:36.740
No one.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.055
Just to tell you guys.

00:33:38.055 --> 00:33:40.672
MARCO TUTINO: It's
too difficult.

00:33:40.672 --> 00:33:43.990
KIP CRANNA: Do we have
any questions out there?

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:47.387
Cliff, do you have questions
for our Google people?

00:33:47.387 --> 00:33:49.720
CLIFF REDEKER: I guess we can
start out just by talking,

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.880
as you look at the Opera
season calendar and the season

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.880
subscription, what
responsibility do

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:58.515
you have to continue
pushing the envelope forward

00:33:58.515 --> 00:34:00.260
with new compositions,
such as these?

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:03.240
How do you balance that with
folks that want to harken back

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:06.580
to the turn-of-the-century
Italian operas?

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.300
And how do you
approach that balance?

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.429
KIP CRANNA: And, Nicola,
can you talk about that?

00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:15.969
When we choose the seasons, what
operas we're going to be doing,

00:34:15.969 --> 00:34:20.090
popular ones, unusual
ones, not popular ones.

00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:24.219
NICOLA LUISOTTI: I think David
Gockley is to be the best guy--

00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:26.219
KIP CRANNA: Our General
Director, David Gockley.

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:27.802
NICOLA LUISOTTI: Our
General Director.

00:34:27.802 --> 00:34:30.159
I think that, when
we do a season,

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:35.850
we have to balance between what
it was, what it's going to be,

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:37.320
what will be.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:42.150
And in this particular
season, in the season of '15,

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:48.750
we have three
story, three operas,

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:50.770
that talk about two women.

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:52.630
Because we have
in "Les Troyens,"

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:56.020
we have two women,
Cassandra and Dido.

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:58.680
In "Nozze di Figaro," we
have two women, Countess

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.290
and Susanna.

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:02.210
And in Two Women,
we have two women.

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:04.320
So-- Cesira, Rosetta.

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:07.700
And all the three operas
are speaking about war.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.870
Because if you
think-- the civil war.

00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:14.890
If you think that we have
the war in the, of course,

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:18.552
in the classic period
with "Les Troyens."

00:35:18.552 --> 00:35:21.440
We have very close
the French Revolution

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:25.100
in "Nozze di Figaro."

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:29.040
And we are in the middle
of the second global war,

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:33.020
and the civil war also in
Italy during the second war.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:36.240
So I think that the
choice is-- all the operas

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:40.150
we are doing this season are
very well connected, and very

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:44.240
well balanced between classic,
romantic and modern one.

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.760
So, this is how--

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.600
KIP CRANNA: It is a good example
of this delicate balancing

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:53.422
act of the 10 operas we do in
the year, three of them come

00:35:53.422 --> 00:35:54.630
at this period in the summer.

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:56.479
And we have something
very familiar,

00:35:56.479 --> 00:35:57.520
"The Marriage of Figaro."

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.110
We have something
unusual, rarely done,

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:03.240
it's been over 40 years since
we've done "The Trojans,"

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.500
because it's so immense.

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.810
And then something brand-new.

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:09.250
So it's important to
have things to appeal

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:12.040
to a wide variety of audiences.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.676
Is there another
question out there?

00:36:13.676 --> 00:36:14.820
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.990
First, thank you for
coming to talk to us.

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:20.520
This is very interesting.

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.980
So, my question is
related to the fact

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:29.200
that La Ciociara is also a
very famous movie by De Sica,

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:34.180
and Sophia Loren, and I think
it got one or two Oscars.

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:40.810
And Maestro Luisotti was talking
about the ticket-buying public.

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:43.800
From observation, I guess,
that a lot of the people coming

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:46.270
to San Francisco
probably went on a date

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:50.800
to see in the '60s La Ciociara.

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.200
So, no doubt this
is in their minds,

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.620
and kind of invites
some comparison,

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:58.680
it seems, as the
opera follows the book

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.790
less closely than the movie.

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:03.380
But I'm curious how
the movie influenced

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.020
your singing, your development.

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:07.660
I mean, the fact that you know
that people will no doubt will

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:11.665
have the movie in the back
of their mind, a lot of them?

00:37:11.665 --> 00:37:13.430
KIP CRANNA: Thank you
for that question.

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:15.630
We should clarify,
just to be sure,

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:19.210
that the opera is officially
based on the book, not

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:21.050
the movie.

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:24.760
But how did the movie influence
the development of the opera?

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.790
LUCA ROSSI: Well, I
don't know for Marco.

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:32.440
For me, very little in
the sense that, of course,

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.060
it's another language.

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:35.550
You had Sophia Loren.

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:39.730
You had De Sica, it was
another time of our lives.

00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:43.320
So it's a beautiful
movie, but if we

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:47.450
have to translate it in
an opera just as it is,

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:49.660
it would be utterly boring.

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:50.160
Utterly.

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:56.260
So we had to detach
ourself maximum we could,

00:37:56.260 --> 00:38:00.880
keeping what are the most
important points, of course.

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:05.110
But then it was really something
that we left in our back.

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:07.710
And for me was an
inspiration, just

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:12.350
like I was telling you about
Giovanni, the first scene.

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:16.090
The first scene in the movie
is very good, with Raf Vallone,

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:17.900
very sexy, very nice.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:21.790
And they have this love
affair, was very small affair.

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:23.830
But it's the beginning
of the story.

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:27.980
That was very, very
important for me

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:30.590
in writing this Giovanni.

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:34.480
Because it gives to
Giovanni a different nuance.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:36.040
He's not an ogre.

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:40.520
He's just a sexy fascist,
let's put it this way.

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:44.940
So in that sense, we have a
lot of influence for the movie.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:47.950
But for the story, we had
to really take another path

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:48.750
and go away.

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:50.880
And I don't know if
Marco agrees with me.

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.570
MARCO TUTINO: Yes, I agree.

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:59.940
But the movie, for
me it was important.

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:07.090
Because when I
wrote the music, I

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:13.700
have to say that the eyes
of Sophia were in my mind.

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:19.670
And the character of
Michele, Rosetta and Sophia

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:21.020
inspired my music.

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:25.900
Because you know,
in the book there

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:28.295
is a very cold
description of facts.

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:44.770
I need the movie to figure in
the reality these characters.

00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:51.100
It's important to have
a figure in front of you

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:52.200
when you write music.

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.110
It's very important.

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:57.470
Because it's a
different thing to write

00:39:57.470 --> 00:40:04.130
an aria for a literal
imagination or a woman.

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:06.304
KIP CRANNA: An abstract idea.

00:40:06.304 --> 00:40:08.720
But you knew you were writing
for Anna Caterina Antonacci,

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.685
and you had written an
opera for her before.

00:40:10.685 --> 00:40:11.190
MARCO TUTINO: Yes, yes.

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:12.300
KIP CRANNA: So you
had some ideas.

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:13.508
MARCO TUTINO: Yes, of course.

00:40:13.508 --> 00:40:24.450
I knew that Anna Caterina would
be the principal guest star.

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:29.700
And I know very well
her characteristic--

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:33.310
the vocal characteristic,
and her possibilities

00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:35.130
as an actress.

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:39.901
And so also this knowledge
is very important to me.

00:40:39.901 --> 00:40:41.900
KIP CRANNA: Is there
another question out there?

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:46.040
AUDIENCE: Yes, first of
all, from the previous guy's

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:50.660
question, I've never heard
of the movie before today.

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:53.530
And also I had the pleasure
of seeing Anna Caterina

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:54.340
last night.

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:56.610
And I'm very much
looking forward

00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:59.470
in "Les Troyens," looking
forward to next week.

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:04.130
But my question is kind of
a difficult question, which

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:07.440
is, I've been a long-time
subscriber to San Francisco

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.300
Opera.

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:11.240
And over, let's
say, 30 years, I've

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:18.140
seen numerous premieres,
numerous new operas come up.

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:21.690
And most of them
have been performed

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:23.650
for about two or three years.

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:25.540
And I've never seen them again.

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:26.900
I've never heard of them again.

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:29.610
About the only
exception I can think of

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:34.490
is "Einstein on the
Beach," which had its 25th.

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:37.140
Are audiences just
not interested?

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:39.140
Are audiences--
like the novelty,

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:43.860
but don't want to support an
opera beyond its opening night?

00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:49.870
I don't like the
fact that opera seems

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:54.290
to have gone to a time of
Puccini and then stopped.

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:58.210
And nothing past Pucinni has
become part of our repertoire.

00:41:58.210 --> 00:41:59.650
How can we change that?

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:02.590
KIP CRANNA: I'll
dispute that statement.

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:05.170
I think we are actually
in a kind of a golden age

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:06.550
of American opera right now.

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:11.900
And although it's true
that, as in the past,

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:15.890
not every opera succeeds
and becomes a standard,

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:17.100
that is happening.

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:20.960
And it's happened to pieces
like "Nixon in China," which

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:24.150
is being done all the
time around the country.

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:26.750
Among the pieces that I've
been directly involved with,

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:28.940
the world premiers of,
"Streetcar Named Desire"

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:30.600
is done all the time.

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.300
We did it-- premiered
here in '98,

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:36.299
and we did it last summer in
our young artists program.

00:42:36.299 --> 00:42:37.840
"Dead Man Walking"
has been performed

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:41.713
in more than 50 cities,
some on three continents.

00:42:41.713 --> 00:42:43.963
AUDIENCE: I'm thrilled to
hear that both of those have

00:42:43.963 --> 00:42:44.462
[INAUDIBLE].

00:42:44.462 --> 00:42:48.100
KIP CRANNA: "Doctor Atomic"
fits in that category.

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:51.756
And Appomattox, which is Philip
Glass piece we premiered,

00:42:51.756 --> 00:42:53.130
is going on to
other productions.

00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:57.310
So-- but, of course, not
every piece is a winner.

00:42:57.310 --> 00:43:01.500
And it takes a while to figure
out which ones those are.

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:05.340
And as Marco alluded to,
time will only tell, really,

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:08.110
what stays in the
repertoire, and what is only

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:10.830
a temporary popular piece.

00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:13.700
NICOLA LUISOTTI: I would
like to clarify this part,

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:15.240
the interest what you said.

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:19.120
And what you said
to, because I said

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:22.520
I would like to refer
Italian operas, what I said,

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:24.050
instead of global.

00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:28.100
Because as you said, there
are many American composers

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:30.570
that are very successful.

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:33.830
But we are missing Italian
successful composer

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:38.390
after Puccini, this
main world-- that can be

00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:40.260
performed all over the world.

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:42.670
And the idea to perform
in another-- I mean,

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:47.910
to continue to the big
Italian tradition of melodies,

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:52.230
is, for this reason, to
give another time, space,

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:56.500
to new generations of
composer that are not

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:59.040
scared to write melodies.

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.740
Because today sounds like,
if you write a melody,

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:09.430
you have to be in the
jail after the last note.

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:12.700
And you are a bad guy, because
you have written something

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:14.220
that the public will love.

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:16.410
This is not good.

00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:20.960
So, I think, that Marco
has written something

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:25.589
that-- I mean, at the
premiere, we had an evidence.

00:44:25.589 --> 00:44:26.880
LUCA ROSSI: Yes, to go to jail.

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:29.760
NICOLA LUISOTTI:
We had-- no, we had

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.560
10 minutes of screaming people.

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:36.300
And we had 10 minutes of
standing ovation immediately

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:39.470
after the last note, screaming.

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:42.610
And when Marco went in
front of the audience,

00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:46.100
they were screaming.

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:48.920
And he was embarrassed, he
became pale immediately.

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:52.380
He was close to faint.

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:53.340
Why?

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:56.640
Because I think
people need beauty.

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:57.390
That's it.

00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:01.120
We need to go in the Yosemite
and say, oh, my god, what

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:02.780
beautiful Sequoias.

00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:05.700
We don't want to see the
Sequoias like that, burned.

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:10.910
We want to see something
that's still alive.

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:14.720
And we want to just be shocked
by the natural, by the beauty.

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:15.480
Why not?

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:16.646
LUCA ROSSI: And by feelings.

00:45:16.646 --> 00:45:18.930
NICOLA LUISOTTI: And by the
feeling, by the emotions.

00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:20.390
We are still alive.

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:21.610
We are not machines.

00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:28.050
We are human beings
need-- that need beauty.

00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:30.740
So, thanks to Marco
Tutino to bring the beauty

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:33.560
to San Francisco Opera.

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:35.027
KIP CRANNA: Another question?

00:45:35.027 --> 00:45:36.860
AUDIENCE: Yes, actually
this is very related

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:38.640
to what you just said.

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:41.340
But I just wanted to hear
from the composer, like.

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:44.760
It sounds like one of
the goals of the opera

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:48.950
was to make it accessible
and easier to sell tickets.

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:53.860
But was it very constraining
for the composer to do that?

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:55.530
Or, how did that feel?

00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:57.800
KIP CRANNA: Yes, do
you feel constrained

00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:00.950
by the goal of making an
opera that will be popular,

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:03.506
that the audience will enjoy?

00:46:03.506 --> 00:46:04.860
MARCO TUTINO: No, no, no.

00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:07.430
Absolutely, no.

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:17.030
I tried in all my
career to do something

00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:22.410
that may arrive to the public.

00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:28.970
And for me is, yes,
for me is natural.

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:34.030
I'm not able to
write music that is--

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:37.340
I know that I'm
writing only to please

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:42.274
the critics and some friends

00:46:42.274 --> 00:46:43.190
KIP CRANNA: Academics.

00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:45.740
MARCO TUTINO: Yes, and
the academic world.

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:46.820
I'm not able.

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:49.700
It's my fault. I'm not able.

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:52.660
So for me, it's natural.

00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:53.700
I take the book.

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:55.840
I take the libretto.

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.970
I sit on the piano.

00:46:57.970 --> 00:46:59.610
And music arrives.

00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:03.681
It's not my responsibility.

00:47:03.681 --> 00:47:04.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:05.820
MARCO TUTINO: No, absolutely.

00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:08.470
The music arrives naturally.

00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:13.700
So I have only to choose
in which way to put notes

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:15.110
and where.

00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:18.890
But notes arrive by themselves.

00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:22.990
I'm not a creator, I'm medium.

00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:28.810
So, really, this
is very easy to me.

00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:31.070
NICOLA LUISOTTI:
I have in mind, I

00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:33.640
know you've never
thought about this.

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:36.950
Could you imagine
"Yesterday" by John Lennon

00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:38.470
in dodecaphonic style?

00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:42.820
Tell me.

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:45.970
If "Yesterday"
was famous today--

00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:47.360
I like dodecaphonic style.

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:48.410
I am a musician.

00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:50.360
I have studied dodecaphonic.

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:52.280
I have written
dodecaphonic when I

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:55.175
was a student of a composition.

00:47:55.175 --> 00:47:57.257
KIP CRANNA: This is
twelve-tone serialism.

00:47:57.257 --> 00:47:58.840
NICOLA LUISOTTI:
Yes, serialism music.

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:00.330
And I loved his music.

00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:03.800
But it's my personal
opinion, because I

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:06.240
understand that music.

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:09.890
But as an audience, could
you imagine go and its now

00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:13.840
I open my broadcast radio,
and listen to "Yesterday"

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:15.933
in the serial style.

00:48:15.933 --> 00:48:17.950
[SINGING SERIAL STYLE]
Yesterday,

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:22.110
all my troubles
seemed so far away.

00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:24.950
How is possible that you go
to the bed remembering that?

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:33.610
I think that we need to, little
bit, go back to go ahead again.

00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:36.292
I'm not telling,
go back to go back.

00:48:36.292 --> 00:48:38.550
Go back to the future.

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:41.510
Go back, and back to the future.

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:43.700
So, I think this is
they way that I'm

00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:45.140
thinking to the operas.

00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:47.200
We have to be brave, bold.

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:50.910
And I'm asking the composer,
go back and get music

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:51.800
from the movies.

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:55.050
Get music from [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:56.160
Do new shows.

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:59.550
But please, please,
write music that

00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:05.135
will remain in the future for
the audience, for human being.

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:12.510
One day, we understand
through our microchips.

00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:14.800
We are in the
right place, right?

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:20.140
Microchips, all sounds that
becoming from other parts

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:21.660
of the universe.

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:23.640
And that will be another day.

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:26.680
But still today, we love
"Yesterday" by John Lennon,

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:28.260
as it's written.

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:31.954
So, we will love also La
Ciociara by microchip Tutino

00:49:31.954 --> 00:49:32.620
as it's written.

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:33.560
Believe me.

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:36.935
KIP CRANNA: I think we have
time for one more question.

00:49:36.935 --> 00:49:39.010
AUDIENCE: It's a
rare privilege for us

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:40.970
to have access to the composer.

00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:45.390
I wanted to hear more about
the composing process itself.

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:49.890
Composers come from completely
different traditions.

00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:53.410
Some could just sit
down and write it.

00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:58.860
Others take 15 years to
write the work of their life.

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:03.410
Some start from the beginning
or end, a lot of iterations.

00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:09.410
Or you might go back to work
in some motifs, back and forth.

00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:12.970
I wanted to hear about the
process, what made this work so

00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:14.160
beautifully in the end.

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.550
I'd like to hear more
about the secrets,

00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:18.710
if you're comfortable sharing.

00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:22.240
KIP CRANNA: So, Marco, about
your compositional process.

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.140
Do you wait for
the words before--

00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:26.200
MARCO TUTINO: My
composition, oh.

00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:29.353
Well, the truth is that--

00:50:29.353 --> 00:50:30.977
NICOLA LUISOTTI:
Don't tell the secret!

00:50:30.977 --> 00:50:31.893
Don't tell the secret!

00:50:31.893 --> 00:50:32.990
MARCO TUTINO: No.

00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:34.490
No, it's possible.

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:37.570
I try to explain.

00:50:37.570 --> 00:50:45.090
When I write music, when I
finish to write music, and also

00:50:45.090 --> 00:50:48.930
in this case of this
score, believe me

00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:53.140
I completely forget all.

00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:55.820
I don't remember.

00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:58.050
I don't know why.

00:50:58.050 --> 00:51:06.930
And I don't know in which
way I was able to write this.

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:09.970
It's impossible
for me to remember.

00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:13.660
It's a tragedy,
because every time

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:20.660
that I have to start again
to write-- For me, I think,

00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:24.240
but I'm not able.

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:26.700
It is absolutely
impossible to write music.

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:33.320
It's very difficult. Because
you have to control a lot.

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:39.345
You have to control rhythm,
harmony, melodies, structures.

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:43.160
Impossible.

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:44.820
For me, it's impossible to--

00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:51.180
So, I simply sit down at
the piano, as I told before.

00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:55.490
And I open a door.

00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:57.470
I really open a door.

00:51:57.470 --> 00:52:01.180
And there are days in which
this door remains closed,

00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:08.140
and this day it's better to go
to take a walk, or to sleep,

00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:10.780
or to whatever you want.

00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:18.160
But there are days in which the
door open, and a river comes.

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:20.470
And I don't know.

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:24.680
I trust in this.

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:31.281
I have to put the river in the
right way in [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:52:31.281 --> 00:52:31.780
But--

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:32.780
KIP CRANNA: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:34.904
MARCO TUTINO: Oh, wonderful,
the same in Italy.

00:52:34.904 --> 00:52:35.820
KIP CRANNA: Very sexy.

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:36.665
Yes.

00:52:36.665 --> 00:52:40.320
MARCO TUTINO: I put
the river in his bed.

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:48.410
And I tried the
river done comes out.

00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:49.510
But it's all.

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:52.740
The river is not my
responsibility, as I told.

00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:59.610
So, I really can't say, what
are my process of composition.

00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:07.010
Because if a composer has
very present to himself,

00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:12.280
which are the technique
in which he wrote,

00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:15.180
I think that is not good.

00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:22.610
It's not good, because
while you are writing,

00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:27.140
you put this consciousness
in this score.

00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:31.260
And if the publics
feel that you are

00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:35.670
thinking about your
techniques, you're finished.

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:39.220
So you have to
absolutely forget,

00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:42.470
don't remember everything.

00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:43.800
AUDIENCE: This is Google.

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:46.490
I have to ask this
follow-up question.

00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:49.530
Do you do your composition
and orchestration by hand,

00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:52.010
or do you use software?

00:53:52.010 --> 00:54:00.110
MARCO TUTINO: I compose at the
piano with a very technological

00:54:00.110 --> 00:54:02.470
instrument that is a pencil.

00:54:05.110 --> 00:54:05.905
A pen and--

00:54:05.905 --> 00:54:07.280
LUCA ROSSI: A sheet of paper.

00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:12.990
MARCO TUTINO: Yes, a sheet of
paper, white, with five lines.

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:16.120
It's a very clever
system, I observe.

00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:23.320
But when I finish this
first fixing of ideas,

00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:25.640
I have to put in
the computer, yes.

00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:34.590
Because in this way, I
can hear, more or less,

00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:38.660
what I have just done.

00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:45.950
And I use Finale, like,
the software is Finale.

00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:53.160
And I use Apple,
a wonderful iMac.

00:54:55.830 --> 00:54:59.280
NICOLA LUISOTTI: And he was
sending to me the score.

00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:01.719
Every time he was
writing a scene,

00:55:01.719 --> 00:55:03.010
he was sending to me the score.

00:55:03.010 --> 00:55:06.680
I was, of course, hearing
the music by the program.

00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:09.450
But also, of course,
reading in another very

00:55:09.450 --> 00:55:12.880
modern and technological
instrument.

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.390
This is the piano.

00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:15.550
I was putting my piano.

00:55:15.550 --> 00:55:18.430
I was playing with my
technological hands.

00:55:18.430 --> 00:55:21.200
And that worked perfectly.

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:23.160
And all the time, he was
sending me the music,

00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:26.030
he said, Nicola, it's
not me that is writing.

00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:26.760
It's not me.

00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:27.450
It's not me.

00:55:27.450 --> 00:55:30.180
He was like, it was beautiful
the process of composition.

00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:32.110
Because he don't
remember, but I remember.

00:55:32.110 --> 00:55:35.390
Because I followed for two
years, every single passage

00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:36.070
of this.

00:55:36.070 --> 00:55:39.429
One day in my bio
I will write that.

00:55:39.429 --> 00:55:41.470
KIP CRANNA: I think we're
at the end of our time.

00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:43.660
But before we conclude, I
do want to remind people

00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:45.450
that San Francisco
Opera will be doing

00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:47.300
one of its free,
annual simulcasts

00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:51.860
at AT&amp;T Park on Saturday,
July 3-- Friday, sorry,

00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:52.610
it's a Friday.

00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:54.740
Friday, July 3, at 7:30.

00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:55.260
It's free.

00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:57.530
You can sign up by just
going to SFOpera.com

00:55:57.530 --> 00:55:59.970
and give us your email address.

00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:01.759
And that'll get you
early admission.

00:56:01.759 --> 00:56:03.550
And you can come and
sit anywhere you like,

00:56:03.550 --> 00:56:05.160
and picnic if you like.

00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:08.860
It's opera and garlic fries,
what could be better than that?

00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:11.345
Thank you all for doing
this, my fellow panelists.

00:56:11.345 --> 00:56:12.970
And thank you, Google,
for inviting us.

00:56:12.970 --> 00:56:13.620
It's been a pleasure.

00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:14.220
NICOLA LUISOTTI: Thank you.

00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:14.970
MARCO TUTINO: Bye.

00:56:14.970 --> 00:56:17.270
