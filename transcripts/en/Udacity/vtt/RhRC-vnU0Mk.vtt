00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.250
The key insight is that giant scale services are network bound

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.520
and not disk I/O bound. This is what helps in defining

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.270
the DQ Principle. The DQ Principle really helps the system

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.750
designer in optimizing either for yield or harvest

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.350
for a given system capacity. Also, it helps the system designer

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:32.150
in coming up with explicit policies for graceful degradation of services

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:38.300
when either servers fail or load saturation happens or upgrades are planned.
