00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.430
- [Instructor] Musa is
interested in the relationship

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.210
between hours spent studying
and caffeine consumption

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.870
among students at his school.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.800
He randomly selects 20
students at his school

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.480
and records their caffeine
intake in milligrams

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.610
and the amount of time
studying in a given week.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.250
Here is a computer output

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.210
from a least-squares regression
analysis on his sample.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.320
Assume that all conditions
for inference have been met.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.020
What is the 95% confidence interval

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.030
for the slope of the
least-squares regression line?

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.160
So if you feel inspired, pause the video

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.470
and see if you can have a go at it.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.010
Otherwise, we'll do this together.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.460
Okay, so let's first remind
ourselves what's even going on.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.530
So let's visualize the regression.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.940
So our horizontal axis, or our x-axis,

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.720
that would be our caffeine

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.553
intake

00:00:51.553 --> 00:00:52.540
in milligrams.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.060
And then our y-axis, or our vertical axis,

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.610
that would be the,

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.170
I would assume it's in hours.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.230
So time

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.403
time studying.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.370
And Musa here,

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.200
he randomly selects 20 students.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.730
And so for each of those students,

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.340
he sees how much caffeine they consumed

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.530
and how much time they spent studying

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.660
and plots them here.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.060
And so there'll be 20 data points.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.031
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10,

00:01:19.031 --> 00:01:21.840
11, 12, 13, 14, 15,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.410
16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.960
He inputs these data
points into a computer.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.260
In order to fit a
least-squares regression line.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.100
And let's say the
least-squares regression line

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.550
looks something like this.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.120
And a least-squares regression line

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.660
comes from trying to
minimize the square distance

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.680
between the line

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.750
and all of these points.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.740
And then this is giving us information

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.720
on that least-squares regression line.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.430
And the most valuable things here,

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.420
if we really wanna help
visualize or understand the line

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.360
is what we get in this column.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.620
The constant coefficient
tells us essentially

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.990
what is the y-intercept here.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.110
So 2.544.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.690
And then the coefficient on the caffeine,

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.420
this is, one way of thinking about,

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.630
well for every incremental
increase in caffeine,

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.560
how much does the time studying increase?

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.920
Or you might recognize this as the slope

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.080
of the least-squares regression line.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.240
So this is

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.530
the slope

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.530
and this would be equal to 0.164.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.630
Now this information right over here,

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.930
it tells us how well our
least-squares regression line

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.270
fits the data.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.280
R-squared, you might
already be familiar with,

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.500
it says how much of the
variance in the y variable

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.180
is explainable by the x variable.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.450
If it was one or 100%,

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.180
that means all of it could be explained.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.320
And it's a very good fit.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.310
If it was zero, that means
none of it can be explained,

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.140
and it'd be a very bad fit.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.920
Capital S, this is the standard
deviation of the residuals.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.850
And it's another measure of
how much these data points vary

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.240
from this regression line.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.130
Now this column right over here

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.770
is going to prove to be useful

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.340
for answering the question at hand.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.470
This gives us the standard
error of the coefficient.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.590
And the coefficient that
we really care about,

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.460
the statistic that we really care about

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.840
is the slope of the regression line.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.160
And this gives us the standard error

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.390
for the slope of the regression line.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.890
You could view this as the estimate

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.830
of the standard deviation
of the sampling distribution

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.780
of the slope of the regression line.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.840
Remember, we took a
sample of 20 folks here,

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.320
and we calculated a statistic

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.620
which is the slope of the regression line.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.580
Every time you do a different sample,

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.350
you will likely get a different slope.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.620
And this slope is an estimate

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.300
of some true parameter in the population.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.780
This would sometimes also
be called the standard error

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.980
of the slope of the
least-squares regression line.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.310
Now these last two columns,
you don't have to worry about

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.540
in the context of this video.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.880
This is useful if you were saying

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.480
well, assuming that
there is no relationship

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.430
between caffeine intake and time studying,

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.140
what is the associated T statistic

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.030
for the statistics that
I actually calculated

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.610
and what would be the probability

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.980
of getting something that
extreme or more extreme

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.460
assuming that there is no association.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.700
Assuming that for example,

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.600
the actual slope of the
regression line is zero.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.120
And this says, well the probability,

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.660
if we would assume that,
is actually quite low.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.410
It's about a 1% chance

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.600
that you would've gotten these results

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.210
if there truly was not a relationship

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.770
between caffeine intake and time studying.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.210
But with all of that out of the way,

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.420
let's actually answer the question.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.330
Well, to construct a confidence
interval around a statistic,

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.130
you would take the value of the statistic

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.120
that you calculated from your sample.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.740
So 0.164

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.360
and then it would be plus
or minus a critical t value

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.290
and then this would be driven by the fact

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.130
that you care about a
95% confidence interval

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.770
and by the degrees of freedom,

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.760
and I'll talk about that in a second.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.230
And then you would multiply that

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.900
times the standard error of the statistic.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.130
And in this case, the
statistic that we care about

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.790
is the slope.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.190
And so this is 0.057.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.680
Times 0.057.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.550
And the reason why we're
using a critical t value

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.910
instead of a critical z value

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.510
is because our standard
error of the statistic

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.510
is an estimate.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.680
We don't actually know
the standard deviation

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.870
of the sampling distribution.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.160
So the last thing we
have to do is figure out

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.940
what is this critical t value.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.990
You can figure it out
using either a calculator

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.350
or using a table.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.030
I'll do it using a table.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.490
And to do that we need to know
what the degrees of freedom.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.060
Well, when you're doing this
with a regression slope,

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.890
like we're doing right now,

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.250
your degrees of freedom are going to be

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.990
the number of data points
you have minus two.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.860
So our degrees of freedom
are gonna be 20 minus two.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.900
Which is equal to 18.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.970
I'm not gonna go into a
bunch of depth right now.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.690
It actually is beyond the
scope of this video for sure,

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.260
as to why you subtract two here.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.810
But just so that we can
look it up on a table,

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.770
this is our degrees of freedom.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.760
So we care about a 95% confidence level.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.850
That's equivalent to having
a 2 1/2% tail on either side.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.890
And our degrees of freedom is 18.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.470
So our critical t value is 2.101.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.870
And so, our 95% confidence interval

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.740
is going to be 0.164 plus or
minus our critical t value

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.300
2.101 times the standard
error of the statistic.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.500
Times,

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.553
I'll just put it in parentheses, 0.057.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.890
And you could type this into a calculator

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.050
if you wanted to figure
out the exact values here.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.500
But the way to interpret
a 95% confidence interval

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.260
is that 95% of the time,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.240
that you calculated 95%
confidence interval,

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.890
it is going to overlap with the true value

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.553
of the parameter that we are estimating.
