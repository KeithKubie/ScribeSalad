00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.540
 Ah-trolls the Internet whether it's on Twitter, a forum, or even these comments in YouTube 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.840
 It does not seem that we can escape from them .... But who are these people? - And how do they look? When evaluated in a scientific sense 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.270
 While many people enjoy chatting and chatting on the Internet, nearly 5.6% of individuals 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.570
 They know themselves as trolls, or they like phishing online. So scientists decided 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.960
 Study a group of 1200 Internet users to understand these trolls where they found countless 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.809
 Of the so-called "dark qualities". Specifically found that trolls show high levels of 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:45.019
 Mental disorders, narcissism and specifically sadism are people who enjoy the pain of others 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.010
 Now, most people tend to avoid hurting others, and if we do, we suffer from guilt 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.969
 Or reprimand of the conscience, but for the masters, cruelty can be exciting and enjoyable for these people 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.040
 They do not necessarily have to be thugs or bad people but get emotional rewards when they are 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.500
 They cause or monitor the suffering of others. In fact, so that there is a class called 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.920
 "Sadism Daily" which highlights how there are sadistic qualities in many people 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.190
 - Not just sexual predators or criminals, for example, many of us have a good fight 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.500
 During sports or excitement from a thrilling movie, right? 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.660
 If you choose between the following four jobs, which one will you choose? 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.220
 A) kill insects b) help someone being experienced in killing insects c) cleaning dirty toilets or d) carrying pain 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.420
 Of ice water? Studies indicate that those who chose to kill insects have the highest points in 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.170
 The range of sadistic pulse measurement. 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.320
 But Internet trolls are showing very high levels of sadism in finding pleasure in others' sorrows 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.980
 While they are controversial and argumentative, studies have also documented a link between 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.920
 Individuals and anti-social behavior. So are these individuals different in real life? 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.340
 It is unlikely - studies indicate that these traits are regularly transmitted to them from day to day 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.520
 And reflect one's actual personality. But while the Internet provides the property of anonymity 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.660
 Anti-social individuals can communicate with others in a similar way while disassociating themselves from their actions 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.319
 In terms of personal responsibility. 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.030
 The unfortunate part is that trolls are not only more attached than they get more responses than 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.840
 For the average user, indicating that they are adept at luring others - moreover 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.620
 Negative feedback only works to stimulate the offending responses of the trolls 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.320
 Their behavior becomes worse over time with more feedback. 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:34.069
 So, next time if you bully someone just remember they want to block you 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.269
 And feed on your unhappiness. Ignoring them is likely to reduce their efforts
