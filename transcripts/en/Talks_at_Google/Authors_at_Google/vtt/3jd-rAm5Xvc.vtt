&gt;&gt;Female presenter: Well, welcome today to
this AuthorsGoogle Talk with John Medina,

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.610
who is returning. He was here in 2008, where
he talked about his book Brain Rules, which

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.279
is not this one. Welcome, also, to all the
VC locations. We have seven different locations

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.259
VC-ing in today. So, with that in mind, when
you do ask your questions, here, locally,

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.320
please use the microphone so that they can
hear your questions, and also it will be recorded

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:37.870
for YouTube. So, John who really doesn't need
much of an introduction, is on the faculty

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.609
of The University of Washington School of
Medicine in the Bioengineering Department

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:48.379
and is a director of The Brain Center of Applied
Learning Research at Seattle Pacific University.

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.431
And he's here today to talk about his book
Brain Rules.

00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:54.649
[inaudible.]
Welcome John.

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:55.719
[applause]

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:05.980
&gt;&gt;John: Well, it's a pleasure to be back here
again. Vikki tells me that I can't escape

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.740
from this space, so that I can stay glued
to the monitor. If you've heard me speak before,

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.860
you know I have a near-Pentecostal style of
teaching. So that will be very difficult to

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.030
do, but if, Vikki, if I do wander for a second,
just raise your hand and say, "Medina, would

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.060
you get back in front of the camera." And
I'll do my best to stay there. In a minute,

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.060
I'm going to reveal to you the number one
question I am asked whenever I give lectures

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.750
on in utero brain development for parents.
I'm a Developmental Molecular Biologist by

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.090
training. Most of my life has been spent primarily
as a private consultant; mostly to biotech

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.920
and pharmaceutical industries. My specialty
is the Genetics of Psychiatric Disorders,

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.000
so I'm very interested in what happens when
brains develop in a womb at the level of gene

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.950
and cell, and then when things screw up and
you can get a behavioral disorder. So, I spend

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.229
a long time thinking about the distance between
a gene and a behavior; primarily as a glorified

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.549
troubleshooter. I founded two brain research
institutes along the way and in one in particular,

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.979
I would, because they would investigate how
infants process information at cellular, molecular

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.260
and behavioral levels, that's where sometimes
I would give talks about in utero brain development

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.050
to parents. Actually, the parents to be. This
book comes from a mistake I would make whenever

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.360
I would introduce those audiences and talk
to them about brain development. Cause I'd

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.020
always start out, you guys, by saying something
like, "Behold, the differential gene transcription

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:37.500
in the developing rhombancephalon." "Take
a look at neuronal cone migration and here

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.330
some cells and tasty molecules." And I would
watch my audiences just fade away from me

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.810
and I could see a strong distance beginning
to come and then at the very end, I could

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.500
see how far I had missed my audiences simply
by the questions I would be asked by these

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.810
parents, primarily parents to be; they had
just found out they were pregnant, at the

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.080
end of the talk. Quite literally, I would
get the same five questions over and over

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.000
again. Question like, "So, how do I get my
kid into Harvard?"

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
[laughter]

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.760
Well, there's nothing wrong with Stanford,
or Berkeley and there's nothing wrong with

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.370
the University of Washington, so I think what
they're really asking is, "How is it, I get

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.450
my kid to survive a tough, intellectual environment,
given a knowledge-based economy?" I would

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.150
get questions like, "Does my kid have an active
mental life in the womb?" "How do I make it

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.010
a happy child?" "What is having a baby going
to do with my primary relationship?" Primarily

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.430
a marriage. "What's the baby's gonna, having
a baby gonna do to my marriage?" And the heartbreaker

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:41.930
question almost always delivered by a grandmother
who'd gotten custodial authority over her

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.650
grandchild, because the daughter was a crack
addict, "Dr. Medina, how do I make a moral

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.090
child?" That unexpected nature reminds me
of something that's very much with the heart

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.660
and soul of Brain Rules for baby, and that
is the unexpected nature of what parenting

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.590
looks like and brain development looks like.
And that reminds me of a very interesting

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.790
story about a clinical pediatrician who has
a four year old daughter. And the four year

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.390
old daughter was in the back seat of a car.
Good. Strapped into a car seat. And she's

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.000
a pediatrician on the clinical faculty of
a medical school. She's driving, stopped at

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.840
a light, she's left her stethoscope in the
back seat of the car and as she's stopped

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.039
at the light, she looks and sees the little
girl's hand moving over to the stethoscope

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:32.259
and grabbing it. And the mother is going,
"Oh, be still my beating heart. We're going

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:36.610
to have another pediatrician in the household."
And she sees the little girl actually grab

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.349
the stethoscope and put it between her ears
just like she should, and now the mom is going,

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:46.820
"Oh, we're only 12 years and an MCAT away
from having a real, life physician in the

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.310
household." And she gets quickly disamused
of the attitude when the little girl grabs

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.840
the bell of the stethoscope, puts it to her
lips and shouts, "Welcome to McDonalds.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.840
[laughter]

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.199
May I take your order, please?"

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.990
So, I wrote the book Brain Rules for Baby
in an attempt to address some of this unexpectedness,

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:11.689
and I decided to take my audience's seriously.
I was given an Ivory Tower, they were asking

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:17.090
for Ivory Soap. So, the Ivory Soap questions
look like this, and what produces the organization

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.060
of the book. There's an introduction, pregnancy
considerations, relationship considerations,

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.319
smart, happy, moral, and the questions that
the book is organized around follow the same

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:32.259
types of questions I always got whenever I
saw that my audiences really weren't interested

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:37.340
in the rhombancephalon. So, number one, "Does
my baby have an active life in the womb?"

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.249
"How will bringing this infant home affect
my marriage?" "How do I get my kid into Harvard?"

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:46.379
"How do I raise a happy child?" "How do I
raise a moral child?" And the number one question

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:51.330
I get whenever it is that I'm talking with
audiences, particularly college educated audiences

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.509
and particularly technical, sophisticated
audiences with lots of advanced degrees in

00:05:55.509 --> 00:06:00.469
the room, is that guy, "How do I get my kid
into Harvard?" "How do I create an intellectual

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:04.930
environment at home that will allow them to
be intellectually successful later on in life?"

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.060
And so, I'm gonna talk about that for the
next 45, 50 minutes or so and I'm gonna divide

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.240
this lecture into an introduction and three
parts in order to be able to talk to you about

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.060
it. So, I will introduce the "Grump Factor"
and in part one we'll talk about the fact

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.110
that babies are active learners. Part two,
"What to do before your child comes into the

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.600
world," and then in part three, "What to do
before your child comes into a school." We

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.190
will emphasize an example in imitation, then
we'll look at the relational ecology of the

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.889
home and then, finally, we'll end it out with
effort versus IQ.

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:39.900
Let's start with an introduction, the grump
factor. Hopefully, I'm a nice guy. I'm a pretty

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.409
grumpy scientist. I don't have a lot of tolerance
for uncontrollable variables and the first

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:48.880
thing I'm going to say might sound surprising
to you. From the cognitive neurosciences,

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.840
it's probably the best academic unit for talking
about parenting and brain science, but if

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.360
you've heard me talk before, you already know
what I'm gonna say. I don't think brain science

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:04.520
has anything to do say to how we should raise
our children any more than it had when first

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.129
book, Brain Rules, anything about what we
can say about how to educate our kids, or

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:12.569
how to create a great business around it.
There are three reasons for this skepticism

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:17.050
and some of those will sound familiar to you,
too. Reason number one has to do with ignorance.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.919
We don't know very much about how the brain
works, regardless of what you may have heard.

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:26.830
We do not know how you know how to pick up
a glass of water and drink it. We don't know

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:31.249
how it is that you can sign your name. We
don't know why it takes two years for a child

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:35.219
to decide whether they're gonna be right-handed
or left-handed. We don't know squat about

00:07:35.219 --> 00:07:38.850
how the brain processes information. We don't
know most of the basics.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:45.189
Number two: Individuality. This has to do
with the previous brain rule in Brain Rules,

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:50.779
the book. Number three: Every brain is wired
differently from every other brain and learns

00:07:50.779 --> 00:07:56.529
in ways unique to that wiring. Kids are extraordinarily
active learners and they learn in actively

00:07:56.529 --> 00:08:02.389
wiring themselves differently and the upshot
is, regardless of parenting advice books that

00:08:02.389 --> 00:08:09.470
might be out there, one size very seldom fits
all. And as a result of the balkanization

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:13.650
of the individual wiring of the brain, you
have to be very careful, especially if you

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:18.349
want the hard stuff, the neurosciences, to
actually inform your parenting skills. There's

00:08:18.349 --> 00:08:22.389
a few out there. We're gonna talk about them,
but there's not very many. One size very seldom

00:08:22.389 --> 00:08:23.389
fits all.

00:08:23.389 --> 00:08:27.599
Number three: The data. I have some real problems
from the times that it has been researched.

00:08:27.599 --> 00:08:32.969
For example, most of the data about parenting
and brains are associative in nature, rather

00:08:32.969 --> 00:08:37.980
than causal and that limits much of what you
can say. What I mean by associative is simply

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:42.690
this: all bullies drink fluid. That does not
mean drinking fluid leads to bullying. It's

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:46.700
just that they're co-associated and a lot
of the data in parenting world is a lot like

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.890
that and so, you have to be careful with it.
I would also argue this: I'm not sure how

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:54.810
much of the data that's out there, in the
last 30 years, is actually relevant to the

00:08:54.810 --> 00:09:00.650
real world of 2010-2011. For example, the
American family is changing in three very

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:05.310
dramatic ways. Number one, you now have blended
families is the norm. Forty percent of all

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:10.060
American children under the age of 15 will
experience a parental break-up by the time

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:17.270
they are 15. Forty percent of all babies born
in 2009 were born to single parent households.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:22.820
And the 2010 figure's looking larger. There
are gay households. One in five gay couples

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:28.480
are starting a family, yet the data, such
as it exists, primarily has been done with

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:35.100
heterosexual, married couples, most of whom
were white. Well, that's where the data we're

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:39.390
gonna have to mine comes from, but with those
caveats in mind, I can now get into the body

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:43.440
of the talk, but it's my grump factor and
hopefully, you got a pretty good grump factor,

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.930
too, and I wanna start that out.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:48.940
I did write Brain Rules for Baby. There are
some things you can say from the sciences,

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:52.851
but you have to be darn careful with what
you do before you get started. So, if you're

00:09:52.851 --> 00:09:57.310
taking notes, and I see some of you are trying,
you already now notice that I speak at the

00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:01.390
speed of light. If you still wanna keep your
pencils up, that will be the triumph of hope

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.600
over experience, but I wish you well.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.260
[laughter]
Take out your pencils.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:12.300
Part one: Babies are active learners. Talking
about getting into Harvard, we're gonna talk

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:17.210
about imitation. They are extraordinarily
sensitive to the adult behaviors that surround

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:21.490
them and for that I wanna give you another
example that also comes from a pediatrician.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:28.180
She has a husband who is a principle investigator
biochemist. Hot dog lab, boy, two NIH program

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:32.290
projects, got lots of post-docs and graduate
students. She's a clinical pediatrician. They

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:37.440
have a six year old daughter and he has a
tradition. Every year he invites, cause a

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.460
lot of this post-docs are from South Asia
and the People's Republic of China, he has

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.950
a lot of folks who have no place to go for
Christmas. He calls them Christmas orphans,

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:50.600
so he is going to invite them all over for
dinner, which he does. Very delighted. They

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.660
have a very traditional marriage, and that's
gonna be important in this story in just a

00:10:53.660 --> 00:11:00.120
second. But, the mom who also has a career
and who also has lots of things she's doing,

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.750
because it's a traditional marriage, even
though it's his laboratory, guess who has

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:09.760
to do the dinner? She does. She's cooking
the dinner and I will tell you she gets increasingly

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.370
pissed off by this as the years have gone
by cause the guys are all talking science

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:19.030
in the den and she's having to do all the
preparations. And the six year old daughter

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:25.040
is observing this anger on the part of "the
wife, mom." And so, it happens and they cook

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.780
the dinner and they sit down for table and
she turns to the daughter just before they

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:33.950
all get ready to eat and says, "Honey, six
year old daughter, will you mind saying the

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:40.120
blessing for dinner?" And she goes, "No, Mom,
I do mind. I don't wanna do it." And Mom goes,

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:45.120
"Well, why not, honey" "I'm already stressed
enough," she's thinking to herself, I think.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.990
Daughter goes, "Well, I wouldn't know what
to say." And Mom gets a relaxed look on her

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:54.290
face and says, "That's ok, dear. You just
say what you hear Mommy say."

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:56.610
[laughter]

00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:00.440
Little girl gets this wicked look on her face,
apparently, closes her eyes and says, "Oh,

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:06.440
Lord, why did my husband invite all these
jerks to dinner?"

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.870
[laughter]

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:12.550
So, they are very sensitive to the adult behaviors
surrounding. That's an example of a six year

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:17.810
old. Believe it or not, we can see this, what
is a very strong form of imitative instincts,

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:24.800
42 minutes after a child has been born. That
imitative behavior, sometimes called reflective

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:29.280
behavior, that imitative behavior can be measured
directly after birth, so we think it may be

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:36.220
innate insofar as post-birth, preloaded software
in a kid is innate. Andy Meltzoff did it.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:41.250
He had the guts to do this. He had the guts,
at 42 minutes of age, to stick his tongue

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:47.540
out at a baby and then wait. Now that experiment
had probably done before. Philosophically,

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:52.030
in experimental psychology, we used to think
that babies were tabula rasas. What's a tabula

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:57.120
rasa? Blank slate and that you can just paint
your self portrait, as a parent, on the kid's

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.480
brain anytime you wanted, probably thought
by a bunch of underfunded experimental psychologists,

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:06.170
none of whom had kids. Because if you have
kids, you realize they come with all kinds

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:11.680
of pre-loaded software and Andy was the first
to really show how sophisticated and active

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.740
a learner a baby is just after birth. Forty-two
minutes of age, he sticks his tongue out at

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:26.970
a baby and the waits. And finds a miracle.
The baby sticks its tongue back out at Andy.

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:32.520
Now, that's amazing. Why is that amazing?
Has the baby ever seen a tongue before? No.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.600
Has it ever seen its tongue before? No. Has
it ever seen your tongue, or Andy's tongue,

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.470
before? The answer is no. What's it seen for
the last nine months? A pink gauze watery

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:46.200
environment that was increasingly uncomfortable
and it wanted to leave. But knows that after

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.220
you've cleaned him up and got the APGAR and
you're looking at him, knows that it has a

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:55.950
tongue, knows that Andy has a tongue and knows
that if it sequences the right amount of neurons

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:59.980
in the right amount of space innervating not
all of the body, but just down through the

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:06.400
lower jaw, will, in fact, stick it's tongue
back out at Andy. That's pre-loaded software.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.800
Now, it takes some time. It takes about 45
seconds and this is an experiment you can

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.830
try at home. If you're pregnant, if you've
got, that's the reason why you're here, you've

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:20.240
got small kids at home, you can try this at
home. But it looks a little bit like , show

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:25.280
my age, Joe Cocker at Woodstock, ok? It looks
like this. You go,"Bleh!" And the baby goes,

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:30.650
"Bleh!" Sticks his tongue back out.

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:31.650
[laughter]

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:35.380
Ok? So, you have to wait. You actually have
to have a video tape to be getting it going.

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:41.360
Once we understood that, you can actually
watch this imitative experience begin to develop

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:46.940
over time, and you realize how unbelievably
sensitive that "jerks to dinner" story actually

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:53.560
is. Kids are doing a tremendous amount of
imitation and they are imitating you, parent!

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:59.540
They've got you in their gun sights. And that's
where parenting begins to take on a very interesting

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:04.120
complexion, simply because babies are such
active sponges. Let me give you two examples

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:10.060
of this active sponge business. It's extraordinary
to actually watch. I'd advise you, if you've

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:14.910
not gone on this, if you are pregnant or thinking
about having children, get on truuconfessions.com.

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:21.060
T-R-U-U confessions.com. It will give you
a very interesting active slice of American

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:24.690
parenting. It's essentially an online diary.
You post anonymously and you can just share

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:28.980
your impressions. I've got two impressions
to share with you about, I think one is a

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:34.050
two year old and other is a, they're both
24 months old, to show you how actively these

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:37.950
kids are already mapping; how sophisticated
and developed this tongue sticking out has

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:39.110
actually gotten. Watch this.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:42.560

"My two year old daughter was so cute today.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:47.230
My husband was watching football and when
his team made a touchdown, he got all excited

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:52.041
and pretended to head butt me, except I didn't
expect it and moved so he ended up doing it

00:15:52.041 --> 00:15:58.920
for real. It hurt. While my husband was apologizing
profusely, my daughter brought me her special

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:05.880
blanket she never lets go of and her pacifier
and shoved the pacifier into my mouth--

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.070
[laughter]

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:12.470
and made me lie down on her blanket to make
me feel better, LOL."

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:13.470
[chuckles]

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:14.470
Another example.

"I have got to learn not to be so crude when
I get home. I was complaining to Shelley on

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:24.700
the phone after work how much of a pain in
the butt my boss is. A few minutes later,

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:31.290
I smelled diaper rash cream, then felt someone
trying to lift up my skirt. My dear two year

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:37.640
old daughter had opened a tube of Desitin
and was trying to smear it on my backside.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:43.240
I said, 'What in the world are you doing?'
She said, 'Nothing, Mommy. It's for the pain

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.240
in your butt.'--

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.240

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.300
"I love this girl so much I could've squeezed
her till she burst."

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:54.620
There, unbelievable behavioral mappers are
infants. They, you can see it at 42 minutes

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:59.650
of age, you can see it at 24 months of age,
you can see it at 72 months of age. They are

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:04.550
unbelievably sensitive to their environment
and it is that kernel of an idea that I want

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:09.009
to explore to you for some of the things we
can do, if you really are interested in getting

00:17:09.009 --> 00:17:13.179
your kid into Harvard. You have to take into
account this sensitivity very, very much and

00:17:13.179 --> 00:17:18.949
for that I'm getting into part two of our
discussion. What to do before your child comes

00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:23.339
into the world: The relational ecology of
the home.

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:30.440
I have three pieces of unexpected news. That's
a euphemism for bad news, by the way. I have

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:35.110
three pieces of bad news for you expectant
parents and one piece of really good news.

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:39.029
And I want to explore all with you. We're
gonna be talking about what to do before your

00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:42.309
child comes into the world. You found out
you were pregnant, what's gonna happen to

00:17:42.309 --> 00:17:46.529
your marriage, what's gonna happen to you
when the pregnancy comes, and fine. Ok, number

00:17:46.529 --> 00:17:51.770
one piece of bad news. Marital conflict increases
in the transition to parenthood. I suggest

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:55.019
you get ready for it. By the time the kid
is six months of age, it either increases

00:17:55.019 --> 00:17:58.620
two-fold or nine-fold, depending on the study.
There are several. You can say that it just

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:04.830
increases dramatically. Number two, kids can
sense the increase even as infants, because

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:12.940
of that sensitivity we were talking about,
and will rewire their nervous systems in response.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:21.549
Number three, this rewiring can interfere
with their academic performance later in life.

00:18:21.549 --> 00:18:27.529
So, there's three pieces of bad news, or unexpected
news. Now for the piece of good news. The

00:18:27.529 --> 00:18:31.779
effect does not have to be permanent. In fact,
there are data that suggests that it's actually

00:18:31.779 --> 00:18:35.779
not the amount of marital conflict, the amount
of fighting between partners that actually

00:18:35.779 --> 00:18:41.870
rewires the kid's nervous system; it's the
loss of the ability for the child to see resolving

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:48.600
behavior. Do you understand? You can actually
fight all you want, but if you don't resolve

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:52.600
in front of your kids in a fashion they can
actually see that everything is gonna be all

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:57.419
right and you now have an asymmetric perception
of the emotional ecology of the home, you

00:18:57.419 --> 00:19:01.789
will rewire that kids nervous system in a
way that does not aid and abet their progress

00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:08.289
into Harvard. So, the whole idea is don't
have that asymmetry. So, many couples will,

00:19:08.289 --> 00:19:12.049
maybe sometimes fights are like that. You
start like a rock on a hill and it's gonna

00:19:12.049 --> 00:19:15.480
roll down and the kid is there, and you don't
mean to, but you end up fighting and it's

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:19.029
12 midnight before the resolution finally
occurs, and you go to your spouse and you

00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:23.460
say, "Honey, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to
do that." And you resolve and your relationship's

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:28.129
gonna be intact, which is fine, but the kid
never sees it. And it's that asymmetry that

00:19:28.129 --> 00:19:32.279
is the killer. So, there's good news; you
don't have to have this. But, unpack everything

00:19:32.279 --> 00:19:37.149
I've just said, let's take a look at this
and then we will discuss in some detail that

00:19:37.149 --> 00:19:41.759
important idea, ok? Number one, marital conflict
increases in the transition to parenthood.

00:19:41.759 --> 00:19:46.830
It does. Kids can sense the increase, even
as infants, and rewire their nervous systems

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:51.340
in response. And number three, this rewiring
can interfere with their academic performance

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:56.139
later in life and the turquoise says that
this effect does not have to be permanent.

00:19:56.139 --> 00:20:02.659
So, let's get into it. What does this do to
the kid and what kinds of conflict is available?

00:20:02.659 --> 00:20:07.360
Let's take a look first at distress rates.
Here's a tasty reference for you. Alrighty,

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.519
what we're gonna take a look at in the transition
to parenthood is stable relationship. Here's

00:20:10.519 --> 00:20:15.490
the birth of the baby. Here is the hostility
and it goes way, way up. Yup. By the time

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:20.009
the baby is born, marital satisfaction yarooon
way, way down. Folks, that's relative instability.

00:20:20.009 --> 00:20:21.009
[laughter]

00:20:21.009 --> 00:20:26.669
But we had no idea how unstable things could
be. It plummets anywhere from 67% to 90%,

00:20:26.669 --> 00:20:30.190
depending upon the study that you're reading.
I'm a conservative scientist, so we'll go

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:35.490
with the 67, but that does mean that two-thirds
of all couples are having some problems by

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:39.909
the time their one and only has landed on
the planet. In such fashion, you can actually

00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:44.289
measure it, these things, through SPF Tests
and a variety of hostility indices that we

00:20:44.289 --> 00:20:48.440
can measure in the laboratory. Let's take
a look at a non-distressed couple. Let's take

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:52.529
a look at a distressed couple in therapy,
trying to save their relationship. And then

00:20:52.529 --> 00:20:56.272
let's take a look at the hostility index of
a couple who has their first child and the

00:20:56.272 --> 00:21:00.889
child is now one year old. What do you see
in terms of NHI? Well, this is what you see.

00:21:00.889 --> 00:21:04.710
There's your non-distressed couple. There's
your distressed couple in trouble. And here's

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:12.210
a non-distressed couple who's had their first
child. Wow. If it's going to come to you that

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:17.299
this will happen, what will it do to the kid's
nervous system if you don't do something?

00:21:17.299 --> 00:21:21.870
We're gonna talk about what to do. But, this
is what happens. Now, I realize that not all

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:25.999
of you are molecular neurobiologists for sure,
so let's just make sure we've done some human

00:21:25.999 --> 00:21:29.710
anatomy to talk a little bit about what actually
happens. You can divide the nervous system

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:33.529
into two parts; central or peripheral. Central
is brain and spinal column; peripheral nervous

00:21:33.529 --> 00:21:37.360
system is everything else. You can take the
peripheral and further subdivide it into autonomic

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.720
and somatic nervous system. Autonomic measures
stress, amongst other things, and the somatic

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:45.869
system generally is innervating skeletal muscles.
That's not completely true. And then if you

00:21:45.869 --> 00:21:49.299
take and do this autonomic nervous system,
see that word? For those of you who can't

00:21:49.299 --> 00:21:55.090
read it, that word says stress, amongst other
things. If you then take and ask the question,

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:59.000
"What's it doing to the nervous system?" I
have to subdivide that guy into two parts,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.360
so I'm going to. The autonomic nervous system
can be divided into the sympathetic nervous

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:07.990
system and parasympathetic nervous system.
In, on average, the sympathetic nervous system

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:14.169
stimulates many stress responses. The parasympathetic
nervous system tells the sympathetic nervous

00:22:14.169 --> 00:22:19.340
system to shut up. All right? So, it's gonna
try and regulate it. Now, that's not completely

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:23.680
true, there's actually equilibrium between
these two, but there are some, not to take

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:28.570
the nuances only for much, but you can think
of this as something that stimulates and something

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:32.299
that tries to tell it to shut up. So, you're
gonna look for some emotional regulation and

00:22:32.299 --> 00:22:36.879
to do that, to understand the neurobiology
of that, I've gotta introduce to you one last

00:22:36.879 --> 00:22:41.360
term. How many of you have heard of cranial
nerves before? Have you heard of cranial nerves

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:45.799
before? Ok, we're gonna talk, for those of
you who have, we're gonna talk about the tenth

00:22:45.799 --> 00:22:50.639
cranial nerve, called the vagus nerve, because
the vagus nerve is going to take and respond

00:22:50.639 --> 00:22:54.649
and traffic between sympathetic and parasympathetic
actually pretty well. So, we're gonna take

00:22:54.649 --> 00:22:59.409
a look at it. Sympathetic nervous system and
parasympathetic. Sympathetic is gonna mediate

00:22:59.409 --> 00:23:04.500
your stress responses, so it's gonna be, regulate
heart, respiration, appetite, cortisol, digestion

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:09.470
and so on. And the parasympathetic is gonna
tell it to shut up, or at least try to. It's

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:14.809
gonna have regulatory potentiometers, only
by analogy, that you can look at. And the

00:23:14.809 --> 00:23:19.139
potentiometers are, in fact, the vagus nerve
and it's a very complex system, but we know

00:23:19.139 --> 00:23:24.520
a fair amount about it, so much so we can
actually measure it. If the kid is going to

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:30.159
be emotionally stable this interaction is
gonna work beautifully. And if the kid is

00:23:30.159 --> 00:23:36.629
gonna be a basket case, he can't tell his
stress responses to shut up. We call that

00:23:36.629 --> 00:23:43.259
vagal tone. You got high vagal tone; you got
a kid who's emotionally right on. You got

00:23:43.259 --> 00:23:47.690
a low vagal tone, you got a kid who does not
regulate their own emotional responses very

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:53.779
well and I'm here to tell you that if you
have lots of asymmetric combat in your household,

00:23:53.779 --> 00:23:58.830
you will create kids with lower vagal tone,
statistically. In fact, the whole thing looks

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:00.830
like this and I'll give you a reference for
it.

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:01.830
[clears throat]

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:05.769
Ok, here's our tenth cranial nerve and what
we're going to be looking at, whoopsie, sorry,

00:24:05.769 --> 00:24:12.820
it's this guy right here. Here we go. Alrighty.
There's our reference. What unresolved marital

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:17.600
conflict does to a child's nervous system.
Alrighty. If you have unresolved marital conflict,

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:21.919
there's a greater incidence of pediatric depression
and anxiety disorders, greater prevalence

00:24:21.919 --> 00:24:25.980
of antisocial behavior in school, poor emotional
regulation, more infectious diseases, that's

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:30.049
because you're collapsing part of the immune
response, poor executive function, which we're

00:24:30.049 --> 00:24:33.820
gonna get into, that's where it gets the poorest
grades and then you've got your vagal tone

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:43.669
problems. You've got differences in parasympathetic/sympathetic
interactions, ok? Not so good news.

00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:49.840
Is there anything you can do about it? The
answer is yes, depending upon the following.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:54.399
Researchers began to investigate this question.
Well, if it's so toxic, this marital conflict

00:24:54.399 --> 00:24:58.500
business, what do married couples fight about?
And remember, I have to stay with the data,

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:02.440
so I'm literally talking about married couples.
What do married couples fight about in the

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:07.909
transition to parenthood? Well, it falls on
gender lines, believe it or not. And to do

00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:13.379
that, we have to enter into a whole thicket
of psychosocial versus genetic issues. There

00:25:13.379 --> 00:25:18.169
are many more social, cultural influences
on gender specific behavior than there are

00:25:18.169 --> 00:25:23.659
genetic ones. In fact, I tend to map them.
If you wanna see what I think are the social

00:25:23.659 --> 00:25:27.019
prejudices, there are social prejudices against
females, there's social prejudices against

00:25:27.019 --> 00:25:32.499
males, and I decided to map them one time.
Here are, is an FMRI of the social prejudices

00:25:32.499 --> 00:25:37.650
of the female brain. Here we go. Her instinct
to use the ladies room, sense of direction

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:43.159
particle, irrational thoughts, need to discuss
feelings nucleus, argue and debate lobe, sex

00:25:43.159 --> 00:25:47.700
particle, chocolate center, weigh all options
a hundred freaking times, need for commitment

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:52.909
hemisphere, shopping and indecision. There's
the social prejudices of the female brain.

00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:56.929
And so then I will ask my audiences, "Would
you like to see the male prejudices of the

00:25:56.929 --> 00:26:01.450
male brain?" Socialize, and then most of themthey
say, "Yes." And so I say, "Ok, I would be

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:04.139
happy to show them to you." There it is.

00:26:04.139 --> 00:26:05.139
[laughter]

00:26:05.139 --> 00:26:11.700
So, we're gonna be talking about gender line
specific behaviors, I actually call them in

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:16.220
the book "the four grapes of wrath." These
are the four things, there are statistical

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:20.909
clusters of behaviors, of things we know that
married couples fight about in the transition

00:26:20.909 --> 00:26:24.450
to parenthood. And here are the four grapes
of wrath, and we're gonna go through one of

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:27.049
them, ok? I can't go through all four; we
won't have time. But we can certainly can

00:26:27.049 --> 00:26:32.759
go through one. Sleep loss, social isolation,
prevalence of affective disorders and chore

00:26:32.759 --> 00:26:37.419
inequities. Good grief. Ok, sleep loss. I
haven't had a good night's sleep in six months.

00:26:37.419 --> 00:26:41.649
That's a very common behavior for those of
you who are rookie parents; finding out that

00:26:41.649 --> 00:26:46.200
you're pregnant and you're gonna have a baby,
ok? Social isolation. Where did all my friends

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:52.220
go? Why don't I have the energy to see them?
Affective disorders. Sometimes, I sleep in

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:59.049
my car, alone. Affective disorders are things
like anxiety and depressive disorders. Depression

00:26:59.049 --> 00:27:03.841
skyrockets in many, both men and women, actually,
with the birth of a baby. And then finally,

00:27:03.841 --> 00:27:08.059
chore inequities. My husband doesn't want
to help me with the house or the baby; he

00:27:08.059 --> 00:27:09.780
just plays World of Warcraft all day.

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:10.780
[laughter]

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:15.511
All right? So, with these in mind, I'm gonna
talk about not all of these, but I'm gonna

00:27:15.511 --> 00:27:19.000
talk about one of them because it suggests
something very practical to do and here's

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.330
a reference for you. If you are having a baby
and you're in the transition to parenthood,

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:27.999
we're gonna talk about chore inequities to
show that we have a very specific gender bias.

00:27:27.999 --> 00:27:32.570
The percent of all household chores, dishes,
dirt, diapers, minor household repairs, car

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:38.440
issues, food acquisition preparation, whether
mom is working in the house or not, 1978 statistic

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:43.320
and 2008 statistic. If you are a male, fasten
your seatbelts.

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.320
[laughter]

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:50.619
All right? Let's take a look at chore disparities.
1978 versus 2008. In 1978, it's a 15 to 85

00:27:50.619 --> 00:27:55.400
split, with mom doing it, even if she's working,
oddly enough. And in 2008, especially if she's

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.741
working, it's gone up, but it's a little better,
but no one's gonna call this even; it's a

00:27:58.741 --> 00:28:03.239
30, 70 split. And if you look particularly,
I think, one of the most damning of the statistics

00:28:03.239 --> 00:28:08.250
is this. Having a husband around actually
creates an extra seven hours of work per week

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:09.250
for women

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:10.250
[laughter]

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:15.649
and a wife saves her husband about one hour
of work per week. Nobody, it's nice that it's

00:28:15.649 --> 00:28:20.639
improving, nobody's gonna call that equal
and if we can hear from our friends, once

00:28:20.639 --> 00:28:23.789
again, from truuconfessions.com, we get the
following.

00:28:23.789 --> 00:28:24.789
[reads]

00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:30.360
"If my husband tells me one more time that
he needs to rest because he quote, 'worked

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:36.799
all day,' I will throw all of his clothes
on the front lawn, kick his car into neutral

00:28:36.799 --> 00:28:42.940
and watch it roll away and I'll sell all of
his precious sports stuff on eBay for a dollar

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:44.559
and then I'll kill him."

00:28:44.559 --> 00:28:45.559
[laughter]

00:28:45.559 --> 00:28:50.499
"He seriously doesn't get it. Yeah, he worked
all day, but he worked with English speaking,

00:28:50.499 --> 00:28:51.659
potty trained adults."

00:28:51.659 --> 00:28:52.659
[laughter]

00:28:52.659 --> 00:28:56.559
"He didn't have to change their diapers, give
them naps and clean their lunch from the wall.

00:28:56.559 --> 00:29:01.230
He didn't have to count to ten to calm himself.
He didn't have to watch Barney 30 million,

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:05.649
three hundred and 24 thousand freaking times
and he didn't have to pop his boob out six

00:29:05.649 --> 00:29:10.509
times a day to feed a hungry baby and I know
he didn't have peanut butter and jelly crust

00:29:10.509 --> 00:29:12.720
for lunch."

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:17.489
If you are going to have a baby, and that
is a part of your household, then statistically,

00:29:17.489 --> 00:29:24.119
in the United States, it is, I have a suggestion
for you. Besides learning how to resolve in

00:29:24.119 --> 00:29:35.850
front of your children, make two lists before
the baby comes. List A, everything wife does

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:45.879
in the house. List B, everything husband does
in the house. If those are unequal, you change

00:29:45.879 --> 00:29:50.509
your behavior and make it equal before they
come. And it's the oddest thing to say that

00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:54.739
that's one of the biggest sources of marital
conflict that exists in the transition to

00:29:54.739 --> 00:29:59.210
parenthood and if you can rewire a kid's nervous
system, based on the amount of unresolved

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:03.480
conflict that's there, you come to an astonishing
and odd conclusion. You wanna get your kid

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.059
into Harvard, guys? Learn how to clean the
toilet.

00:30:06.059 --> 00:30:12.159
[laughter]

00:30:12.159 --> 00:30:16.470
Ok, well. Here's our chore solution right
here. Ok, here's our two lists. Here's your

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:21.320
household or your apartment or your dwelling
place, your domicile. List A, all the chores

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:27.960
wife does. List B, all the chores the husband
does. And that says, "If list A does not equal

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:32.379
list B, then equalize it before the baby comes."
All right. That's what cognitive neuroscience

00:30:32.379 --> 00:30:35.450
has to say.

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:36.909
[laughter]

00:30:36.909 --> 00:30:45.019
Not exactly a 4A transform off a 4 Tesla fMRI,
is it? Part three, what to do when your child

00:30:45.019 --> 00:30:47.109
comes into a school.
[coughs]

00:30:47.109 --> 00:30:53.700
Excuse me. And the subtitles you might remember
is effort versus IQ, right? Effort versus

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:58.279
IQ. This is what you do before the kid is
pregnant; learn how to fight friendly and

00:30:58.279 --> 00:31:03.019
learn how to clean up around the house, but
what do you do before the kid goes in the

00:31:03.019 --> 00:31:07.309
school system? The book really does transit
between zero and five years of age, and so

00:31:07.309 --> 00:31:11.440
I would like to talk a little bit about that.
To talk about effort versus IQ. I wanna give

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:16.229
you an example of what I mean by effort. My
mom, a 4th grade teacher, was a specialist

00:31:16.229 --> 00:31:22.600
in effort. She loved to give her budding scientist
child brain teasers, but she would never give

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:28.659
me the answer, darn it. She had me do effort.
So, she really never, ever gave me the answers

00:31:28.659 --> 00:31:32.720
and I never knew whether she couldn't get
the answers, which wasn't likely, she's really

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:37.470
smart, or whether she had something of a very
interesting insight. I'll give you an example

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:42.899
of a puzzle she gave me, and because she's
a teacher, she actually had access to certain

00:31:42.899 --> 00:31:46.649
psychometric tests. This is actually a test
you can use in the laboratory. It's called

00:31:46.649 --> 00:31:50.919
Gist and detail test as a function of resolution.
It's measuring what we call fluid intelligence

00:31:50.919 --> 00:31:54.489
of a sort. I'll give it to you. You guys can
figure this out in ten seconds. It took me

00:31:54.489 --> 00:31:58.961
about a minute, but here it is. Go ahead and
tackle that for a second. I think you can

00:31:58.961 --> 00:32:02.340
probably see this, but I'll read it to you
for those of you in the back who might not

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:03.340
read it.

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:04.340
[reads from screen]

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:08.539
"There are are three things wrong wrong with
this sentence. Can you find them?"

00:32:08.539 --> 00:32:16.429
Ok. Go ahead. "There are are three things
wrong wrong with this sentence. Can you find

00:32:16.429 --> 00:32:19.950
them?" Ok? And I, as a little boy, would look
at that. It didn't take me all that long for

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:24.740
this one. It takes amount of effort, but I
didn't get it instantly. Ok? I would look

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.610
at it and say, "Hmmm." How many of you found
the, you can find two of them easy enough,

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:31.100
you found the third one alright? Yeah? Ok,
maybe a quarter of you. Ok. All right. I'll

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:34.820
go through this. "There are are three things
wrong wrong with this sentence." Well, the

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:39.429
hint is in the Gist versus detail; 40 thousand
foot view versus the 10 micron view. What

00:32:39.429 --> 00:32:43.119
are you gonna take a look at? Well, I can
see two, I would reason. I could see two things

00:32:43.119 --> 00:32:47.100
wrong with this because they're repeating
two words. "There are are," that's one error.

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:50.360
"Three things wrong wrong," that's a second
error with the sentence and then all of a

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:55.400
sudden it would hit me by effort. Wow. There
are two things wrong with the sentence, but

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:59.670
the sentence says there are three things wrong
with this sentence. There are not three things

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:03.190
wrong with this sentence. There are only two
things wrong with this sentence. The whole

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:04.309
freaking sentence is wrong.

00:33:04.309 --> 00:33:05.309
[laughter]

00:33:05.309 --> 00:33:13.389
And I would look at that and I would say,
"Mom, you son of a gun." Effort versus IQ.

00:33:13.389 --> 00:33:17.109
And then she'd give me a chaser, you guys.
She's a gentle soul, after all. And it's my

00:33:17.109 --> 00:33:22.229
favorite book of all time, this is a game,
book says, "Games you can't lose," so these

00:33:22.229 --> 00:33:25.700
require no efforts and she just gave this
to me, I think, as a chaser just to make sure

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:29.409
I wouldn't be defeated by, this is my favorite
book of all time. "Bobbing for water." Well,

00:33:29.409 --> 00:33:33.970
that's a game you can't lose. "Can you help
Fred find the pizza?" That's a game you can't

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:36.980
lose. And my favorite, cause it's so darn
existential, "Connect the dot."

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:39.220
[laughter]

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:45.850
So, we've got effort versus IQ to talk about.
And to talk about what to do before your kid

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:50.850
enters the school in such fashion that if
Harvard is your option, or better to say an

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:56.549
intellectually robust environment is, we have
to turn to, of all people, somebody who is,

00:33:56.549 --> 00:34:00.309
where is Stanford, please, from here? Just
point. Is it just that way? It's still somewhere

00:34:00.309 --> 00:34:05.909
that way? This is the land of Carol Dweck.
How many of you are familiar with Carol Dweck?

00:34:05.909 --> 00:34:09.810
A few of you? All right. For those of you
who aren't, you can try and sa-, she did not

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:14.349
tackle the problem this way, but I'll couch
it this way and then bring up Carol's terrific

00:34:14.349 --> 00:34:19.619
work. You know, let's say you did your job
well and your kid got into Harvard or Princeton

00:34:19.619 --> 00:34:24.000
or Stanford or wherever you think is a hot
shot place, what you can see, I'm using Harvard

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.280
as my metaphor here, what you can see is you
see two feeder types in the first year of

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:32.559
Harvard life. Number one, some kids make it
just fine. They do very well, but that's not

00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:39.710
true of all of the cohorts. Some get crushed
by the experience, and they end up leaving

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:43.490
before the first year is over. And they have
high depressive disorders, maybe, sometimes

00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:47.039
anxiety disorders. They're not doing very
well in intellectually tough environments

00:34:47.039 --> 00:34:51.159
and the question you can ask is, assuming
a certain level of IQ, or a certain level

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:57.180
of accomplishment at least, what's up with
that? How come you got two and not one? Well,

00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:02.319
Carol thinks she's got a good answer for it,
and boy, I agree with her. Here it is. She

00:35:02.319 --> 00:35:09.900
was able to show that over the arching period
of your parenting skill, 15 to 20 year period,

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:18.119
it fully depended on how you praised or faulted
your child's intellectual accomplishment.

00:35:18.119 --> 00:35:23.839
And I'm gonna go over that in some detail.
And then I'll be done and then I'll take questions.

00:35:23.839 --> 00:35:29.880
It fully depended on how you, as a parent,
reacted to your kid's intellectual successes

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:36.400
and failures. Here's what you shouldn't do.
It's a cluster of behavior that is so robust

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:41.151
and available; she's actually it with a name.
It's called FMS, fixed mindset behaviors,

00:35:41.151 --> 00:35:45.319
if you wanna look this up, ok? I'll provide
a reference in a second. Fixed mindset behaviors.

00:35:45.319 --> 00:35:49.960
You really wanna get your kid crushed by Harvard?
Do this: little Johnny gets an A. You'll say

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:54.799
three things. Little Johnny comes in and you
found he's got an A. "Little Johnny, you got

00:35:54.799 --> 00:36:05.339
an A. I'm so proud of you. You're so smart."
That sounds lovely. That sounds encouraging.

00:36:05.339 --> 00:36:12.550
It is, in fact, toxic. Here's why. What happens
over the course of a multi-year period is

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:18.660
this. The kid gets it that I get good grades
because I'm so smart, but what is smart? Well,

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:22.360
even in the laboratory for us, we have no
idea what intelligence is. Like I said, we

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:26.059
don't even know how you know how to write
your name. Its ephemeral, it's amorphous;

00:36:26.059 --> 00:36:29.930
we don't know what intelligence is. Little
Johnny doesn't know what it is, but you know,

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:36.809
I get an A because I'm smart. Well, what happens
when Little Johnny gets a C? If I got an A

00:36:36.809 --> 00:36:47.490
cause I am so smart, I got a C because I am
stupid. Yeah. And over the course of years,

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:53.750
you see an extraordinary reaction in households
where kids are constantly being fed fixed

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:59.720
mindset behaviors, which is what she calls
them, FMS. They get an astonishing lack of

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:05.869
tenacity. They wilt in the face of challenging
problems. They don't do very well at all because

00:37:05.869 --> 00:37:09.030
they can't control it. Well, I got an A cause
I'm smart, but sometimes I get these Cs and

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:13.049
I don't know why I get these Cs. I must be
really stupid. I think I'm gonna go away and

00:37:13.049 --> 00:37:17.230
hide. In my experience, this is not Carol's
work, this is just John Medina's comment on

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:21.539
it, I have seen many fixed mindset households
over the years since Carol's published this

00:37:21.539 --> 00:37:28.140
and you know what I see? I see a lot of parents
treat their kids as if they were merit badges.

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:35.829
Do you know what I mean by merit badge? Whereby
your, their intellectual success is a direct

00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:40.170
reflection on you. They're not even in the
picture. The kid doesn't even matter. It's

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:46.890
just a reflection of who you are. And parents
in those households track their kid's GPAs

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:52.619
like they watch their stock portfolios, and
watch what happens when they do. In a fixed

00:37:52.619 --> 00:37:56.789
mindset household, we know what they do. Here
is an initial reaction to a hard problem,

00:37:56.789 --> 00:38:00.130
reaction to failure and the depth of their
understanding or lack thereof understanding.

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:05.030
Excuse me a second while I go to standard
view for a second. Here we go. Fixed mindset

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:10.480
behaviors. Right here. They panic in reaction
to a hard problem. In their reaction to failure,

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:14.500
they see errors as personal failings. Of course,
they were told they were, are smart, or were

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:19.380
dumb. So, they ruminate on them over and over
again. The depth of understanding is superficial;

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:23.510
the goal appears to be pleasing an authority
figure with a depth of knowledge. They're

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:27.760
not tenacious; they give up much more easily
and that's probably the reason why they get

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:32.170
crushed at Harvard. Not only do they have
no idea what to do, they have every idea that

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:36.109
it could cast dispersion on them. They've
never learned to focus and drill down hard.

00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:41.220
They are a product of fixed mindset behavior.
You wanna get your kid to flunk out of Harvard?

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:45.309
By all means, tell them they're smart.

00:38:45.309 --> 00:38:47.280
[pause]

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:52.079
Now, there is good news here. You'll notice
I got a little yellow up there with the reference.

00:38:52.079 --> 00:38:59.539
It says, "GMS- growth mindset behaviors."
Carol was also able to show something else.

00:38:59.539 --> 00:39:04.760
That investigating the type of kids who did
make it very well in intellectually challenging

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:10.030
environments, who did very well, had parents
who constantly deployed over a multi-year

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:16.309
period growth mindset behaviors. And these
growth mindset behaviors ended up being pretty

00:39:16.309 --> 00:39:22.490
good. This is what you should do if you wanna
get your kid to survive an intellectually

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:26.290
challenging environments. It's the dangdest
thing. I'll give you the example of kids growing

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:31.369
up in what I'll call the secret sauce of Harvard,
ok? Growth mindset behavior. Little Johnny

00:39:31.369 --> 00:39:39.810
gets an A. "Little Johnny, you got an A. I'm
so proud of you. You must have studied really

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:42.369
hard."

00:39:42.369 --> 00:39:44.920
[pause]

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:52.260
You see the difference? They're not even in
the same emotional universe, are they? "I

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:57.440
studied really hard. That's why I got an A."
Deploy that over a long period of time and

00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:02.480
what you'll see is this. They get it that
I got an A because I studied really hard,

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:07.290
well, when they get a C, if I got an A cause
I studied really hard, if I get a C, it's

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:15.210
because I what? Didn't study hard enough.
And parents in growth mindset households and

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:19.549
my experience, now this is not Carol's work,
this is John's comment on it again, I have

00:40:19.549 --> 00:40:25.339
seen that parents in these households actually
teach their kids how to focus, and they almost

00:40:25.339 --> 00:40:30.920
ignore their GPAs. It's the dangdest thing.
They don't really care about how their kid's

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:36.730
do as a function of some benchmark; they care
if their kids are applying effort. And when

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:41.859
you do that, you will generate the type of
student that will be welcome in my laboratory

00:40:41.859 --> 00:40:51.589
any day because their attitude towards a challenging
problem is, "Yippee! Let's go find out." And

00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:58.279
they do not panic simply because they have
faced a goliath. Looks like this. In the GMS

00:40:58.279 --> 00:41:04.520
households that are available, growth mindset,
they are relaxed. Often feels delighted with

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:08.410
a challenge in response to a hard problem.
Their reaction to failure? Well, they perceive

00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:13.539
errors as problems to be solved, not as personal
problems; not some cancer that's somehow in

00:41:13.539 --> 00:41:18.010
them. Their depth of understanding, this is
why I want them in my laboratory, they aren't,

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:23.230
they go deep. Their goal appears to be focused
on solving problems, not impressing authority

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:28.220
figures. They are tenacious; they don't give
up readily. That's why I want them around,

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:31.960
mostly been a consultant most of my life and
I'm consulting with lots of labs and I can

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:35.970
almost pick out the graduate students that
are, that have been grown up in fixed mindset

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:39.720
households versus those that have grown up
in growth mindset households. You grow up

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:44.780
in growth mindset households, you are fundamentally
curious about learning. You grow up in a fixed

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:48.660
mindset household, in my opinion, you don't
care about learning; you care about pleasing.

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:52.859
[pause]

00:41:52.859 --> 00:41:58.640
All of a sudden, we not only have things in
the cognitive neurosciences to say about cleaning

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:04.260
the toilet and fighting fair in front of kids,
but in what to do if you really want them

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:09.490
to survive in the coming economies in the
next decades. You don't tell them they're

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:20.039
smart, you guys. You tell them they work hard.
Now, I'm closing, I'll take some questions.

00:42:20.039 --> 00:42:26.040
I'm no parenting expert. I'm a brain jock,
a consultant. I probably can't take individual

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:31.960
questions about your child, so it's my way
of abdicating anything that I can't figure

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:36.480
out. I consider parenting to be an amateur
sport. Let me read to you the last page of

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.619
the book and then I'm gonna take some questions.
And apparently, you'll need to go to the microphones

00:42:39.619 --> 00:42:43.970
for that. Ok, here it is. It's my summary
statement of parenting all in fact. Well,

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:47.500
even though I've been cloning genes out of
brains for a couple of decades now.

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:48.500
[reads]

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:53.829
"In the messy world of child rearing, it can
be startling how profoundly a two-way street

00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:59.990
a parent/child social contract really is.
You may think that grown-ups create children.

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:08.200
The reality is that children create grown-ups.
They become their own person and so do you.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:13.170
Children give a lot more than they take. This
hit me one night when my wife and I were snuggling

00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:16.809
with our younger pre-schooler, putting him
to bed. My wife hugged him and thought he

00:43:16.809 --> 00:43:22.710
felt like soft bread dough. She said to him,
'Oh, Noah, you're just so squeezable and soft

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:24.400
and delicious.' "

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:26.200
Sounds like a Charmin commercial, doesn't
it?

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:31.490
" 'Oh, Noah, you're just so squeezable and
soft and delicious. I could almost take a

00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:38.089
bite out of you. You're so yummy.' Noah responded,
'I know, Mommy. I've really got to lower my

00:43:38.089 --> 00:43:39.089
carbs.'

00:43:39.089 --> 00:43:40.970
[laughter]

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:47.130
"We laughed till we cried. Seeing his personality
blossom was such a gift. This is the message

00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:49.720
I would like to leave with you as I close."

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:52.110
Now, this is at the back of the book, but
I think it's relevant here, too.

00:43:52.110 --> 00:43:53.110
[reads]

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:57.819
"As a parent, you may feel sometimes that
all children do is take from you, but it's

00:43:57.819 --> 00:44:03.160
just a form of giving in disguise. Kids present
you with an ear infection, but what they are

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:08.150
really giving you is patience. They present
you with a tantrum, but they are really giving

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:15.220
you the exquisite experience, challenging
experience, hardest experience in the world,

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:21.500
of witnessing a developing personality. In
the twinkling of an eye, you realize the great

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:26.130
privilege it is to be the temporary steward
of another life. Before you know it, you've

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:33.260
raised up another human being where there
was once only a point of view. I said that

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:35.340
parenting is all about developing human brains."

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.220
Which is something I say a lot in the book.

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:42.790
"But my aim was inches too high. Parenting
is all about developing human hearts. At the

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:47.500
end of the day, it doesn't really matter if
your kids get into Harvard because parenting

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:54.500
isn't a matter of celebrating report cards.
It is a matter of celebrating relationships.

00:44:54.500 --> 00:45:03.640
There is no idea in this book, or this talk,
more important than that one."

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:10.329
Thank you very much.

00:45:10.329 --> 00:45:12.010
[applause]

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:16.170
Ok, I'll take question-, woah, sorry Vikki.
I'll take questions and comments till 2, and

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:20.599
then you guys are outta here at 2 o'clock,
so you may need to use the microphone. So,

00:45:20.599 --> 00:45:22.730
if there are any questions or comments I can
take, fire away.

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:24.609
[pause]

00:45:24.609 --> 00:45:31.740
&gt;&gt;female staff: There's one question online.

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:32.740
&gt;&gt;John: Ok.

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:34.980
&gt;&gt;female staff: The person, M, asks, "Does
constant positive reinforcement impact our

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:35.980
kids positively or negatively?"

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:43.480
&gt;&gt;John: Yeah, it's a great question. The question
is about constant reinforcement, positive

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:48.730
reinforcement. Constant positive reinforcement
is a very good thing, but I would also argue

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:54.109
that it is not the only tool kit you need
to have in your parenting supply. There is

00:45:54.109 --> 00:45:58.730
a great researcher by the name of Diana Baumrind,
came up with what she says is the ultimate

00:45:58.730 --> 00:46:03.900
style of parenting and she actually calls
it authoritative parenting. It is a deep supply

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:08.730
of positive empathy and it's got [inaudible]
in it in lots of places. But, if you look

00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:12.900
at households where they have high functioning,
emotionally regulated kids doing very, very

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:18.359
well, who actually get very good grades and
fewer infectious diseases; there are very

00:46:18.359 --> 00:46:23.589
clear rules and expectations in the household.
Do you know that? So, it isn't just about

00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:27.599
positive reinforcement, it's also ability
to produce boundaries. I think of them a lot

00:46:27.599 --> 00:46:31.109
like the banks of a river; the boundaries
that you give your kids. If you have the banks

00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:35.230
of a river, you can give them guidance and
whatnot. Those banks in these households are

00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:41.930
made out of titanium. They're almost not moveable.
So, you have this interesting balance between

00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:46.130
warmth and praise, as the question suggests,
and it's strong there, but also the strong

00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:50.410
sense that you know, we've got some rules
here in the family and you can't violate them.

00:46:50.410 --> 00:46:53.349
And we're gonna get them strong enough that
there will be both rewards and punishments

00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:58.299
for it if you either exceeded the rule or
fail a rule. Those produce the best kids,

00:46:58.299 --> 00:47:02.010
statistically, according to Diana Baumrind.
Yeah, go ahead.

00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:07.760
&gt;&gt;Male member #1: So, hello. So, I've got
a, she's almost one, at home, and I notice

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:12.330
a lot of times she'll do something and it's
something good and then she'll look and she's

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:13.330
waiting for the praise.

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:14.330
&gt;&gt;John: Uh-huh.

00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:19.539
&gt;&gt;Male member #1: How do I get her so she's,
she's interested in doing things, good things,

00:47:19.539 --> 00:47:24.599
on her own and not doing it for the praise?
That's something I've been concerned with

00:47:24.599 --> 00:47:25.599
at home.

00:47:25.599 --> 00:47:30.650
&gt;&gt;John: I see. Well, I would not stop the
praise one iota. She's looking for approval,

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:34.460
she's looking for safety, she's looking for
all kinds of things. Eventually, she will

00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:38.921
get recursive on her own. I think you know
what I mean by that, but for a period of time,

00:47:38.921 --> 00:47:42.950
particularly in the first year of life, they're
still working out safety issues and so there's

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:46.420
attachment things that are going on and they
wanna look to you and see, "Is this ok that

00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:49.400
I still do this?" And if you say, "Yeah, it's
ok that I still do this. Yeah, it's still

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:54.990
ok," there is an envelope, not of dependence
that is growing, but of safety that is growing.

00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:58.700
So, I would argue, particularly in the first
year of life, you pour it on. You're not ready

00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:05.380
yet, the kid'll go, if you will, self-independent
on her own. Wait till you get, wait for a

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:06.380
year from now--

00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:07.380
[laughter]

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:09.210
when you get what's something called the terrible
twos. You will long for this day.

00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:10.210
[John laughs]

00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:11.420
It'll be just fine.

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:13.260
&gt;&gt;Male member #1: Ok, great.

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:14.730
&gt;&gt;John: Yeah, you bet.

00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:20.630
&gt;&gt;Male member #2: I'm wondering about the,
although it's extreme as saying, "You did

00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:25.470
well cause you're smart or you do well cause
you worked hard." And if you say, "I'm really

00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:30.390
proud of you. You did well cause you worked
hard," the kid might know better. Its like,

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:33.490
"I sailed through that. I didn't have to do
squat."

00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:34.490
&gt;&gt;John: Uh-huh[laughs]

00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:35.490
&gt;&gt;Male member #2: Yeah.

00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:37.420
&gt;&gt;John: Well, then they need to go to another
school.

00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:42.059
[laughter]

00:48:42.059 --> 00:48:45.660
It's actually a very good point because there
will be a point, particularly, I call it the

00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:50.809
BS meter, or the authenticity meter might
be a better way to say it, the, there will

00:48:50.809 --> 00:48:53.569
be a point when you'll look at them and they
will say, "Oh, you've studied really hard,"

00:48:53.569 --> 00:48:58.420
and the kid goes, "No, I didn't." And if that's
the case, the bar needs to go up. It does.

00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:02.410
The point of being able to see, or at least
if you want the assay to see this, you see

00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:06.760
this best in problems where they are challenged,
and if they're not challenged enough, then

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:10.019
give them so their intellectual elbow grease
can really get started. So, I would actually

00:49:10.019 --> 00:49:15.519
argue that it's gonna be a give and take and
parts of those, that bar probably need to

00:49:15.519 --> 00:49:21.809
be raised. Yeah.
Uh-huh, all right, folks. Have a great day.

00:49:21.809 --> 00:49:22.809
See you later.

00:49:22.809 --> 00:49:22.810
