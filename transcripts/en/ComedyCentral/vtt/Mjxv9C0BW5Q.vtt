It's a lot more pressure than

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:45.945

In high school,
being in a band gets you laid,

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:54.053
but being in the band
is like

00:00:54.086 --> 00:00:56.956
punting your virginity

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.258

go to a bunch of
tuba playing slobs

00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:05.832
dressed like Cap'n Crunch?

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:07.834
The truth is,
dorks only join the band

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:09.535
because they don't
like eating lunch alone.

00:01:09.568 --> 00:01:12.171
Plus an empty trombone case
is the perfect place

00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:14.173
to hide an assault rifle.

00:01:14.206 --> 00:01:16.209
And why are football stadiums
wasting

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:18.311
200 of the best seats
on the band?

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:20.513
Fire up the Spotify

00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:21.781
and free up that section

00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:24.517
for people who actually
understand how the sport works.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.285
I say force the band
to march around

00:01:26.318 --> 00:01:28.054
in the bathrooms
during halftime.

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:29.322
That's where everyone is,

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:32.358
and it will mask the sounds
of all the beer [bleep].

00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:35.328
But if Kelvin wants a career
where the best he can hope for

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:37.363
is being the guy who
pleads with the audience

00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:40.266
to laugh after Jimmy Fallon's
painful punchlines,

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:41.400

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:37.223
I liked it.

00:02:37.256 --> 00:02:38.424
It's kind of an obscure movie

00:02:38.457 --> 00:02:39.425
for us to parody, though,

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:41.294
wouldn't you agree?

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:43.496
Not so much in terms of
the video and me, I guess.

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:45.731

00:02:54.206 --> 00:02:55.174

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:05.218

00:03:58.904 --> 00:04:00.239
So tell me what happened
in that video.

00:04:00.272 --> 00:04:01.674
It was a summer band camp.

00:04:01.707 --> 00:04:03.409 align:start position:0%
Being a tour band,

00:04:03.442 --> 00:04:05.378
whenever we would
have to eat,

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:06.846
we would typically
not have much time

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.281
and rush to eat.

00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:11.917 align:start position:0%
So anyway, everybody got their
usual crappy food

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.252
that comes in boxes
and stuff.

00:04:13.285 --> 00:04:14.253 align:start size:16% position:84%
Sure.

00:04:14.286 --> 00:04:15.655 align:start position:0%
But since it was
the final concert,

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:17.256
they said that they would
treat the staff

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:18.357
to fast food.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.459
Whoa, okay, so normally
it's awful food,

00:04:20.492 --> 00:04:22.962
and now you got to step up
to fast food.

00:04:22.995 --> 00:04:24.730
- Exactly.
- Wow, that is terrifying.

00:04:24.763 --> 00:04:26.332 align:start position:0%
But I didn't want
just any fast food.

00:04:26.365 --> 00:04:27.933 align:start position:0%
I wanted, like,
the royal fast food.

00:04:27.966 --> 00:04:29.435
What did you get over there
at Burger King?

00:04:29.468 --> 00:04:30.436
'Cause you can have it your way.

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:32.204

That's disgusting.

00:04:33.772 --> 00:04:34.974
Then you had to wolf it down.

00:04:35.007 --> 00:04:36.876
And already
at the intermission,

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:39.045
I knew I wasn't
feeling so good,

00:04:39.078 --> 00:04:40.346
but it didn't matter,

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:41.580
because my piece
was coming up,

00:04:41.613 --> 00:04:42.581
and I had to do it,

00:04:42.614 --> 00:04:44.583 align:start position:0%
after throwing up
from the solo,

00:04:44.616 --> 00:04:48.554
I threw up way more
outside of the theater.

00:04:48.587 --> 00:04:50.423

Did anybody film this?

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:52.458
No, but there's a photo.

00:04:52.491 --> 00:04:54.226
Ah, can we get that photo?

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:55.294
- You can.
- Thank you.

00:04:55.327 --> 00:04:57.163
(Kelvin)
And the next day at lunch,

00:04:57.196 --> 00:04:59.098
I threw up everywhere.

00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:00.466
What is going on with you?

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:04.170
