00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.730
 

00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.890
In this problem, we'll be
working with a object called

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.180
random walk, where we have a
person on the line-- or a

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.370
tight rope, according
to the problem.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.580
Let's start from the origin, and
each time step, it would

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.420
randomly either go forward
or backward with certain

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.405
probability.

00:00:17.405 --> 00:00:19.860
In our case, with probability
P, the person would go

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.530
forward, and 1 minus
P going backwards.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.280
Now, the walk is random in the
following sense-- that the

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.780
choice going forward or backward
in each step is

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.860
random, and it's completely
independent

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.920
from all past history.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.740
So let's look at the problem.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.830
It has three parts.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.640
In the first part, we'd like to
know what's the probability

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.300
that after two steps the person
returns to the starting

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.730
point, which in this
case is 0?

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.700
Now, throughout this problem,
I'm going to be using the

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.820
following notation.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.450
F indicates the action of going
forward and B indicates

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.470
the action of going backwards.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.290
A sequence says F and B implies
the sample that the

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.850
person first goes forward,
and then backwards.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.540
If I add another F, it will
mean, forward, backward,

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.690
forward again.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:11.940
OK?

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.520
 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.910
So in order for the person to
go somewhere after two steps

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.220
and return to the origin, the
following must happen.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.030
Either the person went forward
followed by backward, or

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.270
backward followed by forward.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.290
And indeed, this event--

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.050
namely, the union of these
two possibilities--

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.930
defines the event of interest
in our case.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.970
And we'd like to know what's
the probability of A, which

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.410
we'll break down into the
probability of forward,

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.640
backward, backward, forward.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.980
Now, forward, backward and
backward, forward-- they are

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.660
two completely different
outcomes.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.010
And we know that because they're
disjoint, this would

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.100
just be the sum of the
two probabilities--

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.259
plus probability of
backward/forward.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.920
 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.090
Here's where the independence
will come in.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.850
When we try to compute the
probability of going forward

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.280
and backward, because
the action--

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.360
each step is completely
independent from the past, we

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.630
know this is the same as saying,
in the first step, we

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.550
have probability P of going
forward, in the next step,

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.770
probability 1 minus P
of going backwards.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.360
We can do so-- namely, writing
the probability of forward,

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.450
backward as a product of going
forward times the probability

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.950
of going backwards, because
these actions are independent.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.310
And similarly, for the second
one, we have going backwards

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.980
first, times going forward
the second time.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.440
Adding these two up, we have 2
times P times 1 minus P. And

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.850
that will be the answer to the
first part of the problem.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.440
 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.540
In the second part of the
problem, we're interested in

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.370
the probability that after three
steps, the person ends

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.410
up in position 1, or
one step forward

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.750
compared to where he started.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.610
Now, the only possibilities here
are that among the three

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.440
steps, exactly two steps are
forward, and one step is

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.500
backwards, because otherwise
there's no way the person will

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.050
end up in position 1.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.980
To do so, there, again, are
three possibilities in which

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.670
we go forward, forward,
backward, or forward,

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.690
backward, forward, or backward,
forward, forward.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.850
And that exhausts all the
possibilities that the person

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.490
can end up in position
1 after three steps.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.340
And we'll define the collection
of all these

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.440
outcomes as event C. The
probability of event C--

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.660
same as before--

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.930
is simply the sum of
the probability of

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.560
each individual outcome.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.640
Now, based on the independence
assumption that we used

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.770
before, each outcome here has
the same probability, which is

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.330
equal to P squared times 1 minus
P. The P squared comes

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.680
from the fact that two forward
steps are taken, and 1 minus

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.440
P, the probability of that
one backwards step.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.910
And since there are three of
them, we multiply 3 in front,

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.030
and that will give us
the probability.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.490
In the last part of the problem,
we're asked to

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.480
compute that, conditional on
event C already took place,

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.250
what is the probability that the
first step he took was a

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.580
forward step?

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.510
Without going into the details,
let's take a look at

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.840
the C, in which we have three
elements, and only the first

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.440
two elements correspond
to a forward step

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.500
in the first step.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.490
So we can define event
D as simply

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.100
the first two outcomes--

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.580
forward, forward, backward, and

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.170
forward, backward, forward.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.910
Now, the probability we're
interested in is simply

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:15.540
probability of D conditional on
C. We'd write it out using

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.950
the law of conditional
probability--

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.810
D intersection C conditional
on C. Now, because D is a

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.270
subset of C, we have probability
of D divided by

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.510
the probability of C.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.380
Again, because all samples
here have the same

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.290
probability, all we need to do
is to count the number of

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.190
samples here, which is 2, and
divide by the number of

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.130
samples here, which is 3.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.020
So we end up with 2 over 3.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.940
And that concludes
the problem.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.190
See you next time.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.367
