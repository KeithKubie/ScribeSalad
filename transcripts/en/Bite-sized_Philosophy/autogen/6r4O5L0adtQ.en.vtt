this infrastructure was unreliable for

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379
this infrastructure was unreliable for
 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:49.990
this infrastructure was unreliable for
any length of time we would be in

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000
any length of time we would be in
 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.319
any length of time we would be in
serious trouble and it's never

serious trouble and it's never
 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.680
serious trouble and it's never
unreliable it's so unlikely and so here

unreliable it's so unlikely and so here
we are with all this reliable

we are with all this reliable
 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.899
we are with all this reliable
infrastructure and because of that we
