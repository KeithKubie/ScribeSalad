00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.210
When we have an exponent,
we multiply the base by itself.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.980
So in 3 squared, the base is 3,
and we multiplied 3 by 3.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.730
The exponent tells us how many times
we should multiply the base by itself.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.380
Because 3 was raised to the 2nd power,
we multiplied 3 by itself, twice.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.420
What about 2 to the 3rd?

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.860
Which of the following is
equivalent to 2 to the 3rd?
