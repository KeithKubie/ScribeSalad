00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.530
Cindy and Michael need
1 gallon of orange paint

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.970
for the giant cardboard pumpkin
they are making for Halloween.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.200
Cindy has 2/5 of a
gallon of red paint.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.630
Michael has got 1/2 a
gallon of yellow paint.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.440
If they mix their
paints together,

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.207
will they have the
1 gallon they need?

00:00:19.207 --> 00:00:20.290
So let's think about that.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:27.340
We're going to add the 2/5
of a gallon of red paint,

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.700
and we're going to add that to
1/2 a gallon of yellow paint.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.850
And we want to see if this
gets to being 1 whole gallon.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.090
So whenever we add
fractions, right over here

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.423
we're not adding the same thing.

00:00:38.423 --> 00:00:39.460
Here we're adding 2/5.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.400
Here we're adding 1/2.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.620
So in order to be able
to add these two things,

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.840
we need to get to a
common denominator.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.840
And the common denominator,
or the best common denominator

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.880
to use, is the number that is
the smallest multiple of both 5

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.410
and 2.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.342
And since 5 and 2 are
both prime numbers,

00:00:58.342 --> 00:01:00.550
the smallest number's just
going to be their product.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.100
10 is the smallest
number that we

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.020
can think of that is
divisible by both 5 and 2.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.644
So let's rewrite each of
these fractions with 10

00:01:09.644 --> 00:01:10.435
as the denominator.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.420
So 2/5 is going to
be something over 10,

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.430
and 1/2 is going to
be something over 10.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.080
And to help us visualize
this, let me draw a grid.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.640
Let me draw a grid
with tenths in it.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.710
So, that's that, and that's
that right over here.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.830
So each of these are in tenths.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.570
These are 10 equal segments
this bar is divided into.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.250
So let's try to visualize what
2/5 looks like on this bar.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.880
Well, right now it's
divided into tenths.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.980
If we were to divide
this bar into fifths,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.890
then we're going
to have-- actually,

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.340
let me do it in that same color.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.850
So it's going to be, this
is 1 division, 2, 3, 4.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.030
So notice if you go
between the red marks,

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.410
these are each a
fifth of the bar.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.360
And we have two of them, so
we're going to go 1 and 2.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.420
This right over here,
this part of the bar,

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.000
represents 2/5 of it.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.610
Now let's do the
same thing for 1/2.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.570
So let's divide this
bar exactly in half.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.570
So, let me do that.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.030
I'm going to divide
it exactly in half.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.860
And 1/2 literally represents
1 of the 2 equal sections.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.330
So this is one 1/2.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.380
Now, to go from
fifths to tenths,

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.680
you're essentially taking
each of the equal sections

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.500
and you're multiplying by 2.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.900
You had 5 equals sections.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.130
You split each of those into
2, so you have twice as many.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.250
You now have 10 equal sections.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.290
So those 2 sections
that were shaded in,

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.760
well, you are going to
multiply by 2 the same way.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.140
Those 2 are going
to turn into 4/10.

00:03:07.702 --> 00:03:10.160
And you see it right over here
when we shaded it initially.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.870
If you Look at the
tenths, you have

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.430
1/10, 2/10, 3/10, and 4/10.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.970
Let's do the same
logic over here.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.680
If you have 2
halves and you want

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.550
to make them into 10 tenths, you
have to take each of the halves

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.390
and split them into 5 sections.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.960
You're going to have 5
times as many sections.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.440
So to go from 2 to
10, we multiply by 5.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.110
So, similarly, that
one shaded-in section

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.990
in yellow, that 1/2 is
going to turn into 5/10.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.520
So we're going to multiply by 5.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.770
Another way to think about it.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.320
Whatever we did to
the denominator,

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.445
we had to do the numerator.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.240
Otherwise, somehow
we're changing

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.810
the value of the fraction.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.230
So, 1 times 5 is
going to get you to 5.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.600
And you see that over
here when we shaded it in,

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.590
that 1/2, if you
look at the tenths,

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.920
is equal to 1, 2,
3, 4, 5 tenths.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.700
And now we are ready to add.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.260
Now we are ready to
add these two things.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.519
4/10 plus 5/10,
well, this is going

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.652
to be equal to a certain
number of tenths.

00:04:19.652 --> 00:04:21.860
It's going to be equal to
a certain number of tenths.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.730
It's going to be equal
to 4 plus 5 tenths.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.620
And we can once
again visualize that.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.540
Let me draw our grid again.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.690
So 4 plus 5/10,
I'll do it actually

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.300
on top of the paint
can right over here.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.260
So let me color in 4/10.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.520
So 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.280
And then let me
color in the 5/10.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.050
And notice that was
exactly the 4/10 here,

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.980
which is exactly the 2/5.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:05:01.330
Let me color in the
5/10-- 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.716
And so how many total
tenths do we have?

00:05:03.716 --> 00:05:10.130
We have a total of 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.410
9 of the tenths
are now shaded in.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.770
We had 9/10 of a
gallon of paint.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.930
So now to answer their
question, will they

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.430
have the gallon they need?

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.990
No, they have less than a whole.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.790
A gallon would be 10 tenths.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.210
They only have 9 tenths.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.240
So no, they do not have
enough of a gallon.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.860
Now, another way you could
have thought about this,

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.240
you could have said, hey,
look, 2/5 is less than 1/2,

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.630
and you could even visualize
that right over here.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.120
So if I have something
less than 1/2 plus 1/2,

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.340
I'm not going to get a whole.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.881
So either way you could think
about it, but this way at least

00:05:42.881 --> 00:05:46.720
we can think it through with
actually adding the fractions.
