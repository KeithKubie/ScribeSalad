00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.430
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.602 --> 00:00:05.560
MATT PARKER: Thank you.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.890
Thank you.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:07.390
Oh.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.180
Wow.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.290
Can you all hear me?

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.490
OK.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.853
How's that for the correct
level of disturbingly loud?

00:00:13.853 --> 00:00:14.800
Is that about right?

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.080
OK.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.580
Excellent.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.094
So thank you all very much
for coming along in your lunch

00:00:20.094 --> 00:00:21.510
break to hear me
talk about things

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.730
to see and hear in
the fourth dimension.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.700
My name, as Allen very
kindly said, is Matt Parker.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.250
And in terms of my
background I used

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.530
to be a high school
math teacher actually.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.040
So my original job was
teaching math to teenagers.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.250
And I'm originally
from Australia.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.570
So I taught in
Australia for a year.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.140
And then I realized not enough
people were throwing chairs

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.990
at me.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.780
And so I moved to London,
and that fixed that.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.350
And I taught in London
for a few years,

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.630
again in a couple of
different high schools.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.930
And then I started to drift
from normal math teaching

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.670
to kind of education support.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.500
I started working for some
universities in developing

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.720
resources and doing
sessions for school kids.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.232
So schools would send their
kids along to the University

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.440
and we'd do like summer
schools and things with them.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.620
And so I did that for a while.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.730
Actually, I did
that for 18 months,

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.480
and then I started to get
nostalgic for the classroom.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.430
So actually, at one
point, I went back.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.260
I did six months in an
inner city London school.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.970
And that just cleared
that right up.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:25.470
Right?

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.178
And at the end of that
I'm like, I'm out.

00:01:27.178 --> 00:01:33.240
So since 2009 was the last time
I was a real teacher as such.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.350
And my career now has spread
across several things.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.100
You can see I'm based at Queen
Mary University of London,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.130
which is a university
in East London.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.570
I'm there one day a week.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.356
I'm their Public Engagement
in Maths fellow, which

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:48.730
is what happens when you're
allowed to write your own job

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:49.430
title.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.030
So fun fact, fellow is the
most academically sounding

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.530
credential you can have
with no qualifications.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.890
And so I teach the academics
and the undergraduates

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.880
to communicate maths
to other humans.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.330
And then the rest of my time is
spent doing things like this.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.912
I do a lot of
writing about maths.

00:02:06.912 --> 00:02:08.370
I do a lot of
speaking about maths.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.600
I work as a stand-up.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.890
So actually for a
while I was doing both.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.840
I was a math teacher and
I was doing stand-up.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.290
So during the day, I was
teaching math to teenagers,

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.380
and in the evening
I was telling jokes

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.910
to drunk people in
comedy clubs, which

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.330
is a surprisingly
similar skill set.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.046
And after awhile I realized
I enjoy doing both together.

00:02:30.046 --> 00:02:31.670
And so I do a lot of
very nerdy comedy.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.600
And I do a lot of bits
and pieces for media

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.707
and YouTube and the like.

00:02:35.707 --> 00:02:37.790
Oh, I do a lot of, quite
a bit of work on YouTube.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.750
So if I look familiar but in
higher resolution than normal,

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.390
I do the Numberphile
channel on YouTube.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.350
Actually that was
in the first round

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.205
of funded YouTube channels.

00:02:48.205 --> 00:02:50.580
That was the only non-US one
was the Numberphile channel.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.130
We started in the UK.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.575
So thanks, there you
are, which is great fun,

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:56.470
and we still do it.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.100
And there was a weird crossover
point where the kids in school

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.470
started recognizing me more
from YouTube than from TV work.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.930
And the teachers had no idea
what they were talking about,

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.420
which it's great that a lot of
nerdy kids if they get bored

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.521
at school can turn to YouTube to
watch fascinating bits of math.

00:03:14.521 --> 00:03:15.020
You know?

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.519
I think that's
absolutely fantastic.

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.990
And it's kind of fixed a
problem where bright kids would

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.192
get very bored at
school and they

00:03:21.192 --> 00:03:22.400
get switched off the subject.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.066
Whereas now they can access this
much wider community of people,

00:03:25.066 --> 00:03:27.340
and they can see the
exciting side of mathematics.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.880
And that kind of keeps them
going while they're at school.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.380
And so the book was an attempt
to do a very similar thing as

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.090
well where I wanted to kind of
package up some of the things

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.127
I do with schoolkids.

00:03:36.127 --> 00:03:38.210
I thought there's no point
bringing you along here

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.430
and making you hear about me
talk about the book themes

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.010
"To Make and Do in the Fourth
Dimension," which is why you're

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.110
currently enjoying the talk,
"Things to See and Hear

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.280
in the Fourth," a
wilding different talk,

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.160
I must point out.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.160
I mean, completely
different content.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.220
But there are books
around, and I'll

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.590
be around to chat afterwards.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.330
And I may refer to a few
things that are in the book.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.830
And so that's pretty much
in terms of who I am.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.830
So what I'm going to
do today is effectively

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.630
just show you some of my
favorite bits of math.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.140
And I'll do that for
approximately the remaining 2/5

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.350
of an hour-- 24 minutes.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.980
If you didn't know
that was 24 minutes,

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.279
you're working for
the wrong company.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:20.567
And then I will be around.

00:04:20.567 --> 00:04:22.025
We'll do some
question and answers,

00:04:22.025 --> 00:04:24.650
and then I will loiter around
afterwards to have a chat.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.040
And we are actually going
to do some math, by the way.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.690
That's not an idle threat.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.070
So can everyone who
bought their calculator,

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.510
could you take that out now?

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.040
Really?

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.270
Is that an actual calculator?

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.770
No.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:36.800
It's a phone.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.510
Fine.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.010
What?

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.300
You're going for a phone?

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.791
Phones are perfectly acceptable.

00:04:40.791 --> 00:04:42.790
Some of you have already
got Wolfram Alpha open.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:43.800
That's brilliant.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.630
So if you could get out your
favorite calculation device

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.830
and switch into calculate
mode-- you don't have to.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.164
This is purely optional.

00:04:52.164 --> 00:04:54.205
We're going to do a few
warm up calculations just

00:04:54.205 --> 00:04:54.920
to get us going.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.650
So once you've got it out, put
in any two-digit number you

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.782
fancy, and then calculate the
cube of that two-digit number.

00:05:00.782 --> 00:05:02.490
And if I was doing
this with schoolkids--

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.930
I do a lot of this
with high school kids--

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.400
I'd be very careful to say
multiply it by the same two

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.200
digits, then hit multiply,
same two digits again,

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.350
then hit equal.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.000
If you tell it to your
friends, and you're not

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.300
sufficiently specific,
you'll get the fourth power

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.050
by accident.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.550
But most of you should
have very happily cubed

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.366
a two-digit number.

00:05:19.366 --> 00:05:20.740
And what you're
doing is the kind

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.970
of boring part of math--
the multiplying thing over

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:23.470
and over.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.220
It's the reason why
we have calculators.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.206
The fun part is what you can
do with patterns in the answer.

00:05:29.206 --> 00:05:30.830
Is there anyone who's
prepared to share

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.092
the answer that they've got?

00:05:32.092 --> 00:05:33.550
Not the number that
you start with,

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.070
but the answer on your screen.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.230
Yes, sir.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.979
What have you got?

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:37.430
AUDIENCE: 357,911.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.960
MATT PARKER: So
you put in 357,911?

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.396
So you put in 71 and cubed that.

00:05:44.396 --> 00:05:46.260
Thank you.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.810
OK.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.190
You're keeping your excitement
at a manageable level.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.180
Don't patronize me.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.680
Right.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.700
So has anyone else got an
answer they're prepared?

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.110
Tell me, if I get it right,
instead of just going,

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.015
hm, if you could say, yes.

00:06:02.015 --> 00:06:04.670
The thumbs up is optional
but highly recommended.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.780
If you could say yes
when I get them right

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.880
that would help my
self-esteem dramatically.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.380
OK.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.210
Has anyone got an
answer they're prepared?

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.580
And if you give it in so many
thousands and then the rest.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.288
What have you got at
the back, phone guy?

00:06:14.288 --> 00:06:16.090
AUDIENCE: 804,357.

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.570
MATT PARKER: 804,000--
You put it in 93.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.593
Thank you.

00:06:22.593 --> 00:06:23.400
AUDIENCE: Yes!

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.066
AUDIENCE: Sweet!

00:06:24.066 --> 00:06:26.341
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:06:26.341 --> 00:06:28.590
MATT PARKER: Some of you are
applauding sarcastically.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.520
I would do three
more, and then you've

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.770
go the correct amount of wild.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.740
So are there three people--
don't call them out yet--

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.350
three people who are prepared
to give me the answers.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.180
If I get all three right
in correct succession,

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.910
then you can humor me
with some applause.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:39.090
OK.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:39.340
So this is one.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.048
Hang on a second.

00:06:40.048 --> 00:06:40.570
Remain calm.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:41.069
One.

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:42.120
Anyone else?

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.060
Two over there.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.790
And three over here.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:45.690
OK.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.790
We'll make it like
an exponential trick.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:48.290
Right?

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.570
So we'll start with
you over there,

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.450
and then you, ma'am, and
then that guy on the end.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.840
OK.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.339
Around.

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:52.900
Here we go.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:53.400
So what have you got over there?

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.290
What's the answer?

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.150
AUDIENCE: 531,441.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.980
MATT PARKER: 81.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.739
AUDIENCE: Yes!

00:07:01.739 --> 00:07:02.780
MATT PARKER: Remain calm.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.065
Right.

00:07:04.065 --> 00:07:07.040
AUDIENCE: 21,962.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.066
MATT PARKER: 28.

00:07:09.066 --> 00:07:09.933
Silent nod yes.

00:07:09.933 --> 00:07:10.432
And?

00:07:10.432 --> 00:07:13.543
AUDIENCE: 132,651.

00:07:13.543 --> 00:07:15.355
MATT PARKER: 51.

00:07:15.355 --> 00:07:15.938
AUDIENCE: Yes!

00:07:15.938 --> 00:07:16.438
Woo!

00:07:16.438 --> 00:07:18.418
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:18.418 --> 00:07:19.910
MATT PARKER: Fine.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.140
Now, by the way,
because some of you

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.640
are now working out
how that's done.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.710
Some of you probably
know how that's done.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:25.210
Right?

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.330
And so I'm not going
to explain it fully.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.690
But first of all, I've
not just memorized

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.526
every single two-digit
number cubed.

00:07:32.526 --> 00:07:34.400
Actually, I've been
doing it for a few years,

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.460
so I'm dangerously close
to having done that.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.960
What I'm actually doing is there
are patterns in the answer.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.560
And so there are two
patterns in the answer.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.280
And one pattern gives
you the first digit,

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.710
and the other pattern
gives you the second digit

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:45.117
of the original
two-digit number.

00:07:45.117 --> 00:07:47.200
So as you're calling out
the number, all I'm doing

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.390
is I'm scanning it for the
first pattern that comes up

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.447
is the first digit-- yeah.

00:07:52.447 --> 00:07:54.030
The first digit and
the second pattern

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:54.782
gives me the second digit.

00:07:54.782 --> 00:07:56.910
So I'm just scanning for
those as you call it out.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.680
And it's not an
alarmingly difficult thing

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.810
to do in your head
if you learn it.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.160
If you want to work out how to
do that, if you come and see me

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.618
afterwards I'm
happy to explain it.

00:08:03.618 --> 00:08:06.000
Or if you just try cubing some
two-digit numbers, as some

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.162
of you are doing right now,
or you're texting a friend.

00:08:09.162 --> 00:08:11.620
You wouldn't believe what was
in the lunch time talk today.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:12.119
Right?

00:08:12.119 --> 00:08:15.112
And so if you try some
numbers-- most of you

00:08:15.112 --> 00:08:17.070
have probably got a
spreadsheet open right now.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:17.250
Right?

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.426
It's reasonably easy to
work out how that's done.

00:08:19.426 --> 00:08:21.300
So I'm going to do a
much harder calculation.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.730
And a few of you, again,
will know how this is done.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.957
But if you haven't I will
explain this one at the end

00:08:25.957 --> 00:08:27.040
so you can all learn this.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.840
And this doesn't
involve a calculator.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.430
It involves something
with a barcode on it.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:32.659
Could everyone have a look?

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:34.159
I need someone in
the audience who's

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:35.679
brought a product
they've purchased

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:38.320
in a shop with a retail barcode.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.250
Not technically a joke but
thank you for joining in.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:42.059
So, oh, my book.

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:42.559
Right?

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:43.789
So not my book.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:46.960
Has anyone got a--
What have you got?

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:47.520
What is that?

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.000
Chewing gum.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:49.500
OK.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.458
Can you have a look at
the barcode for me, sir?

00:08:51.458 --> 00:08:54.180
Is there are tiny little digit
to the left and a tiny digit

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.505
to the right, and all the
other digits are underneath?

00:08:56.505 --> 00:08:59.040
Don't say what they are, but
there's a digit on each side.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:08:59.540
OK.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.660
What I'm going to get you to
do in a second is to read out

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.540
all the digits to
that barcode, starting

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.840
with the one off to
the left, all the ones

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.450
underneath, and do not tell
me the one off to the right.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:12.540
I'm going to try and
calculate in my head

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.660
what the one off
to the right is.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:17.720
If I get it correct,
you shout, yes.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.910
Everyone goes bananas.

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:20.530
OK.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:23.144
And I already know some of
you are very good at that.

00:09:23.144 --> 00:09:24.060
And don't go too fast.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:28.840
I will say, yep, after each
digit as we go along so I can--

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.319
People can often
race through them.

00:09:32.319 --> 00:09:32.944
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:09:32.944 --> 00:09:33.569
MATT PARKER: Hang on.

00:09:33.569 --> 00:09:34.069
Hang on.

00:09:34.069 --> 00:09:35.290
Hang on.

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.030
I'm getting in the
math zone over here.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:39.090
All right?

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:39.590
OK.

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:40.150
I'm ready.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.650
OK.

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:41.450
First digit.

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:42.230
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:43.590
MATT PARKER: Is it the same
zero or a different zero?

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:44.580
Is this the one you said?

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.900
That's the one on
the left is a zero.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:46.360
OK.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:46.770
I'm sorry.

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:46.823
OK.

00:09:46.823 --> 00:09:47.400
Well, give me a second.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:47.505
OK.

00:09:47.505 --> 00:09:48.005
Got that.

00:09:48.005 --> 00:09:49.007
Yep.

00:09:49.007 --> 00:09:49.590
AUDIENCE: One.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.070
MATT PARKER: One.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:50.570
Got it.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:51.270
Yep.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:52.070
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:52.942
MATT PARKER: Yep.

00:09:52.942 --> 00:09:53.567
AUDIENCE: Five.

00:09:53.567 --> 00:09:54.325
MATT PARKER: Yep.

00:09:54.325 --> 00:09:55.810
AUDIENCE: Four.

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:56.567
MATT PARKER: Yep.

00:09:56.567 --> 00:09:57.150
AUDIENCE: Six.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.280
MATT PARKER: Yep.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.260
AUDIENCE: Six.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.240
MATT PARKER: Yep.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.220
AUDIENCE: Seven.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.065
MATT PARKER: Yep.

00:10:02.065 --> 00:10:02.690
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:03.535
MATT PARKER: Yep.

00:10:03.535 --> 00:10:04.160
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.140
MATT PARKER: Yep.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:06.610
AUDIENCE: Eight.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:07.756
MATT PARKER: Yep.

00:10:07.756 --> 00:10:08.613
The final digit.

00:10:08.613 --> 00:10:10.000
Is there one more?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.882
It's a six.

00:10:11.882 --> 00:10:12.834
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:10:12.834 --> 00:10:13.767
Yes!

00:10:13.767 --> 00:10:14.350
AUDIENCE: Woo!

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:14.850
Yeah!

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:19.840
MATT PARKER: I like a
brief moment of confusion

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.630
before the climax to a stunt.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.425
So now that-- some of you
have no idea what you just

00:10:25.425 --> 00:10:26.250
applauded.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.985
So that, those of you who know
about check digits and error

00:10:28.985 --> 00:10:29.845
detection and error
correction, which

00:10:29.845 --> 00:10:31.460
is a vast majority
of you, will know

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.770
that there is a pattern
in all barcodes.

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:36.225
And all North American
barcodes have the same pattern.

00:10:36.225 --> 00:10:37.600
It's a slightly
different pattern

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.766
to what they have in Europe.

00:10:38.766 --> 00:10:41.230
So I had to learn a different
method to make it work here.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:44.610
If you want to learn how to
do that-- this is the pattern.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:45.110
Right?

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:48.030
So as someone is reading out
the digits of the barcode,

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:51.350
initially, all you have
to do is add together

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:52.980
every odd positioned digit.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.560
So you add the first thing
they call out to the third

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.810
to the fifth all the way up.

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:58.360
And if you add
every second digit,

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.910
starting in the first
position, you get a subtotal.

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.400
You multiply that
subtotal by three,

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.200
and then you go back and add on
the other digits you skipped.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.408
And if you add every second
digit, multiply by three,

00:11:08.408 --> 00:11:10.810
add the other digits,
for all US barcodes,

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:13.639
the grand total will
be a multiple of 10.

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:15.180
And so if you keep
track in your head

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.470
and there's one of the
missing at the end,

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.840
it's whatever you need to
get-- OK now some of you

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.695
are mildly impressed--
is what you

00:11:20.695 --> 00:11:22.070
need to get up to
the next digit.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:24.305
So the total in my
head ended in a four.

00:11:24.305 --> 00:11:28.930
And so I knew it must be a
six to get up to the next one.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.270
I'm a hoot at
parties, by the way.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:33.910
And so I think it's amazing,
because most people have

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.840
no idea that these patterns are
built into barcodes and things

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.385
around them.

00:11:37.385 --> 00:11:39.051
And so actually if
you look on the book,

00:11:39.051 --> 00:11:42.550
it's got the barcode at the
bottom and the ISBN at the top.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.380
And the ISBN is a subtly
different pattern.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:47.180
But again, it's got
exactly the same thing.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.970
Credit cards have
the same thing.

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:51.150
I can do the same stunt
with credit cards.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:55.420
But very few people will read
their entire 16 digit number

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.360
out in public.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.235
But that's subtly different.

00:11:59.235 --> 00:12:01.064
You double every
second position.

00:12:01.064 --> 00:12:02.480
And if you get a
two-digit number,

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.617
you add the digits together
to get the digit root.

00:12:04.617 --> 00:12:06.450
And then once you add
all of those together,

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.030
you get a multiple.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:10.390
And most people go about
their daily lives completely

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:12.514
oblivious that all these
mathematical patterns

00:12:12.514 --> 00:12:13.430
are in the background.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:16.580
If we didn't have that
pattern in barcodes,

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.331
our modern shopping
centers wouldn't work.

00:12:18.331 --> 00:12:18.830
Right?

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.120
Because when you scan
something at the supermarket,

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.270
because the lasers aren't
very accurate-- because lasers

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:28.360
make a lot of
mistakes-- physics.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.250
But thankfully math
comes to the rescue.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:30.750
Right?

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:34.570
Because if it scans the barcode
wrong, the pattern won't match.

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:36.490
And so it knows it's
misscannned the barcode.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:37.865
And so it keeps
trying to scan it

00:12:37.865 --> 00:12:39.840
until it gets one where
the pattern matches.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.060
The vast majority of the
time that then means it

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.276
scanned it correctly and
it goes onto your bill.

00:12:44.276 --> 00:12:46.650
And people get very emotional
if they scanned one product

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:47.440
and had to pay for something.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.480
Well, it depends on the
price difference, I guess.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.260
And so people don't
know that this pattern

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.676
is hidden in the
background there.

00:12:52.676 --> 00:12:55.200
And the same thing happens
with text messages.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.440
So those of you who
know Reed-Solomon

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.950
and the types of
error and coding

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.660
you can do with text
messages, there's

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.560
a fantastic way to look at what
happens with a text message.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.840
Because when you're
typing in the text message

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.010
and your phone is turning
all the characters

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:10.250
you're entering into
numbers, it effectively

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:12.780
puts those numbers
into a giant grid.

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:15.224
It goes through that grid and
puts a mathematical pattern

00:13:15.224 --> 00:13:17.390
into every single row, and
then puts another pattern

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:18.930
into every single
column, and then

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:22.810
puts a third pattern into
subsections within the grid.

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:25.170
And if that sounds
vaguely familiar,

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:29.940
it's because it turns your text
message into a Sudoku puzzle.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.080
And so people have a sense
that if you give them a Soduku

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.662
puzzle, even though huge
sections are missing--

00:13:35.662 --> 00:13:37.120
all these numbers
are missing here,

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.170
all these numbers are
missing down here--

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.490
if you know the three
mathematical patterns,

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.520
you can recreate all
those missing digits.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.840
And so people, for fun,
do error correction

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:52.110
as kind of a leisurely activity,
which I think is fantastic.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:55.047
And so you see, I push
people like on the train

00:13:55.047 --> 00:13:55.630
will be doing.

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:57.452
I'm like, oh, you love
error correction too.

00:13:57.452 --> 00:13:57.951
What?

00:13:57.951 --> 00:13:59.510
But this is absolute amazing.

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:01.060
And if you give it
to more than one

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.940
person everyone
gets the same answer

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:03.990
because you're using
the same pattern.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:05.490
So the difference
with text messages

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:09.262
is it's done more as a cube,
and the its coefficients

00:14:09.262 --> 00:14:11.470
or polynomials are done in
three different directions

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:12.750
across the cube to
get the same pattern.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:14.790
But it's exactly the
same logic behind this.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.560
And people are quite happy
that the can solve a Soduku.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.460
But yet, they think
it's astounding

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.760
that if there's an
error or information

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.980
is lost when they send a text
message that the phone can

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.550
recreate all the
missing information.

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:29.591
The same thing with Blu-rays
and everything else.

00:14:29.591 --> 00:14:32.410
And there's such
good error-correction

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:35.350
to Blu-ray discs, you can
get a drill bit, which

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:38.840
is about three or four
millimeters across-- so that's

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:44.250
some obscure fraction of an
inch-- and if you get that,

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:48.900
and if you get Blu-ray disc--
if you get someone else's

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.850
Blu-ray disk, you
can drill a hole

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:53.220
straight through the middle.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:53.600
Well, not straight
through the middle.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.400
There's already a whole there.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:54.900
Right?

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.270
You can just to the side,
you can drill a hole.

00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:00.340
And if the laser--
physics-- is good enough

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.580
in the Blu-ray, because
the main issue is cheap

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.510
Blu-ray players will lose
track of where they're up to.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:04.630
Right?

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:06.840
If it can keep track, it
can recreate all the missing

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.570
information that's
been drilled out.

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:12.200
And again, without these
maths, modern technology

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.500
simply wouldn't be possible.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.070
Oh, and I made this
one myself, by the way.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:16.130
I'm quite proud of this.

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:17.970
I wanted it to look
like and x, like

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.850
an algebraic-- tough crowd.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:22.560
Whoa.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.140
The top row are the digits in
the order they appear in pi.

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.280
There you go.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:29.420
So if you want a copy of
that, send me an email.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:30.630
And so I quite like that.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.810
It's kind of useful
maths-- like maths

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.782
you can actually
do something with.

00:15:35.782 --> 00:15:38.240
Well, actually I've got another
bit of fantastically useful

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.660
maths I'm going to teach
you, because I thought

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:41.960
I've got to show you something
you've not seen before.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.780
You've going to be
very disappointed.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.040
And you people work on encoding.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.350
You've been working on encoding
all day, and you come in here

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:47.475
and you're like, oh, great.

00:15:47.475 --> 00:15:49.400
This is my lunch break
doing error correction.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:49.900
Right?

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.270
So I'm going to show
you some useful maths

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:54.030
to save time in your
day to day life.

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:56.120
And to do that I brought
with me down here--

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.580
Actually, I'm going to go off
mic and yell for a second.

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:00.140
Can you all hear me?

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.021
Possibly even better
now that I've got-- OK.

00:16:02.021 --> 00:16:02.520
Right.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:05.890
So I've got down here a camera.

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:07.440
So this is on the floor here.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.460
I'm going to teach you
the mathematical way

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.320
to tie your shoes.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.040
And this will speed up
your life immensely.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.110
So can you all see?

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:16.950
Can you all see my shoe?

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:18.230
You get four of them.

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:19.860
That is-- Oh wow.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.310
This is like the world's
most surreal chorus line.

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:23.202
Look at that.

00:16:23.202 --> 00:16:24.094
Yeah!

00:16:24.094 --> 00:16:28.630
So if anyone comes in
late now just go with it.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:29.970
OK?

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:31.150
So here' what you do.

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:41.540
So normally when
people tie their shoes,

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.850
they get the laces in like
a little foundation knot,

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:45.516
and they get these
and they do all sorts

00:16:45.516 --> 00:16:47.720
of moving them around and
mashing them together.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:52.140
What you can actually do, if
you just hold the two places

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.190
and passed them
across each other,

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:56.900
they will tie themselves.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:57.400
OK.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.816
You again, keeping
your excitement

00:16:58.816 --> 00:17:00.640
at a nice, manageable level.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:01.140
OK.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:01.690
What do you watch?

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:03.398
Actually, is there a
delay on the camera?

00:17:03.398 --> 00:17:04.400
Can I?

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.051
I bet I can tie this and
then watch myself tie it.

00:17:07.051 --> 00:17:07.550
Ready?

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:08.130
Here we go.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:08.550
Ready?

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:08.710
OK.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:09.210
Read.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:12.230
So I'm just holding
the laces, and tied.

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:13.600
Close.

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.941
I'll bet you never tried
this, because normally I

00:17:17.941 --> 00:17:19.359
do this for school kids,
and normally they're

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:20.940
sitting fire to
something by now.

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.359
Would you like to try it?

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:27.400
If you've got to shoe, choose
your favorite, undo the laces,

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.700
and I will actually
teach you how to do this.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.735
So you do that little
foundation knot there.

00:17:31.735 --> 00:17:33.530
So you've all got that.

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:37.040
Take the shoelace on
the right and curve it

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.555
so it goes up and forward,
and you hold on the way down.

00:17:40.555 --> 00:17:42.340
So it goes up in a
loop and then down.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.550
You're holding on the
descending part of the loop.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.190
The other side is the same
thing, but it curls back,

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:49.590
and you hold it on the
descending part of the loop.

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:51.700
And then all you
have to do is pass

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:55.370
the bitch you're holding
under the other loop,

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:57.170
swap hands, and pull.

00:18:01.114 --> 00:18:02.593
AUDIENCE: Whoa!

00:18:02.593 --> 00:18:04.510
MATT PARKER: Oh.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:05.010
One.

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:05.600
OK.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.710
That's-- We've
been through there.

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:10.320
Don't patronize me a bit.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.390
So if you practice that,
you can save literally

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:16.981
ones of seconds of your
life on a daily basis.

00:18:16.981 --> 00:18:17.480
Right?

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.020
And it's exactly the same
knot that you end up with.

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:22.850
So mathematically,
that is the same knot.

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:25.410
And a lot of people
don't appreciate

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.810
that there's a whole area
of maths about knots.

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:29.430
There's knot theory.

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:31.470
Best name of a theory ever.

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:34.610
And so people are
know theorists.

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:35.930
Are you a theorist?

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:37.490
I am knot theorist.

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:40.690
So knot theorists look at the
maths behind different knots.

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:43.670
And as humans we know
dangerously little about knots.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.240
It's a reasonably new
area of mathematics.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.750
Well, it kicked
off in the 1800s.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:52.460
But today we still haven't got
a great understanding of knots,

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:53.190
in general.

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:56.250
And, in fact, I put a picture
of one knot in my book.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:57.500
I've got a shot of it up here.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:01.030
We still do not know the
best way to undo this knot.

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:02.720
This is called the
1011 knot if you

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.200
want to look it up afterwards.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.360
And when you do a
knot diagram, you

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.080
leave a gap when
it goes underneath.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.300
These are not just
joint bits of string.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.370
This is where it goes
underneath there.

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:14.980
And to undo a knot
mathematically,

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:16.910
you do sort of a
crossing switch.

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:18.641
So you would cut one
bit of the string,

00:19:18.641 --> 00:19:20.890
move it around another one,
and join it back up again.

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:23.870
So you take it from one side to
the other side and rejoin it.

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:28.180
And we know this not can
be undone in three crossing

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:32.180
switches, but no one's
found a way to do it in two,

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.510
and likewise, know one's managed
to prove that there isn't a way

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:37.034
to do it in two.

00:19:37.034 --> 00:19:38.700
This is an open
question in mathematics.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.050
This is, in fact,
the most simple knot

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:42.850
for which we do not understand.

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:46.110
At for the vast majority of
knots above it we have no idea.

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:50.230
And so my theory is, if enough
people make this out of string

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:53.050
and try it, sooner
or later, if there's

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:56.510
a way to do it-- for a very
generous definition of sooner

00:19:56.510 --> 00:20:00.060
or later possibly-- we will come
across how it can be undone.

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.350
And at that point fame
and mathematical fortune

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:07.374
is yours, for a very narrow
definition of fame and fortune.

00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:09.540
So, dude if you can try and
make that out of string,

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:10.100
you look it up online.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:11.170
It's the 1011 knot.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:12.920
If you do find a way
to do it let me know.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.870
Photograph yourself
pointing at the bit

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:16.690
where you're going to make
the crossing switches first.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:17.315
Then make them.

00:20:17.315 --> 00:20:19.450
If it untangles, we'll
know what you actually did.

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:20.908
Because if it
happens and you don't

00:20:20.908 --> 00:20:23.510
know how it was arranged--
because in this arrangement

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:24.209
it won't work.

00:20:24.209 --> 00:20:26.000
We've tried everything
in this arrangement.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.458
You have to make it that way,
pick it up, jumble it around,

00:20:28.458 --> 00:20:30.860
put it down a different way,
make two crossings switches,

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:32.399
see if it untangles itself.

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:34.190
And actually, it's
really important that we

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:36.270
know how to do this,
because at the moment

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:39.010
bacteria is better
at undoing knots

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:41.790
than humans, which is
a little bit worrying.

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.030
Because when bacteria
reproduces-- in fact,

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:45.980
same thing happens
with most cells,

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:50.430
and human included-- the DNA
gets tangled and knotted.

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:52.730
And so some bacteria
have circular DNA,

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:54.430
gets very knotted
when they reproduce.

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:56.960
And there are enzymes
which go around and perform

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.630
crossing switches
exactly like that.

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:01.430
They will snip one bit of DNA,
move it around another one,

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:02.580
and rejoin it.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.600
And they do that
very efficiently

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:05.530
to untangle the DNA.

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:09.090
And if they can't do that,
the bacteria can't reproduce.

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:11.490
And so knot theorists
from the maths department

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:14.410
are working with biologists
to try and work out

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:16.861
what the bacteria is doing,
why it's better than us,

00:21:16.861 --> 00:21:19.110
and if we get a better
understanding of both what it's

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:21.620
doing and how to undo
knots in general, that

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:23.530
could be a new wave
of antibiotics.

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:26.310
If we have a way to
impede or stop bacteria

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:28.170
from unknotting
its DNA, then we'll

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:29.670
be able to stop it
from reproducing.

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:31.044
And so I think
it's very exciting

00:21:31.044 --> 00:21:35.150
that a future wave of new
medicine, the new therapies,

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:38.270
can come about because knot
theory, which was started

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:41.300
initially by physicists
trying to understand a string

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:44.047
theory of matter is
what first kicked off,

00:21:44.047 --> 00:21:46.630
but then mathematicians took it
on because it was kind of fun.

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:48.671
And it could be saving
lives in the future, which

00:21:48.671 --> 00:21:50.510
I think is absolutely fantastic.

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:55.200
So I've got two--
actually, you know what?

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.930
Let's do three
things, and then I'll

00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:00.339
wrap up for questions, because
I've got a new toy that I'm

00:22:00.339 --> 00:22:01.630
going to show you very quickly.

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:03.930
And I've put it in my bag here.

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:06.140
I wasn't originally
going to talk about this,

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:08.811
but while I'm here, I
made this two days ago,

00:22:08.811 --> 00:22:10.060
and I'm very excited about it.

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:13.500
What I did was I bought a
brass disk off the internet.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.350
I bought this.

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:17.840
I'm sure I used a Google
service or another.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.310
And so it definitely
wasn't from Amazon.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:24.670
And then what I've done is I've
put a small notch in the disk.

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:28.230
And that notch is 14 and
1/2 percent of the diameter.

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:31.900
Or it's 29% of the radius.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:37.240
Or it's 2 minus root 2 on 2%
of the radius to be specific.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.390
And the reason I've done that
is if you do it to two disks--

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:43.190
So a circle rolls
because as it rotates

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:45.460
the center of mass stays
at exactly the same height.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.530
Very, very handy.

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:48.780
But if you get two
disks and you intersect

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.265
them like this at
right angles-- and I

00:22:51.265 --> 00:22:54.120
made those notches so the
centers of the two disks

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.560
are now root 2 apart
compared to the radius.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:00.060
So if you've got one
unit is the radius,

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:02.450
that's root 2-- the distance
between the two disks.

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:06.240
So what it means is as this
rotates on a flat surface,

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:10.240
the center of mass stays
at exactly the same level.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.620
And I haven't got a
flat surface here.

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.170
I'm going to try it over here.

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:15.670
I checked.

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:17.970
My cable's not long enough
to get the camera over there.

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:20.220
But I'm going to try on this
bench, if you don't mind.

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:25.330
So if I put it there, if I give
that a bump, the center of mass

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.210
stays at exactly
the same height.

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:29.709
And if you want to kick that
back in the opposite direction.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:33.320
It's optional.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.010
Feel free to join in.

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:34.170
OK.

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:34.680
Look at that.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.304
It's all right.

00:23:35.304 --> 00:23:38.310
So the center of mass
is going side to side.

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:40.720
It's not even a sin wave
going backwards and forwards.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.770
It's a quite complicated wave.

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:44.920
It's a combination
of different curves.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.970
But in terms of its
height above the surface,

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:48.340
it stays perfectly flat.

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:52.352
And you can prove that for two
main locations using nothing

00:23:52.352 --> 00:23:53.810
more complicated
than Pythagorean's

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:54.960
System of Triangles.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:58.240
So I shall challenge for
when you should be working,

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:02.150
use some of your 10%
time to calculate

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:05.320
why the center of mass for
that one, because what you do

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.607
is the shoe in the center
of mass is the same height,

00:24:07.607 --> 00:24:09.690
and it would drop out, and
the center of the disks

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:11.050
has to be root 2 a part.

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:13.110
That's the easiest
way to go about it.

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:14.510
And using the Pythagorean's
System of Triangles

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:15.310
you can show that.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:16.280
I will leave it up there.

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.695
And if you want to
have a play with it

00:24:17.695 --> 00:24:19.330
afterwards you can roll
it backwards and forwards

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:19.830
on there.

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:22.539
Or you can make
your own out of CDs,

00:24:22.539 --> 00:24:24.580
which you might have in
some of the display cases

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:27.000
with technology from the past.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.970
Or make your own circles.

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:30.660
You can get those to
roll quite nicely.

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.157
It's kind of fun.

00:24:32.157 --> 00:24:33.990
So the last two things
I'm going to show you

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:37.854
is a ridiculous project that
I did a couple of years ago.

00:24:37.854 --> 00:24:40.020
And I'm going to finish by
showing you the Christmas

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:44.012
present that my mom gave me two
years ago, which is relevant.

00:24:44.012 --> 00:24:45.970
It's not just like, hey,
check out this jumper.

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:46.470
Right?

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:47.710
It's a proper maths thing.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:50.020
But before I get that, this
is a ridiculous project

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.180
I did a couple of
years ago where

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:56.510
I was trying to explain the
way that logic circuits work.

00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:59.400
And to try to explain circuitry
to people in general I

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.695
decide to use dominoes.

00:25:00.695 --> 00:25:02.153
Because what I've
done here is I've

00:25:02.153 --> 00:25:03.800
set up a chain of dominoes.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.150
And the great thing about
a set up of dominoes

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:07.108
is you can send the
information along dominoes,

00:25:07.108 --> 00:25:10.070
because if you put
a signal in one end,

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:11.730
that signal will
move along the chain

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:13.170
and come out the other end.

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:14.340
And so you could use this.

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:15.340
This could be practical.

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:19.470
So if your doorbell
has broken, you

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:21.115
could have a long
chain of dominoes.

00:25:21.115 --> 00:25:22.490
So you've got at
sign at the door

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:23.947
that says please bump domino.

00:25:23.947 --> 00:25:25.780
And that goes all the
way through your house

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:26.890
into the living room.

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:28.360
And a few of the other
dominoes fall over.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.410
You go, oh, there's
someone at the door.

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:29.600
Right?

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.933
And they're sending information.

00:25:30.933 --> 00:25:32.730
Not hugely efficient,
but it would work.

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:34.271
And you can get far
more complicated.

00:25:34.271 --> 00:25:37.310
So instead of just sending
one little bit of information,

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:40.080
you can have a network
that interacts.

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.030
So now I've got two inputs
and a single output.

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:46.840
And this is step so
you have to bump over

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:50.080
both inputs for the
output to go over.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.000
If you bump over
either one separately

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.250
it won't make it all the
way through the circuit.

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:55.950
And so if you want
more information

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:59.809
about who's at the door-- so
let's say you order a pizza,

00:25:59.809 --> 00:26:02.350
and you've got one thing that
says bump this domino if you're

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:04.110
here, and another
one that says bump

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:05.900
this domino if you have a pizza.

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.320
And only if there's someone
there with a pizza will

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.420
the signal get all
the way through.

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:11.628
And I can show you this
working, because what happens

00:26:11.628 --> 00:26:16.224
is this one by itself blocks
itself from getting through.

00:26:16.224 --> 00:26:17.890
Whereas if you've
bump that one as well,

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:20.586
it would have stopped this
one from stopping itself

00:26:20.586 --> 00:26:22.210
and the signal would
have gone through.

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:25.970
And for this, I like to consider
knocking a domino over as a one

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:28.010
and it standing up as a zero.

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:30.240
And so you can see I've
got a table in the corner.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.615
I'll make it a
little bit bigger.

00:26:31.615 --> 00:26:34.250
So for completeness, this
is the complete setup

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:35.461
for that circuit.

00:26:35.461 --> 00:26:35.960
Right?

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:39.760
We can still think of
this in terms of pizza.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:40.630
So zero and zero.

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:43.616
No one's at the door and
they haven't got a pizza,

00:26:43.616 --> 00:26:44.740
and so nothing will happen.

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.262
This is there's
someone at the door

00:26:46.262 --> 00:26:47.470
and they haven't got a pizza.

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:49.160
That won't get through.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:49.660
OK.

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:54.910
For completeness, somehow a
pizza has arrived at the door

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:58.910
and has managed to read the
sign and bump the appropriate.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:02.520
So should there be
a self-aware pizza,

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.437
this is what will happen.

00:27:04.437 --> 00:27:06.145
The signal, thank god,
won't get through.

00:27:06.145 --> 00:27:07.380
All right?

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.364
Because that is a
horrifying experience.

00:27:09.364 --> 00:27:11.280
And then here we had the
person with the pizza

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:12.120
and the signal gets through.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.270
And this is an AND gate.

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:14.780
So if you've done
logic gates, this

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:16.520
is an AND gate made
out of dominoes.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.670
We can do even better.

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:20.110
This is the exclusive OR
gate where the signal only

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:22.410
gets through if you bump
over one and the other one,

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:23.230
but not both.

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:25.280
So that's the exclusive
bit-- one or the other,

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.430
not both simultaneously.

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:27.887
There it is made
out of dominoes.

00:27:27.887 --> 00:27:29.720
If you've got 100
dominoes and you're bored,

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:30.320
you can make these.

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.236
It's about 100 dominoes
to put these together.

00:27:32.236 --> 00:27:34.370
And what happens now is
you hit them both together,

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:36.190
they collide in the
middle and stop.

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:37.934
But if you hit either
one separately,

00:27:37.934 --> 00:27:39.850
it will travel through
and out the other side.

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:42.058
So they stop and annihilate,
where as one, by itself,

00:27:42.058 --> 00:27:44.520
would've carried on and out.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:49.911
Now at this point, a few
of you are thinking, why?

00:27:49.911 --> 00:27:50.940
Why would you do?

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.630
You know where I'm
going with this.

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:53.130
Right?

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:54.879
And if you know where
I'm going with this,

00:27:54.879 --> 00:27:59.139
my only advice is for
now just remain calm.

00:27:59.139 --> 00:28:00.930
Because we have a long
way to go with this.

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:01.430
Right?

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:04.130
Because what you can do
now is get to a circuit

00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:06.114
where it shows both
simultaneously.

00:28:06.114 --> 00:28:08.655
If you have two inputs and two
outputs and one's the AND gate

00:28:08.655 --> 00:28:10.610
and one's the exclusive
OR gate, you've

00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:13.339
got a circuit which counts
the number of inputs

00:28:13.339 --> 00:28:14.255
that have been bumped.

00:28:14.255 --> 00:28:17.140
So this is a very
basic calculator.

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.840
So if you think of the
outputs as a binary number--

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.440
the exclusive order to the
units, the AND as the twos--

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.560
and then it tells
you how many inputs

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.950
were bumped as a binary readout.

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:30.590
So this can count in binary.

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:33.490
And to make one you need
200 to 300 dominoes.

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:35.700
It looks a little bit like this.

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:38.235
And so this has two
circuits coming in.

00:28:38.235 --> 00:28:40.360
It's basically exclusive
OR but with an extra block

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:41.090
on the side.

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:43.390
This is a delayed circuit
to give this long enough

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:45.520
to run, you slow
down this signal

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:47.163
so it doesn't get
there ahead of time.

00:28:47.163 --> 00:28:49.204
So there's a few timing
issues with this circuit,

00:28:49.204 --> 00:28:50.110
but it can be made.

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:52.530
And a few of you
are thinking, well,

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.620
if you've got this
far, what you really

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.941
want is-- this is
the full adder.

00:28:57.941 --> 00:28:58.440
Yes!

00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:58.939
Right!

00:28:58.939 --> 00:29:01.170
So try not to skip ahead to
the punchline without me.

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:01.670
All right?

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:03.280
So this is the full adder.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.769
So you can do any arithmetic
you want with a full adder,

00:29:05.769 --> 00:29:07.810
because you've got the
two numbers you're adding,

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:10.224
you've got a carry from
any previous calculation,

00:29:10.224 --> 00:29:12.640
you've got the carry out that
flows on to the next column,

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.730
and you've got the
right out, which

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:14.855
is the output you're doing.

00:29:14.855 --> 00:29:17.510
And so if you can
make a full adder,

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:19.780
you're effectively
counting any free inputs

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:21.347
and getting the two digit out.

00:29:21.347 --> 00:29:23.430
Now unfortunately, at this
point, I worked it out.

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:26.720
To build one of these would
take about 1,000 dominoes,

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.312
and it would look like that.

00:29:28.312 --> 00:29:30.160
[LAUGHING]

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:35.350
So this is me at the
Manchester University.

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:36.850
This is the maths
floor-- very flat.

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:38.058
We managed to sneak in there.

00:29:38.058 --> 00:29:41.130
We have 1,000 dominoes, and
we built a working full adder

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:42.300
out of dominoes.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.709
And so again the problem was
slowing down the signals.

00:29:44.709 --> 00:29:46.500
You've got a lot of
synchronization issues.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:47.660
But we got to slowing
the right ones

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:48.210
and sending the other ones.

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:50.480
Slowly the whole thing
worked really well.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.660
And then we were like,
well, this is brilliant.

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.550
And some of you know if
you chain these in a row--

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:59.160
if you have adders in row, you
can add numbers of any size.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.030
So if you had three
of these in a row,

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:03.770
you could add two
three-digit binary numbers

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:05.720
and get a four-digit
binary output.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.892
But that would take
10,000 dominoes,

00:30:08.892 --> 00:30:10.670
and it would look like this.

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:17.850
So I now own 10,000 dominoes.

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:20.940
So this took us a whole day.

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.720
It took 10 of us, or 12 people.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.520
We were rotating in shifts.

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:25.150
Oh my god.

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:26.581
This is nerve-wracking work.

00:30:26.581 --> 00:30:27.080
Right?

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.760
And so we managed
to build a circuit

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.470
with 10,000
dominoes, which would

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:33.685
add two three-digit
binary numbers

00:30:33.685 --> 00:30:35.060
and give you a
four-digit output.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:37.000
So this is a working
computer circuit.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.560
This is an actual computer.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.700
I mean, the display
resolution is terrible.

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.530
But it does actually
work as a computer.

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:45.860
And we ran it and it worked.

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.150
We were able to add
two three-digit numbers

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:48.316
and got a four-digit output.

00:30:48.316 --> 00:30:51.030
And we had the museum-- this is
Museum of Science and Industry

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:52.100
in Manchester.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.610
Brilliantly-- you can't
see it in this shot--

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:58.500
we are directly in front of
the rebuild of the first baby

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.780
computer that Alan
Turing worked on.

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:01.890
So it was behind us.

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:05.190
I could see the vacuum tubes and
everything of the original baby

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:05.850
computer.

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:08.310
And I was allowed once
to have a play on it.

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:10.660
And it's so cool,
because the memory--

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.370
the input for the memory
is a board of buttons.

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:16.070
And literally each one
corresponds to a bit.

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:17.610
And so you enter
the ones you want.

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:18.630
That ones to be a one.

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:19.350
That one's a one.

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:21.240
And so you enter the ones that
you want to switch to ones

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:21.980
and hit go.

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:24.000
Nominal piece of kit.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.010
And I got to meet
Alan Turing last ever

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:28.980
student who worked with
him on that machine.

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:30.992
And so he told me
stories about Turing

00:31:30.992 --> 00:31:33.450
where the operating system that
ran the version after that.

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:34.460
Absolutely incredible.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:36.170
Happy to chat about that.

00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:38.090
Oh, and by the way. "The
Imitation Game" film,

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:38.831
not that bad.

00:31:38.831 --> 00:31:39.330
Pretty good.

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:39.830
Pretty good.

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:41.850
The mass is-- I mean,
it was very brave.

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:44.490
The first half an hour
is Cumberbatch describing

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:46.810
how you prove the existence
of uncomputable numbers.

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:48.891
So I was very impressed.

00:31:48.891 --> 00:31:49.390
It's not.

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:51.897
He just looks
handsome and smolders.

00:31:51.897 --> 00:31:53.980
But if you want to talk
Turing, see me after this.

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:55.700
So anyway, so we
got to build this

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:57.420
in Manchester, which
I was so pleased.

00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:58.940
And we did it on the
first day, and it worked.

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:00.070
At we had a backup day.

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:02.010
And we're like, well,
let's not waste this,

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:04.890
because we could have
two four-digit inputs

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:06.501
and get a five-digit readout.

00:32:06.501 --> 00:32:07.000
Right?

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:07.920
And we did that.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.400
But it didn't work.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.950
Two things went wrong.

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:13.050
Because we didn't
have any more space

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:15.290
because we had the same
section of the museum kind of

00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:16.180
sectioned off.

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:17.810
And we didn't have
anymore dominoes.

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:19.235
So we had to make it
more dense, and we

00:32:19.235 --> 00:32:20.370
had to make it more efficient.

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:21.770
So we have to cut
back on the timing,

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:23.603
and we had to have the
rows closer together.

00:32:23.603 --> 00:32:25.284
And two things went
horribly wrong.

00:32:25.284 --> 00:32:26.200
The first one is here.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.540
We had cross torque.

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:31.370
We had signal bleed from one
row of dominoes onto another.

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:34.550
So if you watch, this one
here should not fall over.

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:35.837
That domino should stay up.

00:32:35.837 --> 00:32:38.170
But if you watch as the other
chain comes through-- here

00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:42.124
it comes-- as the other one
comes through, it-- here it

00:32:42.124 --> 00:32:42.880
comes.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:43.758
Here we go.

00:32:43.758 --> 00:32:45.710
Look at that!

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:51.626
And, in slow motion,
here it comes.

00:32:51.626 --> 00:32:54.000
No!

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.340
So that gave us an extra
output we didn't want.

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:58.798
So that ran through and tripped
what should have been zero,

00:32:58.798 --> 00:33:00.160
and the answer became a one.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.420
And the other one was here.

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:02.920
OK.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.090
So let me should you
what happens right here.

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:07.000
If you watch that
row of dominoes,

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.390
it is going to carry
along to this output here.

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:14.530
But this one should get their
first and, bam, stop it.

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:15.170
Right?

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:16.400
I've been watching a
lot of American football

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.580
while I've been over.

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:20.390
And so, bam, it
should stop it there.

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:22.510
So this signal stops.

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:25.590
It closes this gate before
that signal gets there.

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:27.340
Unfortunately it didn't work.

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:29.290
If I show it to
you in slow motion,

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:31.200
is this one so going
to get there first.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.779
So going to get there first.

00:33:32.779 --> 00:33:33.320
Look at that.

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:33.730
Here it is.

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:34.313
Here it comes.

00:33:34.313 --> 00:33:34.930
Coming in.

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:38.960
It's going to close
that gate, and-- Ah!

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.600
Two dominoes off.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:44.560
But at least it went
wrong in interesting ways.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.270
If it had just been
bumped by accident

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:47.770
that would have
been very upsetting,

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:49.927
but it went wrong
in sightful ways

00:33:49.927 --> 00:33:51.510
as to what happens
in actual circuits.

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:53.420
Because that was a
synchronization issue.

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:55.865
So I was so please with
the way that worked out.

00:33:55.865 --> 00:33:57.240
Well, actually
the last project I

00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:00.700
did was a collaborative
project using different museums

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:03.960
around the world, and
we use Google Hangouts.

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.950
We used a live
feature on Hangouts

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:08.712
to link between different
build sites around the world.

00:34:08.712 --> 00:34:10.170
So I was in
Manchester, and I could

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:11.570
talk to people who
were working in Finland

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:12.486
and Canada and the US.

00:34:12.486 --> 00:34:15.199
And the fractal, we're
building a mega menja,

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:17.901
the one that is at MoMA, Museum
of Science and Industry, here.

00:34:17.901 --> 00:34:19.400
So if you want to
go and look at it,

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.524
it's an amazing fractal
thing they've put together.

00:34:21.524 --> 00:34:24.289
And it was great that
we could use Hangouts.

00:34:24.289 --> 00:34:25.705
People could watch
at home, and we

00:34:25.705 --> 00:34:26.810
could cut between the
different builds sites.

00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:27.489
Absolutely brilliant.

00:34:27.489 --> 00:34:27.800
Anyway.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.224
The last thing I'm
going to show you,

00:34:29.224 --> 00:34:30.599
and then we'll do
questions, is I

00:34:30.599 --> 00:34:32.590
brought the Christmas
present my mom made me.

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:33.780
I've got it right here.

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.149
And so I'll bring
up my-- is that my?

00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:36.940
It looks like-- OK.

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:37.440
Here we go.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.530
So you should have seen
my giddy face on Christmas

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:45.889
morning when unwrapped a knitted
scarf made entirely out of ones

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:47.389
and zeroes.

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:50.373
I had no idea she was
doing this behind my back.

00:34:50.373 --> 00:34:51.664
And she went and she made this.

00:34:51.664 --> 00:34:52.747
I was like that's amazing.

00:34:52.747 --> 00:34:54.989
And when I saw it
initially, I thought

00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:56.949
they were just random
ones and zeroes.

00:34:56.949 --> 00:34:58.575
And so then I went,
well, hang on.

00:34:58.575 --> 00:34:59.380
Hang on.

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:02.271
Every single row
starts zero, one, zero.

00:35:02.271 --> 00:35:02.770
Right?

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:04.210
And so that means
every single row

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:07.615
is an upper case
letter in Unicode,

00:35:07.615 --> 00:35:10.150
because my mom knits the
way she text messages.

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:13.000
Right?

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.260
Old habits die hard.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:15.460
Huh?

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:16.840
And so I was like,
well, I've got

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.010
to look work out what it says.

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:18.890
This is Christmas morning.

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:19.950
I was like this is brilliant.

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:21.616
So I got the back of
the wrapping paper.

00:35:21.616 --> 00:35:23.092
I got my pen out.

00:35:23.092 --> 00:35:24.484
What a Christmas morning.

00:35:24.484 --> 00:35:26.900
I get to sit around with the
family and decode my present.

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:27.400
Right?

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.550
And if you actually go
through and work it out-- oh,

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:34.260
I'm now fluent in binary,
by the way, of course.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.910
Because when people get me
to sign their book, I can say

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:40.620
do you want that in normal
characters or in ASCII?

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:42.682
And so I can do people's
names in binary.

00:35:42.682 --> 00:35:44.140
If you're bored
afterwards, come up

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:45.660
and I'll put your
name in in binary.

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:49.150
And I suspect most of you
would then go and fact

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:50.830
check that very quickly.

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:52.644
And so anyway I was
able to work it out.

00:35:52.644 --> 00:35:53.810
My mom found a quote for me.

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:55.310
She found [INAUDIBLE]
for a website.

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:58.120
So it says, "Maths is fun.

00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.650
Keep doing maths."

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:02.600
Except it doesn't.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:05.440
When I actually decoded it,
she swapped a one with a zero.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.790
There's a mistake part way down.

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:09.700
And so it was right on the end.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:15.470
It turned a u into a v. A so it
actually says, "Maths is fvn.

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:16.338
Keep doing maths."

00:36:16.338 --> 00:36:18.730
I was like, oh, mom.

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:23.120
I hate to ruin your fvn,
but, you have swapped a one

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.710
with a zero, and
she was very upset.

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:26.670
Because she is quite
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:28.560
And I was like,
well, actually mom--

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.476
because she wanted to
take it back and fix it.

00:36:30.476 --> 00:36:31.930
She wanted to undo
and replace it.

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:32.070
I said no, no, no.

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:33.560
The thing is you don't
have to do that actually,

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.490
because to make the
scarf long enough

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:37.550
she knit the same
message four times.

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:39.520
So it repeats, front,
back, front, back.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.035
And she only made a
mistake in one of those.

00:36:42.035 --> 00:36:44.810
So what is means
is all I have to do

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:49.127
is calculate the average value
across all four versions,

00:36:49.127 --> 00:36:50.960
and they gives you back
the original message

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.120
without the mistake.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.470
And so today, ladies and
gentlemen of Google, I

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:59.808
can present to you the world's
first error-correcting scarf.

00:36:59.808 --> 00:37:02.103
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:02.103 --> 00:37:06.220
If you would like
to meet the scarf,

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.550
I will leave it at the front.

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:09.750
It does also sign autographs.

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:11.940
You have to hold it
with the pen yourself.

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:13.040
So you're coming to
get a photo of you

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:13.990
wearing the scarf, that's fine.

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.530
I will leave that here.

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:16.970
You can come and check the
code to make sure it all works.

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:19.430
Otherwise, I will be loitering
until I get kicked out

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:20.380
or people have to
go back to work.

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:21.755
If you want me to
come and deface

00:37:21.755 --> 00:37:24.120
your book so it
lowers resale value,

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:27.024
I'm more than happy to do that
or answer any other questions.

00:37:27.024 --> 00:37:28.940
If I've mentioned something
and you've missed,

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:33.060
or you want to copy of all the
circuit diagrams for the domino

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:34.820
computer are in the book.

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:37.160
And originally they were like,
I put them in, in my head

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.540
and looked at it and went, OK.

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:39.426
You're not having it.

00:37:39.426 --> 00:37:40.300
They're not going in.

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:40.954
Oh, OK.

00:37:40.954 --> 00:37:42.120
It happened to a few things.

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:45.170
I said, tell you what,
would I be allowed answers

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:46.680
at the back of the book?

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:47.811
And they were like sure.

00:37:47.811 --> 00:37:48.310
Brilliant.

00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:48.810
Right?

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:50.770
So seriously a massive
chunk of the book

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:52.260
is answers at the back.

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:55.100
And so the circuit diagrams
to the dominoes are in there.

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:56.865
But if you could send me an
email of anything else you want

00:37:56.865 --> 00:37:58.180
a copy of or I've
mentioned something

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:00.096
and didn't go into enough
detail, let me know.

00:38:00.096 --> 00:38:01.521
But on that note, I've finished.

00:38:01.521 --> 00:38:03.520
I'd like to thank Allen
very much for organizing

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:04.020
all of this.

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:05.570
It has been fantastic coming in.

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:07.260
Thank you all very much
for listening so well.

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:07.760
Cheers.

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:11.076
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:14.415 --> 00:38:15.900
Oh, we have to Q and A. Right.

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:21.272
So-- He had that look of
you're not finished yet.

00:38:21.272 --> 00:38:22.730
I know you got the
free lunch first

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:24.690
but now you've got to earn it.

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:26.740
So any questions people
would like to ask?

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:28.730
If you can't get to the
mic, I will repeat them

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:32.070
for the sake of the recordings
so the end up apparently

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:32.811
encoded.

00:38:32.811 --> 00:38:34.310
But if anyone would
like to come up,

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:37.265
you can ask questions
from the center.

00:38:37.265 --> 00:38:38.890
If you're bringing
your laptop with you

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:41.450
it's going to be
quite the question.

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:44.514
I simulated this and frankly.

00:38:44.514 --> 00:38:46.180
AUDIENCE: While writing
the book, what's

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:49.690
the most amazing thing that you
learned that you didn't already

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:52.794
know, and that fascinated you
as a problem and the solution.

00:38:52.794 --> 00:38:53.460
MATT PARKER: Oh.

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:54.220
That is a very good question.

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:55.900
So writing the book
what was the thing

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.740
I learned that was
the most surprising?

00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:59.520
There's a few bits
in there where

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.890
I found new examples
of types of numbers,

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:05.974
because I've been learning
Python as a hobby.

00:39:05.974 --> 00:39:07.390
So I had to program
at University,

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:08.140
and I hadn't done it for years.

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:09.973
There was a few bits
where I ran simulations

00:39:09.973 --> 00:39:11.955
to find ridiculous numbers.

00:39:11.955 --> 00:39:13.830
Some of those were kind
of fun, but I kind of

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:14.730
knew they would be out there.

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:16.938
If I ran the code they would
show up sooner or later.

00:39:16.938 --> 00:39:19.312
What I really found amazing
was because the book,

00:39:19.312 --> 00:39:21.270
the conceit is it's about
the fourth dimension.

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:23.930
There are huge sections
about 4D shapes.

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:28.030
And in 3D-- I knew this before,
but I've never actually looked

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:30.389
into it-- in 3D you get
with the platonic solids.

00:39:30.389 --> 00:39:31.930
If you've not come
across these, they

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:33.305
are very, very
regular 3D shapes.

00:39:33.305 --> 00:39:35.721
All the faces are the same,
all the vertices are the same,

00:39:35.721 --> 00:39:36.560
edges are the same.

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.590
And there's famously
five of them.

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:42.540
So there's the tetrahedron,
octahedron, cube, icosahedron,

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:46.150
and dodecahedron, in a
random order I just made up.

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:49.500
And in 4D there's another one.

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:53.130
So you get the 4D equivalence
of the fine standard platonic

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:53.630
solids.

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:55.890
There's another one that
I call the hyper-diamond.

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:59.770
It's the 4D equivalent of
a rhombic dodecahedron.

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:04.110
But it is a platonic solid
in 4D, and it's not in 3D,

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:05.240
and it's not again in 5D.

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.350
It breaks again in 5D.

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:08.450
It only works in
four dimensions.

00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:11.755
And so visualizing it-- I try
to find a way to visualize it.

00:40:11.755 --> 00:40:16.020
And in 3D a rhombic
dodecahedron is

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:19.870
what happens if you get a solid
cube and turn it inside out.

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:22.931
So if you imagine six
square-based pyramids

00:40:22.931 --> 00:40:24.680
and flipped them all
around the other way,

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.100
you get a rhombic dodecahedron.

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:27.849
The same thing happens
in four dimensions.

00:40:27.849 --> 00:40:31.640
If you get a 4D tessaract--
a 4D cube and-- Oh,

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.530
if anyone's, I don't want to
ruin-- you know spoiler alert--

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:36.455
"Interstellar" they
mention tesseract.

00:40:36.455 --> 00:40:37.912
I was like, yes.

00:40:37.912 --> 00:40:39.440
Oh, and by the
way, I can confirm,

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:42.800
the fifth dimension is love.

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:45.940
And so the same thing happens if
you turn a 4D cube inside out,

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:47.075
you get the hyper-diamond.

00:40:47.075 --> 00:40:47.950
Absolutely brilliant.

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:49.408
And then, in case
you're wondering,

00:40:49.408 --> 00:40:51.040
5D is any three-point solids.

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:53.120
And that's every
dimension above that-- 60,

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:56.570
70, as long as you go,
you'll only ever always

00:40:56.570 --> 00:41:01.210
get the cube, the tetrahedron,
and the octahedron repeat

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:01.889
all the way up.

00:41:01.889 --> 00:41:03.930
And then the other ones
you never see them again.

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:05.390
And so there's this
fantastic flare

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:07.785
up of shapes in kind of three
and four dimensions that

00:41:07.785 --> 00:41:08.660
doesn't happen again.

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:11.660
I think that was fascinating.

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:13.210
Further answers will be shorter.

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:13.710
Yes?

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:15.168
AUDIENCE: Can you
tell us some more

00:41:15.168 --> 00:41:16.955
about the testing
of the calculator?

00:41:16.955 --> 00:41:19.609
Like did someone accidentally
hit a domino down?

00:41:19.609 --> 00:41:20.400
Did you try it out?

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.090
If something goes wrong, can
you reset the whole thing?

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:23.220
How long did all that take?

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:23.460
MATT PARKER: OK.

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:24.950
So the question
was can you tell us

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:27.815
more about testing
the domino calculator,

00:41:27.815 --> 00:41:31.280
and could you relive some of
those horrifying experiences?

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:34.930
So to this day the sound of
domino toppling on concrete

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:37.070
breaks me out in a cold sweat.

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:39.970
So originally I bought a
box of about 100 domino.

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:41.905
I'd seen a YouTube video
of someone trying it.

00:41:41.905 --> 00:41:43.030
And they'd kind of cheated.

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:44.670
They'd taped dominoes together.

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:47.040
And they were doing
the AND gate, I think.

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.770
Well, surely you
can do a half adder.

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:49.555
So I bought a couple hundred.

00:41:49.555 --> 00:41:50.450
And it kind of worked.

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:51.575
And then I went, all right.

00:41:51.575 --> 00:41:54.130
And so I bought 2,000.

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:59.150
And then we had the concrete
floor at the University.

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:02.661
And we wanted to know first
of all is it reliable enough?

00:42:02.661 --> 00:42:05.160
We were really worried about
if it would be reliable enough.

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.770
And can it be built fast enough?

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:07.990
Because if we couldn't
actually build that thing

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.990
it wasn't going to work.

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:11.880
And the big problem was having
the junctions work routinely.

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:14.040
And a very good
mathematician Sean,

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:17.430
she came up with-- we called
it the Juncsean, which

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:20.830
was a reliable way of building
the junction, and it was very,

00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:24.280
very, if you did it exactly the
right way, it works every time.

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:25.280
It was very robust.

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.220
And so we built a
stencil of that.

00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:30.017
And we chalked on
all those junctions

00:42:30.017 --> 00:42:31.350
because we knew they would work.

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:33.601
And then you kind of freestyle
getting between them.

00:42:33.601 --> 00:42:36.100
But we knew as long as we used
those for the uncritical bits

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:37.030
it would work.

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:39.875
In terms of actually building
it, you'd leave gaps.

00:42:39.875 --> 00:42:41.920
And the rule was,
trust the gaps.

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.400
That was our official rule.

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:44.904
Well, actually, one
rule we had was,

00:42:44.904 --> 00:42:46.570
if you bumped dominoes
over by accident,

00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:48.360
because occasionally you would
knock them and they'd all go.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:49.080
You're like, ah.

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.220
The rule was you then
stand up and walk away.

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:53.005
Because someone
else will come in,

00:42:53.005 --> 00:42:54.789
someone who's now
emotionally invested,

00:42:54.789 --> 00:42:56.330
because you're now
balancing dominoes

00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:57.540
with a sense of revenge.

00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:58.040
Right?

00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:00.740
And so someone else would then
come in and put them back up

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:01.630
for you.

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:03.790
And the rule was trust
the gaps, because we

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:05.350
knew we were going to
bump them over by accident

00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:06.510
and they were going to run.

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:08.100
But as long as there was
a gap they would stop.

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:10.210
And I saw one volunteer,
because I just asked on Twitter,

00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:11.840
hey, people come and
balance dominoes.

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:14.170
And one got bumped it,
and it started to run.

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:16.700
And he lunged to
try and stop it.

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.472
And he bumped the
ones after the gap.

00:43:18.472 --> 00:43:20.180
And so then they say
and he was like, oh.

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:21.054
I was like you idiot.

00:43:21.054 --> 00:43:25.462
And then he realized what he
did and tried to stop those

00:43:25.462 --> 00:43:27.170
and bumped the ones
there, at which point

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:28.970
we were just wrestling
him away from them.

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:31.219
And if you watch the video--
I've got a YouTube video.

00:43:31.219 --> 00:43:34.195
It's about half an hour
of me balancing dominoes.

00:43:34.195 --> 00:43:36.070
And I explain the binary
and everything else.

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:39.090
You can see people walking
around inside-- because we

00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:40.990
had to fill in the gaps
when we were done--

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:42.530
and we did like a fractal.

00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:43.739
We did every like middle bit.

00:43:43.739 --> 00:43:46.196
And then we went back and did
a little bit and a little bit

00:43:46.196 --> 00:43:48.200
so trying to minimize
the possible damage.

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:51.519
But to load it we left gaps
where the data would go in,

00:43:51.519 --> 00:43:53.810
and you filled in for one
and left it blank for zeroes.

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:55.720
And we picked random
numbers at the end,

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:58.390
and then people had to walk
out into the center of it

00:43:58.390 --> 00:44:00.000
and fill in where the ones were.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.530
It was the most hair-raising
thing of my life.

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:03.930
But in the end it worked.

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:06.600
We had one spontaneous bit where
we were just standing around

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:08.800
and suddenly a domino
fell over and a bit ran.

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.300
But we hadn't done
all the gaps yet,

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:12.395
and so we were able to fix that.

00:44:12.395 --> 00:44:13.270
Very, very stressful.

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:14.686
If anyone's ever
in the UK and you

00:44:14.686 --> 00:44:17.520
want to borrow 10,000
dominoes, let me know.

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.080
I'm happy to lend them to you.

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:20.925
I bring up a place because I
want to buy them wholesale.

00:44:20.925 --> 00:44:22.790
I ring them up and say I want
to buy dominoes wholesale.

00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:23.645
And they go, oh, no.

00:44:23.645 --> 00:44:25.150
We only send them to shops.

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:26.441
And I said well, I want 10,000.

00:44:26.441 --> 00:44:28.430
They were like, we'll
work something out.

00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:30.180
And so I got them
delivered to the Museum.

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:30.888
It was brilliant.

00:44:30.888 --> 00:44:32.460
So now actually
schools use them now.

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:34.570
So schools can
take them for free

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:36.594
if they pay transport
from the previous school.

00:44:36.594 --> 00:44:38.260
So they get sent
around between schools,

00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:40.593
and they try and build the
circuits, which is great fun.

00:44:40.593 --> 00:44:43.500
So I will do one more
question, and then I

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.850
will loiter around if you
want to have a chat with me

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:46.450
afterwards.

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:47.310
Has anyone got?

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:49.351
It could just be-- I think
the pressure's on now.

00:44:49.351 --> 00:44:51.822
Better be a good question.

00:44:51.822 --> 00:44:52.530
It could be-- No?

00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:54.410
Is it the tech guy?

00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:58.030
Start again, but have
the microphone closer.

00:44:58.030 --> 00:45:02.290
AUDIENCE: Could you potentially
bio-engineer the knot

00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:04.950
that you showed
out of DNA and set

00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:06.775
a bacteria that would
destroy its own type.

00:45:06.775 --> 00:45:07.170
MATT PARKER: Oh, wow.

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:07.670
OK.

00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:09.620
So a very good
question from Matthew,

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:12.600
the guy filming in the back
there, who said could you

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:15.200
make the knot out
of DNA, and then

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:18.800
use that to find the most
efficient way to undo it?

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:20.270
And that's very good question.

00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:22.700
The answer is no idea.

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:26.330
So I'm not sure actually,
because what actually happens

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:29.850
if you want to see the
way you get knots in DNA--

00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:30.670
you can try this.

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:32.950
Because if anyone's
ever made a Mobius loop

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:34.751
and then cut it
in half, you will

00:45:34.751 --> 00:45:36.500
find that you end up
with one longer loop.

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:37.460
It's fascinating.

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:40.050
If you have more twists,
you get longer loops

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:41.260
that are tangled together.

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:42.560
And that's what's
happening with DNA.

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:44.190
It's and incredibly
twisted molecule.

00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:45.430
Because it unzips
down the middle,

00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:47.138
but all those twists
means the two halves

00:45:47.138 --> 00:45:48.680
are all tangled
around each other.

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:52.106
And so what the enzymes--
they're called tropo something

00:45:52.106 --> 00:45:56.550
undabellabella monase
and so what they're doing

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:58.620
is-- I'm not a
biologist-- is working

00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:00.160
on a huge mass of this stuff.

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:02.920
So I suspect they
never encounter knots

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:06.492
that simple is my gut reaction.

00:46:06.492 --> 00:46:08.950
I think it's a bit like solving
like the traveling salesman

00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:09.450
problem.

00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:11.500
You've got good
strategies, but you

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:13.440
can't guarantee you've
done the best way,

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.712
but it's incredibly
efficient in general.

00:46:15.712 --> 00:46:16.420
But I don't know.

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:19.250
I will contact some biologists
and say, look, put down all

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:21.080
this curing cancer stuff.

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:23.220
We've got a knot
we've got to solve.

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:24.960
And I'll report back.

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.600
So on that note, I
am going to wrap up,

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:28.800
but I will be loitering
around for as long as I can.

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.508
I think I am going to
have to finish now.

00:46:30.508 --> 00:46:33.030
And so on that note, again,
thank you all very much.

00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.630
Yes.

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:36.980
[APPLAUSE]
