00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.170
Context: I recently uploaded a video
that was ten minutes long 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.510
and consisted of me doing
nothing but eating cereal. 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.600
Yes. If you haven't seen it yet, don't worry.
It's really not vital viewing. 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.710
Most people haven't watched it. 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.030
Most people that clicked to watch
the video still haven't seen it yet,

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.430
and the reason that this video exists is
because someone left me a comment saying, 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.750
"Charlie you could literally eat
cereal for ten minutes 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.110
and I would find it entertaining." 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.820
And I saw that and I thought, "No you wouldn't,
and I'm gonna prove it to you."

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.780
However, what I wasn't expecting was
that, although most people, yeah, 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.740
thought it was boring, a large number
of people left comments saying 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.620
that they did watch and enjoy the
whole video, and it confused me. 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.880
It peaked my curiosity. 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.310
At this point, I decided to
compare the like/dislike ratio

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.770
of the ten minute video of me eating cereal,
which took me a morning to make, 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.260
with my ten minute short film,
"The Tea Chronicles," 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.590
which took me many, many months
and a substantial amount of money to make, 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.480
and it turned out people did
like my short film more, yay, 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.480
but only 16% more,
which did leave me wondering, 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.470
"Was it worth putting in all
of that extra effort?" 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.970
My instinct has always told me that
the more effort you put into something,

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.310
the more inherent worth
that thing must have, 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.890
but I am starting to wonder
if that is actually true. 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.350
Take Pewdiepie, for example. He is someone
who a lot of people don't like 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.390
because he is incredibly successful,
so incredibly successful, 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.900
for doing something that
seems very easy. 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.550
He talks while playing
video games. 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.910
That's not hard, right? 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.310
However, what I hadn't thought about
before is that even if his videos, objectively, 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.260
take less time and effort to put together
than a sketch or a short film or an animation 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.720
why does that mean that what he does
is less worth while because, clearly,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.100
millions of people love
what of he does 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.400
and I feel like that should
be worth something. 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.850
With my cereal video, even though
I tried to put a bit of effort into it 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.980
like I tried to light it
and frame it nicely 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.780
and I added background music
throughout the whole thing, 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.300
I made it and I still
think it's rubbish, 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.040
but when I see something like a Tumblr
that is dedicated just to videos 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.870
of other people eating
breakfast with me remotely, 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.940
clearly, someone is getting
something out of what I made. 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.800
I think it's fair to say, as well,
that some of the people who hold that 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.240
"This Didn't Take As Much Time To Make
And Therefore It Is Not As Worth While" Attitude 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.700
think that about video blogging, 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.290
and I can completely sympathize
with that point of view as well, 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.340
given that a large amount of video bloggers
do seem to make just "content." 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.790
They will make videos about vapid topics
that don't feel like they have any worth. 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.510
But what confuses me
about that is the idea 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.840
that you would write off
all of vlogging just 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.590
because some people don't use
the medium in a way that you like.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.770
To me, that is the same as
like writing off all of music 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.120
because you do not
like pop songs. 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.090
The most popular video that I've ever
made was me trying to do an 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.930
American accent and failing. 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.530
And did it because I was busy that week and
I couldn't think of anything else to do. 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.700
It was a filler video. 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.810
But what I deem to be my most successful
video is not the one with the most views 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.140
or even the one with like the
highest production value. 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.070
It's the one that allowed me to
make the strongest connection 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.730
with the people who did watch it, in this case,
an insane amount of video responses. 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.380
But, when it comes to which
video has more worth, 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.810
I feel like you could make a
strong argument either way. 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.830
Like, I prefer "I'm Scared," but I know a lot
of people wouldn't have found me

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.190
and seen that video if it hadn't
been for "My American Accent," 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.090
so I don't know. 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.590
I don't know when it happened,
but, at some point, 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.900
someone at YouTube decided that they
were going to call us all "content creators," 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.250
which is the blandest title that I think
we all could possibly have hoped for. 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.980
Frankly, I don't want to
be making "content" 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.420
'cause that sounds to me like something
you're doing just to fill in a gap. 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.540
On the flip side, I don't feel like I would
ever be comfortable calling what I do "art."

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.470
I can't get over how
pretentious that sounds, 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.900
but I what I do worry is
that, as YouTubers, 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.470
we maybe undervalue
what we do. 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.140
Most of the time, we are
just making stuff in the hopes 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.120
that it'll make someone
else laugh and that is it. 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.830
We're not looking for a
deep connection, 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.720
but I do genuinely think
that, as YouTubers, 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.370
we have the ability to make
stuff like nobody else can, 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.880
and I think that
people like us for it,

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.100
and, surely, that is
worth something. 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.490
Anyway, that's what I've been
thinking about recently. 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.350
Let me know what you think,
and I'll see you later. Bye! 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.600
STEPHEN FRY VOICE: You've just had the almost
imponderable joy of watching charlieissocoollike,

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.480
which makes you, like, cool.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.320
CLAP 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.770
BURP 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.080
And the vlog has begun. 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.650
Always tempted to
put the burps in. 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.287
Let's see if I can avoid
putting in that one.
