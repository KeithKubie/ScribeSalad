00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:15.310
So, the apocalypse has happened.

00:00:15.334 --> 00:00:16.980
The zombies have come and gone,

00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:20.012
and all plant life
on Earth has died somehow.

00:00:20.036 --> 00:00:21.970
All you have are some basic supplies

00:00:21.994 --> 00:00:25.508
and some seeds of a few types
of essential plants.

00:00:25.532 --> 00:00:26.563
So, what should you do

00:00:26.587 --> 00:00:28.900
to make absolutely sure they grow,

00:00:28.924 --> 00:00:30.860
seeing how rebuilding human civilization

00:00:30.884 --> 00:00:33.198
absolutely depends on it?

00:00:33.222 --> 00:00:34.461
Well, you'd probably think

00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:35.583
the last thing you should do

00:00:35.607 --> 00:00:37.365
with these crucially important seeds

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:39.723
is something like poking holes in them,

00:00:39.747 --> 00:00:41.355
or grinding them with sandpaper,

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:42.597
or throwing them in acid

00:00:42.621 --> 00:00:44.127
or hot water.

00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:45.961
But, in fact, all of these are methods

00:00:45.985 --> 00:00:47.042
that are commonly used

00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.245
to help seeds start growing.

00:00:50.152 --> 00:00:52.299
A typical seed consists of a plant embryo

00:00:52.323 --> 00:00:54.907
encased in a hard seed coat.

00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:55.858
To start growing,

00:00:55.882 --> 00:00:57.529
it needs to emerge or sprout

00:00:57.553 --> 00:00:59.386
from inside this shell.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.767
This process is called germination.

00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:03.125
But just as it would be hard

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.721
for you to get out of a jail cell

00:01:04.745 --> 00:01:06.511
with no windows and no doors,

00:01:06.535 --> 00:01:08.202
the embryo might need a little help

00:01:08.226 --> 00:01:10.302
escaping from its seed prison,

00:01:10.326 --> 00:01:12.136
and any process that makes this easier

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.905
by wearing down the seed coat

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:15.990
is called scarification.

00:01:16.014 --> 00:01:17.576
This lets moisture and nutrients

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.986
get through the seed coat,

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.556
making the embryo start growing

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.886
until it breaks through.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.112
Now, you might be wondering

00:01:24.136 --> 00:01:26.068
why it is that plants would need humans

00:01:26.092 --> 00:01:28.169
to do all these weird
things to their seeds

00:01:28.193 --> 00:01:29.382
in order to grow,

00:01:29.406 --> 00:01:31.298
and, in fact, they don't.

00:01:31.322 --> 00:01:32.393
In natural environments,

00:01:32.417 --> 00:01:34.990
seed coats are worn
down by cold temperatures,

00:01:35.014 --> 00:01:35.750
bacteria,

00:01:35.774 --> 00:01:37.882
or even animal digestion.

00:01:37.906 --> 00:01:40.188
Our scarification methods just mimick

00:01:40.212 --> 00:01:42.715
and accelerate these natural processes

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:45.965
to increase the chances
of successful germination.

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:48.734
One technique we can
use is called nicking.

00:01:48.758 --> 00:01:50.986
To do this, we make a small cut or scratch

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.571
into the seed coat.

00:01:52.595 --> 00:01:54.490
Be careful not to cut too deep!

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:57.197
You don't want to damage
the plant embryo inside.

00:01:57.221 --> 00:01:59.411
Another way is to file down the seed coat

00:01:59.435 --> 00:02:02.259
using sandpaper or a nail file.

00:02:02.283 --> 00:02:04.490
Once again, you don't
want to file too much,

00:02:04.514 --> 00:02:07.498
just enough to wear
down some of the seed coat.

00:02:07.522 --> 00:02:09.503
After applying either of these methods,

00:02:09.527 --> 00:02:11.527
you'll want to spray the seeds with bleach

00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:12.852
to prevent mold.

00:02:12.876 --> 00:02:14.884
Seeds can also be soaked in water

00:02:14.908 --> 00:02:16.302
to soften the coat.

00:02:16.326 --> 00:02:17.736
One way to do this

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.522
is to place the seeds in a nylon bag,

00:02:19.546 --> 00:02:21.764
then place the bag into hot water.

00:02:21.788 --> 00:02:23.180
Turn off the heat immediately

00:02:23.204 --> 00:02:25.554
and allow the water to cool
to room temperature

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:27.597
before removing the seeds.

00:02:27.621 --> 00:02:30.028
It's important not to heat
the seed for too long

00:02:30.052 --> 00:02:32.067
as this will kill the embryo.

00:02:32.091 --> 00:02:33.160
Again, you'll want to spray them

00:02:33.184 --> 00:02:35.300
with bleach afterwards.

00:02:35.324 --> 00:02:37.312
Finally, you can try immersing the seeds

00:02:37.336 --> 00:02:39.680
in a sulfuric acid solution.

00:02:39.704 --> 00:02:42.276
Make sure you're wearing
protective goggles and gloves

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.146
any time you work with such
a dangerous substance.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.514
Place the seeds into a wire mesh pouch

00:02:47.538 --> 00:02:50.676
and immerse the pouch
in the solution for ten minutes.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.609
Then take out the pouch

00:02:51.633 --> 00:02:53.820
and rinse it with clean water.

00:02:53.844 --> 00:02:55.509
Take out the seeds and, as before,

00:02:55.533 --> 00:02:58.727
spray them with bleach
so they don't get moldy.

00:02:58.751 --> 00:03:00.275
If you try all of these methods,

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.487
you will see that some of them

00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:03.145
are more effective than others,

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:05.455
and some work best
for different types of plants

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:07.563
that have harder or thicker coats.

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:10.472
So, knowing what seed scarification
techniques work best

00:03:10.496 --> 00:03:13.364
will be useful if you ever
need to survive a cataclysm,

00:03:13.388 --> 00:03:14.563
start a farm,

00:03:14.587 --> 00:03:17.313
or just want to plant in your own garden.
