Speaker 1:          00:06          We're moving on to, to have and have not. Um, and this novel was written in a fairly have, has it fashion. It was written in 19, between 1935 and 1937 basically, um, it was written when Hemingway was taking a break from his coverage of the Spanish civil war, so he would be in Spain for Spanish civil war and then he would, um, come back, um, to the, uh, United States, but after they, um, also to The Bahamas to right to have and have not. So, uh, we'll be reading, you guys know that we'll be reading for whom the bell tolls, um, for whom the bell tolls and have and have not really interlocking in multiple ways because one is balanced pencil awards and this one's written when Hemingway was covering the span. So awards. So we can really think of those as in dialogue in really interesting ways.

Speaker 1:          01:11          Um, the um, hotel that Hemingway's stayed at, uh, when he was writing to have and have not, uh, was in The Bahamas is in the mini is the conceit Anglo hotel. Actually, I'm the hotel burned down, so it's no longer there. But this was a picture taken before that was really lucky that there was this picture. Um, and inside of there, there's a plaque standard. This was the home of Ernest Hemingway. Um, he was there for two years, um, the police road to have and have not in various different places, but this was one of the main places he stayed at when he wrote the novel. Um, as we also know, Cuba, um, was very important to Hemingway. Um, this is, uh, his house is still standing. The thing that they're here, um, which is now than Lucio. Um, on this Hemingway in Havana. Um, and this is a picture of Hemingway writing.

Speaker 1:          02:14          He wrote the man, Oh man in the sea when he was in Cuba in this very house. Roy's books were there. So, um, but this was Polly picture was polytech and a little later in the 1950s, um, so I found some pictures of Havana in the 1930 business. The while the frame, this is the El Malecon, uh, with the sea war. You can see are there some really very magnificent buildings, uh, on the Wallace van. And this is the main avenue, the Anita, those president is very, very impressive looking. Um, avenue. Cuba was actually called the Paris of the Western in the first half of the 20th century. And we can see why, uh, it really was a very magnificent place. And, um, this is downtown Havana and still in the thirties. Um, and this is bothered Hemingway went to quill, has the sloppy joes but are, and here's a picture of him and the British playwright, no coward at the sloppy Joes Ball.

Speaker 1:          03:24          So, um, really interesting historic pictures other than drinking. Hemingway also went fishing a lot as we can see as a very intimate knowledge of, of fishing. And the fish that especially, uh, preoccupy him was the mall. And so this is a description from to have and have not, um, of what Amal and look like. And I just happened to have found this picture, the single correspondence lag way through that, the thought, the eye and open lower jaw and huge purple black head of a black Marlin from this picture. We can't really see how big areas. This is a picture of Hemingway on the boat and Nida, um, this is just before he wrote to have and have not, um, with his friends. Um, and the next picture is, um, taken in the mini, um, and with his second wife Pauline and his three sons, Gregory, John and Patrick, 19 than five.

Speaker 1:          04:30          And we can see just how huge a tamale in is. It could weigh up to a thousand partners. So, um, the, this picture is, I downloaded, um, online things to the Ernest Hemingway collection at the JFK Library in Boston. So this is just to acknowledge a very important collection. Um, if you guys want to do future work on him anyway, that's the place to go, um, is helpful, um, in thinking about to have and have not, um, to think a little bit about the publication district of this novel. It was also publish as short stories. It's too short stories. Um, one trip across was published in a cosmopolitan 1934. Um, and then the traders return publish and as wired magazine 1936 and then to have and have not was published by a Scribner's in 1937. Um, so, um, because of the way it came out initially as she was stories, I think once again we have to think about the narrative structure of the novel and this a lot to think about because it turns out that this is an incredibly complicated switching back and forth between the first person and third person.

Speaker 1:          05:54          So one is told and the first person is themes for straight, straightforward is told from herring. Morgan's point of view is also the spring, the session cause spraying. So, um, it is in many ways the spring and Harry Morgan's life. Um, and then part two is toe and the third person. Um, and this is actually quite Jordan. All of a sudden we see Harry more than from the outside. Um, as we knew nothing about him, his reintroduced to us as he and even as the man, the very, very alienating perspective and part you and as the section called the fall. And then part three is called a winter. And here is even more complicated than that is mixed narration begins with someone who's not even a very important character of someone called [inaudible] who tells the story in chat tonight. Um, and then it switches back to Harry and chapter 10.

Speaker 1:          06:57          And then we get third person narration for a good part of the part two, a part three. And then the very final chapter, Chapter 26, it switches back to the first person narration, but there's Toba and Marie, Harry's wife. Um, so at the very least we can say that Hemingway's experimented with all kinds of narrative who of views. Um, and so the most fundamental question, um, has to do with pronouns. Um, who is attached to which pronoun? Why does having way, uh, choose to use certain pronouns while the see choose to use some points of views for that section. Um, and this is also a good moment to start thinking about the interconnections, Amanda Novels. I know that you guys just turn in your first paper, so, but there's not too early to start thinking about the next big project. Um, and the interconnections amount of novels would be a very good approach to thing about that larger project.

Speaker 1:          08:00          So, um, two things are very clear in terms of the prior publication as she was [inaudible] to have and have not obviously looks back to in our time. There seems to be Hemingway's habit is to publish publish poets as short stories. Actually it's very common, uh, publish pause and short stories and then to have a more, a larger entity, um, whether or not, um, the two are related in terms of this kind of pry publication history is a good question. Um, but to have and have not, it's also linked, um, to the sound and the theory because of the multiple narratives voices, um, in the sound of the fury, we know that they are just four, right? So the three brothers, um, each guest one section and then the ignition, a narration in section four and to have and have not is much less clear cut than that.

Speaker 1:          08:56          As I just mentioned, someone who's quite Mojito to a story like Alvin guests to have a section. So he obviously doesn't have to send challenged that Benji or Quentin or Jason. Um, there's the three brothers do in, in Santa Theory. Uh, why does someone like Albert get to tell the story? Um, it's um, even though the two novels have share common ground in terms of multiple narrative whizzes, the actual configuration of those voices, um, the two different configurations in the two novels. Um, and finally something new is also emerging and to half and half, not that we haven't seen so far or that hasn't been in the foreground a up to this point. Then I like to call your attention to add, which as characters, as generic types with classification, with taxonomy of social types, we see it in the very title of the novel is divided into two, the haves and the have nots.

Speaker 1:          10:00          Um, and obviously to social types. Um, it's very much, um, kind of organizing principle in this novel. Uh, but it also looks forward to the Fitzgerald stories that we'll be reading next week. A story like the ritual boy is very much about this kind of classifiable and generic type. Um, so, um, I wanted to think about this. Um, one of the thing about the difference between two novels, um, in terms of another novel that, um, that Hemingway is famous for, which is the old man and the sea. Um, and um, they're both sat in Cuba, the above about Cuba for some extent, but no central league about Cuba but standing Cuba, uh, but in many ways they represent two different sides of the spectrum, um, to have and have not, um, is as we can see from the Tido is a divided canvas is populated by two taxonomic groups.

Speaker 1:          11:15          Um, so it's very much about classify ability. Not only is it giving us two taxonomic groups, but it's also about the phenomenon of classify ability. Um, are human beings classify, can they be put under various generic labels? That is a big question in his novel to the old man. And the sea is in many ways on the other side of the spectrum, as we can see as you, as you guys know the story, the novel is about a solitary, um, fishermen, Cuban fishermen in San Diego. Um, and his decision to go out along, um, and he did get this huge Marlin once again, that fish, um, and he's trying to save that, uh, from being eaten up by sharks. So the novel was really about his struggle against the sharks and he loses out of the mountain is completely cleaned out by the sharks by the end of the novel.

Speaker 1:          12:18          Uh, but in spite of that ending, it is really about the heroic struggle of man against elemental forces. So, um, most of us know Hemingway actually as the Hemingway, the old man and the sea, and it's, um, helpful to keep that in mind. But Hemingway is also very interested in the other side of the equation, which is about, um, not so much about individuals, as about individuals who can be understood or can be encompass, accounted for in terms of social types. So, um, we see it not only in the main characters in the novel, but also in very marginal characters. People who would appear just once. Um, they also presented to us as social types. So the very opening of the novel, um, Harry Morgan is approached by his three young Cubans who want to pay him a lot of money to be taken to the United States.

Speaker 1:          13:19          Um, and this is how they are described. They were good looking young fellows work good clothes, none of them wore hats and they look like they had plenty of money. They talk friendly with money anyway. And there's the kind of English Cubans with money speed, right. So obviously classify as well it's fun standard and this passage, um, the various syntax they talked plenty of money is an expression that we use and is certainly, it's the kind of labeling that goes on behind that kind of syntax. Um, so the uh, where the parent is the clothes, the speech patterns of these people easily classify them. We don't really need to know much else about them that they haven't weighed, is not interested in telling as much else about them. They are just there as representatives of Cubans with money who need to get out of Cuba at that moment.

Speaker 1:          14:20          Um, but because classifiable it seems so central to the novel. The question, obviously it arises as to whether or not Harry Morgan himself as classifiable, he is a hero. He's a protagonist who inhabits a novel that is populated by loss of social types, right? Whether or not he belongs with Nahu fist, completely into that landscape is to open question. Um, is he evil, uh, to break away okayso finally from that landscape does, he's managed to stand out and be an individual that we would recognize and that will stick in our memories as one individual rather than as one social type. That is the question that we have to think about and I like to break that down a little bit. Um, in terms of for, uh, interconnected clusters of issues, one is, um, to willy stands, Harry Morgan, a racist is he races or not races? Um, the other question and that's something that we've already seen in thought the play approved now, um, and that is highlighted dramatize by Hemingway's joys and narrative technique is whether he is an eye or whether he is a he and the choice of those pronouns.

Speaker 1:          15:49          Obviously it has narrative implications, right? If he is an iron, very likely we're going to see the inside of him is going to be an interior view of Harriet. If he's going to be a here, very likely there's going to be an external view of Paris. Um, just as in [inaudible] there's an external view and not very pretty view of doc in the false section of the sound, the theory. Um, and finally going back to the title of the course of the, of the novel, uh, whether he is a half or have not, does he accept the novel empty handed? Um, can you say that he has achieved something? Um, there's something is in his possession that he has on there. He owns something with he also both in the beginning, uh, whether he's still almost anything at all at the annals of novel. That is no, the question, um, I raised the question of racism because that is the question raised by Toni Morrison.

Speaker 1:          16:53          Toni Morrison, we know as the author of novels [inaudible] live in aisles like beloved. Um, but she's also, um, uh, someone who, um, gives a lot of talks and she also turned some of those tasks into essays. So play in the dark is the collection of essays published by Tony Morrison. And she devoted the long section to Hemingway and to have, to have and have not, it's very interesting that this is not the best known novel I haven't went, but this is the novel that, um, Morrison singles out. Um, or those just singling it out, not to praise it. Uh, I've had to pull into some troubling aspects of to have and have not, um, and this is what Morrison says. Harry includes a nigger and his crew, a a man who threw out all of that. One has known name, his appearance is taken on by the sentence.

Speaker 1:          17:57          Just then the nigger we had getting paid comes down to dark. The black man is not only nameless for five chapters, he's not even hired. Just someone we had getting beat the kind of trend with. Now that Asian assessing the job and then she goes on to say the spatial and conceptual difference is marked by the shortcut that the term nigger allows with all this color and cast implications. The term occupies a territory between man and animal for free. Um, strong objections to the novel. Um, in response, I'll just, not to defend him in way completely, but just to point out that the one that goes up use my Faulkner's we've just seen, um, is also used by Marc train because that's the word that those characters were the views how Finn with have used the neighbor in the 19th century. It would have been very odd for Mark Twain not to use that work in this novel.

Speaker 1:          19:05          Um, someone like Quentin, suddenly Jason would have used the word nigger if they were living people. So it would have been very odd for farming not to use that work because that's the basic speech pattern of his characters. Um, but quite aside from that, um, but as you also point out that, um, Maura's and Ashley, you can see it's that it's only in part one that this black man, um, doesn't have a name. He actually, he does over there in part two. So we can look at that moment of transition when the black men acquires and name off son, find out what his car. Um, but uh, before we get into part two, I just want to actually look at another one to call attention to, um, a passage where the word nigger is used. But now to describe the black men that Morrison has in mind.

Speaker 1:          20:00          This is an earlier appearance of that word nigger. Um, and this is actually coming right after, um, Harry's conversation with those three, uh, rich Cubans. Um, all of a sudden this, this seat is fighting, breaking out and shooting. Um, and it turns out that the key player in that shooting as a black character, the nigger with a Tommy gun goddess phase almost into the street and gave the back of the wagon of births from underneath. And sure enough, one came down, fall into what the sidewalk with his head above the curb attended feet. The leaker charlatan in the belly with a Tommy Gun with one. Must've been the last shot in it because I saw him throw it down. No Pancho set down hard and went over four with, he was trying to come up, still holding onto the Luger, only he couldn't get his head up when a nigger and took the shotgun that was lying again as the wheel of the car by the show for and to do the side of his head, some nigger.

Speaker 1:          21:15          Okay. So we might object to file and of this theme. Uh, but what is clear in this passage is the tremendous admiration that having wet has for this black character he's been meant to kill to his job is to kill the three rich Cubans. Um, and he accomplishes that task magnificently. Um, so this is, and having way is just using every bit of his writerly skill to convey to us, even those of us who really know nothing about guns and nothing about the odd of shooting. To highlight for us, one an odd there's there is to be able to get your face almost down to the street until he will to get someone, um, to get the shotgun when there's no more, nothing left in your own. Tommi Gunn. And to be able to finish off the last of the three Cubans, one against three, um, you know, just the performance of it.

Speaker 1:          22:21          Um, so this nothing but admiration in this description of the black man and we can almost get a kind of a capsule summary of the intense admiration from the two word phrase that concludes the passage. Some nigger, okay. How many ways, still using the word nigger, but the expression Stum Negro almost completely undermines that word. Yes, he's a nigger. His the classifiable type, but he's Nivison specimen. He's an amazing specimen of that type. So much so that his stretching that type two is limit. So much so that he's almost making that type non anthology. No, he's such an amazing character that is almost, you know, you can call him a nigger, but it doesn't really mean anything, was some nigger. Um, it turns out that some that construction, some followed by what appears to be a derogatory term, that is a kind of a verbal tick for Harry Morgan.

Speaker 1:          23:32          He uses that phrase over and over again for other characters as well. So we can go and look at some other instances when he uses that construction. Um, and it turns out that he also uses it for the man who has a, who owes him $825. And they said it was a clear out without paying a cent. This is the very regionals to Johnson who charters the boat for fishing managers to lose the whole, um, other, um, um, the, the, um, the works under on boat, um, managers to, to, um, uh, to do real damage, uh, to, to, to, to Harry's bill because of his enamel as efficient and um, and so he owes $825. And this Mr. Johnson, even though he is quite in as a fisherman, he nonetheless is very skilled in one thing. And this is why this passage pays tribute to he went on the plane, frankly, he frankly said, all right, there was, the counselor was close as well, the science.

Speaker 1:          24:43          And anyhow, Wayne was in Miami by now. I couldn't even send a wire some Mr. Johnson, right. It was my fault. I should have known better how I didn't even have enough money to put in gas. It was a hell of a note. All right, so Mr. Johnson, it is not the same kind of performance as the shooting, but it guests from Harry the same involuntary and the regime, even though he's obviously the victim of that magnificent performance on the poem, Mr. Johnson, it takes nerve, it takes whatever ruthlessness we can attach any number of adjectives to Mr. Johnson anyway, and it's much more economic style of writing uses only one phrase. And that is enough desk completely adequate for Mr. Johnson. There's no need for any string of adjectives to be attached to Mr. Johnson, some Mr [inaudible] that does it all. Um, so we can see right away that this is really Hemingway's way of both paying tribute to a generic type.

Speaker 1:          26:02          In this case, we'll Richman, you know, even his name is generic. Mr. Johnson. Um, here's a generic type is a generic Richman who managers, um, you know, to, uh, get to be where he is by what he does by doing so numbers of things. And he's very, very good at that. Uh, so once again, this is a generic type of specimen of a generic type. Those so good at what he's doing that he's stretches the limit, that type one a example. And this one is much more analogous to the expression, some nigger. Um, we know that, um, actually even in Cuba, there's a very, uh, significant, even in Havana now there's a very important, uh, Chinese population and it to tell that there is a timeless character into have and have not. Um, he's very smooth. Talkings looking, uh, China man. Um, he wears a white suit and the silk shirt with a black tie and a $125 Panama hat.

Speaker 1:          27:08          So he also talks like this. Um, and Hemingway gives us a specimen of the spiritual, have them have this very classified or type, he talks like an Englishman quite. So it's the things that, how many you might have fortunate compared with. Could you both accommodate? You Mean Carrie? You stood up and I watch him go out. Frankly smiled at him. I, he, when Mr Sam doesn't look at him, he was a smooth looking chink. Alright. Some Chin. Okay. So once again, um, there's a type that outperforms the tape by the way of margin, right? So this is about what kind of performance can be expected within a generic title and the extent of that outperformance, even as a smooth talking Ching Mr Sing is very, very memorable. Um, and we see it. Um, and even when Mr Sing is that he's still memorable and still more than just a specimen, you guys probably know, um, that um, Mr Sing is killed by Harry.

Speaker 1:          28:24          Um, because he was Harry, he was basically the kill off 12 channels, passengers, uh, that he has no intention of shipping to where they thought they were going. Um, so he was Harry to kill those 12 times passengers and instead of killing those swells, Chinese passengers, herring kills Mr. Sing, but not without a lot of resistance, a very heroic resistance, uh, never seen resistance from Mr Singh. And this is the outcome. Uh, his dad is killed by Harry, uh, but he's left a mark on herring. Um, and this is actually the beginning of the bodily injuries sustained by, um, this is actually one of the structural principles and the novel is the things that eat into Harry's body. And that is pilot with a catalog of things that, that we can put on the half not calling Harry's stars with these of able body person who is completely his eyes by the, um, and he gradually loses some positive as his body positive.

Speaker 1:          29:38          There's barley, we get them. And so is the first instance of something that happens to his body and is coming to him because Mr Saint, I held a wheel with my knee and opened up my should and saw where Mr Sing did me. It was quite a bite and put iodine on it. And then I sat there staring and wondering whether the bite from retirement was supposedly as hell know that bite wasn't poisonous. A man like that. And it's the same Polly's from his teeth two or three times a day. Some of this to say this is Hemingway writing and not father, but we see this thing mixture of cash and even comedy right here in food as Flint. So it is not a great experience to be bitten by anyone. And this seems to be a very bad, but um, but the is also an occasion on what a generic, smooth looking chink with deal.

Speaker 1:          30:45          Um, he's going to be brushing his teeth three or four times, then you can count on his hygiene to save you from getting any infection from his bike. So this one consoling fat. Um, but he's at least if you have to be busy in his belly to be bitten by the lights and this saying than to be by someone else. Um, that is the dark comedy, um, that, um, is emerging and to have and have not. Um, but it also is a meditation, um, really on all those derogatory labels. Um, and the question to us, uh, as to whether or not we should consider them aloud or whether or not we should say this is an instance where it is completely legitimate to use those words or whether we still think that some other work would have been preferred. So I encourage you to talk about this issue in section.

Speaker 1:          31:41          Um, but now, um, I like to switch to part two of two, half and half, not um, and to the possibility that Harry Morgan himself, my actually they portrayed as a Tyler, uh, as dramatize, uh, and reinforced by having ways, narrative technique. So we're switching to third person narration and a very jolting outside view of herring Morgan. And this is also the moment when the black character and actually acquires a name and sorry, Wesley, the man's led by God to steer you. Treat a man, know about her. The dog to Negro said it was getting ugly now, but the man was still sorry for him. I'm going to make you comfortable, Wesley. He said, you just lay quiet. You ain't going to things me up. The neighbors had the man whose name was Harry Morgan, said nothing then because he liked the nigger and there was nothing to do.

Speaker 1:          32:53          Now I hit him that he couldn't hit him. Um, it is um, very almost things to add to deliberate hostility against his own character. Um, after so many pages when we're inside the head and inside the skin of Harry Morgan two and counter that phrase, the man whose name was Harry mortgage, it can be more externalizing and that can be more objectifying than that. What is interesting is that that objectified discretion is actually use for a white protagonist in the same moment when the black character is acquiring a name like so this kind of double dynamics suggest that this is a very, very important moment. New Black character acquires and them and the white character also acquires a name but in a bad way he had, if when he had been telling the story, he doesn't refer to himself as Harry Morgan for the white character to acquire the name and to be referred to as the man whose name was Harry Morgan.

Speaker 1:          34:08          Cause him in almost exactly the same structural position as the black man Westlake. Each of them requires a name except the full of black heritage row to apply and then is a good thing. Whereas for the white character [inaudible] name is about the worst thing that can happen to him at that moment. Um, why is it that Hemingway was suddenly switch to this third person? They're Asian and it's very alienating mechanism that has been visited upon Harry Morgan. Um, we can think of a number of issues. Um, in section, in part one we sort of know, uh, Harry does for a living, right? You know, we sort of have our, you know, why does this man have a boat? Uh, we sort of have our conjectures, but insect in plug to all of that is being clarified for us. Um, we know that the, the black man is his shot.

Speaker 1:          35:06          Um, and um, there's the smell of the maker of the boat. The boat itself is referred to as the booze boat. So we know that's what Harry does in his day smugglers. They are into the United States. Um, he becomes just that, you know, that's his profession. Um, and that's what we know him by. Um, that takes over to intimate into hurdle view that we had of him in part one. And because that is their occupation that lands him in this type, in this very tight spot with his companion. The black man was maybe in shot. And we also know that something else happens as well, that that Wesley is not the only one, um, to be shot on that occasion. Um, as we find out in this man's, uh, disruption. Who the hell Sean was, he asked him, you only you sharp. Worse than legal side, but he never been sharp.

Speaker 1:          36:18          I didn't figure it out. You get shot. I am paid to get shot. I don't want to be a shot. [inaudible] Wesley, the man told him. Don't do you any good to talk like that. I'm just this one little detail that in fact, both of them were shot, uh, because they obviously had run in the booze world was discovered. Um, and so it was a major event, um, with casualties, um, in both Harry and Westley. So far, whether it's in the foreground, in part two is the casualty is to, wouldn't sustain by Wesley. And that's what he's complaining about. His making, everyone aware that he's been shot. The extent of Harris one is revealed to us in this very oblique, very marginal mention who the hell shot worse he asked you or meet you, your shoppers. So Wesley and knowledges that actually the more serious one is on herring, but we don't actually know what the consequences might be because right now the limelight Israeli aren't Wesley.

Speaker 1:          37:39          And the fact that his furious for having gotten shot, uh, for going on this trip with Harry and Harry trying his best to appears, um, due to a Westley. And then in the rest of the [inaudible] two, we also have, um, this outside character, uh, federally Harrison who takes up a louder space, impart to a one inch report, Herrick to authorities. Um, so two is in many ways, um, uh, part of the story in which we see Harry, um, as someone who should be reported to the authorities or someone who is the recipient of complaint from, of bill will of anger out of the glove at the very leaders from Wesleyan. Um, and who's also someone that an outsider would want to report to the authorities. Um, here's someone who's doing something illegal. Um, and his, you know, he's outside the law anyways. Um, so all that suggests that it is fitting that in thought to, um, the storage to be tall from outside of his point of view that we're no longer inside skin.

Speaker 1:          38:50          We just see him as he is seen by other people as he's seen by Wesley as he seen by Captain Willie, tries to protect him as he's seen through the by nodular is, uh, by Federal Harrison who wants to report him. Um, so he really is an object, isn't seen object. Um, and it's fitting that this thin object should be conveyed to us through the third person. Erasion and I think that there's also another reason, um, why Hemingway w one two switch from first person erasion too verbose in the Asian, is that already in part two? We're beginning to see assymetry between Harry and the black man as the rain. We just saw that both of them acquire and name in part two. We now see in this moment that they're also linked. They are kindred. In one sense, they're kindred in a narrative sense. Um, in the same way that Benji, Quentin and Jason are kindred in narrative.

Speaker 1:          39:59          Sam's as authors on these two are kindred in a narrative sense because the same thing happen to them being shot. That is the time between those black character in this way character. Um, and it, the only difference between them, Ashley, is the degree of severity of that shot. And here as they, we know that, um, it is the black man who actually has the later one that is the white protagonists who are suffering the, the, the, the, the worst. Um, the suffering more actually on this occasion. Um, so both the commonality between the white character and the black heritage or we'll it or line and differentiation in the standards. That is the person who has delay the one who's been taken care of by Harry, um, less than go to chapter nine, which is in pods free. Um, and here, um, it is, this is a chapter that is taught by our, the very marginal character.

Speaker 1:          41:06          Um, so, um, it is tour from um, Albert's point of view, but Harry is once again seen from the outside. He is a here in chapter nine in blood three tap tonight. There was also interesting about part three, chapter nine is that it bears, the curvy is a revisiting of earlier moment between Harry and Wesley. And now we know the consequences of that gunshot wound earlier. What happened to your arm? The lawyer as Harry Harry has to sleeve and up to the shoulder. I didn't like the look of it, so I cut it off. Harry told him, you and who else cut it off? Me and a doctor cut it off.

Speaker 1:          42:04          I think that Hemingway really wants that shock that comes from that lack of knowledge in section in thought to, well two goes onto quite awhile and all the time when reading about Frederick Harrison, we have no idea that the one is serious enough that the arm would have to be amputated and is the withholding of that information and what to you that maximize and said in part three, it is a shock to us that that is what will have to happen to Harry and none of them would have been, would have been conveyed to us if Harry had been telling the story. It is impossible to talk about the invitation of the loud with this kind of dramatic impersonality, um, that Hemingway is ending for. If it had been told from Harris point of view, it would have been about his pain. But Hemingway is not into conveying to insight view of pain.

Speaker 1:          43:14          That is not a phenomenal field that he chooses to enter. Some other novelists do great job within that phenomena will feel pain that is not having waste chosen subjects. Where he was is to give us that complete impersonal, neutral, almost joking, kind of look at someone losing his arm. Um, and that can only be achieved by looking at Harry from the outside. So the combination of the straightforward third person duration impala two and then Albert telling the story in part three, chapter nine, the combination of those maximizes the shock of realizing that really hairy is starting to do something. He's starting is well on his way and this trajectory to us to have nod category his well on his way or losing one's arm is, is, is, is um, is, is quite different from losing lots of other things, uh, to say the least. So, um, we've just seen that Harry has something in common with Wesley, but we also see that he has something ours in common with someone else as well because of course then when Ellis pride it is had also lost his mom, Mr Sing in the fight between Harry and his to say Harry tries to Ben, Mr Singh's arm behind him.

Speaker 1:          44:46          And at one point he just, here's this funny low noise that is made when an arm is broken. Um, and the, he lets go there mom, because um, isn't good to Mr. Sing gang war. So we've seen that dramatize rendition of someone losing his arm and this deliberately on dramatize rendition of someone losing his arm and only appearing as a man without, for Harry to appear as a man without a, and I'm in the eyes as seen by the doctor but by a lawyer. So once again is Harry as a CNR object but still the common ground is there. He and Mr saying Ashley, do you have something in common? Mr Saint loses his arm, he loses his life. Um, Harry loses his arm with a knife, is going to lose this live like Mr Sing is to open question, um, in to have and have no, so this is a novel that Ashley, it is very hard to predict the and they use novel.

Speaker 1:          45:45          So I'm very happy not to tell you the ending. I just leave it as an open question. Um, to what extent is the cemetery, um, between Harry and Mr Saint go into extended, how far does that example, um, but just one more, um, meditation on the question of having and not having, um, it seems that Harry actually is quite aware that he is on his way to becoming a have not, but he has his own way of classifying himself. So this is one characters, the term to classify himself in his own fashion and what is going to be used as the criteria for classifying the house and have no, you can classify people by the amount of money they have or you can classify them by whether or not they have arms or you can classify them by something else. So here is Harry proposing to classify himself and his own fashion.

Speaker 1:          46:48          The hell with my arm. You lose an arm, you lose an arm. There's worse things than to lose an arm. You've got two arms and you've got to have something else. And the, they were mad with one arm on one of those to how with it he says, I don't want to talk about it. Then after a minute he says, I got those other two still. So this is the celebrated concept of the colonialist that um, that, that Harry, uh, still has the word that having ways very fun of, um, and uh, that's how he would like to pacify himself. You know, maybe the arm is the most obvious thing that people see, but the most obvious thing is not actually the thing that best classify someone. Um, something that is invisible, um, could be a better classifier. So, um, I think that the novel entertains that question is how much can you lose?

Speaker 1:          47:50          You know, the Harry is going to lose a lot of things in the closet is novel. Um, you can keep on losing a lot of things and still remain yourself. At least that's the hope. Or maybe that's a fantasy. Um, we have to decide whether it's a legitimate hole, a real or hope that actually is, has some grounding in reality or whether it's just a fantasy, uh, weather. So important when you've lost so much that you really have stopped being yourself, you're no longer what it used to be. Whether that is indeed the case. So we'll come back, um, and um, and ramp up the novel, but thing more about where we should put Harry.
