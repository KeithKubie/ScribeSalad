Frozen popsicles are a delicious way to keep
your kids happy in the hot summer sun, but

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.829
the problem is they’re like ticking time-bombs,
just waiting to explode, into sticky, drippy, pools of juice.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.730
So for this video, I’m going to show you
a cool little trick you can do, to make delicious

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.090
summertime popsicles, that won’t melt.

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.760
All you need for this summer hack, is your
kids favorite box of Jello

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.500
Follow the directions on the back of the box,
to make a fruity syrup, the way you normally

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.730
would, but rather than setting it to cool
in the fridge, try pouring the juice, into

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.869
popsicle molds instead.

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.090
With the liquid still hot, go ahead and move
the molds to the freezer, for a couple of

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.640
hours, and your cool summertime treats will
be ready in no time.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.489
As easy as that, you’ve just made a colorful
batch of delicious “summer sabers”, that

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.900
taste amazing, and are super fun to eat. But
here’s the best part.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.219
When they start warming up and thawing out,
they don’t drip like other popsicles do,

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.379
because these ones, are made of Jello.

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.430
Jello doesn’t normally drip, and is just
as fun for kids to eat. Which means, you won’t

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.870
have the traditional sticky messes to clean
up afterward.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.890
So instead of dealing with sticky faces, sticky
fingers and wasted treats this summer, why

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.820
not make a batch of “drip free” popsicles
instead?

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.200
Kids love them, they’re super easy to make,
and they’ll save you time and frustration

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.120
when it’s time to clean up.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.540
Well that’s it for now. If you liked this
video, perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
