00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.730
Okay we gotta talk about The Great Gatsby.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:08.730
Gatsby?

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.730
What Gatsby?

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.040
The Great Gatsby.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.250
The Leonardo Dicaprio movie that we just saw.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.450
We gotta talk about that.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.160
Why?

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.270
Because last week we said we were gonna talk
about Iron Man 3, and you derailed the conversation

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.820
like you usually do, and people got upset
that we didn't actually talk about the movie.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.750
If you wanna talk about Iron Man 3, then we
can do it.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.750
It sucked balls.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.040
I thought you said you liked it.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.309
You said it was awesome.

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:35.930
That was before I actually saw it.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.050
Listen, the twist is terrible, Pepper does
some ridiculous sh*t, and for the second Iron

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.110
Man movie in a row, there's like almost no
Iron Man.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.260
I think the ship has sailed on the Iron Man
3 conversation.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.350
People don't want to tune into a Great Gatsby
conversation and hear us talk about Iron Man

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.350
3.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.280
And the cycle will continue on and on.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.260
We gotta talk about The Great Gatsby.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.620
Fine but I have the same problem that I had
last week.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.270
I mean, I don't want to spoil the movie for
these people.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.270
It's opening day!

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.080
There are ways to talk about a movie without
spoiling it.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.080
Okay?

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.210
Like, why don't you just name something you
liked.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.260
Okay.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:22.000
Okay, why don't you try naming something that
you didn't like.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.530
I think that's probably easier for you.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.749
That's a lot easier.

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:29.200
To start with, it's too faithful to the book.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.090
Too faithful to the book?!

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.930
Too faithful to the book?!

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:35.930
How is that possible?

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.930
Baz Luhrmann should have taken more liberties,
man.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.130
"Too faithful to the book?!"

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.409
I don't think I've ever even heard of that.

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.000
Have you ever read The Great Gatsby?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.630
Yeah, but it was a long time ago.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.289
I don't really remember it very well.

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:47.639
Yeah, well consider yourself lucky.

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:48.639
It's boring.

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:49.670
Dude, it's a classic!

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.689
Yeah, classically boring.

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.909
It is the least exciting book ever.

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.399
It's the Mad Men of books.

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.399
Alright?

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.929
It may be brilliant, but it's too, f*cking,
slow.

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.259
You have the attention span of a five year
old, alright?

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:03.819
What else didn't you like?

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:05.369
Anything else?

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.380
Tobey Maguire narrates the whole freaking
movie.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.060
This is what you do, when you try and film
a book that's in the first person with tons

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.370
of narration, and you realize, "Oh sh*t, I've
gotta do lots of voiceover."

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.420
Why not just film Toby Maguire, the actor,
sitting on a stool reading the book and call

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.420
it a day?

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.830
Right, because that would be entertaining
for everyone.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.320
Bill the movie as Peter Parker reads "The
Great Gatsby."

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.973
Andrew Garfield is Peter Parker, not Toby
MaGuire, and that's like one of the only things

00:02:31.973 --> 00:02:33.620
the new Spider-man movie got right.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.620
Alright.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.620
Alright.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.840
Well, did you at least like Leonardo Dicaprio?

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.693
Did you at least think Leo was good in the
movie.

00:02:39.693 --> 00:02:42.640
Leonardo Dicaprio was a good Gatsby.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.640
Okay.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.300
He was, you know, he was a good Gatsby.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.170
But was he a great Gatsby?

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.780
I don't know.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.350
He sounds pretty goofy saying stuff like "old
sport."

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.629
Everybody sounds goofy saying "old sport."

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.280
Even people that lived in the 20's sounded
goofy saying "Old sport."

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.910
That's, like, the whole point.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.010
That's a pretty stupid reason to write a whole
book.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.340
Did you at least find the movie visually stimulating
in any way?

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.400
Yes, but I found Prometheus visually stimulating.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.180
But I just found the story to be a snoozer.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.680
Great Gatsby the film may look pretty, alright?

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.400
But the story's got as much pep as a Model-T.
You can't blame the director for the story!

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.450
I can blame him for choosing to adapt this
book into a movie.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.440
Yeah, I certainly can.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.260
No one put a gun to his head.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.450
Well, I thought it was great, okay?

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.710
Yeah, well you liked Moulin Rouge.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.330
A lot of people like Moulin Rouge.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.460
Well a lot of people are stupid.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:57.070
You don't have a lot of friends, do you?

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.200
The movie's gorgeous, the--
Yeah, until Jay-Z shows up and pulls you right

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.569
out of the time period.

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:02.670
That's a stylistic choice, alright?

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.530
I thought it was bad-ass.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.640
Jay-Z is a lot like Gatsby, actually.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.640
That's racist.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.640
Not it's not!

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.990
Listen why can't you just accept the fact
that some books are unfilmable.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.890
Life Of Pi was supposed to be unfilmable,
right?

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.079
And then Ang Lee came along and won an Oscar
for it.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.400
Richard Pahkah!

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.310
I just walked right into that one, didn't
I?
