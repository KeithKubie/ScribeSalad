My name is Ji Chen

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.288
CEO of Ufoto

00:00:07.289 --> 00:00:09.549
Since we started the company in 2016

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.309
we've published several selfie and

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.969
social sharing apps into the global market

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.529
Our first app, Sweet Selfie

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.488
exceeded 1M Daily Active Users in less than 3 months

00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:25.419
and was featured on Google Play

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.659
As of today

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.329
the app has reached 300M downloads worldwide

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.679
Our new app Sweet Snap focuses on animated stickers

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.019
and short videos with special effects

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.222
So people can capture happy memories in a more vivid way

00:00:38.488 --> 00:00:40.711
I'm Li Zeng, Product Manager of Ufoto

00:00:40.977 --> 00:00:43.769
As our products are focused on the global market

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.549
the combination of the characteristics of selfies including

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.949
retouch, filters, stickers, collages, photo booth, frames, and backgrounds

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.329
requires that appropriate localization becomes key to sustaining high retention

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.369
For example, in India

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.929
we prepared stickers and collages with red Holi powder throwing effects

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.169
which let people celebrate the festival right in the palms of their hands

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.749
We use Firebase Remote Config to conduct an effective operation strategy

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.329
and use A/B Testing

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.109
to verify our design approach

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.259
Now our selfie assets have over 1M downloads per day

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.459
and they are used more than 5M times per day

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.129
The sharing rate of our selfie assets has increased by 100%

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.879
The challenge in emerging markets like India, Brazil and Mexico

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.309
is dealing with the varying

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.909
hardware specs and network connectivity

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.169
We use Multiple APKs

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.555
to publish different apks that each targeted to different configurations

00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:32.799
We have also developed different image processing algorithms

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.619
for different device specifications

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.039
Thanks to Android Go, we are able to deliver

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.688
a fine-tuned experience on entry level phones

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.949
We removed unnecessary dynamic libraries in our app

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.879
and let it download smaller assets

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.549
if it runs on smaller screen and storage

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.079
To optimize performance, we change cache allocation dynamically

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.309
based on the size of available RAM

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.177
If the RAM is running low, a more aggressive recycle strategy will be used

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:59.459
Our app size is 25% smaller on Android Go

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.733
and uses 20% less RAM

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:03.369
After making our apps Android Go ready

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.929
Sweet Snap's DAU has increased by 465%

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.399
Selfie represents an optimistic lifestyle

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.419
These selfies with people smiling

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.679
are what drives us forward

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.219
Google Play provides us with a global stage

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.529
by giving us the opportunity to entertain Android users in different countries

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.129
We'll continue to try to discover

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.949
new ways to take selfies

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.466
and keep helping people around the world

00:02:29.688 --> 00:02:33.377
to capture the special moments in their lives
