00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.792
We need to put a 1 half here. Remember that the guideline we just talked about

00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:09.587
said that if we have some number x to the power a and all of that taken to the

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.407
power of b, that's just equal to x to the power of a times b. We can't forget

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:19.368
that there's an invisible 1 as the exponent of the number 3. So, the power that

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.882
belongs right here must be whatever we need to multiply by 2 to get 1, and that

00:00:24.894 --> 00:00:30.304
number is 1 half. This also makes sense in the context of another rule that you

00:00:30.316 --> 00:00:35.128
know, x to the a times x to the b is equal to x to the a plus b. 3 to the 1 half

00:00:35.396 --> 00:00:39.990
times 3 to the 1 half is just equal to 3 to the 1 half plus 1 half or 3 to the

00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:42.134
1. I think this is pretty cool.
