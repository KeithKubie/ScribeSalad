Now that you've put all this effort
into making your app accessible,

00:00:02.655 --> 00:00:05.190
you'll want to be sure that
you've done a good job.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.750
As with any other app development
process, you need to test your app.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.170
The easiest way to do this is just to
turn on the accessibility services

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.360
on your device.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.200
I use Talkback, and
then I just go through the app,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.510
trying every component and
cleaning up the bad behavior.
