00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.520
- [Instructor] Blocks A
and B are pressed together

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.550
with a spring between them.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.670
When the blocks are released from rest,

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.000
the spring pushes the blocks apart

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.280
so that the 75/100 of a kilogram block A

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.010
moves up the 30 degree ramp to the left

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.840
and the 0.25 kilogram block B

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.920
moves to the right at a velocity
of three meters per second.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.060
Assume friction is negligible.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.170
Which of the following
is the best estimate

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.360
of the maximum distance d that
block A slides up the ramp?

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.550
So pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.620
All right now let's just first think about

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.620
what would happen intuitively.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.860
So we have A and B, could
imagine you're squeezing

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.450
them together so you
have that energy stored

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.283
in that spring.

00:00:43.283 --> 00:00:44.780
And then when you let go,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.590
we know that B moves to the right

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.700
and you would intuitively
think that A would move

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.910
to the left.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.030
And it seems like the law
of conservation of momentum

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.910
is going to be at play here.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.590
Because if the system of A
and B is initially at rest,

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.220
each of these blocks' velocities are zero,

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.980
doesn't matter what their masses are.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.580
That means that the total
momentum for the system

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.370
of A and B is going to be zero.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.890
So even after we let go
and B moves to the right

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.580
and A moves to the left,

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.810
the total momentum of this system

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.600
should still be zero.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.810
And so maybe we can use that to figure out

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.930
what A's velocity is as it's sliding

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.750
to the left horizontally.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.280
And then using that velocity,

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.610
well we could think about
what's its kinetic energy.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.570
And if we know its kinetic energy,

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.180
we could think about well,

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.570
as it goes up the ramp,

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.940
that kinetic energy's going to be turned

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.100
into potential energy.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.760
And so how high up the ramp would it go?

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.440
And then from that and that angle,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.860
we could figure out our distance.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.240
So let's do that.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.450
So let's start off with the law
of conservation of momentum.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.340
We know that after releasing,

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.750
A's momentum plus B's momentum

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.690
should add up to zero

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.720
because the sum of
their momentums was zero

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.330
when they were at rest together,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.680
when they were compressed.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.460
So what we could say is the momentum for A

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.980
is going to be A's mass,

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.140
so let me write it right over here,

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.817
so 0.75 kilograms is A's mass

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.220
times its velocity.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.240
Well we don't know what this is.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.360
Let's call this velocity sub

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.660
or final velocity for A,

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.870
and that's going to be
in meters per second,

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.870
plus B's mass, which is 0.25 kilograms,

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.800
times B's velocity.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.090
Well that's going to be
three meters per second,

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.010
times three meters per second.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.090
This should be equal to zero.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.930
And so now we just have to solve for that.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.490
And so what do we get?

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.760
Let's see, if we subtract this part

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.800
from both sides,

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.960
we will get,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.700
and this is just 0.75
kilogram meters per second,

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.910
so we'll get 0.75 kilograms

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.096
times the A's velocity
after it gets released

00:03:04.096 --> 00:03:08.530
is equal to negative 0.75

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.550
kilogram meters per second.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.270
And so if you divide both
sides by 0.75 kilograms,

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.500
on the left, you're just
going to be left with

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.580
the velocity of A,

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.600
and on the right,

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.150
you would be left with negative one,

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.150
then the kilograms would go away,

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.430
negative one meters per second.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.920
So A's velocity as it
lets go from the spring

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.768
or as it loses contact with that spring

00:03:35.768 --> 00:03:39.240
is going to be negative
one meters per second.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.575
Now what does the negative mean?

00:03:40.575 --> 00:03:44.200
Well if to the right is positive
three meters per second,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.170
then to the left is going to be negative.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.480
So it's going to be moving to the left

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.620
at one meter per second.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.760
So let's use that
information to think about

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.000
how far up the ramp it's going to go,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.062
and we're assuming that
friction is negligible

00:03:56.062 --> 00:03:58.840
and nothing really
interesting happens here,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.450
although we know in the
real world it might bump

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.710
a little bit, but we're
just going to assume

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.370
that that's not going
to be a major factor.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.310
And so all of that kinetic energy

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.560
when it's moving to the
left at one meter per second

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.210
is going to be converted to
potential energy at some height.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.440
So let's say that once
all of the kinetic energy

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.150
turns into potential energy,

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.200
A is at an altitude of h.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.330
So what's its potential energy going to be

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.760
at that point in time?

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.800
Well it's going to be the mass of A

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.530
times the gravitational field,

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.690
roughly 9.8 meters per second squared,

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.690
if we wanna be even rougher

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.140
say 10 meters per second squared,

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.760
times that height.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.950
So that's going to be once
all of our kinetic energy

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.010
has been turned into potential energy.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.630
Well this should be equal to the amount

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.270
of kinetic energy we had at
this point right over here.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.680
Well what is that going to be?

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.720
Well that's going to be 1/2 m v squared.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.440
So it's 1/2 times the mass of A

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.690
times the velocity of A squared.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.800
So the velocity is negative
one meters per second,

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.940
and then we're going to square it.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.250
Well we could divide both
sides by the mass of A.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.430
Negative one squared is
just going to be a one.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.880
So this is just going
to be a one eventually.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.900
And so you're left with
and then we can divide

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.280
both sides by g,

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.180
and we see that our height is equal to

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.190
1/2 and then we're going to have,

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.693
divided by g,

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.850
divided by g, and then
this is going to be meters.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.210
And so what is this going to roughly be?

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.360
Well h is going to be approximately,

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.330
let's say that g is approximately
10 meters per second,

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.500
because they talk about estimating here.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.500
So this would be one over two times 10,

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.090
and then we're gonna get meters.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.990
So this is gonna be 1/20 of a meter.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.990
So h is approximately 0.05 meters.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:56.620
So you might be tempted to say oh look

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.453
there's an answer there,

00:05:57.453 --> 00:05:59.100
but remember they're not asking us this h.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.800
They're asking us this d.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.280
And so here we just you have to use

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.410
a little bit of trigonometry.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.250
Where we say okay what trig ratio deals

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.300
with the opposite of an
angle and the hypotenuse?

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.360
This is a right triangle right over here.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.830
Well that would be sine.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.563
So sine of 30 degrees,

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.670
sine of 30 degrees,

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.400
would be equal to the opposite
side which is h over d.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.530
We know that h is 0.05.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:28.860
Sine of 30 degrees,

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.300
if you don't have a calculator
this is a good one to know,

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.958
is 1/2, so you have

00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:37.770
1/2 is equal to 0.05 divided by d.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.320
We can multiply both sides by d,

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.330
and then you'll have d over two

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.260
is equal to 0.05

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.040
or multiply both sides
by two and you get d

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.400
is equal to 0.10

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.460
or I could say roughly equal to

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.010
since we are estimating.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.780
We had an estimate for g there.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.623
And then this is choice
D right over there.
