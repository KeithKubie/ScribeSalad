absolutely so yeah I think you know the

absolutely so yeah I think you know the

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
scrolling is definitely usable but as
 

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.500 align:start position:0%

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:27.510 align:start position:0%
you said it wasn't the standout there
 

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.300 align:start position:0%
you said it wasn't the standout there
are<00:07:27.660><c> apps</c><00:07:27.990><c> that</c><00:07:28.200><c> scroll</c><00:07:28.500><c> a</c><00:07:28.740><c> lot</c><00:07:28.980><c> better</c><00:07:29.220><c> than</c>

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.310 align:start position:0%
are apps that scroll a lot better than
 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.670 align:start position:0%
are apps that scroll a lot better than
this<00:07:29.640><c> but</c><00:07:30.630><c> in</c><00:07:30.750><c> general</c><00:07:31.050><c> the</c><00:07:31.110><c> performance</c><00:07:31.560><c> is</c>

00:11:34.459 --> 00:11:36.999 align:start position:0%
resource leak but yeah the problem
exactly<00:11:34.910><c> it's</c><00:11:35.089><c> we</c><00:11:36.079><c> do</c><00:11:36.230><c> cache</c><00:11:36.439><c> images</c><00:11:36.829><c> so</c><00:11:36.920><c> they</c>

00:11:36.999 --> 00:11:37.009 align:start position:0%
exactly it's we do cache images so they
 

00:11:37.009 --> 00:11:39.999 align:start position:0%
exactly it's we do cache images so they
have<00:11:37.129><c> to</c><00:11:37.279><c> layer</c><00:11:37.459><c> 2</c><00:11:37.730><c> 2</c><00:11:38.720><c> layer</c><00:11:38.899><c> caching</c><00:11:39.319><c> yeah</c><00:11:39.800><c> and</c>

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:40.009 align:start position:0%
have to layer 2 2 layer caching yeah and
 

00:11:40.009 --> 00:11:42.129 align:start position:0%
have to layer 2 2 layer caching yeah and
the<00:11:40.100><c> disk</c><00:11:40.279><c> caching</c><00:11:40.600><c> it</c><00:11:41.600><c> sees</c><00:11:41.839><c> that</c><00:11:41.959><c> in</c><00:11:42.079><c> this</c>

00:11:42.129 --> 00:11:42.139 align:start position:0%
the disk caching it sees that in this
 

00:11:42.139 --> 00:11:43.569 align:start position:0%
the disk caching it sees that in this
caching<00:11:42.529><c> is</c><00:11:42.649><c> causing</c><00:11:43.009><c> some</c><00:11:43.189><c> of</c><00:11:43.220><c> these</c><00:11:43.370><c> issues</c>

00:11:43.569 --> 00:11:43.579 align:start position:0%
caching is causing some of these issues
 

00:11:43.579 --> 00:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
caching is causing some of these issues
as<00:11:43.850><c> well</c><00:11:44.000><c> as</c><00:11:44.149><c> so</c><00:11:44.269><c> the</c><00:11:44.389><c> seek</c><00:11:44.569><c> time</c><00:11:44.600><c> on</c><00:11:44.959><c> disk</c>

00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:45.649 align:start position:0%
as well as so the seek time on disk
 

00:11:45.649 --> 00:11:47.379 align:start position:0%
as well as so the seek time on disk
which<00:11:46.250><c> is</c><00:11:46.399><c> what</c><00:11:46.550><c> we're</c><00:11:46.730><c> trying</c><00:11:46.850><c> to</c><00:11:47.029><c> figure</c><00:11:47.360><c> out</c>

right<00:11:47.660><c> now</c><00:11:47.809><c> and</c><00:11:47.990><c> finalize</c><00:11:48.410><c> okay</c><00:11:49.370><c> yeah</c><00:11:49.610><c> we'll</c>

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:49.790 align:start position:0%
right now and finalize okay yeah we'll
 

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:51.009 align:start position:0%
right now and finalize okay yeah we'll
definitely<00:11:50.059><c> be</c><00:11:50.329><c> keeping</c><00:11:50.360><c> an</c><00:11:50.750><c> eye</c><00:11:50.779><c> out</c><00:11:50.990><c> for</c>

00:11:51.009 --> 00:11:51.019 align:start position:0%
definitely be keeping an eye out for
 

00:11:51.019 --> 00:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
definitely be keeping an eye out for
that<00:11:51.290><c> it</c><00:11:51.889><c> sounds</c><00:11:52.100><c> like</c><00:11:52.220><c> you've</c><00:11:52.370><c> pretty</c><00:11:52.759><c> much</c>

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:52.850 align:start position:0%
that it sounds like you've pretty much
 

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:54.699 align:start position:0%
that it sounds like you've pretty much
already<00:11:53.059><c> done</c><00:11:53.389><c> all</c><00:11:53.480><c> the</c><00:11:53.629><c> things</c><00:11:53.839><c> that</c><00:11:53.930><c> we</c><00:11:54.170><c> we</c>

00:11:54.699 --> 00:11:54.709 align:start position:0%
already done all the things that we we
 

00:11:54.709 --> 00:11:56.350 align:start position:0%
already done all the things that we we
thought<00:11:54.889><c> needed</c><00:11:55.189><c> to</c><00:11:55.220><c> be</c><00:11:55.279><c> doing</c><00:11:55.639><c> so</c><00:11:55.879><c> I'm</c><00:11:56.149><c> right</c>

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
thought needed to be doing so I'm right
 

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.129 align:start position:0%
thought needed to be doing so I'm right
you<00:11:56.540><c> know</c><00:11:57.399><c> we're</c><00:11:58.449><c> we're</c><00:11:59.449><c> still</c><00:11:59.569><c> looking</c><00:11:59.959><c> for</c><00:12:00.110><c> a</c>

00:12:00.129 --> 00:12:00.139 align:start position:0%
you know we're we're still looking for a
 

00:12:00.139 --> 00:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
you know we're we're still looking for a
pure<00:12:00.350><c> Java</c><00:12:00.620><c> solution</c><00:12:01.100><c> but</c><00:12:01.279><c> I</c><00:12:01.309><c> think</c><00:12:01.519><c> that</c><00:12:02.290><c> for</c>

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:03.290 align:start position:0%
pure Java solution but I think that for
 

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:05.049 align:start position:0%
pure Java solution but I think that for
some<00:12:03.350><c> photo</c><00:12:03.949><c> things</c><00:12:04.339><c> you</c><00:12:04.550><c> actually</c><00:12:04.850><c> do</c><00:12:05.029><c> have</c>

00:12:05.049 --> 00:12:05.059 align:start position:0%
some photo things you actually do have
 

00:12:05.059 --> 00:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
some photo things you actually do have
to<00:12:05.269><c> drop</c><00:12:05.629><c> down</c><00:12:05.839><c> into</c><00:12:06.529><c> the</c><00:12:06.709><c> Linux</c><00:12:06.949><c> layer</c><00:12:07.189><c> and</c><00:12:07.429><c> an</c>

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:07.490 align:start position:0%
to drop down into the Linux layer and an
 

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
to drop down into the Linux layer and an

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:10.250 align:start position:0%
NDK because at that point you can do
 

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:13.829 align:start position:0%
NDK because at that point you can do
efficient<00:12:10.670><c> file</c><00:12:10.879><c> mapping</c><00:12:11.389><c> and</c><00:12:11.779><c> you</c><00:12:12.019><c> can</c><00:12:12.199><c> do</c>

00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
efficient file mapping and you can do
 

00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:17.769 align:start position:0%
efficient file mapping and you can do
decoding<00:12:15.279><c> with</c><00:12:16.279><c> neon</c><00:12:16.939><c> instructions</c><00:12:17.480><c> instead</c>

00:12:17.769 --> 00:12:17.779 align:start position:0%
decoding with neon instructions instead
 

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:19.449 align:start position:0%

00:12:19.449 --> 00:12:19.459 align:start position:0%

uh you have one for that I think we did
for<00:13:00.830><c> I</c><00:13:00.860><c> am</c><00:13:01.100><c> I</c><00:13:01.130><c> think</c><00:13:01.490><c> I</c><00:13:01.670><c> think</c><00:13:01.910><c> Roman</c><00:13:02.089><c> left</c><00:13:02.360><c> that</c>

working once again so this is a little
 

00:16:11.079 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
working once again so this is a little
bit<00:16:11.169><c> more</c><00:16:11.319><c> like</c><00:16:11.889><c> I</c><00:16:12.189><c> am</c><00:16:12.639><c> in</c><00:16:12.939><c> that</c><00:16:13.089><c> it</c><00:16:13.239><c> is</c>

00:16:13.759 --> 00:16:13.769 align:start position:0%
bit more like I am in that it is
 

00:16:13.769 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%

00:16:16.199 --> 00:16:16.209 align:start position:0%
effectively a camera replacement I think
 

00:16:16.209 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
effectively a camera replacement I think
the<00:16:16.329><c> the</c><00:16:16.509><c> key</c><00:16:16.659><c> difference</c><00:16:17.079><c> here</c><00:16:17.139><c> was</c><00:16:17.439><c> that</c>

00:16:17.639 --> 00:16:17.649 align:start position:0%
the the key difference here was that
 

00:16:17.649 --> 00:16:19.259 align:start position:0%
the the key difference here was that
camera<00:16:17.919><c> zoom</c><00:16:18.069><c> effects</c><00:16:18.369><c> wasn't</c><00:16:18.879><c> so</c><00:16:19.029><c> much</c><00:16:19.209><c> about</c>

00:16:19.259 --> 00:16:19.269 align:start position:0%
camera zoom effects wasn't so much about
 

00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:21.359 align:start position:0%
camera zoom effects wasn't so much about

00:16:21.359 --> 00:16:21.369 align:start position:0%
the community of photography it was more
 

00:16:21.369 --> 00:16:23.069 align:start position:0%
the community of photography it was more
about<00:16:21.579><c> being</c><00:16:21.759><c> able</c><00:16:21.909><c> to</c><00:16:22.029><c> create</c><00:16:22.209><c> great</c><00:16:22.659><c> photos</c>

00:16:23.069 --> 00:16:23.079 align:start position:0%
about being able to create great photos
 

00:16:23.079 --> 00:16:24.779 align:start position:0%
about being able to create great photos
with<00:16:23.379><c> an</c><00:16:23.559><c> app</c><00:16:23.709><c> that</c><00:16:23.949><c> replaces</c><00:16:24.429><c> the</c><00:16:24.459><c> native</c>

00:16:24.779 --> 00:16:24.789 align:start position:0%
with an app that replaces the native
 

00:16:24.789 --> 00:16:26.099 align:start position:0%
with an app that replaces the native

hear Alexes I think where we gave it a

hear Alexes I think where we gave it a

guide<00:16:34.839><c> and</c><00:16:35.049><c> this</c><00:16:35.139><c> is</c><00:16:35.259><c> in</c><00:16:35.379><c> fact</c><00:16:35.409><c> an</c><00:16:35.859><c> app</c><00:16:36.429><c> which</c>

Roman<00:16:37.329><c> and</c><00:16:37.449><c> his</c><00:16:37.509><c> team</c><00:16:37.779><c> took</c><00:16:38.379><c> a</c><00:16:38.559><c> look</c><00:16:38.829><c> at</c><00:16:38.979><c> so</c><00:16:39.159><c> I</c>

00:16:39.179 --> 00:16:39.189 align:start position:0%
Roman and his team took a look at so I
 

00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:41.549 align:start position:0%
Roman and his team took a look at so I
think<00:16:39.279><c> we'll</c><00:16:39.579><c> actually</c><00:16:39.729><c> start</c><00:16:40.359><c> by</c><00:16:41.079><c> having</c><00:16:41.439><c> a</c>

00:16:41.549 --> 00:16:41.559 align:start position:0%
think we'll actually start by having a
 

00:16:41.559 --> 00:16:44.339 align:start position:0%
think we'll actually start by having a
quick<00:16:41.799><c> look</c><00:16:42.069><c> at</c><00:16:42.279><c> some</c><00:16:42.309><c> of</c><00:16:42.579><c> those</c><00:16:42.819><c> changes</c><00:16:43.479><c> so</c>

00:16:44.339 --> 00:16:44.349 align:start position:0%
quick look at some of those changes so
 

00:16:44.349 --> 00:16:46.109 align:start position:0%
quick look at some of those changes so
Roman<00:16:45.219><c> if</c><00:16:45.339><c> you</c><00:16:45.429><c> want</c><00:16:45.579><c> to</c><00:16:45.639><c> talk</c><00:16:45.939><c> us</c><00:16:45.969><c> through</c>

00:16:54.359 --> 00:16:54.369 align:start position:0%
you know some of the thinking behind the
 

00:16:54.369 --> 00:16:56.910 align:start position:0%
you know some of the thinking behind the
changes<00:16:54.730><c> that</c><00:16:54.819><c> you</c><00:16:54.939><c> did</c><00:16:55.149><c> and</c><00:16:55.689><c> we</c><00:16:55.990><c> can</c><00:16:56.139><c> let</c><00:16:56.259><c> Alex</c>

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
changes that you did and we can let Alex
 

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.419 align:start position:0%
changes that you did and we can let Alex
tell<00:16:57.519><c> us</c><00:16:57.639><c> why</c><00:16:57.790><c> they</c><00:16:57.970><c> are</c><00:16:58.149><c> not</c><00:16:58.629><c> a</c><00:16:58.689><c> good</c><00:16:58.779><c> idea</c>

00:16:59.419 --> 00:16:59.429 align:start position:0%
tell us why they are not a good idea
 

00:16:59.429 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
tell us why they are not a good idea
yeah<00:17:00.429><c> so</c><00:17:00.790><c> like</c><00:17:01.779><c> we</c><00:17:01.899><c> said</c><00:17:02.050><c> an</c><00:17:02.139><c> Android</c><00:17:02.410><c> design</c>

00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:02.649 align:start position:0%
yeah so like we said an Android design
 

00:17:02.649 --> 00:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
yeah so like we said an Android design
in<00:17:02.679><c> action</c><00:17:02.829><c> I</c><00:17:03.160><c> think</c><00:17:03.369><c> the</c><00:17:03.879><c> main</c><00:17:04.089><c> thing</c><00:17:04.149><c> that</c><00:17:04.449><c> we</c>

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:04.510 align:start position:0%
in action I think the main thing that we
 

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:06.090 align:start position:0%
in action I think the main thing that we
wanted<00:17:04.720><c> to</c><00:17:04.839><c> do</c><00:17:05.020><c> is</c><00:17:05.319><c> from</c><00:17:05.709><c> an</c><00:17:05.860><c> interaction</c>

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:06.100 align:start position:0%
wanted to do is from an interaction
 

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:09.210 align:start position:0%
wanted to do is from an interaction
standpoint<00:17:06.819><c> just</c><00:17:06.970><c> simplify</c><00:17:07.720><c> the</c><00:17:08.589><c> location</c><00:17:09.100><c> of</c>

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:09.220 align:start position:0%
standpoint just simplify the location of
 

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.429 align:start position:0%
standpoint just simplify the location of
things<00:17:09.459><c> so</c><00:17:09.789><c> we</c><00:17:09.939><c> basically</c><00:17:10.120><c> put</c><00:17:10.480><c> the</c><00:17:10.659><c> camera</c><00:17:11.199><c> in</c>

00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
things so we basically put the camera in
 

00:17:11.439 --> 00:17:14.220 align:start position:0%
things so we basically put the camera in
settings<00:17:11.919><c> and</c><00:17:12.309><c> the</c><00:17:12.459><c> right</c><00:17:12.640><c> and</c><00:17:13.390><c> then</c><00:17:13.539><c> effects</c>

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:14.230 align:start position:0%
settings and the right and then effects
 

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.169 align:start position:0%
settings and the right and then effects
which<00:17:14.380><c> is</c><00:17:14.500><c> I</c><00:17:14.620><c> think</c><00:17:14.679><c> the</c><00:17:15.459><c> most</c><00:17:15.610><c> awesome</c><00:17:16.029><c> part</c>

00:17:16.169 --> 00:17:16.179 align:start position:0%
which is I think the most awesome part
 

00:17:16.179 --> 00:17:18.149 align:start position:0%
which is I think the most awesome part
of<00:17:16.299><c> this</c><00:17:16.360><c> app</c><00:17:16.569><c> so</c><00:17:16.870><c> many</c><00:17:17.169><c> awesome</c><00:17:17.289><c> effects</c><00:17:17.799><c> we</c>

00:17:18.149 --> 00:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
of this app so many awesome effects we
 

00:17:18.159 --> 00:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
of this app so many awesome effects we
put<00:17:18.339><c> that</c><00:17:18.429><c> on</c><00:17:18.490><c> the</c><00:17:18.610><c> left</c><00:17:18.880><c> just</c><00:17:19.000><c> to</c><00:17:19.179><c> simplify</c>

00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:19.630 align:start position:0%
put that on the left just to simplify
 

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:21.809 align:start position:0%
put that on the left just to simplify
the<00:17:19.689><c> model</c><00:17:19.929><c> for</c><00:17:20.350><c> users</c><00:17:20.649><c> and</c><00:17:21.339><c> then</c><00:17:21.459><c> we</c><00:17:21.549><c> started</c>

00:17:21.809 --> 00:17:21.819 align:start position:0%
the model for users and then we started
 

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:23.699 align:start position:0%
the model for users and then we started
grouping<00:17:22.179><c> things</c><00:17:22.510><c> like</c><00:17:22.899><c> the</c><00:17:23.110><c> the</c><00:17:23.439><c> shutter</c>

00:17:23.699 --> 00:17:23.709 align:start position:0%
grouping things like the the shutter
 

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:26.220 align:start position:0%
grouping things like the the shutter
time<00:17:24.010><c> or</c><00:17:24.699><c> the</c><00:17:24.789><c> shutter</c><00:17:24.939><c> type</c><00:17:25.299><c> and</c><00:17:25.569><c> the</c><00:17:25.899><c> camera</c>

and<00:18:53.950><c> you</c><00:18:54.250><c> know</c><00:18:54.370><c> 1.5</c><00:18:54.940><c> 1.6</c>

00:18:56.149 --> 00:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
and you know 1.5 1.6
 

00:18:56.159 --> 00:18:58.919 align:start position:0%
and you know 1.5 1.6
so<00:18:57.159><c> yeah</c><00:18:57.760><c> kind</c><00:18:58.120><c> of</c><00:18:58.149><c> built</c><00:18:58.330><c> from</c><00:18:58.360><c> there</c><00:18:58.570><c> digital</c>

00:18:58.919 --> 00:18:58.929 align:start position:0%
so yeah kind of built from there digital
 

00:18:58.929 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
so yeah kind of built from there digital
zoom<00:18:59.110><c> was</c><00:18:59.350><c> was</c><00:18:59.740><c> kind</c><00:18:59.980><c> of</c><00:19:00.070><c> what</c><00:19:00.250><c> started</c><00:19:00.700><c> it</c>

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:00.970 align:start position:0%
zoom was was kind of what started it
 

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:01.550 align:start position:0%
zoom was was kind of what started it
hence<00:19:01.149><c> the</c><00:19:01.299><c> name</c>

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
hence the name
 

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.410 align:start position:0%
hence the name
and<00:19:01.800><c> we</c><00:19:01.890><c> originally</c><00:19:02.190><c> can</c><00:19:02.430><c> resume</c><00:19:02.670><c> that</c><00:19:03.150><c> Megan</c>

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
and we originally can resume that Megan

we<00:19:03.510><c> edit</c><00:19:03.780><c> the</c><00:19:03.870><c> air</c><00:19:03.990><c> first</c><00:19:04.170><c> change</c><00:19:04.830><c> the</c><00:19:04.950><c> name</c><00:19:05.100><c> to</c>

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:05.220 align:start position:0%
we edit the air first change the name to
 

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
we edit the air first change the name to
can<00:19:05.370><c> receive</c><00:19:05.580><c> it</c><00:19:05.790><c> I</c><00:19:06.030><c> see</c><00:19:06.210><c> what</c><00:19:06.330><c> you</c><00:19:06.450><c> did</c><00:19:06.540><c> there</c>

can receive it I see what you did there
 

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:09.980 align:start position:0%
can receive it I see what you did there
yep<00:19:08.150><c> it's</c><00:19:09.150><c> getting</c><00:19:09.450><c> longer</c><00:19:09.600><c> and</c><00:19:09.720><c> longer</c><00:19:09.810><c> I</c>

yep it's getting longer and longer I
 

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
yep it's getting longer and longer I
don't<00:19:10.170><c> think</c><00:19:10.320><c> we'll</c><00:19:10.410><c> change</c><00:19:10.560><c> the</c><00:19:10.680><c> name</c><00:19:10.740><c> again</c>

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:12.650 align:start position:0%
don't think we'll change the name again
 

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:15.230 align:start position:0%
don't think we'll change the name again
but<00:19:13.650><c> but</c><00:19:13.920><c> yeah</c><00:19:14.010><c> I</c><00:19:14.070><c> mean</c><00:19:14.130><c> essentially</c><00:19:14.730><c> that</c>

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
but but yeah I mean essentially that
 

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.850 align:start position:0%
but but yeah I mean essentially that
there<00:19:15.720><c> are</c><00:19:15.900><c> kind</c><00:19:16.050><c> of</c><00:19:16.200><c> too</c><00:19:16.290><c> hard</c><00:19:16.320><c> to</c><00:19:16.620><c> the</c><00:19:16.710><c> apps</c>

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
there are kind of too hard to the apps
 

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.530 align:start position:0%
there are kind of too hard to the apps
there<00:19:17.070><c> as</c><00:19:17.250><c> you</c><00:19:17.550><c> mentioned</c><00:19:17.940><c> that</c><00:19:18.000><c> the</c><00:19:18.330><c> first</c>

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
there as you mentioned that the first
 

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.100 align:start position:0%
there as you mentioned that the first
half<00:19:18.720><c> is</c><00:19:18.900><c> is</c><00:19:19.110><c> at</c><00:19:19.260><c> the</c><00:19:19.410><c> capture</c><00:19:19.740><c> time</c><00:19:19.920><c> trying</c><00:19:20.640><c> to</c>

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:21.110 align:start position:0%
half is is at the capture time trying to
 

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
half is is at the capture time trying to
kind<00:19:22.110><c> of</c><00:19:22.140><c> improve</c><00:19:22.410><c> on</c><00:19:22.590><c> the</c><00:19:22.710><c> ability</c><00:19:23.370><c> that</c>

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:23.490 align:start position:0%
kind of improve on the ability that
 

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:25.250 align:start position:0%
kind of improve on the ability that
people<00:19:23.520><c> have</c><00:19:23.880><c> what</c><00:19:24.300><c> they're</c><00:19:24.480><c> composing</c><00:19:25.110><c> and</c>

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
people have what they're composing and
 

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.020 align:start position:0%
people have what they're composing and
taking<00:19:25.530><c> pictures</c><00:19:25.890><c> so</c><00:19:26.160><c> we're</c><00:19:26.820><c> looking</c><00:19:27.000><c> at</c>

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:27.030 align:start position:0%
taking pictures so we're looking at
 

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
taking pictures so we're looking at
things<00:19:27.150><c> like</c><00:19:27.300><c> a</c><00:19:27.390><c> grid</c><00:19:27.660><c> compositions</c><00:19:28.320><c> stable</c>

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:29.130 align:start position:0%
things like a grid compositions stable
 

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.190 align:start position:0%
things like a grid compositions stable

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:33.990 align:start position:0%
time-lapse but to make for example we
 

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:37.180 align:start position:0%
time-lapse but to make for example we
can<00:19:34.140><c> take</c><00:19:34.500><c> up</c><00:19:34.740><c> to</c><00:19:34.770><c> 10</c><00:19:35.250><c> 10</c><00:19:35.970><c> shots</c><00:19:36.240><c> per</c><00:19:36.360><c> second</c>

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:37.190 align:start position:0%
can take up to 10 10 shots per second
 

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:42.350 align:start position:0%
can take up to 10 10 shots per second
and<00:19:38.390><c> I</c><00:19:39.710><c> guess</c><00:19:40.710><c> kind</c><00:19:41.610><c> of</c><00:19:41.670><c> where</c><00:19:41.790><c> we're</c><00:19:41.910><c> going</c><00:19:41.940><c> is</c>

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
and I guess kind of where we're going is
 

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.330 align:start position:0%
and I guess kind of where we're going is
we<00:19:42.600><c> look</c><00:19:43.230><c> at</c><00:19:43.350><c> doing</c><00:19:43.500><c> a</c><00:19:43.560><c> major</c><00:19:43.740><c> update</c><00:19:44.010><c> every</c>
