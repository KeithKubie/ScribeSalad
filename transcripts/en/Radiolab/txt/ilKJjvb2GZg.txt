Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab. Today's topic, parasites, where we have already learned that parasites can be good. Sometimes Harris' fades can of course be very bad. That also parasites can affect human behavior. Making this, some of us a little lethargic or solving our allergies. Yeah. Here's the question to consider though. Can they not just affect our behavior? Can they control our behavior and different question in time? Yeah. And you know, we were, we were thinking about this question, you know, in the abstract doing some research, but then things got kind of real when our producer Ellen Horn called in late to work one day.

Speaker 2:          00:37          Hey Lulu, it's Alan. I just got home from the, that um, I've been waiting on chest x rays, um, blood work from my cat.

Speaker 1:          00:44          She managed staff to meet with them. This is my cat, my big, lovely affectionate kitty. She's like the sweetest cat you will ever meet. I've met Louis. He's a very sweet cat. He's a darling. But Moose has, uh, digestion problems. And this one day I had to take her to the vet and as I was putting her into the kitty carrier,

Speaker 2:          01:07          she managed the scratch me with her bat claws and like a bloody wound on my hand. Her back claws are like totally pooped covered. So I'm kind of worried I have six months pregnant.

Speaker 1:          01:20          The very first thing that they tell you when you get pregnant is stay away from cat poop. So after it happened, I called my with my CSC. Are you ready for me? Yeah. She told me to rush right down to her office to bled pretty profusely. H did. Wait a second. Why? What's so scary about cat poop? Well, it turns out that cat poop can have in it this tiny parasite called Toxoplasma Gondii. Well what is the threat to the baby if it gets to the baby? It can cause miscarriage. It can cause stillbirth and it can also cause seizures, blindness. So you're, you're, you're freaking out at this point. Yeah, I'm kind of freaking out the, this cranium small head. Ah. My midwife said there's probably nothing to worry about. So just took my blood. That's probably the better arm. Can you say question yet? And she sent me home. The turnaround time for the test is between two and three days. Okay. Okay. So I'm looking, um, the Antoinette, yeah. At home I proceed to get myself even more freaked out. A bunch of things about toxoplasma. One of the things that I found was this lecture by Robert Sapolsky.

Speaker 3:          02:32          Tell me an example I'm talking about here.

Speaker 1:          02:34          He's a neuroscientist who we've had on the show.

Speaker 3:          02:37          It has to do with a parasite called Toxoplasma.

Speaker 1:          02:40          And um, I just decided that I was going to call them up. Hello and ask a few questions. Okay. So what's the deal with Toxo? And he proceeded to tell me one of the most amazing zinc feats of mind control, but I'd ever heard one. What'd he tell you? Well, the first thing he me is that toxo

Speaker 4:          03:00          doesn't actually want to be in me. Yes. It really has wandered off into the wrong county. If it winds up in a human, it wants to be inside Moose for totally mysterious reasons, at least to me. Toxo can only reproduce sexually in the gut of cat, so it's there in mooses intestines that the toxoplasma meet and hook up. Then they lay eggs. Next Moose takes a trip to the backyard where she EGX those eggs in her put. See what's out there now on the cat feces. Step two says, suppose key is that, you know, maybe a week later a rat will come along and eat the cat poop. Now toxo has a problem. It's stuck inside a rat that really wants to be inside a cat, but rats totally freak out whenever they so much as even smell cat. It's, it's a hardwired aversion and talk. Sue's evolutionary challenge now has been to figure out how to get rodents inside cat stomachs.

Speaker 4:          04:03          Here is where the mind control comes in and it's kind of hard to believe, but this is what supposed to be says happens. Toxo starts off in the stomach. The welding takes about six weeks to migrate its way up to the brain and once it's in there, it finds this particular region called the Amygdala, which isn't like command central for year end design error, all of that. It also finds this other region kind of right next door where a very different emotion, legs sexual around. So one way he ran way in what talks so seems to be able to do is to somehow cross the wires. This may be some horrifically simplified sound bite, but what I think is going on is the talkshow knows how to make cat urine smell sexy. What to rodents, which that is so likable, totally bizarre. But talk soap makes rodents like the smell of cats and thus they approach and they're more likely to wind up in the cat stomach.

Speaker 4:          05:09          That's rough. Yeah. In all other ways. The written is totally normal. Normal olfaction in normal social behavior. Just hot for cats. Oh good, good. I start to wonder. Well, this really likes the microphone. I love cats. Yeah. Is it possible that Toxo Lucy is wonderful, is what's been drawing me to cats. Sorry, we let her put her for everywhere. I ask him pure speculation, but people who think about this stuff with you, it is not just purely speculative. The notion that talk so can produce some sort of attraction to cats and humans. They don't think that's all that crazy, Lisa. So you're saying that like the crazy cat lady could be toxoplasma? Well, no one's really studied that yet. Testing, testing.

Speaker 1:          05:58          But there are scientists out there that are making the case that talks o can really change you. Okay.

Speaker 4:          06:03          Probably the most interesting established link is between Toxo and schizophrenia.

Speaker 1:          06:08          Are you Dr Tori? Yep. There's actually been last count, 54 studies on Toxoplasma in people with schizophrenia and other psychosis. That's Dr. Fuller Torrey. He works at the Stanley Medical Research Institute that sponsors a lot of these studies. Well, I've been doing research on schizophrenia since the early seventies anything? So there's a link. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          06:29          not a huge effect. Very, very small risk of schizophrenia simply because schizophrenia is very rare.

Speaker 1:          06:36          Well, why would it cause schizophrenia to begin with? Is it trying to cause schizophrenia? Is that you imagine if the Toxo is sort of lost in the brain. It thinks it's in a rat brain. Maybe it's just trying to do what it usually does to rats, but in humans it has a very different effect. Nice. And one of the reasons he thinks this might be true, this connection between Toxoplasma and schizophrenia is because of a historical link. The fact that what we now call schizophrenia was quite rare until the late part of the 18th century. And then during the 18 hundreds, schizophrenia increased very rapidly. Why? This was the first time when we started to keep catches pets.

Speaker 5:          07:18          They first were adopted by the um, kind of east Greenwich village types in parish, the artists. And it was really considered kind of weird, but it's the kind of thing that if you were an artist or writer or something like that, you started to do a mini kind of spread to London now where the writers and artists kept it there. And then starting in about the 1840s, he had started to become a little bit more popular. And then in the 1860s and seventies, it was what called a cat. Crazy cats were all over bleeding cards. The first cat show was at London and 1870 and Madison Square Garden, I agreed to 80 it became very fashionable to have a cat,

Speaker 1:          08:03          we should say. I mean he'll agree at this point it's just a theory. Okay. But is there any evidence that toxo can actually control our behavior like it does with the rats? Well, there are some scientists out there who believe that toxo may affect something more common to all. Okay,

Speaker 4:          08:19          here's another one of those gimme a break. That's Robert Sapolsky. Again, science fiction branches to the story. Two different groups independently have seen people who are toxo infected have two to four times the likelihood of dying in car accidents.

Speaker 1:          08:36          Really? Yeah. And I asked him why,

Speaker 4:          08:38          insofar as toxo makes Rodens get really imprudent about cat smells, maybe toxo is making all sorts of mammals get imprudent about anything that they're normally a skittish about, like your body hurdling through space at a high speed.

Speaker 1:          08:53          So in the end it might be possible, might be possible that talkshow is guiding our emotions.

Speaker 6:          09:05          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          09:06          changing who we are in some basic way. And if you consider that toxo might just be one of thousands of tiny little parasites inside us pulling our strings from the inside. Well, that thought is pretty creepy.

Speaker 4:          09:21          Even if the entire lesson with toxo is a small subset of infected people now have one half of 1% more likelihood of wanting to drive really recklessly. Um, even lurking in that one half of 1% are some serious implications for thinking about freewill. We haven't a clue the biology lurking in the background that makes freewill seem a little bit suspect. Either way, whatever happened with your test.

Speaker 6:          09:52          Whoa.

Speaker 1:          09:53          Well this is me with my midwife, Barry Winter, my absence. She's giving me the news, whatever we find out from the Tux. So test that you have had past infection with toxoplasma

Speaker 6:          10:06          positive,

Speaker 1:          10:09          you're positive. Yeah, but my midwife says that the baby's going to be okay. So the baby look like she's small. She looks like she's a nice size too. A little bit on the larger size. So not a baby I'd be worried about and I believe her. Thanks Helen. Sure.
