00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.840
When multiplying fractions,
you multiply the numerator and

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.060
multiply the denominator.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.250
So, in order for us to have gotten one
fourth here, we multiplied 1 times 1,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.724
to get 1, and
you multiplied 2 by 2 to get 4.
