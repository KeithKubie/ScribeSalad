00:00:00.363 --> 00:00:02.946
 Netflix developer story for Android 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.060
 We have seen significant growth in emerging markets 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.160
 Many of these markets rely on mobile users 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.210
 Some of these users enter the Internet for the first time using their phones 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.090
 The phones they use most of the time rely on Android 

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.385
 Improving the performance of our Android app is critical to us 

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:24.730
 Because we look forward to offering a great experience for those markets 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.940
 Application size is an important component of Netflix 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.630
 Because it directly affects the installation rate 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.690
 When Google announced the dynamic application and delivery package 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.600
 We were very happy 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.890
 This has given us many potentials to benefit from and to improve our application 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.860
 By improving the size of our application 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.830
 Go to use the application package and dynamic features 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.050
 We must first identify the elements we want to modify 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.030
 Take into consideration any large component and restrict usage 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.930
 Such as language and translation 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.600
 And we turned around one of the features we offer 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.660
 They communicate with customer support service, to dynamic advantage 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.150
 So if the user really needs this feature 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.780
 Will go to the Help section 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.890
 This feature will be downloaded to this user 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.930
 Go to the application package and the dynamic features 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.090
 Enables us to reduce application download by 33% 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.210
 Where application size decreased from 23 MB to 15 MB 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.510
 We have a few other features we are working to turn into dynamic features 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.367
 We expect an additional volume reduction in the coming months
