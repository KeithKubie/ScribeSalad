00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:13.250
Why Native Americans Didnt Wipe Out Europeans
with Diseases

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.730
While estimates vary, approximately 20-50
million people are believed to have lived

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.289
in the Americas shortly before Europeans arrived.

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.099
Around 95% of them were killed by European
diseases.

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.630
So why didn’t 19 out of 20 Europeans die
from Native American diseases?

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.570
The short answer is that Europeans simply
had more robust immune systems.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.960
Several factors contributed to this: first,
Europeans had been the caretakers of domestic

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.570
animals for thousands of years, and had over
time grown (somewhat) immune to the common

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.449
diseases that accompanied the domestication
of such food sources.

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.660
Native Americans, on the other hand, were
largely hunters and gatherers, and even in

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.719
some domestication cases, it’s thought exposure
was limited.

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.320
For instance, as Jared Diamond, author of
Guns, Germs, and Steel states,

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.080
The Incas had llamas, but llamas aren’t
like European cows and sheep.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.360
They’re not milked, they’re not kept in
large herds, and they don’t live in barns

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.760
and huts alongside humans.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.750
There was no significant exchange of germs
between llamas and people.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.280
Second, Europeans lived in more densely populated
areas than Native Americans.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.030
When so many humans live together in relatively
close quarters (particularly with lack of

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.620
good, or any, sewage systems and the like),
disease spreads quickly with the general population

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.430
continually getting exposed to numerous pathogens.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.770
The Europeans’ bodies had to adapt to dealing
with many of those diseases, and for those

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.990
who survived, their immune systems thrived
as a result.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.640
The third factor is travel and exchange.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.670
Groups of people and animals moved around
a lot in Europe and had interactions particularly

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.920
through war and trade, resulting in the spread
of disease across continents—and, eventually,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.450
some level of immunity for the survivors.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.530
All of these things resulted in Europeans
being regularly exposed to many more pathogens

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.440
than Native Americans were.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.750
The Europeans’ immune systems simply developed
to ward off the worst of some of the nastier

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.410
diseases that incapacitated entire Native
American populations.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.470
That same immunity protected them from diseases
that Native Americans might have given them,

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.790
or at least made it so the new diseases that
they encountered were not as deadly.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.840
That said, it should be noted that Europeans
were also commonly killed off by the diseases

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.440
they brought to the New World.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.880
It’s just that over time those who were
more susceptible to these diseases died off

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.000
and the survivors’ immune systems had developed
to the point where the general populace wasn’t

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
typically being wiped out at rates anywhere
close to 95%, though the numbers were often

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.610
still extreme by today’s standards.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.040
But contrary to popular belief, it wasn’t
all one sided.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.450
It’s believed that one Native American disease
did slip on to the European ships and sailed

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.470
onward to Europe doing some major damage in
the process.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.370
That disease was syphilis.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.319
Columbus “sailed the ocean blue” in 1492.

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.730
Just three years later, in 1495, the first
syphilis epidemic broke out among armies in

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.920
Italy at the Siege of Naples, seemingly brought
by French soldiers who in turn probably got

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.510
the disease from Spanish mercenaries.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.410
Because of the French popularly spreading
it, syphilis was initially known as the “French

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.410
disease.”

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.310
There was up until very recently some debate
about whether or not syphilis was in fact

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.630
a “New World” disease because there are
over 50 skeletons that have been found with

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.530
all the markings of syphilis being the cause
of death and that were once thought to date

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.460
to pre-Columbian times.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:59.750
However, advancements in dating technology
and a recent (2011) comprehensive study published

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.590
in the Yearbook of Physical Anthropology looking
at all of the skeletons placed those people’s

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.819
deaths after Columbus returned from the Americas.

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:13.319
The initial syphilis epidemic is thought to
have killed upwards of a few million Euopeans

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.020
as it made its rounds.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.320
Artist Albrecht Dürer remarked,

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.440
God save me from the French disease.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.259
I know of nothing of which I am so afraid
… Nearly every man has it and it eats up

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:26.449
so many that they die.

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.419
The disease continued to be a problem into
the 20th century.

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.999
It’s caused by bacteria Treponema pallidum,
which can attack the nervous system, heart,

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:40.389
brain, and internal organs, causing a variety
of health problems and, sometimes, death.

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:59.379
A cure wasn’t developed until the 1940s
with the development 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:05.729
of penicillin.
