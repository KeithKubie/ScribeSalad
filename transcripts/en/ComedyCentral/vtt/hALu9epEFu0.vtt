00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.050
- Welcome back to Baba Knows
Best, the only game show

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.060
where real brown dads
compete for cold hard cash.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.680
We're down to our final
three dads. Let's meet them.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.030
Up first an aerospace engineer
from Seattle, Washington,

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.210
give it up for Mohammad.
Now, Mohammad

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.980
I hear one of your hobbies
is reading the newspaper?

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.680
- I love newspaper.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.620
- Okay. Our next baba,
is from Fremont, California,

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.870
he's a mechanical engineer.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.020
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for Akbar.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.090
Akbar, I hear you were recently
kicked out of a Costco

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.560
for trying too many samples?

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.820
- I go in, and they said, "No
sir, you can not keep eating

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.570
the tortilla chip with salsa."
I said, "Goddamn it, I pay.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.170
I will eat as much salsa
and chip as I need to do."

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.660
- Our last baba is from
Baltimore, Maryland.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.190
He's a structural engineer.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.890
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's Nassar.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.880
Nassar, I hear that you like to
mow your lawn in your Speedos?

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.920
- What do you mean?

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.300
On the form, you said one of
the activities you like to do-

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.530
- Right.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.150
... is mowing the lawn-
- I mow lawn.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.940
... over the weekend
in your Speedo?

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.190
- Yes, I'm in Speedo.
What am I going to do?

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.360
Wear my underwear?

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.770
- Alright.
Let's play our next game,

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.930
What's the Matter with Shoe.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.700
Alright, you guys
know the rules.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.040
Every justified direct hit
on a target is five points.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.870
Hit the wrong target,
you lose five points.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.500
Your money shoe
is worth triple points.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.710
You guys ready?

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.980
Yes.
Yeah.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.680
Let's go.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.530
- Dad, I got a C.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.640
- Whoa, five points
across the board.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.150
- I got into UCLA.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.270
- Double points for Akbar.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.970
- Ivy League only!

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.820
- I'm gonna kill this, bitch.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.900
- I'm gonna burn this
fucking house house down.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.530
- I had some bacon.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.190
- Whoa. Now, Akbar,
you hit the arsonist,

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.640
but your son
did have bacon,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.310
so he's gonna burn
in hell forever.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.580
- My hands are sweaty.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.280
- Minus five points.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.200
- We're forming a band.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.770
- Ah! Come here, son.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.720
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Shoes down. Time's up.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.350
Now, Nassar, you did hit the kid
with the frosted tips,

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.530
but you used your own shoe,
so no points there.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.820
- Shit!

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.100
- That was a great round.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.850
Let's check in on our podiums
to see who's in the lead.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.300
Alright, Mohammed
is in the lead,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.300
but it's still anyone's game.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.240
Let's move on
to our final challenge,

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.490
Like a Rock.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.660
We'll play out real life
events from your life.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.020
Whoever doesn't cry wins
the challenge and the game.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.590
You guys ready? Let's play.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:02.020
- Push! Come on. One more. Push.
It's your son.

00:03:07.652 --> 00:03:08.130
- I'm all packed up.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.970
Thank for everything you
and mom have done for me.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.670
I'm gonna miss you, dad.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.980
- Baba, you made the perfect
home for me growing up.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.180
I can only hope to create
the same for my family.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.360
One last dance?

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.120
- Wow. Hearts of stone.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.300
It's almost as
if you aren't human,

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.500
but how will you react
to this message

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.200
from your real life fathers?

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.950
- Son, I love you.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.050
- Baba.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.890
- Wow. It's a photo finish.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.130
We're gonna have
to go to replay.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.502
Let's take a look.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.040
Mohammed cried last, so it looks
like Mohammed is the winner.

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.510
- When did Baba say this?

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.070
- He didn't.
Thank you to our CGI team

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.790
who mocked up the perfect
photo of your fathers,

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.980
because, of course,
they would never say that.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.320
Billy, why don't you tell us
what Mohammed has won?

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.460
- You'll be going home
in our grand prize,

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.530
a 2006 Toyota Camry.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.570
Kelly Blue Book value is $6296,
but we got it for $5.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.860
- That's a good deal.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.807
- It always is on
Baba Knows Best!
