00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.230
What problems does material
design try to solve?

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.110
&gt;&gt; Well, the question of how
a user goes between all these

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.080
different devices is a key one.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.770
And to the user, it's really just
they're doing this one task.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.390
They're trying to do this one thing and
it doesn't matter so

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.900
much to them whether it happens to
be on the phone in their pocket, or

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.790
the laptop that's on their desk.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.090
So we want that kind of continuity.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.050
Something else we really
focus on is motion.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.530
We've seen all too often that motion
is something that just kind of gets

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.990
tacked on at the end.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.220
So you do all this other work, and then
you just kind of add in some animations.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.260
&gt;&gt; After effect or something like that.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.930
&gt;&gt; It is literally that, right?

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.670
It's all done, so
throw that thing in there.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.020
We try to think about motion from
the very start, because we think that

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.080
kind of knowing how things
are going to move around is so

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.770
powerful for giving feedback to
the user about what they're doing.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.200
So, you want to kind of plan for
that in advance.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.475
And we try to have these materials that
give the material design it's name.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:00.280
Or things like kind of paper and

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.099
ink that can kind of move in
predictable ways that feel tactile and

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:10.360
feel familiar to the user, but aren't
bound by kind of boring old reality.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.850
It can do kind of these really
interesting things that makes

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.130
the user feel powerful,

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.400
and that's a key goal towards giving
them a satisfying experience.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.510
&gt;&gt; So the inspiration comes
from design and material,

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.820
actual material getting to play with.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
I mean we really wanted to look at

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.680
things that felt familiar to the user.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.330
And we engage with those
materials every day.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.010
We don't engage with, kind of,
these pieces of inscrutable glass.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.560
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.080
&gt;&gt; In our day to day lives except
when we're using these devices.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.280
So why should that be the metaphor?

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.930
Let's go for something that's
a little bit more predictable.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.640
&gt;&gt; So where do I as an entrepreneur come
to learn more about the material design?

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.490
&gt;&gt; The best place to start
is just Google.com/design.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.540
So from that site,
we have a full specification,

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.160
a set of guidelines that
describes material design.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.530
It breaks down the philosophy behind it,
gives you some key principles to employ.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.140
It's richly illustrated with imagery,
with motion,

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.620
samples of video, and also has a lot
of resources that you can download.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.900
So fonts, color palettes, sticker
sheets of kind of common components for

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.690
all of the typical design
tools that you might use.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.920
&gt;&gt; So I can use those out of the box,
and not reinvent the wheel, right?

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.650
&gt;&gt; Exactly, and then it should be
very close to what you're getting on

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.630
the platforms that
directly support material.
