00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.520
 
somebody asked me the other day if I

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530
somebody asked me the other day if I
 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.519
somebody asked me the other day if I
believed in miracles and I hate being

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529
believed in miracles and I hate being
 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.349
believed in miracles and I hate being
asked questions like that you know and

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359
asked questions like that you know and
 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.190
asked questions like that you know and
you know it's also people ask me do I

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200
you know it's also people ask me do I
 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.140
you know it's also people ask me do I
believe in God and like I don't know

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150
believe in God and like I don't know
 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.820
believe in God and like I don't know
what they mean when they say that so I

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830
what they mean when they say that so I
 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.110
what they mean when they say that so I
don't know what to answer because I

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120
don't know what to answer because I
 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.099
don't know what to answer because I
don't think we're talking necessarily

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109
don't think we're talking necessarily
 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.720
don't think we're talking necessarily
going to talk about the same thing but

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730
going to talk about the same thing but
 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.240
going to talk about the same thing but
in any case I said yes and I have a

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250
in any case I said yes and I have a
 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.920
in any case I said yes and I have a
variety of reasons for that but one of

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930
variety of reasons for that but one of
 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.109
variety of reasons for that but one of
them is that you know the consensus

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119
them is that you know the consensus
 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.769
them is that you know the consensus
among physicists is that we can track

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779
among physicists is that we can track
 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.870
among physicists is that we can track
the origin of the cosmos to something

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880
the origin of the cosmos to something
 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.240
the origin of the cosmos to something
like a hundred millionth of a millionth

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250
like a hundred millionth of a millionth
 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.280
like a hundred millionth of a millionth
of a second after the Big Bang it's like

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290
of a second after the Big Bang it's like
 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.299
of a second after the Big Bang it's like
it's so close to the Big Bang that the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309
it's so close to the Big Bang that the
 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.430
it's so close to the Big Bang that the
difference is literally infinitesimal

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440
difference is literally infinitesimal
 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.400
difference is literally infinitesimal
but the consensus is that before that

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410
but the consensus is that before that
 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.560
but the consensus is that before that
whatever that is the laws of physics

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570
whatever that is the laws of physics
 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.569
whatever that is the laws of physics
themselves break down well what what do

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579
themselves break down well what what do
 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.540
themselves break down well what what do
you call an event that exists outside

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550
you call an event that exists outside
 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.119
you call an event that exists outside
the laws of physics that by definition

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129
the laws of physics that by definition
 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.740
the laws of physics that by definition
that's a miracle now that doesn't

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750
that's a miracle now that doesn't
 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.470
that's a miracle now that doesn't
necessarily mean that there's a

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480
necessarily mean that there's a
 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.509
necessarily mean that there's a
transcendent Adi that caused the event

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519
transcendent Adi that caused the event
 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.660
transcendent Adi that caused the event
that's a separate issue but it does

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670
that's a separate issue but it does
 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.320
that's a separate issue but it does
imply a barrier of some sort beyond

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330
imply a barrier of some sort beyond
 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.840
imply a barrier of some sort beyond
which we can't go where some other set

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850
which we can't go where some other set
 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.230
which we can't go where some other set
of rules apply and so I find that

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240
of rules apply and so I find that
 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.200
of rules apply and so I find that
interesting as well
