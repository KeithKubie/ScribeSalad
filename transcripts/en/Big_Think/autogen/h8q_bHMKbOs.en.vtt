public to the general public and so the
the main idea of the book project is is

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300
the main idea of the book project is is
 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.359
the main idea of the book project is is
the following well let me start with

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369
the following well let me start with
 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.160
the following well let me start with
there is this kind of well well-worn

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170
there is this kind of well well-worn
 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.170
there is this kind of well well-worn
prayer of niebuhr and it says that you

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180
prayer of niebuhr and it says that you
 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.480
prayer of niebuhr and it says that you
know God gave us the courage to change

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490
know God gave us the courage to change
 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.540
know God gave us the courage to change
what we can change and the serenity to

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550
what we can change and the serenity to
 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.610
what we can change and the serenity to
accept what we can change and the wisdom

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620
accept what we can change and the wisdom
 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.180
accept what we can change and the wisdom
to know the difference between the two

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190
to know the difference between the two
 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.670
to know the difference between the two
and now what I think is actually that it

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680
and now what I think is actually that it
 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.610
and now what I think is actually that it
that this is actually a false dichotomy

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620
that this is actually a false dichotomy
 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.270
that this is actually a false dichotomy
because there is something in between

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280
because there is something in between
 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.130
because there is something in between
accepting the things that we can change

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140
accepting the things that we can change
 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.420
accepting the things that we can change
and changing the things that we that we

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430
and changing the things that we that we
 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.280
and changing the things that we that we
are able to change having the courage to

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290
are able to change having the courage to
 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.990
are able to change having the courage to
change the things that are able to

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000
change the things that are able to
 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.780
change the things that are able to
change and what comes in between

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790
change and what comes in between
 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.719
change and what comes in between
actually is precisely sort of having a

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729
actually is precisely sort of having a
 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.350
actually is precisely sort of having a
kind of control over over the mind right

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360
kind of control over over the mind right
 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.840
kind of control over over the mind right
and now hoping is exactly the sort of

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850
and now hoping is exactly the sort of
 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.050
and now hoping is exactly the sort of
thing that fits in the space in between

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060
thing that fits in the space in between
 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.240
thing that fits in the space in between
courage and serenity you're not changing

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250
courage and serenity you're not changing
 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.490
courage and serenity you're not changing
the world and you're not just merely

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500
the world and you're not just merely
 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.560
the world and you're not just merely
accepting things I mean you're

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570
accepting things I mean you're
 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.039
accepting things I mean you're
developing some kind of attitude of

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049
developing some kind of attitude of
 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.570
developing some kind of attitude of
coping with hardships and that's

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580
coping with hardships and that's
 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.820
coping with hardships and that's
precisely I think what is hoping is all

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830
precisely I think what is hoping is all
 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.030
precisely I think what is hoping is all
about right I think hoping is actually

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040
about right I think hoping is actually
 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.500
about right I think hoping is actually
just one

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510
just one
 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.240
just one
of the things that fits in the space

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250
of the things that fits in the space
 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.229
of the things that fits in the space
between discourage and serenity another

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239
between discourage and serenity another
 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.330
between discourage and serenity another
thing that I've been exploring over the

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340
thing that I've been exploring over the
 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.360
thing that I've been exploring over the
years is what's often called sour grapes

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370
years is what's often called sour grapes
 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.789
years is what's often called sour grapes
right now sour grapes is a little bit of

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799
right now sour grapes is a little bit of
 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.610
right now sour grapes is a little bit of
bad rep but if you think about it what

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620
bad rep but if you think about it what
 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.890
bad rep but if you think about it what
you're really doing or what the Fox is

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900
you're really doing or what the Fox is
 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.720
you're really doing or what the Fox is
doing when you can't reach for the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730
doing when you can't reach for the
 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.520
doing when you can't reach for the
grapes right and it turns his back and

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530
grapes right and it turns his back and
 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.350
grapes right and it turns his back and
he says oh those grapes are sour right

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360
he says oh those grapes are sour right
 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.199
he says oh those grapes are sour right
if you know you could interpret this in

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209
if you know you could interpret this in
 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.509
if you know you could interpret this in
many ways and actually when you think of

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519
many ways and actually when you think of
 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.559
many ways and actually when you think of
this of this fable right it's been

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569
this of this fable right it's been
 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.960
this of this fable right it's been
written and rewritten in many ways I

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970
written and rewritten in many ways I
 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.030
written and rewritten in many ways I
mean it may be the case that the Fox

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040
mean it may be the case that the Fox
 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.789
mean it may be the case that the Fox
just says look you know these grapes are

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799
just says look you know these grapes are
 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.009
just says look you know these grapes are
not ripe yet then is that is actually

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019
not ripe yet then is that is actually
 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.319
not ripe yet then is that is actually
changing his beliefs in order to deal

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329
changing his beliefs in order to deal
 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.349
changing his beliefs in order to deal
with his frustration right but in other

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359
with his frustration right but in other
 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.259
with his frustration right but in other
versions he actually says look I really

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269
versions he actually says look I really
 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.569
versions he actually says look I really
like grapes so it seems like he's

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579
like grapes so it seems like he's
 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.640
like grapes so it seems like he's
changing his tastes is changing his

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650
changing his tastes is changing his
 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.280
changing his tastes is changing his
desires that's a different thing and

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290
desires that's a different thing and
 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.470
desires that's a different thing and
then the third thing that the Fox might

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480
then the third thing that the Fox might
 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.199
then the third thing that the Fox might
be doing is he says oh you know grapes

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209
be doing is he says oh you know grapes
 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.479
be doing is he says oh you know grapes
are really for the low life animals in

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489
are really for the low life animals in
 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.610
are really for the low life animals in
the woods that is kind of framing the

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620
the woods that is kind of framing the
 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.189
the woods that is kind of framing the
whole thing right so often I think when

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:24.199
whole thing right so often I think when
 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:25.960
whole thing right so often I think when
we're trying to deal with hardships in

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970
we're trying to deal with hardships in
 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.420
we're trying to deal with hardships in
life we're changing our beliefs we're

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430
life we're changing our beliefs we're
 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.729
life we're changing our beliefs we're
changing our desires or we frame things

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739
changing our desires or we frame things
 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.970
changing our desires or we frame things
differently and depending on what you're

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980
differently and depending on what you're
 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.400
differently and depending on what you're
doing here these things are either more

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410
doing here these things are either more
 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.680
doing here these things are either more
or less problematic I think people often

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690
or less problematic I think people often
 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.539
or less problematic I think people often
have problems with changing your beliefs

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549
have problems with changing your beliefs
 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.640
have problems with changing your beliefs
as well right

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650
as well right
 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.939
as well right
whereas changing the frame with which

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:45.949
whereas changing the frame with which
 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:47.979
whereas changing the frame with which
you look at things in order to make

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989
you look at things in order to make
 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.589
you look at things in order to make
things more acceptable that seems to be

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599
things more acceptable that seems to be
 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.500
things more acceptable that seems to be
a perfectly all right thing to do right

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510
a perfectly all right thing to do right
 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.780
a perfectly all right thing to do right
I mean at one point actually going back

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790
I mean at one point actually going back
 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.990
I mean at one point actually going back
to markers are really as the meditations

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000
to markers are really as the meditations
 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.509
to markers are really as the meditations
see Marcus Aurelius says you know look I

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519
see Marcus Aurelius says you know look I
 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.430

things like there's a lot of need for
 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.020
things like there's a lot of need for
them like one thing I'm doing currently

them like one thing I'm doing currently
 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.380
them like one thing I'm doing currently
is I'm thinking about you know how it is

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390

afterlife and so on but I really want to
 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.950
afterlife and so on but I really want to
think about the idea of what kind of

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960
think about the idea of what kind of
 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.260
think about the idea of what kind of
hopes what kind of secular hopes that we

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270
hopes what kind of secular hopes that we
 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.680
hopes what kind of secular hopes that we
can have in the face of death right and

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480
so I try to to look at you know various
 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.070
so I try to to look at you know various
various components and so to make a kind

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080
various components and so to make a kind
 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.350
various components and so to make a kind
of taxonomy of the sort of hopes that

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360
of taxonomy of the sort of hopes that
 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.920
of taxonomy of the sort of hopes that
people have in the face of death like

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930
people have in the face of death like
 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.930
people have in the face of death like
for one thing I think people hope that

their life was worthwhile somehow and I
 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.450
their life was worthwhile somehow and I
started actually thinking about this

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460
started actually thinking about this
 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.320
started actually thinking about this
because a friend of mine you know he

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330
because a friend of mine you know he
 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.110
because a friend of mine you know he

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350
and I said you know how is this possible
 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.780
and I said you know how is this possible
I mean you know look me being a

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.790
I mean you know look me being a
 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.670
I mean you know look me being a
philosopher right we're kind of envious

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680
philosopher right we're kind of envious
 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.890
philosopher right we're kind of envious
of the medical profession in a way right

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900
of the medical profession in a way right
 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.570
of the medical profession in a way right
because it seems so easy for them to

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580
because it seems so easy for them to
 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.880
because it seems so easy for them to
answer the question oh you know do you

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:09.890
answer the question oh you know do you
 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.890
answer the question oh you know do you
do something meaningful in life right

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900
do something meaningful in life right
 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.469
do something meaningful in life right
and so what about your patients they

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479
and so what about your patients they
 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:16.900
and so what about your patients they
said oh he says my patients he says you

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:16.910
said oh he says my patients he says you
 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.280
said oh he says my patients he says you
know they're all dead or they're going

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:18.290
know they're all dead or they're going
 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.560
know they're all dead or they're going
to die soon anyway right and I thought

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570
to die soon anyway right and I thought
 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.450
to die soon anyway right and I thought
that was really interesting because it

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460
that was really interesting because it
 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.909
that was really interesting because it
seems like you know the only thing that

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919
seems like you know the only thing that
 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:26.080
seems like you know the only thing that
he thought would make his life

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090
he thought would make his life
 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.390
he thought would make his life
worthwhile is things that would remain

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400
worthwhile is things that would remain
 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.710
worthwhile is things that would remain
past is death right and you know to me

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720
past is death right and you know to me
 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.810
past is death right and you know to me
actually family trees in genealogy and

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:34.820
actually family trees in genealogy and
 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.610
actually family trees in genealogy and
so on is a little bit like Trainspotting

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620
so on is a little bit like Trainspotting
 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.589
so on is a little bit like Trainspotting
so I can't get too excited about it but

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:38.599
so I can't get too excited about it but
 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:40.030
so I can't get too excited about it but
I'm definitely envious of

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:40.040
I'm definitely envious of
 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.830
I'm definitely envious of
you know I've spent a life in the

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840
you know I've spent a life in the
 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.430
you know I've spent a life in the
medical profession right so then I

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440
medical profession right so then I
 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.310
medical profession right so then I
started thinking about how is it that we

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:48.320
started thinking about how is it that we
 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.500
started thinking about how is it that we
think about how is it that we hope that

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:50.510
think about how is it that we hope that
 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.740
think about how is it that we hope that
our lives will be worthwhile right and

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.750
our lives will be worthwhile right and
 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.270
our lives will be worthwhile right and
it seems to me that there is this

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280
it seems to me that there is this
 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.120
it seems to me that there is this
difference between thinking about a

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.130
difference between thinking about a
 

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.420
difference between thinking about a
worthwhile life in terms of projects

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:01.430
worthwhile life in terms of projects
 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.380
worthwhile life in terms of projects
that will extend over you over the

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:05.390
that will extend over you over the
 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.390
that will extend over you over the
moment of your death versus thinking

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:07.400
moment of your death versus thinking
 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.610
moment of your death versus thinking
about having done great times great

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:09.620
about having done great times great
 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.650
about having done great times great
things in life which can be purely

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:11.660
things in life which can be purely
 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.800
things in life which can be purely
ephemeral right so I'm sort of thinking

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:14.810
ephemeral right so I'm sort of thinking
 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.550
ephemeral right so I'm sort of thinking
about you know a DJ who who'd through

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560
about you know a DJ who who'd through

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:55.840
life according to an aesthetic principle
right and I think that's quite quite

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:55.850
right and I think that's quite quite
 

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.660
right and I think that's quite quite
interesting too because you can think of

00:07:58.660 --> 00:07:58.670
interesting too because you can think of
 

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:00.670
interesting too because you can think of
you know your life being worthwhile in

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:00.680
you know your life being worthwhile in
 

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.920
you know your life being worthwhile in
terms of ephemeral projects that you've

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:02.930
terms of ephemeral projects that you've
 

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.410
terms of ephemeral projects that you've
done in terms of projects that will

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:05.420
done in terms of projects that will
 

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.820
done in terms of projects that will
extend over your death

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:06.830
extend over your death
 

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.880
extend over your death
but also in terms of living in a

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:09.890
but also in terms of living in a
 

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.190
but also in terms of living in a
particular mode right living a

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:12.200
particular mode right living a
 

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.330
particular mode right living a
particular style of life maybe a life of

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:16.340
particular style of life maybe a life of
 

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.300
particular style of life maybe a life of
self-forgetfulness maybe a life of other

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:19.310
self-forgetfulness maybe a life of other
 

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.790

oriented nests or in the case of Keats

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:21.800
oriented nests or in the case of Keats
 

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.890
oriented nests or in the case of Keats
living a life in accordance with an

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:23.900
living a life in accordance with an
 

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.470
living a life in accordance with an
aesthetic principle so that's sort of

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:26.480
aesthetic principle so that's sort of
 

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.470
aesthetic principle so that's sort of
the idea of hoping that you've lived a

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:29.480
the idea of hoping that you've lived a
 

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.300
the idea of hoping that you've lived a
worthwhile life but I think there's

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:31.310
worthwhile life but I think there's
 

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.890
worthwhile life but I think there's
other hopes that we have to other

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:32.900
other hopes that we have to other
 

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.200
other hopes that we have to other
secular hopes that we have to you know

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:35.210
secular hopes that we have to you know
 

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.120
secular hopes that we have to you know
in general we just have hopes for the

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:37.130
in general we just have hopes for the
 

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.760
in general we just have hopes for the
future right I mean there is this they

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:39.770
future right I mean there is this they
 

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.880
future right I mean there is this they
saying you know after May the downfall

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:42.890
saying you know after May the downfall
 

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.290
saying you know after May the downfall
right but will feel like there's

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:44.300
right but will feel like there's
 

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.640
right but will feel like there's
something wrong with that you should

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:45.650
something wrong with that you should
 

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:50.790
something wrong with that you should
have hopes for for a better future then

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:50.800
have hopes for for a better future then
 

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.579
have hopes for for a better future then
in addition to that I think we also hope

00:08:54.579 --> 00:08:54.589
in addition to that I think we also hope
 

00:08:54.589 --> 00:08:57.400
in addition to that I think we also hope
not just to have lived well but also we

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:57.410
not just to have lived well but also we
 

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:00.310
not just to have lived well but also we
hope to die well now that goes back all

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:00.320
hope to die well now that goes back all
 

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.710
hope to die well now that goes back all

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.900
the way to Aristotle now Aristotle
actually thought that dying on the

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:04.910
actually thought that dying on the
 

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.420

battlefield you know that's what was

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:07.430
battlefield you know that's what was
 

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.360

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:11.750
know this may seem a little bit outdated
 

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:15.340
know this may seem a little bit outdated
to us but but it's interesting when you

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:15.350
to us but but it's interesting when you
 

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.579
to us but but it's interesting when you
when you know this is justification for

00:09:18.579 --> 00:09:18.589
when you know this is justification for
 

00:09:18.589 --> 00:09:20.530

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.240
it so he says you know it's a good thing
to die on the battlefield because there

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:22.250

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.999

00:09:56.079 --> 00:09:56.089
interesting debate actually going on
 

00:09:56.089 --> 00:09:59.650
interesting debate actually going on
recently in in the Netherlands

00:09:59.650 --> 00:09:59.660
recently in in the Netherlands
 

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.960
recently in in the Netherlands
I mean euthanasia is legalized in the

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:01.970
I mean euthanasia is legalized in the
 

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:05.050
I mean euthanasia is legalized in the
Netherlands but but the debate right now

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:05.060
Netherlands but but the debate right now
 

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:09.370
Netherlands but but the debate right now
is whether if somebody gets a diagnosis

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:09.380
is whether if somebody gets a diagnosis
 

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.350
is whether if somebody gets a diagnosis
of cancer whether they can have a very

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360
of cancer whether they can have a very
 

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.410
of cancer whether they can have a very
early euthanasia because if they wait

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:14.420
early euthanasia because if they wait
 

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.059
early euthanasia because if they wait
too long none of their organs will be

00:10:16.059 --> 00:10:16.069
too long none of their organs will be
 

00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:16.870
too long none of their organs will be
any good anymore

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:16.880
any good anymore
 

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.850
any good anymore
right and so they ask actually to be

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:18.860
right and so they ask actually to be
 

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.069
right and so they ask actually to be
euthanized earlier because they want to

00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:21.079
euthanized earlier because they want to
 

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:23.110
euthanized earlier because they want to
be organ donors and it's the same thing

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.120
be organ donors and it's the same thing
 

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.689
be organ donors and it's the same thing
