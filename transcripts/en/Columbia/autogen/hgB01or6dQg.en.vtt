I was asked to give a set of readings

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:20.509
I was asked to give a set of readings
 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:26.990
I was asked to give a set of readings
for you and I did and I am going to

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000
for you and I did and I am going to
 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.339
for you and I did and I am going to
assume that you have done or will do

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349
assume that you have done or will do
 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.549
assume that you have done or will do
those readings so I'm not going to talk

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559
those readings so I'm not going to talk
 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.840
those readings so I'm not going to talk
about what's in the readings okay I what

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850
about what's in the readings okay I what
 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:47.599
about what's in the readings okay I what
I'm going to do is is to to illustrate

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609
I'm going to do is is to to illustrate
 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:53.090
I'm going to do is is to to illustrate
the argument in the readings if the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100
the argument in the readings if the
 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.259
the argument in the readings if the
readings are where they really focus on

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269
readings are where they really focus on
 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.360
readings are where they really focus on
the nature of the colonial state but I

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370
the nature of the colonial state but I
 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.800
the nature of the colonial state but I
want to talk a little more broadly about

an informed view but the most important
 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.340
an informed view but the most important
one is the assumption that a organized

political power did not exist in Africa
 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.630
political power did not exist in Africa
before colonialism and if it did exist

before colonialism and if it did exist
 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.190
before colonialism and if it did exist
then it must have been brought from the

outside in the study of Rwanda this is
known as the Hamitic hypothesis

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.850
 
this assumption is so widespread how

Assumption on Africa in Guns Germs and
Steel is precisely this that there was

Steel is precisely this that there was
 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.490

second assumption the second assumption
 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:17.910
second assumption the second assumption
is that the beginning of organized

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920
is that the beginning of organized
 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.180

possibility of law and order is the

possibility of law and order is the
 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:38.309
possibility of law and order is the
colonial period the third assumption

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.750
 
is that the reason for the proliferation

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760
is that the reason for the proliferation
 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:52.789
is that the reason for the proliferation
of ethnic conflict around the continent

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799
 
 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:58.020
 
after independence is that colonialism

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030
after independence is that colonialism
 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.690
after independence is that colonialism
ended too soon colonialism should

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700
ended too soon colonialism should
 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.250
ended too soon colonialism should
actually have continued and finished its

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260
actually have continued and finished its
 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.460
actually have continued and finished its
job

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470
 
 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.539
 
that's the third assumption these are

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549
that's the third assumption these are
 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:13.679
that's the third assumption these are
widely held assumptions

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:13.689
widely held assumptions
 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:20.969
widely held assumptions
I'm not curry catering and and sometimes

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979
I'm not curry catering and and sometimes
 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.870
I'm not curry catering and and sometimes
they tend to be held or not even

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880
they tend to be held or not even
 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:36.980
they tend to be held or not even
consciously which is more serious deed

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990
 
 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.210
 
today currently in in the present day

American imagination the example of this

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810
American imagination the example of this
 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:54.990
American imagination the example of this
is Darfur right that's the example so

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000
is Darfur right that's the example so
 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.230
is Darfur right that's the example so
what I want to do today is to talk about

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240
what I want to do today is to talk about
 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.920
what I want to do today is to talk about
the state but in the very specific

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930
the state but in the very specific
 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:11.189
the state but in the very specific
context of Sudan and Darfur and I want

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199
context of Sudan and Darfur and I want
 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.629
context of Sudan and Darfur and I want
to talk about it historically I don't

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639
to talk about it historically I don't
 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.409
to talk about it historically I don't
know how long it will take but everybody

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419
know how long it will take but everybody
 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.730
know how long it will take but everybody
is allowed to vote with their feet if

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740
is allowed to vote with their feet if
 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:29.159
is allowed to vote with their feet if
mine give way I'll just sit down and but

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169
mine give way I'll just sit down and but
 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:30.480
mine give way I'll just sit down and but
I'll try and make a coherent argument

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490
I'll try and make a coherent argument
 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.070
I'll try and make a coherent argument
that's what I'm saying

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080
that's what I'm saying
 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.200
that's what I'm saying
okay so it will take a bit of time it'll

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210
okay so it will take a bit of time it'll
 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.650
okay so it will take a bit of time it'll
take an hour and something

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660
 
 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.740
 
take boy you're wondering why you asked

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750
take boy you're wondering why you asked
 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:49.430
take boy you're wondering why you asked
me to come it they wonder every year and

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440
me to come it they wonder every year and
 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.590
me to come it they wonder every year and
they ask me to come every next theater I

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600
they ask me to come every next theater I
 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.670
they ask me to come every next theater I
don't know why so that's what I'm going

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680
don't know why so that's what I'm going
 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:02.390
don't know why so that's what I'm going
to try and do now if you were if you

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400
to try and do now if you were if you
 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.790
to try and do now if you were if you
were in the University of Khartoum in

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800
were in the University of Khartoum in
 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.830
were in the University of Khartoum in
Sudan and you were studying history in

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840
Sudan and you were studying history in
 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.230
Sudan and you were studying history in
that university you would notice that

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240
that university you would notice that
 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:20.570
that university you would notice that
there is a big gulf between academic

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580
there is a big gulf between academic
 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:29.030
there is a big gulf between academic
history and popular memory Sudan by the

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.040
history and popular memory Sudan by the
 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.890
history and popular memory Sudan by the
way is the largest country in Africa

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900
way is the largest country in Africa
 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:36.470
way is the largest country in Africa
right it's roughly a third of the United

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:36.480
right it's roughly a third of the United
 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:44.290
right it's roughly a third of the United
States in its in its surface area and

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300
States in its in its surface area and
 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:52.460
States in its in its surface area and
Darfur is the size of France right on a

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.470
Darfur is the size of France right on a
 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:57.230
Darfur is the size of France right on a
small place roughly if I don't know

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240
small place roughly if I don't know
 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.159
small place roughly if I don't know
about a third but a good chunk of Sudan

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:01.169
about a third but a good chunk of Sudan
 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:06.159
about a third but a good chunk of Sudan
but size of roughly the size of France

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:06.169
 
 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:08.720
 
so if you were at the University of

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:08.730
so if you were at the University of
 

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:10.670
so if you were at the University of
Khartoum and you were studying history

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680
Khartoum and you were studying history
 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:22.430
Khartoum and you were studying history
you would notice a gulf between academic

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:22.440
you would notice a gulf between academic
 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.080
you would notice a gulf between academic
notions of history and popular memory

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.090
notions of history and popular memory
 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.990
notions of history and popular memory
between what people like you educated

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000
between what people like you educated
 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:38.540
between what people like you educated
young person's your sense of history and

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:38.550
young person's your sense of history and
 

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.340
young person's your sense of history and
what the man and the woman in the street

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:42.350
what the man and the woman in the street
 

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:46.159
what the man and the woman in the street
the history that they identify with the

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:46.169
the history that they identify with the
 

00:07:46.169 --> 00:07:48.830
the history that they identify with the
academic notion of history in the

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840
academic notion of history in the
 

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.879
academic notion of history in the
university

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:52.889
 
 

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:57.710
 
would trace the history of Sudan to

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:57.720
would trace the history of Sudan to
 

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.450
would trace the history of Sudan to
about 6,000 years ago

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:02.460
