00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:11.120
What Really Happens to a Person When They
are Tarred and Feathered

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.349
In times gone by, tarring and feathering was
a go-to method used by mobs to punish or otherwise

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.529
humiliate criminals or people believed to
have wronged the community in some way.

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.490
While it’s mostly recognised as being a
punishment handed down in colonial times,

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.009
the history of tarring and feathering stretches
back all the way to the crusades and possibly

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.469
further, with the earliest known recorded
reference to the punishment being an edict

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.110
passed down by Richard the Lionheart in 1189.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.699
According to the King Richard’s decree,
if one of his soldiers was found stealing

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.780
from his fellow crusaders, he was to be shaved
and then coated in boiling pitch before having

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.649
a “cushion of feathers” poured over his
head; the thief would then be left stranded

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.530
in whichever country they happened to anchor
in next.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.760
While the explicit wording King Richard used
suggested that the punishment wasn’t meant

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.359
to be fatal, it’s not difficult to see how
pouring hot pitch over someone could prove

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.479
deadly, especially in a time before antibiotics
to treat inevitable infections from severe

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:08.479
burns.

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.790
The most common injuries from the tarring
and feathering itself were indeed burns and

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:13.790
blisters.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.240
After the individual was then thoroughly humiliated,
perhaps by parading them around town in a

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.390
nude or semi-nude state, he or she also tended
to find it very difficult to get the tar and

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.860
feathers off without potentially losing a
little skin in the process, leaving behind

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.400
a lasting testament to their shame in the
forms of scars.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.909
Because tarring and feathering was a punishment
most often handed down by angry mobs, which

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.070
aren’t exactly known for their restraint,
individuals subjected to the punishment were

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.189
also sometimes severely beaten.

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.270
For example, in 1832 a Mormon minister named
Sidney Rigdon and his friend, none other than

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.860
Joseph Smith himself, were almost killed when
a mob dragged them from their homes in the

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.840
dead of night, severely beat them while trying
to force-feed them acid before tarring and

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.740
feathering them and leaving them both for
dead.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.649
Amazingly, both men were able to survive this
horrifying ordeal.

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.369
Unfortunately, Smith’s baby, who was left
exposed to the elements during the event,

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.180
was not so lucky, dying shortly after.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.590
From all this, you might be surprised to learn
that most people who were tarred and feathered

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.990
survived the ordeal.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.990
How?

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.670
Well, in most cases the tarring and feathering
was simply meant to humiliate the individual

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.340
in question, not kill them.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.390
As such, pine tar was commonly used, which
has a relatively low melting point, typically

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:37.050
around 130-140 degrees Fahrenheit (55-60 C);
certainly hot enough to cause an exceptional

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.760
amount of discomfort and burns, but nothing
like the harm that would be caused by various

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.380
forms of melted petroleum based tar.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.160
Further, depending on the severity of the
perceived crime or slight against the masses,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.480
the pine tar may not, in some cases, be melted
and then poured on, but simply heated a little

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.970
and then roughly rubbed on the individual
to leave enough residue on their skin for

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.230
the feathers to stick- painful to be sure,
but at least perhaps avoiding the burns.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.700
So if the goal was to cause excruciating pain
and death, boiling pitch or coal tar could

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.170
be used, along with severe beatings.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.700
But given the very good survival rates we
have record of, it would appear this was rarely

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.720
what those administering the tar and feathers
were going for; survivable pain and humiliation

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.900
were the name of the game in most cases, both
during the tarring and feathering and after,

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.750
with the individual finding it exceedingly
difficult to get the tar off.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.840
If the mob wanted to kill the person, they
had more expedient and less elaborate methods

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:55.590
for that, such as hanging.
