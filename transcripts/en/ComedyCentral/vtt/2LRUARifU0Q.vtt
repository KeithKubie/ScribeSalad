00:00:04.638 --> 00:00:06.206
Hmm.

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:11.345
No, this is
the wrong remote.

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:13.714
What must I do?

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:14.948
What do you want
from me?

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.351
Look, lady, this is
the wrong remote,

00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:18.752
and this is the right remote.

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:21.355
Okay, you gotta get
the right remote.

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:22.723
I had to find out I may
or may not have <i>herpes</i>

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:25.092
to get this remote!

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:26.093
Can I speak to
your manager, please?

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:28.061
Oh, I am the manager.

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:29.763
I also do billing,
installation programming,

00:00:29.897 --> 00:00:31.732
and I compose
the "on hold" music.

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.066
You composed this music?

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.369
Oh, no, no, this is
the "waiting room" music.

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.172
I compose that too.

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:41.308
I'm actually the only
person who works here.

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:43.977
Yikes.

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:45.379
Okay, what are
my options?

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:47.447
You can either mail in
a check for $1,000,

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:49.516
or come in person
and pay $5.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.285
You're only the fifth person
ever to come in.

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:52.319
Oh...

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:53.787
Here.

00:00:53.954 --> 00:00:54.955
I can pay
in quarters, right?

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:57.090
Oh, actually, no.
Our system's down

00:00:57.224 --> 00:00:58.725
and we only take nickels.

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.295
Sorry.

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:03.063
Oh, and you know what?
I hate your music.
