00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.850
Google Apps Script is a
cloud-based development

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.210
platform for creating
web applications.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.250
With just a browser, you
can build scalable web

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.560
applications that integrate
easily with Google products.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.070
Apps Script uses a familiar
JavaScript format.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.100
So you can take what you know
about web development and what

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.390
you know about Google products
and create something new

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.810
really quick.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.740
Google APIs and user interface
tools are built right into

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.250
Apps Script as services.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.510
And the script editor gives
you fast access to all the

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.420
services with code completion.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.370
Accustomed to editing HTML?

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.159
There's an HTML service
you can use to make

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.470
templates and layouts.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.870
And with the same library of
services, you can save data in

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.910
Google Spreadsheets, connect to
external databases, or use

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.210
the new ScriptDb to create a
JavaScript object store.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.370
When you're ready to share your
web application, publish

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.860
it as its own service
with versioning

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.990
and shareable libraries.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.170
Apps Script even has quick
publishing to the Chrome Web

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.810
Store, where anyone can find,
install, and use your web

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:54.830
application.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.260
To create a new script project
of your own, open Google

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.590
Drive, and click Create,
More, Script.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.830
Or just go to script.google.com
to start

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.080
your first project today.
