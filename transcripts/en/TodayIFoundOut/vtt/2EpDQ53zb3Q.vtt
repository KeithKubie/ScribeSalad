00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:22.380
It’s standard procedure in most hospitals
to incinerate any limbs, organs or tissue

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.449
they remove from a non-organ donor patient.

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.630
However, just because this is the way things
are normally done, it’s not necessarily

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.320
the way it has to be done.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.980
For example, while there almost universally
doesn’t seem to be any laws saying you have

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.880
rights to an amputated limb after a doctor
removes it, in many cases you can ask for

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.870
anything cut off of or removed from your body
back from the hospital and they’ll (usually)

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.470
say yes if pressed on the matter.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.540
Even where laws exist, they tend to be less
about how to handle such tissue and more about

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.820
getting around potential lawsuits.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.700
For example, in California there is a law
stating that patients can’t sue after the

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.760
fact for the return of tissue used in medical
research or for a share of the profits if

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.450
the tissue removed leads to a medical breakthrough.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.800
(See Bonus Fact below on the fascinating case
of John Moore which spurred this California

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.800
Supreme Court ruling.)

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.570
That said, in part because of Moore’s case,
prior to any surgery hospital representatives

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.180
will invariably ask patients to sign a form
that “cedes ownership of their surgical

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.590
leavings”, usually to the pathology lab
for use in medical research or study.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.479
However, as a patient, you’re entirely within
your rights to not sign such a form and request

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.360
ownership of any piece of your body removed
during surgery.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.780
But, as previously alluded to, hospitals and
doctors won’t always make this easy for

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.350
you and will often tell you that this isn’t
possible owing to the removed bits being a

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.299
biohazard.

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.030
While this sounds like a reasonable explanation,
in truth this is usually just something hospital

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.440
representative say when a hospital has a policy
against returning removed bits, generally

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.770
from wanting to avoid jumping through the
additional effort involved in returning a

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.810
body part.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.279
As lawyer and author of The Law of Human Remains,
Tanya Mash, notes, “When they don’t want

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:12.980
to do something, they’ll tell people it’s
illegal.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.720
That doesn’t mean it’s illegal.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.950
A lot of people just cave when they’re told
it’s not permitted.”

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.279
Or, as PBS succinctly states, unless a piece
of removed tissue contains a communicable

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:28.879
disease or a virus, “keeping your own body
part isn’t inherently anymore dangerous

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.170
than keeping a steak”.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.480
And even if you have a communicable disease,
the common process of preserving the tissue

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.780
or limb (submersed in a solution of water
and formaldehyde) will usually kill off any

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.459
such diseases anyway outside of some known
exceptions, making the often claimed “biohazard”

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.250
excuse for not returning your body part generally
bogus.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.489
For example, consider the case of Kristi Loyall
who, upon being told that she needed to have

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.299
a foot amputated owing to cancer, asked the
hospital for it back only to be stonewalled

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.900
by doctors who told her that this wasn’t
possible.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.340
Nevertheless, she insisted and, after hounding
the hospital about the issue for several weeks,

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.629
they agreed to return it.

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.700
It’s also noteworthy here that while they
initially said it wasn’t possible, the hospital

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.180
actually had a liability release form on file
specifically for use when returning removed

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.249
body parts.

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:20.120
After signing the form and getting her foot
and part of her leg back, Loyall paid $650

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.939
to a private company to skeletonise it.

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:28.569
Hilariously, she maintains an Instagram account,
onefootwanderer, where she takes various photos

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.209
with said foot, such as this glorious shot
of her using her skeletonised foot as a golf

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.230
club.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.540
When asked if she had any advice for people
who similarly wanted to keep an amputated

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.669
limb, Loyall explained that it was important
to be persistent and “just keep reminding

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.650
everyone that you are getting it back”.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.239
As for exactly what condition you’ll get
your limb, organ or tissue back in, this will

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.339
usually depend on the tests the pathologist
conducts on it and the manner in which it

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:58.339
is removed.

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:01.919
Things like kidneys stones, for example, will
normally be destroyed by the tests performed

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:06.370
on them after the fact, if not the method
used to remove them in the first place.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.840
Because of this, while you can theoretically
ask for anything removed from your body back,

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.870
occasionally this really won’t be possible.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.180
But where possible and if you insist, the
general process is that the organ, tissue

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.740
or limb will be sent off to a pathology lab,
among other things to ensure it’s pathogen

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.740
free.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.819
It will also be preserved in some way (usually,
as mentioned, in a solution including formaldehyde)

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:33.979
and you will have to sign a liability release
form before it will be returned.

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.460
Once back in your possession, in most regions,
you’re free to do with it as you please.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.259
One man, Leo Bonten, even created a rather
fetching, if a little creepy, lamp out of

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:43.259
his leg.

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:46.190
If you happen to be interested in selling
your former body part, as we mentioned in

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.190
our article concerning how one goes about
donating your body to science and the fascinating

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.250
things that may be done to it after, with
a few exceptions, this is entirely within

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.750
your rights as there aren’t really much
in the way of regulations in the United States

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.800
and many other countries about the ownership
or sale of human remains.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.080
The exception to this in the U.S. is primarily
regarding the sale or ownership of Native

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.280
American remains, which are protected by The
Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.280
Act.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.909
(Although a few states, like Louisiana, Georgia,
and Missouri, do have some laws pertaining

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:17.270
to restricting selling body parts.)

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.500
Over in the United Kingdom, things are only
slightly different with the decision of what

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:27.360
to do with amputated limbs and removed tissue
being left to the discretion of hospital trusts

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.150
and, in some cases, the individual surgeon
performing the amputation itself.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.789
However, as long as a patient makes their
wishes clear and signs the necessary forms,

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:40.699
in most cases one shouldn’t have significant
issue getting the bit(s) of yourself back.

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:45.320
Also, as in the United States, tests need
to be performed to ensure the tissue or limb

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.020
doesn’t pose a public health risk and it
will need to be properly preserved before

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.689
being returned.

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:55.850
One thing that is different in the UK is that,
due to a quirk of British law, one of the

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.909
few things a patient can’t do with an amputated
limb once they get it back is have it cremated

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:02.191
at a licensed crematorium.

00:06:02.191 --> 00:06:03.191
This is primarily because a death certificate
is required by law for someone at a crematorium

00:06:03.191 --> 00:06:07.220
to cremate human remains, as noted in a paper
published in the BMJ (formerly British Medical

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.220
Journal).

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.949
In the paper, Dr. Simon Marlow also muses
over the fact that although you can’t legally

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:16.729
have a crematorium cremate your limb after
its amputated, you could ask for it back and

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:17.729
burn it yourself.

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:22.189
And, of course, if the limb is not going to
be used for medical research, hospitals themselves

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:26.860
almost universally will incinerate the limb
anyway, which is all perfectly legal.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.949
It’s just the crematoriums that can’t
do it.

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:35.370
But to sum up, it would seem in most regions
of the world, as long as the bits of you removed

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.530
don’t pose a significant health risk to
the general public, while many a doctor or

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.370
hospital (particularly research hospitals)
may resist if you ask for a body part back,

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:49.360
if you’re insistent enough, you’ll likely
have good luck in having it returned.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.820
And once you have it back, for the most part
you are free to do with it as you please.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.650
Obviously losing a limb is nearly always less
than ideal (unless, I suppose, you have Body

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:03.379
Integrity Identity Disorder), but for those
who persist on finding the positive in any

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:08.990
situation, if the aforementioned Kristi Loyall
is any indication, there are a lot of hilarious

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:57.499
things you 
can 

00:07:57.499 --> 00:08:19.180
do 

00:08:19.180 --> 00:11:12.050
with your own severed limb.
