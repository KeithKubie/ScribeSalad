00:00:00.484 --> 00:00:01.900
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.940
think about how the
normal force might

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.060
be different in
different scenarios.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.120
And since my 2 and 1/2-year-old
son is obsessed with elevators,

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.790
I thought I would
focus on those.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.670
So here I've drawn
four scenarios.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.420
And we could imagine
them almost happening

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.840
in some type of a sequence.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.500
So in this first
picture right over here,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.650
I'm going to assume that
the velocity is equal to 0.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.599
Or another way to think about it
is this elevator is stationary.

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.140
And everything we're going to
be talking about in this video,

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.850
I'm talking about in
the vertical direction.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.224
That's the only dimension
we're going to be dealing with.

00:00:34.224 --> 00:00:39.320
So this is 0 meters per second
in the vertical direction.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.290
Or another way to think about
it, this thing is not moving.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.850
Now also it is
also-- and this may

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.000
be somewhat obvious to
you-- but its acceleration

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.350
is also 0 meters
per second squared

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.710
in this picture right over here.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.810
Then let's say that I'm sitting
in this transparent elevator.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:56.910
And I press the button.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.090
So the elevator begins
to accelerate upwards.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.160
So in this video
right over here,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.040
or in this screen
right over here,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.472
let's say that the acceleration
is 2 meters per second.

00:01:10.472 --> 00:01:12.430
And I'll use the convention
that positive means

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.690
upwards or negative
means downwards.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.391
We're only going to be operating
in this one dimension right

00:01:17.391 --> 00:01:17.890
here.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.975
I could write 2 meters per
second times the j unit vector

00:01:21.975 --> 00:01:23.850
because that tells us
that we are now moving.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.391
Why don't we just
leave it like that.

00:01:25.391 --> 00:01:29.490
That tells us that we are
moving in the upward direction.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.242
And let's say we do
that for 1 second.

00:01:32.242 --> 00:01:34.200
And then we get to this
screen right over here.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.130
So we had no velocity.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.130
We move.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.390
We accelerate.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.800
Let me-- oh, this is 2
meters per second squared.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.820
Let me make sure I--
It's 2 meters per second.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.470
This is acceleration here.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.330
So we do that for 1 second.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.790
And then at the end of 1
second, we stop accelerating.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.290
So here, once we get to this
little screen over here,

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.920
our acceleration
goes back to 0 meters

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.504
per second squared
in the j direction,

00:01:57.504 --> 00:01:59.711
only you don't have to write
that because it's really

00:01:59.711 --> 00:02:00.230
just 0.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.640
But now we have some velocity.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.750
We did that just for
the sake of simplicity.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.979
Let's say this screen
lasted for 1 second.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.770
So now our velocity is going
to be 2 meters per second

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.280
in the j direction, or
in the upwards direction.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.230
And then let's say we
do that for 10 seconds.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.990
So at least at the
constant velocity,

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.140
we travel for 20 meters.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.600
We travel a little bit while
we're accelerating, too.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.160
But we're getting
close to our floor.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.893
And so the elevator
needs to decelerate.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.890
So then it decelerates.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.060
The acceleration here
is negative 2 meters

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.810
per second squared times--
in the j direction.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.890
So it's actually
accelerating downwards now.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.974
It has to slow it down to
get it back to stationary.

00:02:51.974 --> 00:02:53.640
So what I want to do
is think about what

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.310
would be the normal
force, the force

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.610
that the floor of the
elevator is exerting

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.620
on me in each of
these situations.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.990
And we're going to assume
that we are operating

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.650
near the surface of the Earth.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.510
So in every one of
these situations,

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.870
if we're operating near
the surface of the Earth,

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.474
I have some type of
gravitational attraction

00:03:13.474 --> 00:03:15.140
to the Earth and the
Earth has some type

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.030
of gravitational
attraction to me.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.400
And so let's say that
I'm-- I don't know.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.070
Let's just make the math simple.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.860
Let's say that I'm
some type of a toddler.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:25.880
And I'm 10 kilograms.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.330
So maybe this is
my son, although I

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.070
think he's 12 kilograms.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.580
But we'll keep it simple.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.865
Oh, let me be clear.

00:03:38.865 --> 00:03:40.930
He doesn't weigh 10 kilograms.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:41.660
That's wrong.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.530
He has a mass of 10 kilograms.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.290
Weight is the force
due to gravity.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.690
Mass of the amount of stuff,
the amount of matter there is.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.280
Although I that's not
a rigorous definition.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.090
So the mass of the individual,
of this toddler sitting

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.610
in the elevator,
is 10 kilograms.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.300
So what is the force of gravity.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.675
Or another way to
think about it,

00:03:59.675 --> 00:04:02.640
what is this person's weight?

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.040
Well, in this vignette
right over here,

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.570
in this picture right
over here, its mass

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.450
times the gravitational
field near the surface

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.300
of the Earth, the 9.8
meters per second squared.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.760
Let me write that over here.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.610
The gravitational field near
the surface of the Earth

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.469
is 9.8 meters per
second squared.

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:24.510
And the negative tells
you it is going downwards.

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.610
So you multiply this
times 10 kilograms.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.550
The downward force,
the force of gravity,

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.220
is going to be 10 times negative
9.8 meters per second squared.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.889
So negative 98 newtons.

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.347
And I could say that that's
going to be in the j direction.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.880
Well, what's going to be the
downward force of gravity here?

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.030
Well, it's going to
be the same thing.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.610
We're still near the
surface of the Earth.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.151
We're going to assume that the
gravitational field is roughly

00:04:54.151 --> 00:04:55.990
constant, although
we know it slightly

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.330
changes with the distance
from the center of the Earth.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.913
But when we're dealing
on the surface,

00:04:59.913 --> 00:05:01.880
we assume that it's
roughly constant.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.830
And so what we'll assume we have
the exact same force of gravity

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:07.420
there.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.500
And of course, this person's
mass, this toddler's mass,

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.570
does not change, depending
on going up a few floors.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.460
So it's going to have the same
force of gravity downwards

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.790
in every one of
these situations.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.230
In this first
situation right here,

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.040
this person has no acceleration.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.230
If they have no acceleration
in any direction,

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.800
and we're only
concerning ourselves

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.950
with the vertical
direction right here,

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.970
that means that there must
be no net force on them.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.190
This is from Newton's
first law of motion.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.830
But if there's no
net force on them,

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.470
there must be some force that's
counteracting this force.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.000
Because if there
was nothing else,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.650
there would be a net force of
gravity and this poor toddler

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.190
would be plummeting to
the center of the Earth.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.810
So that net force
in this situation

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.400
is the force of the floor
of the elevator supporting

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.940
the toddler.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:05.640
So that force would
be an equal force

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.980
but in the opposite direction.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.710
And in this case, that
would be the normal force.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.230
So in this case,
the normal force

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:17.600
is 98 newtons in
the j direction.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.120
So it just completely
bounces off.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.140
There's no net force
on this person.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.020
They get to hold their
constant velocity of 0.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.550
And they don't plummet to
the center of the Earth.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.520
Now, what is the net force
on this individual right

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.430
over here?

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.800
Well, this individual
is accelerating.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.660
There is acceleration
going on over here.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.672
So there must be some
type of net force.

00:06:38.672 --> 00:06:40.630
Well, let's think about
what the net force must

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.300
be on this person, or on
this toddler, I should say.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.660
The net force is going to
be the mass of this toddler.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.970
It's going to be 10 kilograms
times the acceleration

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.450
of this toddler, times 2 meters
per second squared, which

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.280
is equal to 20 kilogram meters
per second squared, which

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.800
is the same thing as
20 newtons upwards.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.040
20 newtons upwards
is the net force.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.770
So if we already have
the force due to gravity

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.455
at 98 newtons downwards--
that's the same thing here;

00:07:16.455 --> 00:07:17.830
that's that one
right over there,

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.800
98 newtons downwards-- we need a
force that not only bounces off

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.910
that 98 newtons downwards to
not only keep it stationary,

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.950
but is also doing
another 20 newtons

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.020
in the upwards direction.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:35.260
So here we need a force
in order for the elevator

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.710
to accelerate the toddler
upwards at 2 meters per second,

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.050
you have a net force
is positive 20 newtons,

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.040
or 20 newtons in the
upward direction.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.840
Or another way to think about
it, if you have negative 98

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.630
newtons here, you're going
to need 20 more than that

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.120
in the positive direction.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:08:00.040
So you're going to need 118
newtons now in the j direction.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.110
So here, where the elevator
is accelerating upward,

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:07.110
the normal force is
now 20 newtons higher

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.220
than it was there.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:12.140
And that's what's allowing
this toddler to accelerate.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.340
Now let's think
about this situation.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:18.980
No acceleration, but
we do have velocity.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:20.280
So here we were stationary.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.090
Here we do have velocity.

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.560
And you might be
tempted to think,

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.770
oh, maybe I still
have some higher force

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:29.480
here because I'm moving upwards.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.330
I have some upwards velocity.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.640
But remember Newton's
first law of motion.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.450
If you're at a
constant velocity,

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.120
including a constant
velocity of 0,

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.679
you have no net force on you.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.740
So this toddler right over
here, once the toddler

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.780
gets to this stage,
the net forces

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.549
are going to look
identical over here.

00:08:46.549 --> 00:08:48.840
And actually, if you're
sitting in either this elevator

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.560
or this elevator, assuming it's
not being bumped around it all,

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.350
you would not be able
to tell the difference

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:59.330
because your body is
sensitive to acceleration.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.270
Your body cannot sense its
velocity if it has no air,

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:05.670
if it has no frame of reference
or nothing to see passing by.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.310
So to the toddler
there, it doesn't

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:09.470
know whether it is
stationary or whether it

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.870
has constant velocity.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.910
It would be able to
tell this-- it would

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:15.970
feel that kind of
compression on its body.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.570
And that's what its nerves
are sensitive towards,

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.280
perception is sensitive to.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.665
But here it's identical
to the first situation.

00:09:22.665 --> 00:09:26.200
And Newton's first law tells
there's no net force on this.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.360
So it's just like
the first situation.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.770
The normal force, the force of
the elevator on this toddler's

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:35.650
shoes, is going to be
identical to the downward force

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.000
due to gravity.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.080
So the normal force here
is going to be 98 newtons.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.140
Completely nets out the
downward, the negative 98

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:43.640
newtons.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.440
So once again, this
is in the j direction,

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.710
in the positive j direction.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:51.370
And then when we
are about to get

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.040
to our floor, what is happening?

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.350
Well, once again we
have a net acceleration

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.840
of negative 2 meters per second.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.060
So if you have a negative
acceleration, so once again

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.740
what is the net force here?

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.530
The net force over
here is going to be

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.450
the mass of the
toddler, 10 kilograms,

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:14.110
times negative 2
meters per second.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.760
And this was right here
in the j direction.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.390
That's the vertical direction.

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.600
Remember j is just
the unit vector

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.860
in the vertical
direction facing upwards.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:29.270
So negative 2 meters per second
squared in the j direction.

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:34.120
And this is equal to negative
20 kilogram meters per second

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.910
squared in the j direction, or
negative 20 newtons in the j

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:38.900
direction.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.220
So the net force on this
is negative 20 newtons.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:46.240
So we have the force of
gravity at negative 98 newtons

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.840
in the j direction.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.950
So we're fully
compensating for that

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.450
because we're still going
to have a net negative force

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:56.580
while this child
is decelerating.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.410
And that negative net force
is a negative net force

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:02.150
of-- I keep repeating
it-- negative 20.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:08.240
So we're only going to have
a 78 newton normal force here

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.250
that counteracts all but
20 newtons of the force

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.220
due to gravity.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.280
So this right over
here is going to be

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.295
78 newtons in the j direction.

00:11:18.295 --> 00:11:20.170
And so I really want
you to think about this.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:22.700
And I actually really want you
to think about this next time

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.180
you're sitting in the elevator.

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:27.770
The only time that you realize
that something is going on

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.380
is when that elevator is
really just accelerating

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.090
or when it's just decelerating.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:35.220
When it's just accelerating,
you feel a little bit heavier.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.289
And when it's just decelerating,
you feel a little bit lighter.

00:11:38.289 --> 00:11:40.580
And I want you to think a
little bit about why that is.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.420
But while it's moving
at a constant velocity

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.750
or is stationary, you
feel like you're just

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:48.910
sitting on the surface
of the planet someplace.
