1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,400
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05,401 --> 00:00:09,800
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and Ah,

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:10,800
game chess.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,800
Checking in on you late Wednesday night
while my daughter sleeps in the next F

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,600
and Ruma. Yeah, I got to keep quiet
on this one. I got to keep it down.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,190
Keep it down. I turned up the volume so
I can whisper a little bit here. Right.

7
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,140
I gotta knock this fucker up.

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,840
I got a table read for
episode eight of Season Three,

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,240
eight of 10 where 80% of the way
there for you mathletes out there.

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,191
Very excited.

11
00:00:38,191 --> 00:00:43,191
Starting to see the light at the end of
the tunnel before the horrific editing

12
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,400
process begins. And uh, you know,

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,520
we'll just be working
for another year and uh,

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,550
get everything all locked and I'll have
maybe three days off and then we'll

15
00:00:56,761 --> 00:01:01,710
start all over again. Bump
pump, pump, pump, pump, pump,
pump, pump, pump, pump. Oh,

16
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,350
Badu Ludo too. Um, what's going on? How
are you? I, yeah, how's your week going?

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,350
Is that all right?
I'm actually a have to do the table read.

18
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,600
I'm going to bright some more shit.

19
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,430
And then late night I'm going to be
traveling up to Toronto where I'm doing

20
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:22,431
three shows at the Sony
fucking sat up Toronto,

21
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:25,680
one of my favorite cities. You know, I
like, I like a nice small city, you know,

22
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:27,810
everybody knows everybody's name.
That's what I love about Toronto.

23
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,930
You know what I mean? It's not this
fucking monstrosity with a ton of traffic.

24
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,110
Everybody's done the earth now.
I actually really like, you know,

25
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,940
it's the biggest God damn city,
you know, basically for, uh,

26
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,910
people in the United States.
All right.

27
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,100
Who never look up when they're walking
around so they never see Canada. Right.

28
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,960
They dumb like me. Where north to you
is looking up cause you can't fucking,

29
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,420
you have no spatial relation to
how you stand on this planet. Um,

30
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,160
auto was the capital of Canada,
but Toronto is, is like,

31
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,790
it's kind of like how Albany is
like the capital of New York,

32
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:10,140
but it's all about New York City.
Albany is the capital of New York state,

33
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:14,160
I should say, and share.
They have the egg, you know,

34
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,320
they have a fucking
minor league hockey team.

35
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:20,220
There's a lot to like an Albany
got some beautiful theaters.

36
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,220
You know what I mean?
They got that fucking,

37
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,900
we used to build shit here before
it all left, you know, for 30 years.

38
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:31,410
And now we're coming back around
with a little tech savvy horse shit,

39
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,610
like all these fucking rust belt cities.
Not Saying Albany was in the rust belt,

40
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,610
but all I can look at,
look at what's going on in Pittsburgh.

41
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,400
The revitalization of the downtown area
is all these fucking nerds who make

42
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:48,150
websites and uh,
robots and you know,

43
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:49,410
synthetic heroin,

44
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:53,880
whatever the fuck it is these
nerds do for these sociopath's,

45
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,150
for these fucking sociopath.
That's how it works. Nerds,

46
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,050
I've said that my act nerds make
fucking sociopath dreams come true.

47
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:06,250
That's what the fuck they
do. Okay. Sociopath's are
crazy enough to think shit,

48
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:10,810
but they need a nerd to actually make
it a fucking reality in nerds do none of

49
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:13,030
the background to backbone,
I should say.

50
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,660
They don't have the backbone to tell
fucking sociopath's. You know what dude,

51
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:21,520
I know I, I could figure out how to do
that, but I'm not going to make that.

52
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:23,620
They won't do it.
They won't do it.

53
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:28,660
And they're all sitting around making
robots that they can fuck right now to get

54
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:30,280
rid of that guilt.
Okay.

55
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:34,510
And we're taking collars were
taking callers will read them live.

56
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:41,350
Um, Toronto. What of Doing
Toronto? Toronto. Sorry.

57
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,550
Just had some fucking corn
checks. Um, by the way,

58
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,660
I haven't been working out cause
my cap was fucked up and I'm,

59
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm still dropping weight just by not
boozing and eating like a fucking angel.

60
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,980
Do you know what I have
every fucking night?

61
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:03,010
Like probably four out of seven nights
a week at this premade to bully salad

62
00:04:03,531 --> 00:04:04,280
that has this little,

63
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,350
I don't know if it's cous cous I
don't know what the fuck it is.

64
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,610
Tomatoes and onions in it.

65
00:04:07,611 --> 00:04:12,611
And then I put a little fucking chicken
in there and I just eat that shit.

66
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,990
Like the fuel that it is,

67
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,990
I just shovel it into my mouth
to stop the, the hunger feeling.

68
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,900
And it's around five 36 and
then I owed do anything.

69
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,050
And if I get a little extra hug,
did a set tonight, you know,

70
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:27,970
burned a little calories.
Every once in a while I'll come home.

71
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:30,790
I just have a fucking bullet cereal and
then that's it. And I have to tell you,

72
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:34,450
dude, I gotta tell you,
I've got on the scale today,

73
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,110
all fucking Billy alabaster,

74
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:42,250
freckled fat tits was down to 175 pounds.

75
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:46,450
I was up to a buck 85 I
was a buck 90 last summer,

76
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:51,830
so I'm down to one 75 my fighting weight
is one 72 I got this acting Gig in two

77
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:57,721
fucking weeks and I've been unable to
work out my fucking rotator cuff is all

78
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:58,840
fucked up again.

79
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,550
I was imitating this blowup doll on stage
and I stuck my fucking arm out and it

80
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:05,620
started burning again. It's like, really?

81
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,703
Yeah,

82
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,190
I'm a chef, I'm a God damn man. I
have to, you know what I have to do?

83
00:05:10,191 --> 00:05:13,130
I have to go to a physical
therapist and I have to,

84
00:05:13,131 --> 00:05:15,440
I have to start being a better
patient. Like, you know,

85
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:18,770
when they tell me to do some shit,
I need to go fucking do the shit.

86
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,350
That's what the fuck I need to
do to finally get past the shit.

87
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,680
Cause I haven't worked out. You
know, I used to be pull up guy.

88
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,140
I got a bet with Paul Versey
that when I'm 70 years old,

89
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,990
I'm still be able to do 10 pull ups.
I want you to be able to do that.

90
00:05:29,991 --> 00:05:33,680
When I turned 50 the way this is fucking
going on. What I'm trying to say here,

91
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:37,790
people is I'm falling apart. I know
there's a lot of benefits out there. Okay?

92
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,550
From, you know, people's
who's fucking, you know,

93
00:05:40,551 --> 00:05:43,610
heads were fused together with their
brother would have whatever your fucking

94
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:45,350
causes.
All right.

95
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,960
What about broken down middle aged,
white male heterosexuals.

96
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,070
What about that? What do
all about? All of us. Okay.

97
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,680
After half a century of privilege,
you know,

98
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:04,160
what about us with our sore calf and our
soil, right shoulder. What about that?

99
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,200
How people,
you know,

100
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,000
I want to know how much you care.
Um,

101
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,890
I just want to turn a fucking corner
with this goddamn thing. You can't do it.

102
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,800
I haven't been able to do whatever
the other rotated cuffs at the tough,

103
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:23,750
you know, they gay kind of fucking linger.
I know, I know. I'm living with it. Um,

104
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:27,440
so my name is, I've been talking to
some people recently and you know,

105
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:29,660
I've always just joked around
about pharmaceutical companies.

106
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:32,780
I keep hearing this rumor
that they started the of
this fucking heroin epidemic

107
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:35,060
and everything. And I
just found out, you know,

108
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,810
someone from like the town I grew up
in 23 years old just fucking died of a

109
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:45,710
heroin overdose.
I grew up in fucking Mayberry and uh,

110
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,850
someone was talking about basically
all these fucking things, oxy,

111
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:55,760
Percocet, all of that shit. It has the
exact same fucking addictive qualities,

112
00:06:55,761 --> 00:06:57,860
chemical makeup,
all of that shit is heroin.

113
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:02,950
It's just like a synthetic heroin and
a difference between an opiate and an

114
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:06,080
opioid.
And opiate is natural.

115
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,550
Like those poppy fucking things you
always see in those chuck Norris movies.

116
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,043
Right?

117
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,730
And then now the poppy seeds there
and then in a opiate is just like

118
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,790
manufactured nerds.
Nerds,

119
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,430
you fucking go to the doctor like me. I
fucked up my calf. This fucking guy goes,

120
00:07:25,431 --> 00:07:28,560
all right, I'm going to give
you a painkiller and I'm
going to give you an anti

121
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:32,240
inflammatory.
So I go to the fucking pharmaceutical.

122
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,970
Pharmacists are fucking hilarious.

123
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:38,780
The fact that they get to dress up like
their doctors is one of the funniest

124
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:40,610
fucking things. It's like,
what are you doing in there?

125
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:46,340
It's like you're basically working
the Starbucks of the medical field.

126
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,810
You know what? What do you do?
What the fuck you do it back?

127
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,050
You should get me a cup of
coffee with my fucking pills.

128
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,240
They always act like they're so God damn,
you know,

129
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,400
just under the gun when you're back there,
you're counting aspirin.

130
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,700
I get, you know what? Enough way.

131
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,930
You know what the fucking worst
thing is is when somebody like,

132
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,310
it's like running. There's
nothing. People think cops are bad.

133
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:17,290
The worst thing you want to have fucking
attitude. Get a rent a cop. Cars in the,

134
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,160
in the,
in the back of his head.

135
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:24,260
He knows he's not a real cops and now
he's got something to prove. A cop's cop,

136
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:26,660
you know what I mean? Say He's, he
knows he's, you know, he's got a gun,

137
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,400
he's got a fucking license to kill him.

138
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,940
I'll stick this right in the back of
your fucking mouth and I'll pull the

139
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:35,150
trigger and go down and go to a sandwich
and I even think about it. Right?

140
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,880
Fuck around cup.
Where does he get maybe as a taser,

141
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,950
it got a little fucking stick.

142
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,940
So he's gotta be some cut and run
around taking some little fucking kid's

143
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:47,360
skateboard away, right? They, they,
they, they dabble in that shit.

144
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,960
So always that type of shit,
you know what I mean?

145
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,940
It's like if you're going
to get a threesome, right,

146
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:56,270
there's always the beautiful girl and
then the other one is fucking annoying.

147
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,250
Who's got to start running a Yap.
Even if she is beautiful,

148
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,440
she knows she's not as good
looking as the other one.

149
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:04,650
That brings up the insecurity and
then she won't shut the fuck up.

150
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,640
She tries to be funny or something like
that is stupid, sloppy tits hanging out.

151
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,110
It's like,
what are you doing?

152
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,730
I don't care how fucking ugly you are.

153
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,750
You don't think I'm gonna work my way
through you to get to her to shut up.

154
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,410
I don't know what the fuck this has to
do with pharmaceutical companies. Okay.

155
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:26,400
But I know when I went to this
pharmacy with my calf problem,

156
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,690
all right, I was supposed to get, he
said a painkiller. I'm like, well,

157
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:33,210
I'm not fucking with those.
I'm not fucking with those.

158
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,500
I'm not getting heroin in a
fucking synthetic form and
start tailoring and look

159
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:42,810
how I handle beaus people,
or I should say,

160
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:47,190
look how Booz handled me.
Okay.

161
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,520
Who's like triple g walking
down Alvarez the other day.

162
00:09:50,521 --> 00:09:54,120
That's what fucking booze does to me.
A backing up the whole fucking fight.

163
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,900
Maybe once a while I plant and I
fucking throw a cup of combinations.

164
00:09:57,901 --> 00:10:01,560
You know what the bottle does? It
eats it up. Hey eats, sit upright.

165
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:07,110
But my wife's sitting there, gone here,
not an alcoholic has me winning one 18,

166
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:10,980
one 10. Figure that one
out. So I fucking go in

167
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,590
to a cvs. Right. Which is a great place.
If you need to buy somebody a card,

168
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,560
you know, get a gallon of root beer
and get some fucking heroin. Right.

169
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:24,690
Maybe some shit and fucking, I don't know,
shaving cream or some shit. Right? So

170
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,450
the fucking, you know, rent a fucking
Dr. Guy behind there. He fucking,

171
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,270
you know, it's, you know, it's
going to be like 20 minutes.

172
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:35,750
So I was gonna be like 20 minutes. All
right. Okay. Whatever. I get it. Yeah.

173
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,610
There's a lot of different
colored pills back there.

174
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,680
You got to look at your pill chart. See
which color the blue ones are for boys.

175
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,620
And the red ones are for old people,
whatever that sciences.

176
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:48,760
Okay.

177
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,280
They're, they're back. They're
acting like they make the pills.

178
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,060
I need to shut the fuck
up about pharmacists.

179
00:10:58,061 --> 00:11:02,770
I got to read up on him here far months.
Let me finish selling the story. Um,

180
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,900
so the guy finally comes back,
right.

181
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,470
I'm standing by in all these cute
fucking old people, you know what I mean?

182
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:15,580
Fucking people with all that God damn
pills for the ailments and shit. Um,

183
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,370
and uh, he gives me two vials and I
go, okay, what's this one? He goes,

184
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:22,860
those are the pain pills, painkillers.
And I'm like, all right, well,

185
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:26,580
I'm not messing with that.
And I, and I go, what are
these? And he goes, those, uh,

186
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:30,910
those are more pain pills. And I'm like,
well, what about the anti inflammatory?

187
00:11:30,911 --> 00:11:35,850
He goes, oh, it's, it's in these
painkillers. And it's just like,

188
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,330
oh, I don't want that. I just want the
antiinflammatory. But you know what it is,

189
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,230
is he's fucking drug companies.
They're drug dealers. So they get,

190
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,890
they want to get me hooked.
So you want the antiinflammatory,

191
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,380
you've got to do a little fucking
synthetic heroin one with it. Okay.

192
00:11:49,381 --> 00:11:51,930
Now base in all of this on
my own fucking paranoia,

193
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,870
in like two conversations I've
had over the last 48 hours. Okay?

194
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,440
And now I'm in my fucking house,
like in that movie, Beautiful Mind.

195
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:00,310
I'm taking fucking,

196
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:04,420
I'm cutting out headlines from papers
that I don't read and upon on Blinken and

197
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:08,650
all together and I'm presenting
it as fact to you. Okay.

198
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,050
Pharmacists,
what do they do?

199
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,623
All right.

200
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,750
They advise physicians and other
health practitioners on the selections,

201
00:12:21,751 --> 00:12:25,740
dosage interactions and
side effects of medication.

202
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,660
They also plan and monitor drug
programs or regimens. Pharmacists,

203
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:31,231
council,

204
00:12:31,231 --> 00:12:36,231
hospitalized patients on the use of
drugs and on their use at home when the

205
00:12:37,261 --> 00:12:41,000
patients are discharged. Yeah, you
made it the back of the CVS. Okay.

206
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,810
Take two of these twice a day.

207
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,860
Take one on the third day and
then flush the rest of it, right?

208
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,993
MMM.

209
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,900
Pharmacists

210
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,990
level of edgy to everything just
pops up like I wrote what and then it

211
00:12:59,991 --> 00:13:01,630
immediately popped up.
Do they do,

212
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,770
I said level and immediately of
education immediately popped up.

213
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:11,350
Doctoral or professional degree.
All right.

214
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:14,980
Here's what you got to do.
There's no way this is, no, no.

215
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,450
This can't be more than a two year
fucking program. Okay. Here you go.

216
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:21,670
Here's a video on how to
be a fucking pharmacist.

217
00:13:21,671 --> 00:13:25,690
It's a fucking cartoon character
in a pharmacist and a pharmacy.

218
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,380
Education requirements and career center.

219
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,110
Becoming a pharmacist requires a
significant amount of formal education.

220
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,950
Get the fuck Outta here. Learn
about education, job duties,

221
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:40,210
and trained to see if this is
the right career for you. Okay.

222
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:45,211
Find the perfect school k doctor
of pharmacy degree fields.

223
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:49,600
Non-Specified two years
of undergraduate study.

224
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:53,290
I got four is required to
apply for pharmacy school.

225
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:58,330
Okay.
License required in all states.

226
00:13:58,331 --> 00:14:01,360
I got one of those to sell health
insurance. That's not impressive.

227
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:06,370
You take a test and then your licensed
experienced clerkship residency's

228
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:10,990
fellowships. This is bullshit.
Key skills, attention to detail.

229
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,660
Oh,
did I say for Percocet?

230
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:18,870
I met one a and an extensive
knowledge of drugs and interactions.

231
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,840
Okay, there you go. I'll give you
that one. Research, communication,

232
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:27,350

$121,500 given up for the
pharmacist. Jesus. No.

235
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:38,060
One of their lab coats is
so damn clean, Huh? Back.

236
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,710
They're raking in the fucking money.

237
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,310
I'll tell you if you start selling
some of those drugs on this side to the

238
00:14:43,311 --> 00:14:45,450
people that you get
addictive in the front. Okay.

239
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:46,660
Yeah.

240
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:51,100
Do you know, I'm just saying you
get those fake tits. They're sweet.

241
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,210
[inaudible] um, I had an
amazing week this week.

242
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:57,830
I actually got to a,

243
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:04,330
I got to fucking play drums for about
two and a half hours with a tremendous

244
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:07,730
musician who is just like, hey man, do
you want to fucking jam? And I was like,

245
00:15:07,731 --> 00:15:11,030
yeah man, I want to jam. And I
didn't even know what that meant.

246
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,290
I thought it was going to go down there
and just be like, hey, you do, you know,

247
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:18,530
highway to hell. That's what I thought
it was going to be. I showed up,

248
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:21,250
this guy was doing that yellow
have Reggie watts thing where yeah,

249
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,400
we fucking builds up,

250
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:27,120
he'll make like drum sounds and then
I'll make guitar songs and then whatever

251
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,890
and whatever, whatever. And then he
starts fucking singing over it. Right. Um,

252
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,660
he was doing that but with like a guitar
and he was just creating these songs.

253
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,430
And then I had to jump in and play drums
and it was just a whole other fucking

254
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:45,110
animal. And I realized that all these
years I thought that I played drums.

255
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:50,030
I didn't, I like do drums. I was talking
about somebody who bought that today.

256
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,390
I like do drums. I don't play
them. You know what I mean?

257
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,800
Playing him is what I attempted to do
the other night and failed horrifically.

258
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,230
See if you fucking listen to a song and
you listen to what the drummer's doing,

259
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:04,550
you figure it out,
then you play it.

260
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,960
That's like getting all the answers to
the test and then the drum part fits,

261
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:12,140
fix fits because the other guy
already came up with it. But you,

262
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,810
somebody just starts playing you a
piece of music he never heard of.

263
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:19,160
And then you have to actually come
up with the drum part. You are, um,

264
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:25,100
the level of musician that you are as
immediately exposed and there's nowhere

265
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:25,934
for you to hide.

266
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:33,620
And I was just, I, we had a great time.
I had such a fucking fun time doing it,

267
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,800
but I was actually thinking, I was
like, wow man. I knew I sucked.

268
00:16:36,801 --> 00:16:40,100
I didn't know I sucked. Wow. Um,

269
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,120
but it was a, it was so much
fun and the person was really,

270
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:47,000
really generous and I want
to thank him for a fucking

271
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:48,330
okay.

272
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:53,220
Hang on that long with me. But it was
such a fun fucking time and it was also,

273
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:58,140
you know, it was a very huge learning. So
it wasn't, you know, it was a few moments.

274
00:16:58,141 --> 00:17:00,840
I actually thought I played pretty good.
But other than that I was just like,

275
00:17:00,841 --> 00:17:05,040
Jesus Christ just kept trying
to do stuff and then, you know,

276
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,650
you just make that face.
Like I'm not bad at that too.

277
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,950
I don't know if you professional drummers
can try and fill and you don't you

278
00:17:10,951 --> 00:17:14,730
fuck up, you know, do you make
a face? Cause I always do.

279
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:16,980
I make that,
oops,

280
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:20,430
you don't have face John Paul Jones made
when him and bought him fucked up in a

281
00:17:20,431 --> 00:17:23,280
song remains the same.
They came in a little too early.

282
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:29,010
But John Paul Jones says back to the
crowd and you see bon and looked down and

283
00:17:29,011 --> 00:17:32,700
he just kind of shakes his head for half
a second and then they got it right.

284
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,240
Um,
I dunno what I'm talking about.

285
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,100
I'm just trying to fill up this fucking
half hour cause I have no fucking time.

286
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:45,050
I have no time in my life anymore. You
know what I mean? I don't, I need to,

287
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,500
I need a pharmacist in my fucking
life. You know what, you know,

288
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:52,200
I don't take pills aside from the fact
that I don't want to get addicted is, uh,

289
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,600
what I like about drinking is I enjoy
the effort it takes to get the buzz.

290
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:03,170
You know what I mean? Like I don't
like, uh, like we just seem so easy,

291
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:07,580
especially now with all these fucking
vaporizers and stuff. I'll eat you inhale,

292
00:18:07,581 --> 00:18:12,540
you're doing that anyways. Then you
just sit there and all say, hey man,

293
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:16,190
blah blah blah, but fucking
drinking. You gotta drink it.

294
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:17,830
Yeah.

295
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,570
If you're going to get shit
faced just drinking beer,

296
00:18:19,571 --> 00:18:21,240
that's a lot of Goddamn work.
You've got dre,

297
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:25,990
he drink at least six of them feel
lightweight, upwards of fucking, you know,

298
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,500
I dunno, 36 to 40 depending
on, how bout you Drake.

299
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,110
So anyways, look at this shit. So
I went to this um, this website

300
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,240
and it was like, what is the
difference between heroin and Percocet?

301
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,570
And this is like fucking nuts.

302
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:50,070
This is like people who were like on these
drugs talking in this, this chat room.

303
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,810
Like what is the difference?

304
00:18:51,811 --> 00:18:56,811
Someone told me I should buy some
versus buying 30 milligrams of oxycodone

305
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,230
because it should be a lot cheaper.
So what are your opinions?

306
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,210
Somebody taught, basically told this
person who is addicted to these,

307
00:19:07,211 --> 00:19:11,710
this fucking oxy, they should
now get heroin. So this guy
just, this is such like,

308
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,590
like they talking about cars or some shit.
This person says,

309
00:19:14,591 --> 00:19:16,360
well they are both strong narcotics.

310
00:19:16,361 --> 00:19:19,590
Heroin is an opiate and
oxycodone is an opiod,

311
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,170
which is basically in layman terms,

312
00:19:21,171 --> 00:19:24,970
opioids are synthetics and
opiates occur naturally.

313
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,750
And the opium poppy, in my
opinion, heroin is stronger.

314
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:33,760
But then that's countered by the fact
that you'll never know street heroins

315
00:19:33,761 --> 00:19:37,960
purity. And you always know what's
in an oxy, am I saying that right?

316
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,980
Oxy coating tablet, do you buy 30
milligrams of 30 milligram tablets?

317
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:43,000
You know how strong it is.

318
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:46,540
Heroin purity can go up and down and
they cut it with all kinds of shit.

319
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:50,710
These are fucking people doing hard drugs.
First of all,

320
00:19:50,711 --> 00:19:53,680
I got to give it up that they could
still fucking have the sense to go into a

321
00:19:53,681 --> 00:19:57,270
chat room
and compare fucking notes.

322
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:02,580
So
does a lot of people talking about this,

323
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:04,440
but not in,
not on CNN,

324
00:20:04,441 --> 00:20:09,420
on Fox News or any of those other fucking
so-called news channels where they're

325
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:13,740
all bought and paid for and they're not
going to do this fucking story because

326
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,813
you know,

327
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,480
the same companies that get everybody
allegedly got everybody addicted or

328
00:20:18,481 --> 00:20:22,200
advertising on their fucking channels.
Um,

329
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:27,950
so Ohio is suing drug companies over
their role in creating an opioid epidemic,

330
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,670
which has led to an opiate epidemic.
Uh,

331
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,950
cause after a while they won't
fill you fuck a prescription.

332
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,500
So NPRs Robert Siegel talks
with Ohio attorney general.

333
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,910
Did you get to the bullshit here?
The state of Ohio figures?

334
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:47,130
It's home to 200,000 opiod addicts.
That's the equivalent.

335
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:50,440
The population of Akron
overdoses are so common.

336
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,670
The morgues in some Ohio
counties lack for space.

337
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,890
Today's Ohio, uh, today,

338
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:01,300
Ohio's attorney general announced
he's bringing a suit against five drug

339
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:06,280
manufacturers accusing them
of misrepresenting the risk
of prescription opioids

340
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:10,060
and helping to fuel an addiction
epidemic in this state. Yeah.

341
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:14,360
Like these people are like murdering
people. If what they're saying is true,

342
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:18,700
that's what the fuck they're doing in
these fucking cunts. These corporate cons,

343
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:23,000
they go to bed fucking silk,
pajamas,

344
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,810
indoor and outdoor pool is
everybody's fucking dying.

345
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,660
I don't know the uh,

346
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:34,820
population control person in me sorta
like I'm on both sides of this thing.

347
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,460
It's like this is fucking terrible that
do to people. Then it's also like, well,

348
00:21:37,461 --> 00:21:38,600
there's 20 people on the planet,

349
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,590
so thank God these fucking psychos are
killing people so they can get a bigger

350
00:21:42,591 --> 00:21:44,660
house. I heard the like, you know,

351
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,330
any doctors listen to this shit
anonymously want to write in.

352
00:21:47,331 --> 00:21:50,510
I mean I heard like they have like
these pharmaceutical companies see,

353
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:55,170
hire these hot chicks to walk around to
bring in the new drugs wearing like fuck

354
00:21:55,171 --> 00:21:56,180
me pumps and stuff.

355
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,020
Is that true or did it was I have asleep
sleep watching some red shoe diary one

356
00:22:00,021 --> 00:22:02,030
night. I thought it was in
this industry. I have no idea.

357
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,930
So the State Attorney General Mike,

again, I'll fuck this is the, uh,

360
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,130

361
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:20,330
hear NPR.

362
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:25,330
Mike [inaudible] good to be back.

363
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,340
Thank you very much Segal.

364
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,180
And first tell us which companies
have you named in the suit.

365
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,610
We have sued the following companies,
Purdue Pharma,

366
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,130
endo health solutions,

367
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,610
Janssen or Yansen pharmaceuticals,

368
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,480
cephalon and then Allergan.

369
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,543
Okay.

370
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:52,050
Why the fuck? Why wouldn't
you just summarize all of
this? I guess I can hit play.

371
00:22:52,051 --> 00:22:54,090
It's a five minute interview.
I don't have time for that shit.

372
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,260
US officials are starting to treat
opiod companies like big tobacco.

373
00:22:59,261 --> 00:23:02,100
About time and how the city
is suing pharmaceutical.

374
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,880
Don't vilify drug companies says cvs.
Really?

375
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:09,700
Oh Jesus. He's how button
paid for these fuckers? Well,

376
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,500
but you don't mind when I
hear their opinion first.

377
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:18,880
Only America would vilify the people that
invented Viagra. That's what happened.

378
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:22,210
That's what's happening.
Parentheses sort of.

379
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:27,400
They just bought back everything they
just said this week is the FDA holds very

380
00:23:27,401 --> 00:23:31,090
public hearings and the potential health
risks of popular prescription pain

381
00:23:31,091 --> 00:23:34,900
medication such as Cox,
two inhibitors,

382
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,740
Pfizer, the company that
makes one of those medicines.

383
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:42,370
Celebrex is also the company that
brought you in yours. Viagra,

384
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,990
drug companies,
big farmers.

385
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,560
The villains of medicine and health
care at least according to much media.

386
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:52,890
Who the fuck wrote this horseshit.
This is by,

387
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:56,100
I swear to God.
Booty cost grove Mather.

388
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:58,680
All right.

389
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,490
I don't understand how you can be anywhere
in journalism with a first name booty.

390
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:08,280
All right. Have I, have I made enough of
an ass of myself talking about this shit?

391
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:13,860
Um, you know I love about this country
is whores can give press conferences.

392
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,630
All right, let's do some. Um, all right,

393
00:24:18,631 --> 00:24:23,320
let me do a little advertising here.
Oh, look who's back. Indochina.

394
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,960
Indochino uh,

395
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:29,490
talk about how every man looks
better in a suit. Listen,

396
00:24:29,491 --> 00:24:33,570
I've always been attracted to men,
but nothing gets my loins going.

397
00:24:33,571 --> 00:24:35,700
Like seeing another man
walked by in a suit.

398
00:24:35,701 --> 00:24:39,400
Something about hearing those slacks
rubbing together in Doe China.

399
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,080
China is making it easy to get a perfectly
tailored suit at an incredible price.

400
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:51,230
You can choose from hundreds of top
quality fabrics and personalize your suit

401
00:24:51,511 --> 00:24:54,030
just the way you want it.
Whether it works,

402
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,830
whether it's for work or a wedding
or another special occasion,

403
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:00,290
okay?

404
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,080
It's going to work is
not a special occasion.

405
00:25:02,081 --> 00:25:04,280
That's what the fuck he up to
a wedding special occasion.

406
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:11,360
Where are you going, honey, to a special
occasion. All I'm going to work. Well,

407
00:25:11,361 --> 00:25:12,860
what the fuck is it?
He's going to work.

Choose your customizations from lapels
to pleats to jacket linings and more.

414
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:41,720
What the fuck else is their shoulders?

You weren't taught all week.
You were tired all week.

452
00:28:18,171 --> 00:28:21,530
Why not fucking take your paycheck
and throw it on some football games?

453
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,210
Draft kings,

too late to take your paycheck sticking

on the table and never

00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,380
Or you get closer to the game
you love with draft kings.

457
00:28:33,381 --> 00:28:34,550
One week fantasy football.

Draft Kings has organized
players into eight tiers.

464
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:59,360
All you have to do according to what?
Skin color.

465
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:02,540
How are you doing this?
All you have to do is select.

466
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,170
Are there eight different skin colors?
Well, if you get into shades are,

467
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,830
if you just like a racist person,
there's like black, white, Asian,

468
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,520
native American.

469
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,653
Yeah,

470
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,070

the last fucking read.

485
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:15,460
This is the last fucking read
that I have to do. Oh my God,

486
00:30:15,461 --> 00:30:16,450
that was a little Don Henley.

487
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,230
Remember Don and he put out that great
fucking album, the late eighties.

488
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:25,750
What a songwriter. What a showman. A lift.

489
00:30:25,751 --> 00:30:26,584
Everybody.

490
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:31,450
Lyft knows that drivers
are what keeps them moving.

491
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:36,580
So they do everything they can to make
sure their drivers are happy on every

492
00:30:36,581 --> 00:30:37,414
trip.

493
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,840
Lift believes that being a ride sharing
driver should be fun if you're having a

494
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:45,790
good time.
Also the passengers,

495
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,930
if you're choosing a ride
sharing company to drive for,

496
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,890
go with the company that treats
you better. It's lift now.

497
00:30:53,891 --> 00:30:57,310
Like those slave driving
bastards over at Uw, at Uber,

498
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,270
you want to go with Lyft,
you get tips at this fucking place.

499
00:31:01,271 --> 00:31:04,450
The only tips you get it over is, hey,
here's a tip. You ain't make it shittier.

500
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:09,070
So shut the fuck up and keep
driving. That's how they
treat him over there, right?

501
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,040
Lyft is the North Sea.
I mean,

502
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:16,210
Uber is the North Korea
of ride sharing apps.

503
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:21,340
Uh, live was the first
to offer in APP tipping.

504
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:25,540
Can imagine a few are fucking Lyft
driver and you picked up Kim Jong Il,

505
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,050
or maybe just somebody who look like,
you know what I mean? You're like, well,

506
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,630
he wouldn't be over here.
He doesn't like us.

507
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:37,600
Maybe that's just some fat Asian kid who
likes to have a Hitler youth haircut.

508
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,580
I don't know where you go.
And serve

509
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,670
to the airport. Live was the
first offer. Inept tipping.

510
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:49,450
When you drive for Lyft,
you keep 100% of the tips.

511
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:54,250
Drivers have been paid over $200
million in tips since the feature was

512
00:31:54,251 --> 00:31:58,480
introduced. Express pay lets
drivers get paid almost instantly.

513
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,630
Instead of waiting for weeks,

514
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,440
you can earn hundreds of dollars a
week plus tips. One, earn more money,

515
00:32:05,441 --> 00:32:08,170
drive more. It's never been
easier to give yourself a raise.

516
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:11,440
It's a simple formula.
Happy drivers means happy passengers.

517
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:16,710
Maybe that's why nine out of 10 Lyft
rides get a perfect five star rating the

518
00:32:17,741 --> 00:32:19,420
others and in a fiery crash.

519
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:23,350
So join the ride sharing company
that believes in treating people,

520
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,580
treating its people better.

521
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:29,850
Go to lift.com/bird today and you
can get a $500 new driver bonus.

00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:45,080
Fuck you. I'll talk to
you later. Um, honestly,

525
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:49,460
32 minutes. Okay. People I want you
guys all have a wonderful weekend.

526
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:52,220
I want you to get on your knees and
give thanks that you don't live in the

527
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:55,190
Caribbean with all them tornadoes coming.
Why don't we say tornadoes,

528
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,070
hurricanes coming,

529
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:58,863
uh,

530
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,340
everybody in Puerto Rico, I
help you make it out. All right?

531
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,870
I just saw was coming yesterday, man. It's
fucking brutal, man. It's really brutal.

532
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:11,130
The same way they are going after these
pharmaceutical companies for a, the,

533
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:16,290
you know, the opioids,
opiates, ob and cheese,

534
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,030
the Endo Chinos,
right?

535
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:21,840
They should go after fucking fossil
fuel companies at some point.

536
00:33:21,841 --> 00:33:24,060
That's going to fucking happen,
you know?

537
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,970
But she can never get the
people that made the decision.

538
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,550
Because what you're doing is you're,
you're suing a corporation,

539
00:33:29,551 --> 00:33:30,960
which is nameless and faceless.

540
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:36,270
And then all those people who made those
fucking decisions collectively turn

541
00:33:36,271 --> 00:33:39,240
your key. They all turned their
fucking key. I was following orders.

542
00:33:39,241 --> 00:33:44,241
All of those fucking cuts when you go to
sue the company or completely insulated

543
00:33:44,371 --> 00:33:49,080
and they will be giving themselves
raises with their blood money.

544
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,750
And then when they go to
fucking attack the company,

545
00:33:51,751 --> 00:33:56,070
everybody just fucking walks
away. It's like, well, I work
there. I am not, you know,

546
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,260
I'm not the corporation.

547
00:33:58,950 --> 00:33:59,783
Okay.

548
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:04,920
Yeah. Why are you still talking? I'm
sorry. I gotta go to fucking bed. Alright.

549
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,130
Anyways, don't be a con
this weekend everybody. Huh?

550
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,990
And don't watch the fucking news. All it's
gonna do is make you feel fucking set.

551
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:17,850
Go out. Be a good person.
You know, somebody asks you
to get in their trunk. Just,

552
00:34:17,851 --> 00:34:21,720
you know, just don't do it.
That's all I'm saying. All right?

553
00:34:21,721 --> 00:34:25,410
Does that make any sense? I
don't give a fuck. All right. Um,

554
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,600
please enjoy this music as we a,

555
00:34:28,601 --> 00:34:31,720

fucking riveting entertainment like the

556
00:34:31,721 --> 00:34:36,390
last fucking 33 minutes of this shit
show from a Thursday afternoon podcast

557
00:34:36,391 --> 00:34:41,391
that's gone by you a Thursday from another
year or possibly earlier this month.

558
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,320
All right?
I'll see all you people in Toronto.

559
00:34:44,321 --> 00:34:47,680
I can't wait to go up there and give
you my brand new IRA fucking bullshit.

560
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:52,110
I'll be there with Paul Versey.
That dude, I called a kid the pride,

561
00:34:52,111 --> 00:34:52,944
a New Jersey,

562
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,433
you know,

563
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:59,800
someday Paul Verges going to walk through
the pearly gates wearing a brand new

564
00:34:59,801 --> 00:35:00,920
pair of Jordan threes.

565
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,860
He's fucking dope.
Did Jordan trees with my,

566
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:11,560
so in those wingstone over all right.
Have a great weekend.

567
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:27,200
I've got,
see what's on the camera.

568
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:34,250
I'm just being vs today.
Ah,

569
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,770

570
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,410

571
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,693
[inaudible]

572
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,340
[inaudible]

573
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:23,980
all right. X Defense Minister from
Canada speaks out about, speaks, uh,

574
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:28,640
speaks about, see that is what
not, once again, not my fault,

575
00:36:28,641 --> 00:36:30,430
this person writes x defense.
Mez.

576
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:34,400
Minister from Canada speaks
about out about aliens,

577
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:41,280
out about aliens or speaks out about
aliens or does he speak about out about

578
00:36:42,221 --> 00:36:46,050
aliens? See what I'm saying?
This isn't always me.

579
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:52,050
Alright, Bill loved the podcast,
freelance every week. Uh,

580
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,090
they're much appreciated,
Yada, Yada, Yada.

581
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:58,470
I thought you might like this link
as you're a big conspiracy theory,

582
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,050
a big conspiracy theorist.
You mean?

583
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:04,560
He said it's the former
Canadian defense administrator.

584
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:09,720
No Canadian defense minister giving some
bold claims about several species of

585
00:37:09,721 --> 00:37:13,410
aliens living among us and actually
working with elements in the government.

586
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,540
Uh, not only that, but a shadowy cabal.

587
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:21,780
C A, B, a, l, k, but k bow, I dunno,

588
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:26,650
comprised of the council on foreign
relations, the build the Burgers,

589
00:37:26,651 --> 00:37:30,690
the
trilateral commission.

590
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,920
That should add a hyphen in it. You
caught the international banking cartel.

591
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,950
Uh,
the oil cartels,

592
00:37:37,951 --> 00:37:41,090
members of various intelligent organizes
the select members and military Dah,

593
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,550
Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.
One world government. Check it out, sir.

594
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:47,940
The last thing I'm going to do is look
at this. I'll put the link up there. Ah,

595
00:37:47,941 --> 00:37:49,110
fuck it.
I'll look at it right now.

596
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:52,500
This shit just freaks me out and makes
me depressed because there's nothing I

597
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,830
could do about it. Okay. Now, how
is this going to help me, sir?

598
00:37:55,831 --> 00:37:59,580
If I find out there's actually
aliens living among us,

599
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:04,860
talking to international bankers,
you know, am I gonna come walking in,

600
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,010
bursting into their meeting like
the end of a feel good movie?

601
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:09,380
Yeah.

602
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:14,240
You know, like, hey man, the people
have spoken and they like me.

603
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:18,360
All right, here we go.
I got it right here. Uh,

604
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,840
Canada's former minister
of national defense,

605
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,070
Paul Haler testifies at the
citizens hearing on disclosure,

606
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:30,330
where the fuck am I last
month in Washington DC that
aliens are living among us

607
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:34,780
and that it is likely at least two of
them are working with the u s government.

608
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:41,530
Oh, this guy sounds like he's out
of his fucking mind. Ah, let, let's,

609
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,280
let's, let's, let's kind of flip the
script here. Let's say you're an alien.

610
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,310
All right.
Whoever's listening to this still,

611
00:38:48,311 --> 00:38:52,660
who believes in aliens who was in blogging
about my reaction to the blogger? Um,

612
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:57,370
can you go to ego to another
fucking solar system now the galaxy,

613
00:38:57,371 --> 00:39:01,330
whatever the fucking terminology is,
and you land there,

614
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,393
okay,

615
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:07,750
what are you going to do other
than try and get blended it.

616
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:11,200
Blend in so people don't chop
your fucking alien head off.

617
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:18,040
Like how exactly did
this fucking alien get?

618
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,510
Infiltrate the government.

619
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:26,070
This is like Mr. Smith goes to Washington.
The alien just lands and just goes,

620
00:39:26,071 --> 00:39:29,850
okay. Ah, right. I mean, how come
he didn't do this in Argentina?

621
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:33,180
He picks the United States,

622
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:38,260
goes right into fucking Washington DC
walks into the Capitol building and

623
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,580
somebody filibustering so they can't
make an electric car or whatever comes

624
00:39:41,581 --> 00:39:44,820
right out on the house
floor and then does what,

625
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:47,780
you know,
security comes up,

626
00:39:47,781 --> 00:39:50,810
tries to shoot him and he just puts his
hands up and their guns turned into like

627
00:39:50,811 --> 00:39:55,760
chocolate bars or fall to the ground and
then for some reason everybody in their

628
00:39:55,761 --> 00:39:59,930
suits doesn't scramble
and freak the fuck out,

629
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:04,180
you know?
No,

630
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:09,640
you just fucking walk out there and say,
hey, what's going on? Relax, relax, relax.

631
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,030
It's a simple technology
that you guys will discover.

632
00:40:13,031 --> 00:40:14,320
If you become friends with me,

633
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,400
hired attorney could fucking gone into
some melted shit that doesn't let people

634
00:40:18,401 --> 00:40:22,150
shoot you. I am from the
planet. Zol Tar. Right.

635
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:27,310
It always begins with z.
How does that work?

636
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:33,350
Like if you were a fucking alien and
you went to another God damn plan it.

637
00:40:33,351 --> 00:40:36,290
Exactly, I guess. Okay.
You'd be like, all right,

638
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:40,160
if there's a bunch of different nations,
which one seems to be running? Shit.

639
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:45,690
I got to chop the head off and you're
just going to want you and you and a buddy

640
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:50,470
till you
gonna walk in fucking arm and arm

641
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:57,030
and do what? Yeah. Hey, listen. Uh,

642
00:40:57,031 --> 00:41:00,280
I think just the simple fact that worry
we were able to get here. You know,

643
00:41:00,281 --> 00:41:03,680
the kind of firepower
that we're capable of. Um,

644
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:08,730
for some fucking reason we want to take
over this planet or we want you guys to

645
00:41:08,831 --> 00:41:12,280
do shit the way we feel
that the it should be done.

646
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,990
Who? Who would want that
fucking headache? I don't,

647
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,990
I don't know that I believe this shit.
Anyways,

648
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:26,670
he believes Hellyer whose beliefs are
extra life, extra terrestrial life.

649
00:41:26,671 --> 00:41:28,980
And you are so your foes
are well established.

650
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:33,000
Made the statements at the nongovernmental
hearings chaired by six former US

651
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,680
congressman and aimed at
according to the events website,

652
00:41:36,681 --> 00:41:41,390
doing what the u s congress
had failed to do for 45 years.

653
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:45,140
Seek out the facts surrounding the most
important issue of this or any other

654
00:41:45,141 --> 00:41:48,620
time. Evidence pouring towards
an extraterrestrial presence,

655
00:41:48,621 --> 00:41:53,090
engaging the human race.
All right. You know what,

656
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:58,580
even I have my limits when it comes
to that type of shit. All right.

657
00:41:58,581 --> 00:42:00,580
I don't think that's the most
pressing thing I would say. Yeah,

658
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:04,280
I was fucking up the environment, world
population and that type of suit. Shit,

659
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:05,203
it's a little more,

660
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:10,650
unless you want to throw more people
from other galaxies also living here too.

661
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,493
Do they drink bottle

662
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,343
water to

663
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:21,183
[inaudible]

664
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,533
you can't get

665
00:42:59,270 --> 00:42:59,610
[inaudible].

666
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,980
Um, all right. Sisters
a through c. Here we go.

667
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:04,901
Uh,

668
00:43:04,901 --> 00:43:09,220
tired of giving advice to guys with
psycho suicidal girlfriends or people with

669
00:43:09,221 --> 00:43:12,160
STDs. Well, I got something
a bit lighter for you here.

670
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:16,330
A kind of like the cores lite version
of your typical advice. Thank you.

671
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:19,960
And is perfect for the middle of summer.
Like kick my feet back on this one.

672
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,700
So I know this
who I'd been friends with,

673
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,940
uh, for awhile now and banged one time.
She's the oldest of three sisters,

674
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:35,830
so we all call her sister a. About
two years ago I made out with sister,

675
00:43:35,831 --> 00:43:39,670
be in a club, not my initiative, um,

676
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,360
and ended up having sex with there
the same night. Jesus Christ. Dude,

677
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,280
I went out with her.
Do,

678
00:43:45,281 --> 00:43:48,370
do they have like that thing on the back
of their SUV where they had this stick

679
00:43:48,371 --> 00:43:51,910
figures of the entire family and
you just slowly keep axing them out

680
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:58,220
and the family doesn't
understand if somebody's trying
to kill my daughters. No,

681
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:03,100
just trying to fuck all of them, sir.
Well, that's a relief. All right.

682
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:08,110
Um, anyways, I went out
with her for awhile. Oh,

683
00:44:08,111 --> 00:44:09,160
this is sister B.

684
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,910
And it was surprisingly not awkward
when we were hanging out all together,

685
00:44:12,911 --> 00:44:17,350
even though everyone knew the situation.
Jesus Christ,

686
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:22,480
what's southern state are you in sir? Um,
I'll go fuck yourself people down south.

687
00:44:22,481 --> 00:44:26,110
That was funny. Um, some months later,
sister bea left me for one of her,

688
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:31,030
one of my friends and got
over it quickly enough. Oh,

689
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,490
got over it quickly enough.

690
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:37,340
And nowadays I'm still in contact with
sister a and B since I'm not the kind of

691
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:39,600
guy that holds a grudge for that
kind of stuff. Oh, there you go.

692
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:41,581
That's very mature,

693
00:44:41,581 --> 00:44:43,620
which means you really didn't give
a fuck about either one of them.

694
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,840
So why are you going to be all upset?
You know,

695
00:44:45,841 --> 00:44:48,930
like you own their pussy once you fuck
it. I hate when, I hate when guys do that.

696
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,210
Anyways,
recently senses to see,

697
00:44:51,211 --> 00:44:54,450
started talking to me more
frequently after talking for a bit.

698
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:59,660
She said she could pose for me since
I'm a painter and she's a model and a 10

699
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:03,750
all the fucking way I might add.
Oh you fucking creep.

700
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:07,380
You fucking creep.
You fucking creep.

701
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,250
So she was attend the whole time.

702
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:15,270
So basically you're in a holding pattern
banging her oldest sisters waiting

703
00:45:15,271 --> 00:45:18,990
until this girl was of age so he could
fucking painter Jesus Christ. I gotta I,

704
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:20,970
you know, I might have to
stand up and applaud this one.

705
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,950
This guy has taken it to another level.

706
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:28,620
This is a fucking epic situation
here. So you see, here's my question.

707
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:34,770
Does that proposition mean anything?
Do you need my advice?

708
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,460
I need advice from you. How do you
fuck every girl in the same family?

709
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:45,320
Jesus Christ. This is like, you know,
long there's been at, they'd spend,

710
00:45:45,321 --> 00:45:48,150
since there's been a triple
crown winner in horse racing,

711
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,780
the last time someone
won the Kentucky Derby,

712
00:45:51,781 --> 00:45:53,310
the Preakness and the breeders' Cup,

713
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:56,190
is that what it is or is that a
soccer match? I don't fucking know.

714
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:59,190
I don't own a fucking horse
since the late seventies.

715
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:03,540
I would guarantee that it's been since
the late seventies sent somebody has

716
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:07,470
booze. Bang three. I think a
lot can do two in one family,

717
00:46:07,471 --> 00:46:11,910
but to get all fucking three, two, three,

718
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:16,530
two is a respectable three. Is it? No,

719
00:46:16,531 --> 00:46:19,380
it's beyond respectful. Two. Three. Okay.

720
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,660
Everybody knows it's three is
in the sporting world. Do that.

721
00:46:21,661 --> 00:46:26,130
That's a fucking dynasty. Okay.
You just put yourself in there.

722
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:30,960
We're fucking Bill Russell.
You put yourself in there
with, with, with the fucking,

723
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:35,700
uh, Magic Johnson Lakers. You know,

724
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:38,100
I wouldn't say the Colby Lakers.

725
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:41,220
You know when you go out and you get
Phil Jackson and fucking check, then it,

726
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:44,800
that's that new shit that the kids
like. I don't like that shit. Um,

727
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,870
either way, dude, you're
talking fucking dynasty. Wait,

728
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,040
magic never won three in a row,

729
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:52,350
but he had the Celtics to fuck with
named when three out of four years.

730
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:55,440
Give me a fucking break. Um, so
here's Michael Jordan. There we go.

731
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:59,790
So here's my question. Does that
proposition mean anything? Is it a trap?

732
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,830
Should I try to bang her?

733
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:07,380
Should I try and bang her too and get a
third strike or keep my dick in my pants

734
00:47:07,381 --> 00:47:10,860
and avoid a potential
shitstorm and if yes,

735
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:15,480
do you have any tips,
special tips on this special situation?

736
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,760
All my friends are telling me to do so,

737
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:22,110
but I thought I'd ask them more refined
mine like yourselves before I did a move.

738
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:26,040
Dude, you are looking at me like,
dude, you're beyond me right now. Okay.

739
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:30,430
This is like Bull Durham. I'm, I'm fucking
Kevin Costner. Um, I'm, I'm a lifer.

740
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:33,610
Okay. You're, you're,
you're going up to the show.

741
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:38,260
Hit and brand new balls every fucking
day. I will. You tell me. Okay.

742
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:41,710
I never bank two girls in
one fucking family. You know,

743
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,460
I was psyched if I was able to tag a
couple of friends and we were all hanging

744
00:47:45,461 --> 00:47:48,430
out at a bar one night and you get that
feeling like I fuck both of you and you

745
00:47:48,431 --> 00:47:52,630
both knew it and you both loved it. I
hope. Please, please tell me you liked it.

746
00:47:52,631 --> 00:47:57,550
Did you like it was I okay? Um, dude,

747
00:47:57,551 --> 00:48:02,500
I think you gotta do it. You
got to do it. You know, you,

748
00:48:02,501 --> 00:48:06,310
you've been above board the
whole time, sister. A sister be,

749
00:48:06,311 --> 00:48:08,500
they all fucking knew
everything right now.

750
00:48:08,501 --> 00:48:10,570
I understand this is a little delicate.
Okay.

751
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:13,450
He's trying to snip the last wire here.
This is the kid sister.

752
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,620
This is it going to blow up in your
fucking face. Uh, it's worth it, dude.

753
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:23,710
It's worth it. It's worth losing a couple
of limbs and your nose on this one.

754
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,910
You got to do it to fuck you. No, dude.

755
00:48:27,911 --> 00:48:32,770
What the fuck she says to you? I,

756
00:48:32,771 --> 00:48:33,181
yeah,
you're,

757
00:48:33,181 --> 00:48:36,790
you're a painter all let me take my
clothes off and get paid my fucking Twat.

758
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:40,840
Let's not art too. That's foreplay. Give
me a fucking break. It'd be one thing.

759
00:48:40,841 --> 00:48:45,640
If you're in a classroom of people, it's
just you and she's standing there naked,

760
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:47,411
dude,

761
00:48:47,411 --> 00:48:50,980
that's like one of the TIF they ever done
that porn senate and that scenario in

762
00:48:50,981 --> 00:48:53,620
a porn Jesus Christ,
you might've found a new angle

763
00:48:56,380 --> 00:49:01,300
to. That's phenomenal. That is fucking
phenomenal, dude. You got to do it.

764
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,730
You got to do, what did John Elway
retired when he only got one?

765
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:08,080
He came back for another,
right?

766
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,090
You got to do it to
two.

767
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:17,140
That's like when Bush fucking
the first Bush, he stopped.

768
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:21,190
He didn't get to sit down. You got
to go all the way on this one, man.

769
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:23,620
All right?

770
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:29,500
You gotta be like Marlon Brando in fucking
apocalypse now. You just, you just,

771
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:33,890
you just accept the fact you
left the program. All right?

772
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:35,253
And

773
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,470
I don't care how mad
these girls get to do.

774
00:49:40,471 --> 00:49:45,471
You are at the precipice of
becoming an absolute fucking legend.

775
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:52,330
Legend who, who can, who can, who's
gonna be able to top that dude?

776
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:55,150
There are celebrities who've had orgies,

777
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:58,480
they've had five on ones and
all that type of Shit, okay?

778
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:03,990
But I guarantee you they never fucked
three fucking girls in the same family

779
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:07,000
when they weren't famous,
not famous.

780
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:11,410
You're doing this shit with the gift of
Gab. Whatever the fuck you doing, dude,

781
00:50:11,411 --> 00:50:15,600
you do this. You got to write a book.
You gotta write a book, that's fine.

782
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:16,660
You know that's easy to do.

783
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,070
Collection of the most amazing pussy
getting stories ever that you can somehow

784
00:50:21,071 --> 00:50:25,690
confirm, all right, and it has
to be none of that bullshit.

785
00:50:25,691 --> 00:50:28,370
The second you get famous, he get
money. That doesn't count. All right?

786
00:50:28,371 --> 00:50:30,680
That's garbage time.
Okay?

787
00:50:30,681 --> 00:50:33,850
They put the fucking second team in
there and you just fucking Titone layups.

788
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:37,520
That's bullshit. I'm talking
about just regular dude. You,

789
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:40,820
you talk yourself into it through. You're
a fucking legend. You got to do it.

790
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:45,990
All right. This might halftime
speech. I'm going to quote Joe Barton.

791
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:51,210
[inaudible] quoting John Madden today
is going to be the greatest day of your

792
00:50:52,551 --> 00:50:55,400
life,
but only if you win.

793
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,460
All right?
You got to do it.

794
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:01,240
He got to fucking do it and keep it

795
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:11,700
[inaudible] the future.

796
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:36,923
[inaudible] he's told me,

797
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,770
hey,
what's going on?

798
00:51:43,771 --> 00:51:47,640
This is bill burr and this is the
Monday morning podcasts for Monday,

799
00:51:47,641 --> 00:51:52,500
September 21st, 2009. This is like the
fifth time I've tried to start this thing.

800
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:54,720
I don't know where to begin this week.
Uh,

801
00:51:54,721 --> 00:51:59,721
I am psyched because I am in Los Angeles
at least for a today and tomorrow

802
00:52:00,301 --> 00:52:04,830
before I fly right back out again.
I'm getting ready to do another special.

803
00:52:04,831 --> 00:52:08,550
So I have to,
I'm in comedy bootcamp right now.

804
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:13,020
I did a Gig at Boston
University this weekend,

805
00:52:13,021 --> 00:52:17,160
the weekend before I was in Philadelphia,
the weekend before I was in Stockholm,

806
00:52:17,161 --> 00:52:21,020
Sweden. Let me think. I had
a week off and now I got it.

807
00:52:21,021 --> 00:52:26,021
I got a four week intensive right here
where I just keep fucking going out and

808
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:30,240
uh, my, my act is going to get
really tight during this time.

809
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:34,890
But um, you ever see those fat people
on the biggest loser where they're like,

810
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,800
they're losing weight, but that look
of pain when they're on the treadmill?

811
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,000
That's what I have right now.

812
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,980
If the stand up comedy version of that,
you know,

813
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:45,811
where there's some,

814
00:52:45,811 --> 00:52:50,040
a good looking woman who sort
of manly standing over me going,

815
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:54,040
you got to tell more jokes. Do you guys
watch your show? Biggest loser deck.

816
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:56,430
Did the girl on the woman,
the female,

817
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:01,440
the broad on that show is
like, I dunno, she's really,

818
00:53:01,441 --> 00:53:04,560
really hot,
but she's really like manly.

819
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,760
And I wrote me and she looks like a mess.
She just moves.

820
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:13,080
There's like nothing dainty about her.
Actually.

821
00:53:13,081 --> 00:53:17,070
Some girl you kind of play fight with
and then she just unleashed one into your

822
00:53:17,071 --> 00:53:18,510
ribs and you'd be like,
okay,

823
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:22,410
you definitely had older brothers
because you know how to throw a punch.

824
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:25,800
Why are your eyebrows so big?
All right.

825
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:29,670
So if you're new to the podcast and I
can't figure out why this fucking thing

826
00:53:29,671 --> 00:53:33,690
keeps red line in like that,
turn down the record level here.

827
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:37,830
Maybe that's the problem. Um,
if you new to this podcast,

828
00:53:37,831 --> 00:53:39,630
I do one of these every God damn week.

829
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:43,380
I've been doing them for about two years
at this point and I pretty much, uh,

830
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,530
I don't think I've really
missed a week really. I mean,

831
00:53:46,531 --> 00:53:49,140
occasionally I put them in on Tuesdays,
but generally speaking,

832
00:53:49,141 --> 00:53:52,640
I don't miss a week. So they
come out every Monday and, uh,

833
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:54,450
people send me in questions,

834
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:58,470
they send me in their list of stuff
that they feel is underrated. Overrated.

835
00:53:58,471 --> 00:54:02,940
We recommend some youtube videos
and websites. We interpret dreams.

836
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:06,630
No, actually we don't, you know what,
that was one that I always want,

837
00:54:06,631 --> 00:54:09,120
I've been meaning to do.
Um,

838
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:12,750
people keep asking me for advice and
it keeps getting deeper and deeper and

839
00:54:12,751 --> 00:54:16,280
deeper and um,
evidently haven't,

840
00:54:16,281 --> 00:54:19,320
I've been getting some decent reviews
with my advice, but you got to understand,

841
00:54:19,321 --> 00:54:22,080
you're talking to the guys pretty much
fucked up in every area of his life.

842
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:27,360
Like here's one. Oh yeah. Let me see if I
can find this one. Actually, the, how was,

843
00:54:27,361 --> 00:54:31,740
I was on the plane and I was
going through the emails.

844
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,720
I'll,
I guess I'll have to paraphrase.

845
00:54:36,721 --> 00:54:39,930
This guy basically sent me in one

846
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:45,510
that was asking advice
and he said that he was,

847
00:54:45,511 --> 00:54:49,710
he was married to a Chinese woman

848
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:53,580
who was like seven years older than him.

849
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:58,350
They had a 10 year old kid
and he was from like Vietnam.

850
00:54:58,351 --> 00:55:01,950
I don't fuck a remember, but all I
know is they got a kid and he's tired.

851
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:04,650
He's not attracted to her anymore.

852
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:09,810
And he wanted some advice and it's
just like to I, I, I don't know.

853
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:13,020
I mean that sounds about right.
You know,

854
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:19,050
you've been together for how long now?
Why would I say something like that? See,

855
00:55:19,051 --> 00:55:21,840
that's why I don't wanna I don't want
to fucking talk about stuff that that's

856
00:55:21,841 --> 00:55:25,590
got, that's, that's that fucking
deep, you know what I mean?

857
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:28,530
Yeah. I can see that.
I think that's normal.

858
00:55:28,531 --> 00:55:30,360
Don't they call it like the
seven year rich, you know,

859
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:32,550
you're in a relationship
for like seven years or so,

860
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:36,210
or maybe 10 years and after
awhile it's like, you know,

861
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:38,250
when it comes to the physical thing,

862
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:42,360
it's like there's no room left in
your house where you haven't fucked.

863
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:46,740
There's no position that you haven't done.
You know,

864
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,100
mean my girls a pain in the ass.

865
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:57,540
She just walking out of the room,
threw her head back. Are you serious?

866
00:55:57,541 --> 00:56:00,240
Are you seriously going to talk about
me this way? Because if you are,

867
00:56:00,241 --> 00:56:04,470
I'm gonna storm out. Um, yeah.
I don't know what to tell you.

868
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:09,670
Why do you always do that? Nia,
you just stick your head in you.

869
00:56:09,671 --> 00:56:12,960
You start looking at me like that's
gonna make me not be an asshole.

870
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:18,030
I'm always going to be an asshole.
Um, so anyways, this is what I,

871
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:21,420
this is what I did. This is why you
can't be here when I do these. Nia,

872
00:56:21,421 --> 00:56:24,850
you have to leave. Close the
door. Be a good girl. Come on.

873
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:30,880
Come in here. All right, well what?

874
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:36,460
You're distracting me. Close the door. Oh,

875
00:56:36,461 --> 00:56:39,850
that's a good girl. Ah, you're the
worst. You just keep walking in and out.

876
00:56:39,851 --> 00:56:44,710
It's fucking brutal. 11,
12, 13 seconds wasted.

877
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:49,480
Oj. When your girl puts on
flip flops, that's the worse.

878
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:53,290
When they're being annoying and you
keep hearing the sound of that Sandal

879
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:55,030
hitting the fucking healer,
their foot.

880
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:59,170
And you need to be a little more
sensitive. And then that silence here

881
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:04,210
[inaudible] you're walking through some
horrific mall that you don't even want

882
00:57:04,211 --> 00:57:08,120
to be in. Oh, look at those
sunglasses, those acute,

883
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:12,190
I want sunglasses. There
you go. There you go guys.

884
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,360
That's how you get rid of your girl.

885
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:17,290
Just start trashing what they're wearing
and then they store them up, you know?

886
00:57:17,291 --> 00:57:19,750
And then I guarantee you six
hours from now she'll be like,

887
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:24,460
do you really not like when I wear
flip flops? I thought you like those.

888
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:28,600
Oh my God,
why didn't you say something?

889
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:31,690
I just feel so stupid right now.

890
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,660
You know the way she had an
argument about health, you know,

891
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:39,100
I know I can't stand about fucking women.
I just do this every week.

892
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,630
But it's annoying. It's frustrating. I
can't fucking stand the way they turn.

893
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:45,190
Little things,

894
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:50,370
nothing into these big fucking dramatic
Falcon Crest fucking moments where all

895
00:57:52,451 --> 00:57:55,960
of a sudden like I'm
supposed to feel like, sorry,

896
00:57:55,961 --> 00:57:59,200
I can't fucking stand that.
You know?

897
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:03,670
Like I was flying back yesterday. I
couldn't, you know, from the east coast,

898
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:06,700
I can't find my keys.
All right.

899
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:09,580
Now for those of you who listen
to my podcast all the time,

900
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:14,650
you know that I drive a hybrid like a fig.
I drive a Prius,

901
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:17,530
right? It's a great fucking
car. I totally recommend it.

902
00:58:17,531 --> 00:58:21,160
Especially if you live in a city. Why
would you buy a sports car in a city? Huh?

903
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:23,470
You're going to be stuck in traffic.

904
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:26,800
The car's going to get all fucked up
cause you can't blow out the lines or

905
00:58:26,801 --> 00:58:30,370
whatever the fuck you supposed
to do. Actually reality
is I can't afford the car.

906
00:58:30,371 --> 00:58:34,660
I want it. So I'm just going to trash
people who can anyways, plumbing ahead.

907
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:39,840
So how it works with the Fancy Prius is
you don't have to stick your key in the

908
00:58:40,151 --> 00:58:43,840
lock and you don't even have to press
a button. As long as it's on you.

909
00:58:43,841 --> 00:58:47,800
The second you get in the vicinity of
the handle and you touch it, it unlocks.

910
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:52,390
Okay. Which you know is
supposed to be like, wow, wow.

911
00:58:52,391 --> 00:58:55,810
We really are going to fucking have
flying saucer some days like moment.

912
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:58,690
You know? So evidently, but that,

913
00:58:58,691 --> 00:59:03,190
that little mechanism that's supposed
to make my life so much easier.

914
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:07,180
If I lose that thing, it costs like
two or 300 bucks to get a new one.

915
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:09,040
And I can't just be like,
well,

916
00:59:09,041 --> 00:59:11,290
why don't you just give me one
that has a fucking key on it?

917
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,560
Cause I don't think that that option
exists. Does it now? Maybe it does.

918
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:15,483
I don't fucking know.

919
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:18,670
So all I know is I thought I
lost like that two or $300 thing.

920
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,290
I hung around watching the Patriots jets,

921
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:24,770
the game went a little bit long cause
those country refs call the fucking

922
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:26,270
penalty every two seconds.

923
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:30,020
So now I was in jeopardy of missing
my flight and I can't find my keys.

924
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,950
So I'm rushing around the house. I tore
apart my luggage like twice. All right.

925
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:38,840
And then I call my girl up and she answers
the phone and I'm like, I'm like, Hey,

926
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:42,900
did I leave my keys out in la? They
only make, he's out in La. She goes, um,

927
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:47,630
yeah, yeah, you left him in the car. I
said, okay, cool. All right. I'll, uh,

928
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:50,990
no, no, no. She answered it right away. So
she goes, yeah, you left them in the car.

929
00:59:50,991 --> 00:59:53,330
And I said, okay. Okay. All right,
cool. I'll call you from the airport.

930
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:57,900
And she just goes, okay. I just, yeah,

931
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:01,870
that you want attached to me
for a minute. You know, they,

932
01:00:01,871 --> 01:00:04,200
they create that fucking moment.
You know what I mean?

933
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:07,810
That's why women are not in battle
in war. Right. Fucking there.

934
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:14,580
He'd start giving quick
fucking, you know, orders. Ah,

935
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:15,903
thank you.

936
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,580
Asking me how my day in the Fox Hall
went fires before he just started telling

937
01:00:19,581 --> 01:00:23,540
me charge up the hill.
No, that's okay. You know,

938
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:29,360
I don't know. I don't, I don't tolerate
that. So when they say shit like that,

939
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:34,960
well I guess, I guess you too
busy to talk to me. That's right.

940
01:00:34,961 --> 01:00:39,460
I am. All right. See you later. You know,

941
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:44,320
and then you just fucking go. Four, three,
two, one. And then the phone calls again.

942
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:46,840
What's the problem?
Is there a problem?

943
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:52,860
And then you're in it. You're in the
fucking fight that they wanted. A,

944
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:57,650
he just can't fucking actually
you can win, you can win.

945
01:00:57,651 --> 01:01:00,890
You just going to live a lonely life,
but you can win. And speaking of that,

946
01:01:00,891 --> 01:01:02,180
this is something I learned the other,
you know,

947
01:01:02,181 --> 01:01:06,370
I use the word console out
here on my podcast and um,

948
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:08,390
I don't know how they
hell I came across this,

949
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:13,900
but I would like to read to you guys
about a street that existed in the Middle

950
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:16,700
Ages by the name of Grope cunt lane.

951
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,240
I'm not bullshitting
you grope current lane,

952
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:26,640
pronounced grope current
lane or they come late.

953
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:28,700
They have to have that like
I can't read English. Okay.

954
01:01:28,701 --> 01:01:33,230
Was this street name found in English
towns and cities during the middle ages

955
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:38,830
believe to be a reference to the
prostitution centered on those? Uh,

956
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:42,710
in those areas it was normal
practice from an evil names,

957
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:47,950
street names to reflect the streets
function or economic activity taking place

958
01:01:48,231 --> 01:01:50,150
within it. Grope. Cont

959
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:53,900
the earliest known use of,

960
01:01:53,901 --> 01:01:58,901
which is about 1230 after the death of
that dude that everyone thought was holy,

961
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:00,980
um,

962
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:05,980
appears to have been derived as a
compound of the words grope and cunt.

963
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:10,220
Don't you hate when people explain
obvious shit? Like really? Yeah.

964
01:02:10,221 --> 01:02:12,230
I couldn't put the two
of those grope content.

965
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:15,650
What are the w everyone
knows what groping is,

966
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:22,130
you know, there's no other word
for what else can grow up mean

967
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:27,120
and [inaudible] is yet.
Yeah, grub contact. Got It.

968
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:32,040
Why do I have puberty lately
on this? I got it, Ma.

969
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:36,630
I really like this girl in
class. What do I say? Um,

970
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:38,790
streets with that name.

971
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:42,130
We're often in the busiest parts
of medieval towns and cities. Yeah,

972
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:45,630
it's a red light district and at least
one appears to have been an important

973
01:02:45,631 --> 01:02:47,910
thoroughfare. Um, although,

974
01:02:47,911 --> 01:02:50,820
although the name was once
commonly common throughout England,

975
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:54,510
changes in attitude,
results resulted in,

976
01:02:54,511 --> 01:02:56,190
it's being replaced by more.

977
01:02:56,191 --> 01:02:59,730
And Nakia was versions such as grape lane,

978
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:05,560
grope con was last recorded
as a street name in 15, 61.

979
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:07,353
You know what I mean?

980
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:13,360
So all you guys out there used to have
cool names for your stadiums and now you

981
01:03:13,361 --> 01:03:14,260
have a,

982
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:19,320
I need a job.com arena as opposed
to like war memorial coliseum.

983
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:23,530
It's been going on forever.
All right.

984
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:27,580
And you know when they changed it to
grape lane that there was people who still

985
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:32,560
called it grope, comment and then there
was people like, it's, it's balloon. Okay,

986
01:03:32,561 --> 01:03:36,550
have a little bit of clothes.
Um, go fuck yourself.

987
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:39,610
What are people doing
down there on grape lane?

988
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:47,340
You know what that is just the beginning
of like that clean comedy and why you

989
01:03:48,041 --> 01:03:51,190
know, something unique. You need
grape lane for grope Khan to be funny.

990
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:55,450
You need great Blaine. I'm full of Shit.
It's just fucking annoying me. Like does,

991
01:03:55,451 --> 01:03:58,930
does that mean because
you call it grape lane,

992
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:04,150
does that mean that there's
any less fucking women down
there getting, you know,

993
01:04:04,151 --> 01:04:07,300
getting their cons groped?
You know,

994
01:04:08,590 --> 01:04:13,150
do you guys know I got, I got an
email from somebody, a, I dunno,

995
01:04:13,151 --> 01:04:16,570
a priest, a pastor. Uh, I
dunno what the fuck it was.

996
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:18,730
Some person who a holy person

997
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:24,910
said that they saw me on TV and that
they thought I was absolutely hilarious,

998
01:04:24,911 --> 01:04:29,830
but they wished that I hadn't cursed as
much because it was getting beeped out a

999
01:04:29,831 --> 01:04:30,131
lot.

1000
01:04:30,131 --> 01:04:35,131
And then they stumbled across my
podcast and thought the podcast was also

1001
01:04:35,411 --> 01:04:40,411
hilarious but just could not get
past the fact of how much I curse.

1002
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:46,870
And um, I don't understand people. I
could see if you have a child there,

1003
01:04:46,871 --> 01:04:51,820
but I just don't understand it. Like
adults who just like, uh, you know,

1004
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:55,810
it's like, dude, you're
on the Internet. Okay,

1005
01:04:55,811 --> 01:04:58,720
what does nothing I'm saying that's
going to be shocking. Good Lord.

1006
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:04,970
I Dunno. You know what in is he right?

1007
01:05:04,971 --> 01:05:06,980
I don't fucking know. You
know what? I don't have class.

1008
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:11,440
Do you know what they normally like about
having class? There's this, there's a,

1009
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:14,120
there's,
there's a lack of honesty to it.

1010
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:16,930
You know what I mean?

1011
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:21,070
The second you put on a pair of a
pair of loafers in a blazer, okay.

1012
01:05:21,071 --> 01:05:23,590
And all of a sudden people are looking at
him. He's a gentleman, he's easy client.

1013
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:27,670
And then all of a sudden you start calling
grope con grape lane and that that's

1014
01:05:27,671 --> 01:05:30,490
how it begins.
You know,

1015
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:34,270
you start calling it human resources.

1016
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:40,360
That creepy shit. I don't
fucking know. You know,

1017
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:46,330
I like to say fuck, I do.
I like it. It feels good.

1018
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:51,070
You know, nothing. I, you know,
something people out there who are clean,

1019
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:55,450
who don't curse as much. Can
you, can you give me a word, um,

1020
01:05:57,550 --> 01:05:59,350
that did that, you
know, when you're angry,

1021
01:05:59,351 --> 01:06:04,351
like what word gets it out like that you
can stress and then it ends with that.

1022
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:07,841
You know,
you just,

1023
01:06:07,841 --> 01:06:12,841
you just stick the landing like
fucking Mary Lou Retton anyways,

1024
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:17,590
so whatever. My point is that there used
to be a street called [inaudible] Lane,

1025
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:18,461
you know,

1026
01:06:18,461 --> 01:06:21,790
back in a more honest time when they
could be head you every five fucking

1027
01:06:21,791 --> 01:06:23,290
seconds. Um, you know,

1028
01:06:23,291 --> 01:06:25,660
it's one of those deals where you look
back on a time and there's certain things

1029
01:06:25,661 --> 01:06:28,390
about it that you liked in other
aspects you didn't, I mean,

1030
01:06:28,391 --> 01:06:32,230
I liked the fact that where the whores
wear was called grow current lane,

1031
01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:37,050
you know, I mean, shit, you don't
even need a map. You don't need that.

1032
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,500
But you know why they had that back then,

1033
01:06:38,501 --> 01:06:41,950
they didn't have those little tourist
brochures to let you know that, uh,

1034
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:45,670
where you, what part of
the city you were in? Oh,

1035
01:06:45,671 --> 01:06:49,220
it's right there on the corner of uh,
uh,

1036
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:53,230
fucking raped me and grope cunt. Oh yeah,
that's the red light district. Okay,

1037
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:56,950
I got it. Cool. You know, and
then the other side was, uh,

1038
01:06:57,870 --> 01:07:02,170
you know, black soles, blacksmith row
and cobbler fucking lane. I don't,

1039
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:05,650
I don't know. You know what? I'm too
stupid to Improv with this right here.

1040
01:07:05,651 --> 01:07:08,680
But you know what I'm saying?
Actually, Bill, you know what?

1041
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:12,130
We've known what you've been saying
for the last 15 fucking minutes.

1042
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:16,330
Why don't you get on with the
podcast? All right? It's already 12,

1043
01:07:16,331 --> 01:07:18,280
26 out here and I have
something to do at one,

1044
01:07:18,281 --> 01:07:23,230
so I got to fucking get
moving along here. Um, oh,

1045
01:07:23,231 --> 01:07:26,560
and what I have to start doing is hyping
my shit more towards the front because

1046
01:07:26,561 --> 01:07:30,100
I think a lot of people get sick of me
by the end of it. God knows I do. So, uh,

1047
01:07:30,101 --> 01:07:32,740
this week I'm going to be at
the Improv in Addison, Texas,

1048
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:36,970
Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
And I'm going to the cowboys game,

1049
01:07:36,971 --> 01:07:41,500
the Monday night game against
the Carolina Panthers on uh,

1050
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:42,393
on the Monday.

1051
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:47,110
So if you see me stumbling
through the parking lot,

1052
01:07:47,111 --> 01:07:49,480
because I will be drinking.
All right,

1053
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:52,720
please offer me a burger or
something like that because a,

1054
01:07:52,721 --> 01:07:53,554
I don't know if I'm going to have,

1055
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:58,330
the person I'm going with is going to have
a fucking grill, you know. Um, anyway,

1056
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:02,080
so let's plow ahead here. Uh, and
after next week, the week after,

1057
01:08:02,081 --> 01:08:05,920
I'm going to be at the stress factory in
New Jersey and the week after that I'm

1058
01:08:05,921 --> 01:08:07,510
going to be in Pittsburgh at the Improv.

1059
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:12,160
Then I have a week off and then
I'm at the uh, Improv in a DC.

1060
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:16,960
So there's no excuse not to see me
on the fucking east coast. All right.

1061
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:22,010
Cause I just got back from Boston. I was
in New York in May. I've been everywhere.

1062
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:25,610
I write. All right, Bill.
Exactly. I know, I'm sorry.

1063
01:08:25,611 --> 01:08:27,170
I just been like a real jerk lately.

1064
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:30,920
I've been really like this how I
get when I own, I'm under the gun.

1065
01:08:31,830 --> 01:08:36,350
I really shouldn't do like podcasts.
I was under the gun last week. Um,

1066
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:40,400
I dunno. Let's, let's just
plow ahead here. Oh yeah. Okay.

1067
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:43,070
Now people have been asking
me a lot of advice. Um,

1068
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:46,610
my girlfriend had this real weird dream
the other day and I actually interpreted

1069
01:08:46,611 --> 01:08:49,340
it to the point where she went, wow,
that was pretty good. And I was like,

1070
01:08:49,341 --> 01:08:51,290
you know what? That'd be great.
Should have podcasts listeners,

1071
01:08:51,291 --> 01:08:53,240
if you have some sort of,
you have to have one of those dreams.

1072
01:08:53,241 --> 01:08:55,070
You just have no idea
what a fucking meant.

1073
01:08:55,970 --> 01:08:59,360
And maybe you need somebody insight
into it. Like, here's one for you.

1074
01:08:59,361 --> 01:09:04,361
I had a dream the other day I was flying
on an airplane and for some reason I

1075
01:09:04,671 --> 01:09:08,210
was faced in the opposite direction,
like I was on a train.

1076
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:11,630
You know those little areas where you
can have like people face each other and

1077
01:09:11,631 --> 01:09:16,130
they can discuss the latest styles,
like it's the fucking 18 hundreds. Um,

1078
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:18,350
yeah, I was sitting like that, right?

1079
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:21,500
I was sitting the other way and I was
looking through plexiglass and I was

1080
01:09:21,501 --> 01:09:24,380
watching George Carlin doing stand up

1081
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:29,600
and for some reason he was
missing his right hand.

1082
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:34,500
And I was like, Holy Shit, that's
George Karl. And I couldn't believe it.

1083
01:09:34,530 --> 01:09:36,710
He's right fucking there.
And what happened to his hand?

1084
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:41,390
And then when we went to get off the
plane, all of a sudden he was really,

1085
01:09:41,391 --> 01:09:46,391
really skinny in small and
almost look like an like a woman.

1086
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:52,220
And then I walked around the front,
he had like a beard and he,

1087
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:55,340
and he was missing his fucking hand. And
I, and I, what the hell did I say to him?

1088
01:09:55,341 --> 01:09:57,800
I said, well, you know, you, I
think you're really funny, whatever.

1089
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,950
And then at with the, I came
out, what the fuck he said to me,

1090
01:10:00,951 --> 01:10:05,360
he said something weird back to me and
then walked away and then I got back on

1091
01:10:05,361 --> 01:10:09,770
the plane like it was a subway and it
just continued on flying somewhere,

1092
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:12,660
you know? And that's one of those
dreams you just say to somebody in,

1093
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:16,940
they're looking at you
like, uh, uh, I dunno dude.

1094
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:20,990
Maybe you want to fucking may be your
fucking attracted to George Carlin is some

1095
01:10:20,991 --> 01:10:21,824
fucked

1096
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:28,430
at all fucking though.
That was just a weird ass fucking dream.

1097
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:33,560
Why is he missing a hand? Why did
he look like a woman? You know,

1098
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:38,060
what's the deal with fucked up dreams if
you have fucked up dream like that one?

1099
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:39,800
Cause I can't make heads
or tails of that one.

1100
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:44,930
Why was I faced in the opposite
direction? Well, build in life.

1101
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:46,100
You feel as though,

1102
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,820
you know everybody's just going in this
one direction and you don't agree with

1103
01:10:49,821 --> 01:10:52,280
the direction you're going
in the other direction.

1104
01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:57,620
That's what you feel and you want to
get to where some of your heroes are.

1105
01:10:57,950 --> 01:11:02,720
But there's this invisible
piece of plexiglass that
seems to stop you from going

1106
01:11:02,721 --> 01:11:03,554
there.

1107
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:09,020
And a lot of times when you don't do
what everybody else wants you to do,

1108
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,520
they say you're evil.

1109
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:14,790
And back in the day when people
used to write with their left hands,

1110
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:18,660
they thought those kids were demonic and
they used to slap their left hand and

1111
01:11:18,661 --> 01:11:20,370
make them write with their right hand.

1112
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:24,570
So maybe because your hero was
on the other side of that glass,

1113
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:27,660
he was evil. And that's why
he didn't have a right hand.

1114
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:36,270
See, I can do it. I could somehow
find a fucking through line,

1115
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:39,700
you know?
And then maybe you,

1116
01:11:39,910 --> 01:11:44,910
you always want to hook up with
Gloria on a fucking all in the family.

1117
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,530
And that's why when you were
walking behind George Carlin,

1118
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:53,530
that's what he looked like. An old Gloria.
All right, let's fucking, let's end this.

1119
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:57,400
Alright, let's plow ahead
here. Um, we actually,

1120
01:11:57,401 --> 01:11:59,410
for the first time on my podcast,

1121
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:03,550
I have a follow up email from
somebody that I gave advice to,

1122
01:12:04,030 --> 01:12:07,870
to see how shit worked out.
Um,

1123
01:12:08,410 --> 01:12:12,160
and of course I can't fucking find it.
Why?

1124
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:15,610
Why do I do this to myself? All right.
As I search for it, I'll tell you,

1125
01:12:15,611 --> 01:12:18,580
remember last week when I was telling
you about the guy who had his, uh,

1126
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:21,070
his brother a cock blocked him.

1127
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:24,660
MMM [inaudible]

1128
01:12:25,030 --> 01:12:29,860
you know, at the party and he, you
know, he meets a beautiful girl first.

1129
01:12:29,861 --> 01:12:32,590
She asked for a piece of cake. He
set up, we'll get you on. He leaves,

1130
01:12:32,591 --> 01:12:35,860
he comes back and then his
fucking douchebag, older brother,

1131
01:12:36,490 --> 01:12:40,070
he's trying to get her number.
Well, he wrote me back. He said, uh,

1132
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:43,270
well here's what ended up happening.
Um,

1133
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:46,350
that's it. I don't know. Okay.

1134
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:49,800
The next day after meeting that 26 year
old and having my brother's steal her

1135
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:54,810
numbers, she ended up requesting
me on Facebook. Got To
love the Internet. He says,

1136
01:12:55,030 --> 01:12:57,870
uh, she then wrote me saying, nice
to meet you. Thanks for the cake.

1137
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,860
I wrote back and we made
some conversation, uh,

1138
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:04,530
where I ended with hope to see you around
again. She agreed and said the same,

1139
01:13:04,531 --> 01:13:07,440
so fuck it. I asked for a
phone number. Needless to say.

1140
01:13:07,441 --> 01:13:09,750
She gave it to me and we played
the phone game for a week.

1141
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:12,930
We made plans to go out to some
club on Saturday. By the way,

1142
01:13:12,931 --> 01:13:17,220
I'm not much of a dancer, but if necessary
I can bullshit my way through it. Uh,

1143
01:13:17,221 --> 01:13:18,720
my luck could not have been any better.

1144
01:13:18,721 --> 01:13:23,721
We got there around 3:00 AM and the
friend she came with ended up leaving

1145
01:13:23,761 --> 01:13:27,180
thinking I was taking her home. Whether
they play on that or not, I don't know.

1146
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:30,600
But we got to her house and she a
little tipsy, tells me to come up.

1147
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:34,890
Doesn't ask would you like to come in?
She casually tells me to come in dot.

1148
01:13:34,891 --> 01:13:38,910
Getting too crude. I'm proud to
say I fucked the shit out of her.

1149
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:45,120
Funny thing. While I was banging
her, I remember thinking to myself,

1150
01:13:45,121 --> 01:13:49,020
wait till I tell bill,
dude,

1151
01:13:49,021 --> 01:13:50,580
I really hope this story is true.

1152
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:55,260
All right cause I want the best
for all my 14 podcast listeners.

1153
01:13:55,261 --> 01:13:58,290
I hope this happened. Um, had um, anyways,

1154
01:13:58,291 --> 01:14:02,070
he said I had to turn my head down
and stop myself from laughing.

1155
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:04,260
Now my brother,
the cup.

1156
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:07,500
Now for those of you who didn't
listen last week or two weeks ago,

1157
01:14:07,501 --> 01:14:11,010
whenever the hell I read it, uh,
her brother's a cop. All right.

1158
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:14,260
And he's also a cock block and
Douche bag of identity. Um,

1159
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:17,020
the cop works the night shifts.
Dude,

1160
01:14:17,021 --> 01:14:20,710
he's not at copies of fucking security
guard stop it or I was wondering how the

1161
01:14:20,711 --> 01:14:24,370
hell he became a police officer at
21 probably works at a video store.

1162
01:14:24,371 --> 01:14:28,930
The fucking creep. Anyways, he said we
ended up getting home at the same time,

1163
01:14:28,931 --> 01:14:33,340
around 6:00 AM him in his late ships,
late shifts,

1164
01:14:33,341 --> 01:14:37,480
security guard brother. He said, uh, I'm
not one to rub shit my brother's face,

1165
01:14:37,481 --> 01:14:39,560
but he asked me what I ended
up doing for the night.

1166
01:14:39,561 --> 01:14:42,460
So I simply told them I
chilled with that Monica Bitch,

1167
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:47,680
his face said it all with me getting
home at that time he was able to put two

1168
01:14:47,681 --> 01:14:48,431
and two together.

1169
01:14:48,431 --> 01:14:52,600
I'm not sure whether this counts as a
revenge story or not since I didn't take a

1170
01:14:52,601 --> 01:14:55,870
bat to his squad car or anything,
but with the way shit turned out.

1171
01:14:56,230 --> 01:15:00,570
I don't think a revenge is necessary.
Also on a different note. Um,

1172
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:02,500
all right.
So we ended up getting it.

1173
01:15:02,501 --> 01:15:07,270
Then the rest is about how he has four
dogs and unfortunately he had to put one

1174
01:15:07,271 --> 01:15:10,760
down and he told you he or she
gave me good advice. He goes, uh,

1175
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:13,690
you can't believe how much you miss
your dog when it's finally gone.

1176
01:15:13,690 --> 01:15:17,200
So make sure you enjoy your dog,
which I did in which I am.

1177
01:15:17,201 --> 01:15:21,700
I wrestle my fucking dog. The dog likes
to wrestle. Isn't that right Cleo? Huh?

1178
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:28,360
Good dog. You a good
dog, Huh? Fucking maniac.

1179
01:15:28,361 --> 01:15:33,040
You wake me up every morning. Um,
anyways. All right, let's get on to, um,

1180
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:38,080
how bout some youtube videos
for the weekend? Everybody,
let me scroll down here.

1181
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:42,190
I actually have a website that I think
is kind of blowing up on the Internet

1182
01:15:42,191 --> 01:15:46,990
right now and I wasn't able to, uh, to
get to it. I think it got too many hits.

1183
01:15:46,991 --> 01:15:51,340
These kids started it. It's the name
of the website is people of Walmart.

1184
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:54,310
Just search for that.
And I guess these people go,

1185
01:15:54,311 --> 01:15:56,110
they just walk around taking pictures.

1186
01:15:56,410 --> 01:15:58,570
Of all the fucking freaks
you see in a Walmart.

1187
01:15:58,810 --> 01:16:01,600
And they just thought it was going to
be something that would be funny amongst

1188
01:16:01,601 --> 01:16:06,040
them and their friends and somehow
and ended up on funny or die. So, uh,

1189
01:16:06,041 --> 01:16:10,470
evidently it's hilarious. Uh,
check that out and for, um,

1190
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:15,220
sports fans because we seem to
have a lot of them on this. Um,

1191
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:18,790
and even if you're,
you're overseas, you can,

1192
01:16:18,791 --> 01:16:23,791
you can actually enjoy this one search
bears fan catch it catches kick on

1193
01:16:25,361 --> 01:16:30,160
youtube bears fan catches kick and it was
basically from a Monday night football

1194
01:16:30,161 --> 01:16:34,600
game about a, I dunno, 20, 24 years ago,

1195
01:16:34,601 --> 01:16:37,030
25 years in 1985,
24 years ago,

1196
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:39,730
the bears kick in an extra point.

1197
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:44,290
It's going through the uprights and into
the stands and all of a sudden coming

1198
01:16:44,291 --> 01:16:48,520
from like the right hand side of
the TV screen, this guy just jumps,

1199
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:51,550
you know, like a stadium. Like
when you kick an extra point,

1200
01:16:51,551 --> 01:16:55,330
it usually goes down and into the alleyway
where the, uh, the players run into.

1201
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:58,600
That's basically what it was. This
guy is like fucking, you know,

1202
01:16:58,601 --> 01:17:00,420
a good 20 feet in the air.
He,

1203
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:03,670
and the best part of it is he's
just completely standing up.

1204
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:07,390
I think I've actually talked about this
before in the podcast and he catches the

1205
01:17:07,391 --> 01:17:09,350
ball with no fucking concern.

1206
01:17:09,351 --> 01:17:12,470
What's fro whatsoever about
his own goddamn safety.

1207
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:16,790
I Dunno who we landed on our what,
but if he did that today in America,

1208
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:21,970
they'd be some sort of al Qaeda nine 11
fucking group of people that would go

1209
01:17:22,551 --> 01:17:25,340
after this guy with his
mullet and a z Kaveri cheese.

1210
01:17:25,341 --> 01:17:29,750
Like he isn't just some drunk coked up
football fan that can jump to stories

1211
01:17:29,751 --> 01:17:31,310
without breaking his fucking ankle.

1212
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:34,280
They treat him like he was some sort
of terrorist and put his face into the

1213
01:17:34,281 --> 01:17:38,300
fucking ground. But this is
back in the day. All right,

1214
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:41,900
pre all that bullshit.
They actually showed the replay.

1215
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:45,500
We're talking about what a great
catch it was in Lynn Swann,

1216
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:50,060
the hall of fame fucking wide receiver.
We had one of the best world,

1217
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:53,960
a world series, best Superbowls
ever. Actually interviews the guy.

1218
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:59,840
So check that one out. Check that one out.
Why don't, yeah. Um, all right. That's it.

1219
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,910
Now let me get onto the advice.
Like I said,

1220
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:05,690
I've got to blow through it this
week. I apologize. Um, hey bill.

1221
01:18:05,950 --> 01:18:07,220
So I was going out with this girl.

1222
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:11,520
She was real cute and real funny and we
had a lot in common. Uh, do, this is a,

1223
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:14,120
this is a fucking weird
story here he goes. Uh,

1224
01:18:14,121 --> 01:18:17,060
we had gone out four or five times, so
I thought I was getting sick, you know.

1225
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:21,050
Semi-Serious then one day she called
me and told me we had to cancel,

1226
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:25,590
cancel a dinner. We had planned for later
that week. She had a legitimate reason.

1227
01:18:25,591 --> 01:18:30,080
So I was like, just like, I fuck it.
Well, just reschedule. No biggie. Right?

1228
01:18:30,530 --> 01:18:34,280
So later in the week I call her and get
her voicemail and leave her a message

1229
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:38,300
asking if she had, uh, she was
free a certain day to have dinner.

1230
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:43,880
She never gets back to me. So I wait
a few more days and I call her again.

1231
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,230
I ended up leaving another message.
Fucking nothing. Never calls me back.

1232
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:52,460
At this point, I wait about a week and
call again and leave one more message.

1233
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:57,380
Not a goddamn thing.
What the fuck?

1234
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,870
Who does that? Sorry, I
got lost at what the fuck?

1235
01:18:59,871 --> 01:19:04,460
Who does that fucking at least call
me? Tell me it's over. Tell me.

1236
01:19:04,461 --> 01:19:08,420
I'm lame. Say you have to wash your
hair or your dog ate your love life,

1237
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:09,620
but fucking call.

1238
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:13,250
I talked to my parents and friends and
they have all consoled me and gave me

1239
01:19:13,251 --> 01:19:17,810
advice or whatever.
But I needed advice from,

1240
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:22,820
I want you to get some advice
from you. Um, all right, well,

1241
01:19:22,821 --> 01:19:27,140
let's be honest. She took
the easy way out. Um,

1242
01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:32,480
you know, she obviously didn't want to
see an anymore obviously, and yeah, she,

1243
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:36,620
she took the fucking easy way out and um,
who's getting to a,

1244
01:19:36,621 --> 01:19:40,580
breaking up with somebody is one of
the hardest things. The fear of it.

1245
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:42,721
You know,

1246
01:19:42,721 --> 01:19:46,080
I saw this thing on intervention one
time where they were talking about drug

1247
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:51,081
addicts and they say basically
they'll spend 20 years avoiding,

1248
01:19:53,490 --> 01:19:53,911
you know,

1249
01:19:53,911 --> 01:19:58,911
10 days of pain by continuing to medicate
themselves because in their head,

1250
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:01,580
the pain of going through,

1251
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:07,070
getting clean is so fucking huge
that they, that they'll continue,

1252
01:20:07,330 --> 01:20:10,620
they'll, they'll, they'll go through
20 years of fucking hell, you know,

1253
01:20:10,621 --> 01:20:12,690
and that's what relationships can be like,

1254
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:15,960
where people get into relationships
and they want to break up with someone.

1255
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:19,850
They just don't know how to fucking do
it. And they just thinking, oh my God,

1256
01:20:19,851 --> 01:20:22,140
I'm gonna break this person's heart.
They're going to cry.

1257
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:25,860
I want to feel horrible.
Uh, you know, and for guys,

1258
01:20:25,861 --> 01:20:29,360
what if they start screaming and
throwing shit and charging me, you know,

1259
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:33,270
with assault,
because when they threw a bookcase at me,

1260
01:20:33,390 --> 01:20:38,070
it bounced off my big forehead and
then hit their big toe, you know? Um,

1261
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:43,790
so I know this is gonna
sound fucked up, but his is,

1262
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:48,900
she kind of,
she did you a favor in a weird,

1263
01:20:48,901 --> 01:20:52,620
she obviously felt that there wasn't a,

1264
01:20:52,621 --> 01:20:56,340
the connection to make it long lasting.
Um,

1265
01:20:56,370 --> 01:20:59,970
and I know she took the coward
way out, but at least she, she,

1266
01:21:00,030 --> 01:21:04,680
she figured out a way to get out of it
before she fucking rips your heart out of

1267
01:21:04,681 --> 01:21:07,980
your chest. I mean, I know it probably
sucked, but it didn't seem like, you know,

1268
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:11,310
you have been gone. You said you're
going to have four or five times.

1269
01:21:11,311 --> 01:21:13,440
So I thought it was getting, yeah,
so you went out like fuck, you know,

1270
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:14,640
four or five times,
Dude.

1271
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:19,200
I mean that's some shit you can get
over that at a keg party, you know,

1272
01:21:20,430 --> 01:21:21,930
couple of fucking plastic,

1273
01:21:22,530 --> 01:21:27,530
16 ounces and you grabbed the fucking
closest Hooters look and chick,

1274
01:21:27,721 --> 01:21:30,300
you know, or whatever.
Talk a little bit of Shit.

1275
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:35,150
You know that she did your favorite man.

1276
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:37,880
So I don't know how old
you are with this girl.

1277
01:21:37,881 --> 01:21:40,790
Sounds like you guys sound like you're
young and when you're young you really

1278
01:21:40,791 --> 01:21:45,770
don't know how to do it. Um, the
best way I found to do it, I mean,

1279
01:21:45,771 --> 01:21:47,750
we actually should have like
a fucking class on that.

1280
01:21:47,751 --> 01:21:50,450
How to break up with somebody.
First of all,

1281
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:54,380
you got to psych yourself up mentally
to do it and you just have to be like,

1282
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:55,333
all right,

1283
01:21:56,030 --> 01:22:01,030
we're going to talk it too and my life
is going to suck from about two to

1284
01:22:02,961 --> 01:22:05,240
possibly four 30 or five

1285
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:12,140
and I just have to understand that the
next three hours of my life is going to

1286
01:22:12,141 --> 01:22:17,120
suck. You know, it's kind of like if you
had a fight, a kid after school you like,

1287
01:22:17,121 --> 01:22:20,480
okay, we're fighting around three. By
the time I remember a buddy of mine,

1288
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:23,360
he used to always get into fights as
well cause I used to be like, dude,

1289
01:22:23,361 --> 01:22:26,090
how the fuck do you
fight? Like Dan? He goes,

1290
01:22:26,091 --> 01:22:29,570
I just think in an hour I'm going to
be home. I'm going to be in my bed.

1291
01:22:29,571 --> 01:22:33,200
Everything's gonna be fine. It's kind of
the same way I look at like, you know,

1292
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:35,120
yeah.

1293
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:38,540
If back in the day when I do a college
gig and they just had me standing in a

1294
01:22:38,541 --> 01:22:41,720
fucking hallway with no microphone
and I'm like, all right,

1295
01:22:41,721 --> 01:22:44,870
this is going to be absolutely
humiliating. But in an hour from now,

1296
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:48,020
I'll have my check and I'll
be in my fucking, you know,

1297
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:52,570
Buick Skylark rented
from Avis or whatever,

1298
01:22:52,571 --> 01:22:55,660
and I'll be fucking drab driving away
from here. And I'd just be a funny story.

1299
01:22:55,661 --> 01:22:58,420
Who gives a shit?
So that's kind of what you have to do.

1300
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:02,940
And uh, and you can't leave
any, there's no daylight.

1301
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:07,540
And a great way to stop to start is
just to say that you're not happy.

1302
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:14,200
You know, I'm not happy. Why
Asian? I'm just, I'm not happy.

1303
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:19,180
You know, you're a great person. You can
do, you know, all of that type of stuff.

1304
01:23:19,210 --> 01:23:22,600
I feel horrible,
but you know,

1305
01:23:22,601 --> 01:23:26,590
it's not working for me and I have
to figure out why. And I just,

1306
01:23:26,591 --> 01:23:30,550
this just doesn't feel right in more.
And you got, and you just get that out.

1307
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:33,010
And once you get that out,

1308
01:23:33,610 --> 01:23:37,660
then the fucking tears and
all the bullshit comes and
then you just, you fucking,

1309
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:42,820
you just got to stay in
there, take it, you know,

1310
01:23:44,530 --> 01:23:47,620
and it's just getting through that
first major fucking day of it.

1311
01:23:47,621 --> 01:23:50,110
And then you've got to have other
conversations. Fucking brutal.

1312
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:54,490
It's fucking brutal. So getting
back to this look, you know,

1313
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:58,090
you guys sound like you're young and I
just don't think that she has the mental

1314
01:23:58,091 --> 01:24:00,910
ability to be like, yeah,
listen, you know, we've gone
out like four or five times,

1315
01:24:01,150 --> 01:24:02,200
I think early,
Nice Guy,

1316
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:05,400
but I just don't feel like it's
going to go anywhere else in bum.

1317
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:08,410
And who's kidding? Who, if she did that,
you'd still be just as fucking pissed.

1318
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:12,490
But it is weird when they just disappear
off the face of the earth like that.

1319
01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:15,940
I've, I've had that man. I had the
classic, uh, she's in the shower

1320
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:20,250
in a roommate, sucked at lying
and when she's in the shower,

1321
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:24,550
callback and a half an hour and I
called back and a half an hour, um,

1322
01:24:24,551 --> 01:24:26,800
she's repairing her credenza,

1323
01:24:27,650 --> 01:24:31,930
callback and 17 minutes and I called
back in 17 minutes. Dude, I called,

1324
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:33,940
I want a fucking moron.

1325
01:24:33,941 --> 01:24:37,120
I must've called like eight times and
then they finally stopped answering the

1326
01:24:37,121 --> 01:24:40,900
phone. You know? Do you ever have that?

1327
01:24:40,901 --> 01:24:44,410
Like you're avoiding somebody call and
in like you think thinking there finally

1328
01:24:44,411 --> 01:24:47,380
not going to call and then the phone
rings and you literally get that little

1329
01:24:47,381 --> 01:24:51,550
fucking heart attack in your chest.
You're almost scared of the goddamn phone.

1330
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:55,070
Um,
what do,

1331
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:58,150
she did not break up with you and
she did and she did you a favor.

1332
01:24:58,151 --> 01:25:00,970
Do cause she could have stuck with you
for another six months and you could have

1333
01:25:00,971 --> 01:25:03,700
been walking around telling
all your friends how much
you love her and how great

1334
01:25:03,701 --> 01:25:04,534
she is.

1335
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:09,600
And then she dumps you out of fucking
nowhere or bangs one of your friends and

1336
01:25:09,671 --> 01:25:10,361
then you got to carry.

1337
01:25:10,361 --> 01:25:13,120
You can carry that shit around for eight
years and you know what you do get end

1338
01:25:13,121 --> 01:25:17,170
up being stuck going out hurting other
girls who had nothing to fucking do with

1339
01:25:17,171 --> 01:25:21,640
that. So in a weird way, consider
yourself lucky you're out of it. You know,

1340
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:25,210
why would you want to waste any more
time with someone who's not NTA anyways?

1341
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:28,570
And you're absolutely right. It was
fucked up. She should have called you,

1342
01:25:28,571 --> 01:25:31,380
but she's just not at that
level of maturity and a,

1343
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:34,060
you've got a life to lead so there's
no reason to carry around anymore.

1344
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:37,660
You understand me? So you go out
there, you have a couple of drinks,

1345
01:25:37,661 --> 01:25:39,580
you talked some shit to
some broads this weekend.

1346
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:43,510
He put her fucking behind you and
it's football season, you know, uh,

1347
01:25:43,511 --> 01:25:47,440
fire up the fucking grill and forget about
her. All right, here we go. Moving on.

1348
01:25:47,441 --> 01:25:51,850
Next one. Bill, I watched a couple of
your shows and videos or you stand up.

1349
01:25:51,851 --> 01:25:56,050
I really enjoy your work.
Thank you. Uh, but, but the,

1350
01:25:56,490 --> 01:25:59,800
but the, all right, um, um,

1351
01:25:59,890 --> 01:26:02,980
I've been listening to
podcasts. All right, here we go.

1352
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:07,460
I am a sophomore in and I'm attending a
public school that has a reputation for

1353
01:26:07,461 --> 01:26:09,260
being dumb.

1354
01:26:09,950 --> 01:26:14,950
Where slutty girls and obnoxious boys
roam freely until the the bell rings.

1355
01:26:15,321 --> 01:26:17,690
You know what school I
thought you were describing.

1356
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:21,440
There's a school on the upper west side.

1357
01:26:23,810 --> 01:26:26,300
Ah, what the fuck? I think
Paris Hilton went to it.

1358
01:26:27,890 --> 01:26:30,140
A CHS knee out.
She knew the name of it.

1359
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:35,390
I think it's called the Dwight school.

1360
01:26:38,510 --> 01:26:43,510
And the people said it stood for dumb
white idiots getting high together

1361
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:48,980
cause I guess they were
all like rich kids.

1362
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:52,930
And this kind of sounded like you were
a, you were describing anyways. That's a,

1363
01:26:52,931 --> 01:26:54,050
that's an old story.
Anyways.

1364
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:58,070
Not only does my school
have bratty and no annoying,

1365
01:26:58,071 --> 01:27:02,750
almost unbelievably ignorant students,
but it is also located in Las Vegas.

1366
01:27:02,870 --> 01:27:05,570
Oh that's right. That's how I
knew it wasn't at school. Um,

1367
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:09,290
the hottest slash colas hole in the west.

1368
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:14,360
I am basically a nobody at school and
other people talk to me in school.

1369
01:27:14,361 --> 01:27:16,070
They usually describe me as quiet.

1370
01:27:16,530 --> 01:27:20,450
I'm the person who when that one person
they talk to all the time doesn't show

1371
01:27:20,451 --> 01:27:23,690
up, seems more lost and
more lonely than usual.

1372
01:27:23,990 --> 01:27:26,660
I'm very introverted and people
don't really warm up to me,

1373
01:27:27,050 --> 01:27:30,110
although I secretly wish they would.
My grades are usually high,

1374
01:27:30,111 --> 01:27:32,060
but since I have always been Mousey,

1375
01:27:32,061 --> 01:27:36,740
I usually have problems making speeches
and presentations due to not speaking

1376
01:27:36,741 --> 01:27:39,410
loudly enough and not
making any eye contact.

1377
01:27:39,411 --> 01:27:42,560
I mean it was easily
embarrassed and mistake prone.

1378
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:47,180
And when I'm around my friends, friends,
when I'm around my friends, friends,

1379
01:27:47,181 --> 01:27:50,300
teachers and anyone I find intimidating,
uh,

1380
01:27:50,330 --> 01:27:53,690
all they do is sit there arguably hoping
I never have to talk to them to summon

1381
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:57,240
up. I'm socially inept. You really
should've said to sum it up, you're,

1382
01:27:57,250 --> 01:28:00,680
you're a teenager. This is how
I was. I was socially retarded.

1383
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:02,173
Do you know when I was in,

1384
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:05,450
if I was like right up until like
sophomore year in high school,

1385
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:08,780
if a girl even talked to me,
my face turned beet red.

1386
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:13,220
It's fucking embarrassing to admit,
but it's true.

1387
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:18,110
It was pathetic and I was only funny
around my immediate group of friends.

1388
01:28:18,290 --> 01:28:22,220
If I was in a class and it was basically,
you know,

1389
01:28:22,221 --> 01:28:25,700
a middle of the pack class and there
was no real popular people in there,

1390
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:30,770
you know, either guys or the
cheerleader girls, then, um,

1391
01:28:30,830 --> 01:28:33,160
then I would be myself.
But if any of the popular people,

1392
01:28:33,161 --> 01:28:35,270
I just knew my role and
I just shut the fuck up.

1393
01:28:35,330 --> 01:28:40,330
So to this day I have a lot of people
who I knew in my past and like,

1394
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:44,660
how the fuck did you end up being a
comedian? Dual use show. Fucking quiet.

1395
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:48,380
Cause that was a fucking
psycho. Um, anyways,

1396
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:51,680
person goes on and says
the only people who, uh,

1397
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:58,040
live in this plane, bug infested house
or my mother on a Chambong of life,

1398
01:28:58,670 --> 01:29:02,670
uh, or his life. I mean, I didn't even
see who the, this was guy or girl,

1399
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:06,600
sorry about that.
A bug infested house on my mother and me.

1400
01:29:06,630 --> 01:29:09,780
My Dad pays for the major bills,
like the mortgage and rent,

1401
01:29:09,781 --> 01:29:13,100
but doesn't live with us
for most of the year. Uh,

1402
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:16,950
he works as a retired
civilian for the navy.

1403
01:29:16,951 --> 01:29:21,180
Doing janitorial work on the ship
channel is outside the country.

1404
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:23,500
Yeah.

1405
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:27,400
My mom works currently at a Vietnamese
supermarket and as a cashier, yes,

1406
01:29:27,401 --> 01:29:31,510
she is Vietnamese. And like most people
from there that I observed, she cares.

1407
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:34,840
She only cares for Vietnamese and
Chinese people. That's hilarious.

1408
01:29:34,990 --> 01:29:37,840
Cause I told that guy he
was being sensitive a few
weeks ago when he was talking

1409
01:29:37,841 --> 01:29:40,420
about the fucking,
uh,

1410
01:29:42,030 --> 01:29:45,540
that lady at the front desk or the
dentist office being reverse racist.

1411
01:29:45,541 --> 01:29:47,630
And I was like, there's
no way that happened. See,

1412
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:48,690
this is why you shouldn't listen to me.

1413
01:29:48,691 --> 01:29:50,920
I don't want the fuck
I'm talking about and uh,

1414
01:29:50,921 --> 01:29:54,810
I'm going to use your mother as the, the,
the litmus test for everyone in Asia.

1415
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:56,850
I should just shut the
fuck up here anyways.

1416
01:29:56,970 --> 01:29:59,460
I can't stand or prejudice
against other racist. The biggest,

1417
01:29:59,461 --> 01:30:01,130
most recent mistakes she has made so far,

1418
01:30:01,180 --> 01:30:05,160
she's tried to open a business and
it's failed w uh, in less than a year,

1419
01:30:05,161 --> 01:30:08,960
which is pretty pathetic. We
ended up being bankrupt, um,

1420
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,780
and living without water and electricity
and had to move around a little bit.

1421
01:30:12,781 --> 01:30:16,970
After a while we had to make a big change
in lifestyle, which was to move, um,

1422
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:21,570
to Las Vegas. I was furious and upset. Oh,

1423
01:30:21,571 --> 01:30:24,240
I guess this person used to live in San
Diego in a neighborhood and always had a

1424
01:30:24,241 --> 01:30:26,940
good time out there. And
now you're at the house. Uh,

1425
01:30:26,941 --> 01:30:30,600
my two best friends lived in San Diego
and we share so much in common knowing

1426
01:30:30,601 --> 01:30:34,170
each other and grade
school. And, uh, thirdly,

1427
01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:38,040
my sisters would visit me and take me out
of the House and away from her mother.

1428
01:30:41,090 --> 01:30:44,300
Um, so what are you asking me
here? Did I skip something? Oh,

1429
01:30:44,301 --> 01:30:46,280
I have a major reason why I
don't want to leave. Okay.

1430
01:30:46,281 --> 01:30:50,650
Your mom's taking you out there when we
lived in a nice looking suburb network.

1431
01:30:50,690 --> 01:30:53,360
Okay. All my friends are there,
my parents. So I have, okay.

1432
01:30:53,690 --> 01:30:56,330
Even though I can't get away
from my current situation a life,

1433
01:30:56,331 --> 01:30:59,900
I'm worried about going to college and
living on my own was moving away from

1434
01:30:59,901 --> 01:31:03,110
your parents and living
independently hard for you.

1435
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:08,240
Is there anything I should
be warned about? Uh,

1436
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:11,660
no. You just need to relax and realize
that you're a cool person and you're

1437
01:31:11,661 --> 01:31:13,760
overthinking shit.
Everything's gonna be fine.

1438
01:31:14,050 --> 01:31:15,650
Do you want to learn how
to come out of your shell?

1439
01:31:15,651 --> 01:31:19,280
You just work at it the same way you
would fucking learn how to play guitar,

1440
01:31:19,310 --> 01:31:22,370
which is to basically do it every day.
You know,

1441
01:31:22,430 --> 01:31:26,090
I sucked at guitar three
years ago and now, um, um, um,

1442
01:31:26,150 --> 01:31:31,150
getting halfway decent at guitar because
I try to play it every day and the shit

1443
01:31:31,791 --> 01:31:34,030
that I still suck at is
a shit I don't work at.

1444
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:38,060
So what I would do if I was you is
just work at coming out of your shell.

1445
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:40,040
You can try it. You know, you go out,

1446
01:31:40,041 --> 01:31:45,041
you buy something and try
and make a little chit chat
with the person behind the

1447
01:31:45,230 --> 01:31:48,700
register if it's not
fucking automated and a,

1448
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:51,170
and give you a self licensed
to suck in the beginning.

1449
01:31:51,171 --> 01:31:53,300
That's the big thing about
improving shit in your life,

1450
01:31:53,301 --> 01:31:58,250
I found is to forgive the fact that in
the beginning when you try to talk to

1451
01:31:58,251 --> 01:32:02,890
other people, you're a, you're not going
to be good at it at first. And, um,

1452
01:32:03,130 --> 01:32:06,130
let me ask you this, have you ever
opened your mouth and said something?

1453
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:09,580
And then an entire room of people turned
around and looked at you and said,

1454
01:32:09,581 --> 01:32:13,180
what the fuck? And then they all
beat the shit out of you. I mean,

1455
01:32:13,181 --> 01:32:14,170
that was my fear.

1456
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:18,280
That was my fear in high
school that that's what was
gonna happen. You know what?

1457
01:32:18,281 --> 01:32:21,550
It never happened. And when I finally
did open my mouth, people are like, hey,

1458
01:32:21,551 --> 01:32:24,910
you're funny. You should have been
more like that in high school.

1459
01:32:24,911 --> 01:32:27,940
You could have been fucking those
fucking cheerleaders, you know?

1460
01:32:29,110 --> 01:32:32,080
So hence I have a lot of regret about
that period in my lifetime because I

1461
01:32:32,081 --> 01:32:36,930
wasn't being myself. So, um,
I dunno if you're under age,

1462
01:32:36,931 --> 01:32:39,460
you got to go with your mom. So, you know,

1463
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:43,590
you got to go out there just fucking
write it out and you know what it's going

1464
01:32:43,710 --> 01:32:46,630
gonna make you a stronger person to go
out there and to be a great exercise and

1465
01:32:46,631 --> 01:32:51,040
coming out of your shell to go there,
be the new kid, meet some new people.

1466
01:32:51,430 --> 01:32:54,400
And um,
as far as moving out,

1467
01:32:54,401 --> 01:32:58,210
the best advice I can give you is a
get a can opener and all that little

1468
01:32:58,211 --> 01:33:03,100
innocuous bullshit that you take for
granted in your mother's house. Um,

1469
01:33:04,540 --> 01:33:08,920
you know, and then, I dunno, don't,
uh, don't hang around with assholes,

1470
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:12,900
you know,
don't hang out with psychosis and,

1471
01:33:13,010 --> 01:33:15,500
but I don't mean psychos like the standing
there with a bloody ax, but you know,

1472
01:33:15,501 --> 01:33:18,790
those PE people play like fucking mind
games with you and you feel getting

1473
01:33:18,791 --> 01:33:22,290
competitive with you. Those aren't
friends, you know, or you can,

1474
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:24,520
it can happen like one or two times,
but you address it.

1475
01:33:24,521 --> 01:33:28,870
And if it continues to happen, dump
them because it's just, you know,

1476
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,870
those are the kinds of people that
if you start doing well in life,

1477
01:33:31,871 --> 01:33:34,660
they actually resent you.
And uh,

1478
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:38,380
it's kind of like that guy before earlier
that I was talking about with that

1479
01:33:38,381 --> 01:33:43,330
woman kind of, you know, saves them
a lot of pain by leaving early.

1480
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:47,410
You can do that with friends yourself.
Does that make any sense? You know,

1481
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:49,360
the second you start seeing
someone's being a Douche,

1482
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:52,360
if your gut is telling you that they
are a Douche and there's no reason to be

1483
01:33:52,361 --> 01:33:55,000
around him. But uh, I
hope that helps you out.

1484
01:33:55,270 --> 01:33:57,970
I'm kind of rushing through here though
cause I gotta only like eight minutes

1485
01:33:57,971 --> 01:34:01,660
left here before I got to
get on. Um, alright bill.

1486
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:04,990
Um, his last advice when
I'm going to read bill,

1487
01:34:04,991 --> 01:34:06,140
I've been going out with this girl for,

1488
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:08,080
I love how I'm giving
relationship advice yet.

1489
01:34:08,081 --> 01:34:11,230
I've never had a successful relationship,

1490
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:14,320
although I like to think this one's
a little successful, don't you Nia,

1491
01:34:14,350 --> 01:34:18,100
who's sneaking around the room you find
you find this relationship successful?

1492
01:34:19,940 --> 01:34:22,250
Oh,
define successful.

1493
01:34:26,030 --> 01:34:27,890
We have healthy arguments,
don't we?

1494
01:34:28,590 --> 01:34:30,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1495
01:34:30,910 --> 01:34:33,580
Wow. That was hilarious for you went.
Yeah. And then you're like, wait,

1496
01:34:33,581 --> 01:34:37,060
that didn't sound like
a good, yeah, we do.

1497
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:41,740
All right. You know what? I was right the
first time. Beat it. Let me finish this.

1498
01:34:43,780 --> 01:34:45,800
Oh, look it up. Just one second.

1499
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:47,340
You didn't have to put that over there.

1500
01:34:47,410 --> 01:34:51,150
You're just trying to stay in here longer.
Alright, let's plow ahead here. Bill.

1501
01:34:51,550 --> 01:34:54,150
I've been going out with this girl for
a little over a year and she's been,

1502
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:55,800
she's beginning to Piss me off.

1503
01:34:59,350 --> 01:35:00,670
Ah, Jesus Christ. He, you know,

1504
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:03,080
at this question could be for
about 9,000 people right now.

1505
01:35:03,081 --> 01:35:06,980
She complains about not having any money
and never offers to pay when we go out

1506
01:35:06,981 --> 01:35:10,370
somewhere. But when she goes out with
their friends to the bar or something,

1507
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:13,250
she spends it like, no
fucking tomorrow. As a man,

1508
01:35:13,251 --> 01:35:16,730
I don't mind paying for shit most of
the time, but fucking offered to pay,

1509
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:21,950
you know, but fucking offered to pay
would be a great, would be great sometime,

1510
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:25,610
but fucking offering to pay.
See, it's not always my reading.

1511
01:35:25,611 --> 01:35:28,070
Sometimes people don't
write shit correctly,

1512
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:32,420
but fucking offering to pay
would be great sometime. Um,

1513
01:35:32,421 --> 01:35:35,900
I don't want to seem like an ass
making the girl pay for Shit,

1514
01:35:35,901 --> 01:35:39,830
but give me a fucking break. Times
have changed. Equality is prevailing.

1515
01:35:39,831 --> 01:35:43,650
So why don't you throw some
dough like the guys do a,

1516
01:35:43,651 --> 01:35:47,300
what should I do to get her to start
spending some money on me or at least

1517
01:35:47,301 --> 01:35:50,930
fucking offer without me
making me out to be the Dick?

1518
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:54,380
Basically tell me what you just
told me and take out all the fucks

1519
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:58,880
that seriously do. That's the
secret. You have to, you have to,

1520
01:35:59,450 --> 01:36:02,930
and I had to do this because I have a
temper and I say fuck every other word.

1521
01:36:02,931 --> 01:36:07,130
I would literally sit down with a
piece of paper and I would write

1522
01:36:08,780 --> 01:36:08,930
the,

1523
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:13,930
the two or three points that
I was trying to make and um,

1524
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:20,360
just to make sure that I, I didn't, you
know, that this is what I wanted to say.

1525
01:36:20,690 --> 01:36:22,950
And then I would also, and and,
and I would draw out this happened.

1526
01:36:22,951 --> 01:36:24,200
I have a how much of a psycho I was.

1527
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:26,810
I had to draw a little
smiley face next to it,

1528
01:36:26,811 --> 01:36:31,811
which would remind me not to say it
with my usual angry east coast tone.

1529
01:36:34,050 --> 01:36:34,550
All right,

1530
01:36:34,550 --> 01:36:39,550
so what you have to tell
her is that basically what
you tell me then a big thing

1531
01:36:39,651 --> 01:36:40,190
with women,

1532
01:36:40,190 --> 01:36:44,480
you've got to tell her how it makes
you feel when she doesn't offer to pay.

1533
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:48,200
All right? Yet you have to sit
there and listen to her. You know,

1534
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:52,400
complaining about money yet she doesn't
offer to pay and how it makes you feel

1535
01:36:52,401 --> 01:36:55,490
when you then see her throwing the money
around with their friends and makes you

1536
01:36:55,491 --> 01:36:58,370
feel like what?
Like she's treating.

1537
01:36:58,371 --> 01:37:01,190
You see I was gonna say like an ATM.
See,

1538
01:37:01,191 --> 01:37:03,560
this is what happens when I don't
write shit down. That's very hostile.

1539
01:37:03,650 --> 01:37:05,960
He treated me like a fucking ATM.
What?

1540
01:37:05,961 --> 01:37:09,050
I'm not good enough to spend fucking
money on you fucking whore. See,

1541
01:37:09,051 --> 01:37:13,070
you can't go that route. You
got it. Oh Jesus Christ. Cleo,

1542
01:37:13,071 --> 01:37:17,330
what the fuck are you eating lately?
Just gassing me out.

1543
01:37:19,650 --> 01:37:24,470
You know, some, I am convinced with
dogs that there, there is no like, uh,

1544
01:37:25,850 --> 01:37:29,360
is no toxins built up in them. They
just don't give a shit. You know,

1545
01:37:29,390 --> 01:37:33,470
they got a fucking rip one. They just do.
Um, anyways, that's what you have to do.

1546
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:38,030
You got to tell her how that
makes you feel, you know? Um,

1547
01:37:38,930 --> 01:37:43,160
and just, I dunno, you know
what, the more you do it,

1548
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:44,510
you're going to learn how to do it.

1549
01:37:44,590 --> 01:37:48,710
And it's like keywords that you can use
with women that makes their ears perk up.

1550
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:52,850
Perk up without getting mad at
you is basically, if you say,

1551
01:37:52,851 --> 01:37:56,220
it makes me feel like this and
you use words like, you know,

1552
01:37:56,221 --> 01:37:59,430
I just kind of feel like there's a
lack of respect there. I mean that's,

1553
01:37:59,610 --> 01:38:01,140
you got to go like this way more,

1554
01:38:01,141 --> 01:38:04,830
a sort of mature way and not
because they're more mature.

1555
01:38:04,831 --> 01:38:06,510
So get off your high horse is ladies,

1556
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:10,560
you just have to go that way or else
they will fucking turn it around on you.

1557
01:38:11,370 --> 01:38:14,790
Okay. The fact that you're
fucking paying for everything,

1558
01:38:14,791 --> 01:38:19,050
somehow that point we'll,
you'll somehow be in the wrong.

1559
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:25,320
And um, there's two ways to know you're
winning an argument with the female is,

1560
01:38:25,740 --> 01:38:30,230
uh, one, they're trying to pull some
fucking Jujitsu, double reverse,

1561
01:38:30,570 --> 01:38:32,610
two point reversal fucking move on you.

1562
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:36,450
And a lot of times last,

1563
01:38:36,630 --> 01:38:41,630
their last ditch suicide bomber
fucking mood move is they cry.

1564
01:38:43,950 --> 01:38:48,360
All right? And the thing about is a guy,
if you want to win an argument, the woman,

1565
01:38:48,390 --> 01:38:49,830
okay?
And I'm not just saying win,

1566
01:38:49,950 --> 01:38:52,200
but you really want to make your
point when you know you're right,

1567
01:38:52,201 --> 01:38:53,460
because you'll write on this one.

1568
01:38:53,670 --> 01:38:56,730
If your version of what's
going on is actually going on,

1569
01:38:56,850 --> 01:38:59,100
you're fucking right on this one,
okay?

1570
01:38:59,220 --> 01:39:03,480
So what you have to do is not
lose your cool. You cannot get,

1571
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:05,790
don't take the bait and she'll do shit.

1572
01:39:05,970 --> 01:39:09,650
She'll bring up shit from your fucking
childhood. She'll bring up mom,

1573
01:39:09,690 --> 01:39:10,920
you didn't do the fucking dishes.

1574
01:39:10,980 --> 01:39:15,720
She'll do something if you get a dead
to rights, okay? If you, if you don't,

1575
01:39:15,721 --> 01:39:19,380
if you do, it all depends on her
personality. If she's a real defensive,

1576
01:39:19,381 --> 01:39:23,520
combative person, you really got
to watch out for that breed. Okay.

1577
01:39:23,550 --> 01:39:25,200
Those little terrier fucking women,

1578
01:39:25,590 --> 01:39:29,030
what you gotta do is just know that she's
going to say all that stuff and that

1579
01:39:29,170 --> 01:39:33,020
you, you got to keep your fucking
cool. And once they start, you know,

1580
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:37,460
if they go name calling or something like
that, that's just, that's hostile. They,

1581
01:39:37,461 --> 01:39:41,880
they basically that to fucking
word. I can never remember. Um,

1582
01:39:42,260 --> 01:39:45,780
God dammit, you know, uh, capitulate,

1583
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:49,230
that's a great word too.
If you use that calmly,

1584
01:39:50,340 --> 01:39:52,490
it's basically is when you
just abandon your, the,

1585
01:39:52,491 --> 01:39:54,570
the argument and you just start,

1586
01:39:54,571 --> 01:39:57,780
you don't reverting to like name calling
or you abandon your argument and they

1587
01:39:57,781 --> 01:40:00,420
start agreeing with you or something
like that. I don't fucking know.

1588
01:40:00,930 --> 01:40:05,910
It just sounds great to
say it. But anyways, um,

1589
01:40:07,230 --> 01:40:09,690
you gotta do you gotta write
down what you want to say,

1590
01:40:10,020 --> 01:40:12,360
say it and just say how you feeling.

1591
01:40:12,510 --> 01:40:17,460
Take out all the fucks and if she
tries to turn around on you, you know,

1592
01:40:17,490 --> 01:40:21,630
by bringing, if she starts bringing
up other shit while you do this,

1593
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:26,310
will you do that? And it don't, don't
allow that. You know what I mean?

1594
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:30,660
And if she wants to to talk about, you
know, are you leave your shoes, you know,

1595
01:40:30,661 --> 01:40:34,470
in the middle of the living room, be
like, okay, well before we discuss that,

1596
01:40:34,471 --> 01:40:38,070
can we, can we finish discussing this?
You just got to keep steering it back.

1597
01:40:38,071 --> 01:40:41,460
It's like fucking law and order.
You've got to cross examine them.

1598
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:46,260
And I'm telling you, watch out for
that cry and bullshit. All right?

1599
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:50,160
Cause that's a latch. Diffs that's
their fucking 60 yard field goal.

1600
01:40:50,550 --> 01:40:52,950
Our Hail Mary Pass. When they know
that they're going to fucking,

1601
01:40:53,710 --> 01:40:55,930
and I'm telling you,
they're all there like Meryl Streep.

1602
01:40:56,380 --> 01:40:59,450
That's why I'm not blown away
by Meryl Streep. Okay. You know,

1603
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:04,080
I have my girlfriends can fucking act
as good as she can. That's bullshit.

1604
01:41:04,090 --> 01:41:08,920
She's a great actress. Just
being a Douche. Um, so anyways,

1605
01:41:08,950 --> 01:41:12,190
there you go. That's how you do it. All
right? And that's how you win an argument.

1606
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:16,390
If you're right, or at least that's
how you make your point. Okay?

1607
01:41:16,391 --> 01:41:20,230
And if they want to revert to name calling
and bring up shit from your childhood,

1608
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:23,560
just don't take the bait and then what's
going to end up happening is they're

1609
01:41:23,561 --> 01:41:28,360
just going to be sitting there
feeling like a jerk. And um, you know,

1610
01:41:28,361 --> 01:41:31,270
if they're mature enough then they'll
apologize for the name calling and say,

1611
01:41:31,271 --> 01:41:34,360
I was actually wrong. I got defenses
but blah, blah blah, blah, blah.

1612
01:41:34,510 --> 01:41:37,840
But if there is psycho, they'll
actually try to cry their way out of it.

1613
01:41:37,930 --> 01:41:40,540
And I'm just know this,

1614
01:41:40,541 --> 01:41:45,370
that when an adult is beyond
the age of, uh, eight,

1615
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:51,010
if you didn't punch them in the
face or call him some horrific name,

1616
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:55,090
there's really no reason to be crying.
So if they are crying, you know,

1617
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:59,530
it's like those fucking
commercials here on the radio,

1618
01:42:00,190 --> 01:42:03,220
they give you a free car and you don't
have to give him any money to like

1619
01:42:03,221 --> 01:42:07,830
September of 2015. It sounds
like bullshit, doesn't it?

1620
01:42:07,930 --> 01:42:11,170
It has to be somehow you're getting
fucked. And that's the same way it is.

1621
01:42:11,171 --> 01:42:15,400
Like most of the times when women
are crying, all right out. Okay,

1622
01:42:15,430 --> 01:42:19,240
let's get on to some questions
here. Um, oh, by the way,

1623
01:42:19,241 --> 01:42:21,190
I gave this guy shit talking about how,
you know,

1624
01:42:21,191 --> 01:42:24,190
games weren't invented in England
with the fuck is he talking about?

1625
01:42:24,220 --> 01:42:27,870
And here's somebody actually
was trying to tell me, um,

1626
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:29,320
that I was wrong on that one.

1627
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:32,750
Said I would thought ever respond
to your comments about, uh,

1628
01:42:32,770 --> 01:42:36,220
what sports did the English and invent.
Um,

1629
01:42:36,221 --> 01:42:39,820
I think the English did invent baseball.
It was called rounders,

1630
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:44,680
like in the 17 or 18 hundreds and
it was played mostly by girls.

1631
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:48,850
Not Kidding. Look it up. I
actually looked it up. Um,

1632
01:42:50,050 --> 01:42:54,070
and it seems like, yeah, there is a game
called rounders, but that's one of those,

1633
01:42:54,100 --> 01:42:54,933
you know,

1634
01:42:55,180 --> 01:42:57,610
that's like one of those things like
somebody invents that guitar and then they

1635
01:42:57,611 --> 01:43:02,560
take credit for Jimi Hendrix, you
know, I dunno. Maybe I'm them.

1636
01:43:02,561 --> 01:43:06,940
I'm exaggerating. Um, I
just don't understand why,

1637
01:43:06,941 --> 01:43:11,470
if there is a game like
baseball in England, why you
would play cricket, you know,

1638
01:43:11,471 --> 01:43:14,800
and don't they where a bunch of
pads, those big catcher pads, don't,

1639
01:43:14,870 --> 01:43:16,560
they wear that shit anyways as plow ahead.
Um,

1640
01:43:16,700 --> 01:43:20,470
besides what you mentioned on the podcast,
they also invented,

1641
01:43:21,220 --> 01:43:25,870
he wrote Bob Sleigh. Is
that Bob sledding? Um,

1642
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:31,320
tennis, Ping Pong table
tennis, golf in badminton.

1643
01:43:32,390 --> 01:43:37,120
While if you want to take credit for those
fucking sissy games, go for badminton.

1644
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:39,160
Really Ping Pong.

1645
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:43,690
I like how you keep inventing games
that then other people dominate golf.

1646
01:43:43,690 --> 01:43:48,070
Tiger Woods. Thank you. Ping Pong. China.

1647
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:52,250
You lose that one. Tennis was the last
time saving from England, England,

1648
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:55,160
one to fucking Wimbleton never.

1649
01:43:55,730 --> 01:43:58,460
You got to go back to when only white
people were allowed to play and they were

1650
01:43:58,461 --> 01:44:03,110
a little fucking a cutoff slacks. No,
actually they work. No, they wore slacks.

1651
01:44:03,111 --> 01:44:05,090
That's right.
There were full length pants.

1652
01:44:05,690 --> 01:44:10,160
They have wooden rackets that they ate
later use to hit a woman over the head

1653
01:44:10,161 --> 01:44:13,280
with the fucking have a
girlfriend. Um, badminton.

1654
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:18,520
Who plays badminton? Members of
your royal family. All right. Um,

1655
01:44:18,530 --> 01:44:21,290
I said I wasn't gonna be a jerk,
but I, and I ended up being a jerk.

1656
01:44:21,291 --> 01:44:25,010
Let's close out here with the questions.
Uh, Bill, I recently started like,

1657
01:44:25,011 --> 01:44:26,850
you know what? It's one oh
three with the fuck am I doing?

1658
01:44:26,851 --> 01:44:30,590
I got to get to the questions next week.
I gave out a lot of advice this week. No,

1659
01:44:30,650 --> 01:44:33,290
always. No. My disclaimer, I don't
know what the fuck I'm talking about.

1660
01:44:33,291 --> 01:44:37,130
All I can do is a judge, you
know, go from my own life here.

1661
01:44:37,131 --> 01:44:41,990
How I've handled some shit as the
psycho that I am. All right. Ah, Shit.

1662
01:44:41,991 --> 01:44:44,150
That was 53 minutes,
so I didn't even do a short one.

1663
01:44:44,420 --> 01:44:47,150
Hope you guys all have a good weekend.
Please come out and check me out, uh,

1664
01:44:47,151 --> 01:44:49,370
over the next couple of months
while I get ready for my special,

1665
01:44:49,670 --> 01:44:51,950

Improv this weekend.

1666
01:44:52,550 --> 01:44:56,120

next weekend and the weekend after that,

1667
01:44:56,121 --> 01:44:59,390
I'm at the Improv in Pittsburgh.
