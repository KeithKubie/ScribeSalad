00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.841
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:02.590
JEN PERSON: Hello.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.859
I'm Jen Person for
The Developer Show.

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.900
This is your update on
the coolest developer news

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.430
from Google in the last week.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.370
Staged releases on
Android allow you

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.860
to manage the inherent
risks of a new release

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.480
by making a new
version of your app

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.390
available to just a
fraction of your users.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.690
And staged releases are now
possible on testing tracks, as

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.640
well as the production track.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.190
To take a closer look at
how staged releases work

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.740
and how you can use them as
part of your release process,

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.646
head on over to the post linked
in the description below.

00:00:32.646 --> 00:00:34.020
We recently
announced that we are

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.690
evolving the design
of Wear OS by Google,

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.240
and providing quicker
access to your information

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.920
and notifications.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.410
Take a look at the post to
learn about the new notification

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.470
stream and how you can make
the most out of notifications

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.190
on the redesigned
Wear OS by Google.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.320
Google Cloud and Unity
recently announced

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.990
the availability of an open
source matchmaking project

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.080
called Open Match to help you
focus on just the matchmaking

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.070
logic--

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.920
that's the inputs in logic
for selecting players--

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.840
instead of building
a whole matchmaker

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.970
from scratch for each game.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.230
More details and a link to the
GitHub repo are on the post.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.200
Firebase provides real-time
streams and async callbacks

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.170
to do all sorts of awesome
things in your app.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.270
Getting data from one
stream is easy enough,

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.790
but what if you want to
join it from another?

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.060
Combining multiple async
streams of data can get complex,

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.550
so we created a new
JavaScript library called

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.430
RxFire to simplify things.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.990
Take a look at the
post for a video

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.750
and plenty of example code.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.540
We're committed to transparency
and a thriving developer

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.080
community, which is why we
started open sourcing our SDKs

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.550
last year.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.700
Recently, we continued on
that mission by open sourcing

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.910
our first Firebase
Android SDKs, including

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.280
our Cloud Firestore,
Cloud Functions,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.460
and real-time database SDKs.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.410
The GitHub link is on the post.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.870
To help you ship secure
cryptographic code,

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.050
we developed Tink, a
multi-language cross-platform

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.465
cryptographic library.

00:02:02.465 --> 00:02:04.770
At Google, Tink is
already being used

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.560
to secure the data of
products, such as AdMob,

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.610
Google Pay, Google
Assistant, Firebase,

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.452
and the Android search app.

00:02:12.452 --> 00:02:15.880
It just recently
hit version 1.2.0,

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.710
which now supports Cloud,
Android, iOS and more.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.620
Take a look at the post for some
example code and all the links.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.550
It's been 10 years since
Chrome was first released.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.350
A lot has changed
since then, but we've

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.530
kept our goal of building a
solid foundation for modern web

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.140
applications.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.130
In Chrome 69,
we've added support

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.520
for CSS Scroll Snap, Display
Cutouts, the Web Locks

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.640
API, and more.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.410
For the detail and a video,
head on over to the post

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.610

Thanks for watching, and
we'll see you next week.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.490
Maybe they didn't hear me.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.040
Ah!
