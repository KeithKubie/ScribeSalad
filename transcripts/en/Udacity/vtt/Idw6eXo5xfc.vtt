00:00:01.043 --> 00:00:05.792
So world-class entrepreneurs are never lucky. Never.

00:00:05.792 --> 00:00:11.345
You make your own luck. It’s a big idea you know At a

00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:14.300
single point in time, you’ll say, yeah, just happened to be

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.822
there when X happened there. Geez, that’s just kind of

00:00:16.822 --> 00:00:20.481
happened and I was there when somebody said X or Y

00:00:20.481 --> 00:00:24.423
over a career. You will now look back and go you were not

00:00:24.423 --> 00:00:27.336
lucky. You showed up more than other people. You took

00:00:27.336 --> 00:00:29.820
advantage of more other people you raised your hand

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.900
more often, you were there more often you got on a plane

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.463
where everybody else went ‘ah, it’s too much of a hassle.

00:00:35.463 --> 00:00:40.604
World-class entrepreneurs do that over time consistently.

00:00:40.604 --> 00:00:43.531
And you could tell the difference of whether you’re gonna

00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:47.070
make it or not is when everybody else says ‘nah, too much

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.233
worker ‘what do you mean I got to drive over there’ or ‘you

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:52.436
mean I have to talk to those guys it’s just too much about’

00:00:52.436 --> 00:00:55.892
or nah that is just too hard.’ I want you to remember that.

00:00:55.892 --> 00:01:00.522
That adds up over time in a career and you will start making

00:01:00.522 --> 00:01:03.379
your own luck and you will find because stuff will start

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.377
coming your way. Does this make sense, right? Yes, this

00:01:06.377 --> 00:01:10.525
conference happened to happen but you guys decided to

00:01:10.525 --> 00:01:13.732
go to it. Somebody who I gave you a little hint that perhaps

00:01:13.732 --> 00:01:18.434
you needed to do that. But my point is don’t – right

00:01:18.434 --> 00:01:22.338
don’t ever think what happens to other people and

00:01:22.338 --> 00:01:25.465
I want you guys to understand the distinction between

00:01:25.465 --> 00:01:28.772
standing there waiting for direction versus making your

00:01:28.772 --> 00:01:32.337
own direction by making it happen. So just as an side

00:01:32.337 --> 00:01:34.486
keep going, guys, this is good. Well, we

00:01:34.486 --> 00:01:37.353
thought these guys would know this big problem so it's

00:01:37.353 --> 00:01:43.577
existed. It’s a big shift, right, where you think they are just

00:01:43.577 --> 00:01:46.572
going to grab it out with your hands and now you realized,

00:01:46.572 --> 00:01:48.864
geez, there is a portion of evangelism here and just

00:01:48.864 --> 00:01:51.806
to remember, if you’re right and new market turns into an

00:01:51.806 --> 00:01:54.684
existing market fairly rapidly, right? Yeah, yeah. But at least

00:01:54.684 --> 00:01:58.007
on day one, when you’re ahead of the game with the things

00:01:58.007 --> 00:02:02.119
you need to do about evangelism about scale, about

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.923
wether you are selling or evangelizing is really kind of

00:02:04.923 --> 00:02:07.694
different. pitching team other comments or..? That’s alright -

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:10.305
quickly it that getting the people you’re talking to as

00:02:10.305 --> 00:02:12.801
your customers to be talking about this problem itself is part

00:02:12.801 --> 00:02:15.812
of your journey now as he explained. Getting that message

00:02:15.812 --> 00:02:19.504
out there and making your company solution part of the

00:02:19.504 --> 00:02:21.903
conversation at all the conferences six months and a year

00:02:21.903 --> 00:02:24.627
from now, is like a critical thing to do, because if you do it

00:02:24.627 --> 00:02:26.670
your portfolio’s looking better then. ..that...

00:02:26.685 --> 00:02:30.061
So the point is this that a lot of – the reason

00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:32.016
of pushing on these points that we’re

00:02:32.016 --> 00:02:34.907
talking about these things is a lot of the pivots are

00:02:34.907 --> 00:02:36.852
off understanding the complexity of that chart, more

00:02:36.852 --> 00:02:40.040
the pivots are off there are some complexity the markets

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.198
not penetrable understanding the ecosystem, there’s no

00:02:43.198 --> 00:02:45.532
insertion point for a new technology or new company.

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:47.589
Those are probably more of the reasons for the pivot

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:50.938
stand around the core technology. So the sooner

00:02:50.938 --> 00:02:52.736
you understand that ecosystem, the sooner you’ll

00:02:52.736 --> 00:02:55.953
have a sense of where you want to stay with it. And just

00:02:55.953 --> 00:02:58.583
you know, hope to see that in you guys, you may look at the

00:02:58.583 --> 00:03:02.173
fuel cell market structure and go ‘it’s just not penetrable

00:03:02.173 --> 00:03:04.555
for a new entrant even though the technology is applicable.

00:03:04.555 --> 00:03:08.338
Right. So what are you doing for tomorrow? For tomorrow,

00:03:08.338 --> 00:03:12.917
we’re going to go try and visit the planning board for

00:03:12.917 --> 00:03:17.117
Redwood City and see what they’re thinking about

00:03:17.117 --> 00:03:19.838
is that - they’re working on this cost per vote the salmation

00:03:19.838 --> 00:03:21.984
plant trying to talk with them about how they are

00:03:21.984 --> 00:03:23.510
thinking about that project. And some of you are

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.255
probably wishing that now but I have to tell you how

00:03:27.255 --> 00:03:30.017
proud I am of each and everyone of you here because

00:03:30.017 --> 00:03:32.659
you’re going to look back and what you did here, most

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:36.238
of you, and go ‘holy cow did we actually do that in a class

00:03:36.238 --> 00:03:38.991
or we were taking a course and doing work and everything

00:03:38.991 --> 00:03:43.123
else? and so for me, it’s just a really impressive effort on

00:03:43.123 --> 00:03:47.042
all your parts. Any other comments? Yeah, I’m guessing

00:03:47.042 --> 00:03:49.919
for some of you this was the hardest class you might

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:54.369
have taken. And that’s the intent because as hard as

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:58.042
this class might have been, it’s so much easier then when

00:03:58.057 --> 00:04:01.705
you get out and do it for real. So the laboratory was a sort

00:04:01.705 --> 00:04:04.500
of safe place to stretch your muscles and see if it fits.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.886
And for a lot of you, I think it does and I’m thrilled to have

00:04:07.886 --> 00:04:09.522
been a part of it, I think you guys have done a great job

00:04:09.522 --> 00:04:13.348
yeah. Thank you, guys, congratulations and best of luck

00:04:13.348 --> 00:04:16.168
to all you on Monday. Next Monday you start it for yourself

00:04:16.168 --> 00:04:21.137
for real.So final comment. I would just share is that

00:04:21.137 --> 00:04:26.440
by design this class is not taught, right. It’s experienced We

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.038
set up a framework under Steve’s leadership that gets

00:04:30.038 --> 00:04:32.806
you out of the classroom and then we all sort of monitor each other
