00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:33.200
OK. Let's settle down.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.600
Settle down. A couple of
announcements.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.000
You got the test back.
This is what it looked like.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.400
These are the very nice Gaussian.
You see it goes up and down. And

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.800
the average was 54 with a standard
deviation about 15. We

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:24.660
have a high here of 95.
We had a number of people in the 80s

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.990
and 90s. We had a number of people
that were in the 50s and 60s on the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.330
first test who moved to the right,
and we had also some people that

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.660
were up here who moved to the left.
Far more moved to the left than

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.990
moved to the right.
I talked to the TAs and we put a

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.330
fair bit of care into preparing the
test that no one felt that it was

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.270
atypically difficult.
But somehow people didn't do as well.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.810
I have been getting emails from
people asking about a makeup.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.360
Yeah, there is a third test on the
17th of November.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.900
We are not going to allow you to
retry until you get a score that you

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.450
like because there is no point in
doing that. You know what the rules

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:32.700
of engagement are. I don't
ask much of you.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:23.610
But, if you fail to give seven hours
a week, you are not going to pass

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.220
this class. There was nothing there
that was out of the ordinary.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.840
Nothing tricky. Just asking you to
answer a few skill-testing questions.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.460
I am very happy to talk to anybody
about his or her performance.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.070
I know my TAs are willing to do the
same. We have tutorial assistance

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.690
available at no charge,
but there is no substitute for your

00:02:46.690 --> 00:03:06.780
making the investment in time.
And I think that perhaps some people

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
are lulled into complacency because
I don't require you to hand in

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
monster problem sets,
because I think that is childish.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I think that you should take
ownership of your learning.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I treat you as adults. But if you
think because I am not there looking

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
over your shoulder whether you are
doing your work or not,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I don't have to. I just look at
this. I would warmly recommend that

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
if you want to pass this class,
and I told you everyone in this room

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:23.630
should pass this class.
I want to fail nobody.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.900
But if you don't demonstrate basic
proficiency, I cannot do it.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.180
It is intellectually dishonest on
my part. You wouldn't want that.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.450
You want to know the truth, so I
will tell you if you are not doing

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.720
the basics. And we will have a
chance to get back into the swing of

00:03:44.720 --> 00:04:02.040
things. There will be
a quiz on Tuesday.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And I goofed. I issued two problem
sets in a row both called Homework 7.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Just to be clear,
I fixed this one and reposted it on

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
the Web. It is the same questions,
but basically you will be looking at

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
the x-ray diffraction questions and
the questions on defects.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
That is where we are going to be
for Tuesday. And that is good news

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
because, those of you who had
trouble on the test this past

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Wednesday, we are going to be moving
into some new topics so you get a

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.500
chance to start over.
Towards the end there is some

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.500
integration, but at least it is not
so strictly lock step that if you

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.500
didn't do well on Wednesday then you
are hopelessly behind.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.500
Again, I mean it when I say this.
I want everyone to succeed here,

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.500
but you have to invest.
You have to invest. Last day we

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.500
were looking at defects.
We looked at point defects and line

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.000
defects.
Today I want to continue and look at

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
surface defects and volume defects
and ultimately go to something that

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
is so defective it lacks order.
We will move from surface to volume

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
to disordered solids.
Let's look at what makes surfaces

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
special. What makes surfaces
special is that the coordination

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
number is different at the surface
from what it is inside the material.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
What I am showing here is the free
surface of the material.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And here is one region of the
material where the atoms are lined

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:24.330
up in this manner.
And here is another region of the

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.990
material where the atoms are lined
up in this manner,

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.660
because they grew from the melt
starting from different starting

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.330
points from different nuclei.
And, when they impinge, this plane

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.990
does not line up with this plane.
And there is a boundary along here.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.660
We have two types of surfaces here.
We have a free surface and we have

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.230
an internal surface.
I am going to talk about both of

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.690
them. The thing they have in common
is that if we look at an atom down

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.150
here in the center,
if this is an FCC structure,

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.610
an atom here in an FCC structure has
12 nearest neighbors.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.070
An atom here at the free surface
cannot have 12 nearest neighbors.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.530
It has fewer than 12 nearest
neighbors. And we know that systems

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:32.860
form bonds maximally to
lower their energy.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:25.200
Therefore, if I have fewer than the
maximum number of bonds,

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:43.666
this is not at as low an energy at
the free surface as it would be were

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.600
it inside the material.
Because at the free surface it has

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.800
fewer than 12 nearest neighbors.
That means that surfaces are higher

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:30.000
energy. They are higher energy
regions in the crystal.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:54.280
And that can be good or it can be
bad. If we want something high

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.570
energy that is good if we are
looking for catalysis.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.850
We will talk about catalysis later,
but catalysis occurs at the free

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:07.140
surface. By definition,
you need to have those broken bonds.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:11.420
Catalysis is good, but it also
means things are highly reactive

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.710
sometimes undesirably.
And that can lead to corrosion

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:35.086
which is undesirable.
Where is corrosion going to occur?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.500
This material is not uniform in its
properties. The corrosion

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.000
resistance of an atom deep inside
the crystal is different from the

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.500
corrosion resistance on the free
surface, which is different from the

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:18.000
corrosion resistance along this
internal surface.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.500
Each of these regions is called a
grain. The grain is a virtual

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.000
single crystal. It is
a single crystal.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000
We have a polycrystalline material
consisting of a tapestry of single

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000
crystals called grains.
And this internal surface is called

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
a grain boundary.
Both of these are defects.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
What does the grain boundary do?
Well, the grain boundary does

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
several things.
First of all, the grain boundary

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:22.140
acts as a trap for impurities.
That can be good or it can be bad.

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:26.420
If all the impurities collect at
the grain boundaries,

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.710
and those impurities embrittle the
material, it doesn't matter what

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:34.990
ductility the grains have,
the material will fail at the grain

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:39.280
boundary. It would be as though you
had bricks that are very strong held

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.570
together by a weak mortar.
The grain boundaries act as that

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:47.850
mortar, but they have beneficial
effects. Imagine a dislocation

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:52.660
sliding in one grain.
It wants to rip through the entire

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:57.990
material. That misregistry of atoms
at the grain boundary stops the

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:03.330
dislocation so it can act as a site
for arresting dislocations.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:08.660
It arrests dislocations. I talked
to you last day about the management

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:13.990
of defects. If we want to have a
material that has high strength and

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:19.330
is not going to easily slip,
do we want a material that has

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:23.860
coarse grains or fine grains?
We want to have fine grain material.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.590
Grain boundary engineering is
important in the management of the

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:31.330
mechanical properties of material.
And I want to show you several

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:35.060
things. First of all,
here is a cartoon just to get you,

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.790
again, onto the page of what is
happening. These different grains

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:42.530
began from the melt at different
sites in the liquid,

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:46.260
grew to impingement. And you can
see these atoms cannot ever

00:09:46.260 --> 00:10:06.653
perfectly align with the atoms
growing from the adjacent grain.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:53.880
And so this zone of misregistry,
it is the void here which is called

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.760
the grain bound.
Now, this is showing it in terms of

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.640
cross-hatching.
The cross-hatching is tilted in

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.520
different ways.
And the gaps between the

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.410
cross-hatching are termed grain
boundaries. This is a piece of

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:13.290
polycrystalline copper that has
actually been polished and then

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:17.170
etched. And because their different
grains are presenting different

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:21.050
crystal densities,
atom densities, these grains etch

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:40.233
differently.
They etch at different rates in the

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
same acid. And,
after a while, they will actually be

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
tilting at slightly different angles.
And then when we illuminate this

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
with polarized light and look at it
under a simple optical microscope we

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
see different colors.
And these are the different grains.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Each one of these you can consider
a single crystal that has just the

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
normal atoms in their FCC lattice
throwing in some vacancies

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
and some dislocations.
And now they impinge along these

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
different boundaries.
And this is a field ion microscope

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
image of a tungsten bicrystal.
And right along the lower right

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
corner you can see the edge.
This is the grain boundary, so

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
there is a single crystal to the
lower right and the rest is a single

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
crystal to the upper left.
Grain boundaries. And also I can

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
show you again,
we will go to the document camera

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
and go back to our pal the atom mix
here and see if we can zoom in.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:26.070
That is too much zoom.
Now auto focus. Auto focus off.

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:31.150
Auto focus on. That's a so-so auto
focus, but if we had a manual.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:36.220
Oh, that's better. Now you can see
how things align.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:41.300
You can see zones here,
perfect, and then you can see there

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:46.380
are some vacancies.
And you see along here?

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:51.460
These atoms are moving sort of
towards 2 o'clock and these

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:56.150
atoms are moving here.
And then, when they try to align,

00:11:56.150 --> 00:12:00.460
there is the grain boundary. That
auto focus is really going nuts.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.760
Isn't it fun to see the machine
struggle? I just laugh.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:09.070
Laugh at it. It is a stupid
machine. Look at this.

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:13.380
There are grain boundaries,
and then the free surface up here of

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:17.690
course. These are both high energy
regimes. And we can anneal this.

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:37.580
If we anneal it we can try to get a
more coarse grain structure.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:10.500
Now I have a single grain.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:15.500
There was the original grain
boundary, there was one in here and

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:20.500
now we have a larger regime.
Let's go back to the computer.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:25.500
Now let's look at three-dimensional
defects. Three-dimensional defects,

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:30.500
there are really two types, being
and void, things that are missing

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:56.270
and things that are there.
So, what is there and void.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:13:02.810
I will talk first about the
three-dimensional voids.

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:09.360
Voids are simply coalesced
vacancies. The vacancies will

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:15.900
eventually come together and
coalesce. And so this clearly

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:22.450
weakens the material mechanically.
Mechanical properties are degraded

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:40.166
by the presence of what looks like
blowholes on the micron scale.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:34.770
And then there are three-dimensional
defects consisting of matter.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:40.550
And the most injurious is called
the inclusion.

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:46.330
And the inclusion is simply trapped
foreign matter.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:52.110
It is trapped foreign matter.
Why is it trapped? Because it is

00:13:52.110 --> 00:14:11.620
insoluble in the parent matrix.
And this can lead to deleterious

00:13:36.800 --> 00:14:00.390
mechanical properties.
And I will show you an example

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:03.990
immediately following.
And then there is a desirable form

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:07.590
of three-dimensional defect which is
called the precipitate.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:11.190
And the difference between the
precipitate and the inclusion is

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:14.790
that the inclusion is never soluble.
The inclusion is something that is

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:18.390
foreign matter that got trapped
during the melting process or the

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:38.113
vapor deposition process when the
solid was formed.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:27.590
The precipitate sometimes is put
there by designation.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:33.190
It is something that was dissolved
at one point and then made to come

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:38.790
out of solution,
so it is exsolved matter,

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:44.390
formerly dissolved. And the reason
that both of these are so injurious

00:14:44.390 --> 00:15:01.313
is that they represent
separate phases.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:54.280
And what do we have at the interface
between one phase and the other

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.570
phase? Well, we have the same issue
as an interface.

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:02.850
Not only do we have the bad
mechanical properties of the

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:07.140
precipitate or the bad mechanical
properties of the inclusion,

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:11.420
but we also have an interface.
These things do double injury.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:15.710
And the other point is that most
typically the exsolved material or

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:33.886
the inclusion has a
different density.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:25.330
And so when it comes out of solution
there is a volume change.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:30.660
And that either leads to a
compressive stress or a tensile

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:35.990
stress. There is a volume
difference with the parent or the

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:41.330
host matrix. This all leads to
trouble. Now,

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:46.660
I showed you that carbon in iron is
strengthening the iron to make steel

00:15:46.660 --> 00:16:05.853
because it is a little bit larger
than its interstitial site in iron.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
And there are examples.
When you fly on an airplane,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
you're flying on something that is
largely made of aluminum.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
And one of the elements that goes
in there is copper.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
And it goes in at a level that
causes precipitation of aluminum

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
copper compounds called
Guinier-Preston zones.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
These are precipitates that raise
the strength of aluminum beyond what

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
you would have if you had
essentially pure aluminum.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:25.450
You do not want to be flying in an
airplane made out of something that

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:30.900
has this level of ductility.
I mean, I love dislocations,

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:36.360
but there is a time and a place.
We don't want that. Let me show

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:41.810
you an extreme example of what
happens with inclusions.

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:47.270
Yes, the Titanic sank because of
these three-dimensional defects

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:51.870
called inclusions.
And this is some data taken recently

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:55.620
down at the National Institutes of
Standards and Technology in

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.370
Gaithersburg. This is Tim Fecke who
is a metallurgist who did a lot of

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:03.120
the work. This is a rivet.
And you can see the actual size of

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.870
it in his hand.
These are very,

00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:10.620
very large rivets.
And these are the rivets that were

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:14.370
in the hull. What has happened is
they have cut the rivets,

00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:18.120
polished them and put them in an
optical microscope. And

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:22.660
here is what you see.
If you look inside,

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:27.990
you see these dark zones.
These dark zones are inclusions of

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:33.330
slag. And how did they get there?
Well, in those days, we're talking

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:38.660
around 1910. The way steel was made
was in a unit called the open hearth

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:43.990
furnace. And the open hearth
furnace was the invention of Siemens,

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:49.330
one of his many inventions.
And the way the open hearth furnace

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:54.260
works --
This is not to scale.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:58.790
What I am going to show you is a
vessel that would have a floor about

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:03.330
the size of the entire front of
10-250. Actually,

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:07.860
many times larger. But this gives
you a sense of the scale.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:12.390
And you have two layers here.
Two liquids that are insoluble in

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:16.930
one another as salad oil and water.
The lower layer is iron, it is a

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:21.460
metallic layer,
and the above layer is slag.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:41.586
And the slag basically consists of
things like silica, calcia, alumina.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:29.570
It is all oxides so it is sort of
the equivalent of what you know to

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:33.140
be window glass or bottle glass.
And it lies in a giant pool on top

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:36.710
of a pool of metal.
And what is going on in here is

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:40.280
that the iron has come out of the
blast furnace,

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:43.850
it contains far too much carbon and
it contains impurities,

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:47.420
things like silicon and manganese at
too high a level.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:19:07.173
And the process was called open
hearth steelmaking.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
You had a vessel about the size of
the front of this room.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
And, to keep it molten at 1300
degrees C, you had to giant burners

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
at either end.
And these things would be like

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
dragons shooting flames across and
keeping everything molten.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
It was all contained in brickwork.
And the idea here is that over time

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
the impurities will rise out of the
metal and move into the slag layer.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
For example, carbon in the iron
will react with some oxygen in the

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
iron to form carbon monoxide
and bubble away.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:26.590
But, more importantly,
things like manganese in the iron

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:30.190
will react with oxygen in the iron
to form manganese oxide which is not

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:33.790
soluble in the iron,
and it goes into the slag.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:37.390
This process, in those days,
took about 12 hours. For 12 hours

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:40.990
you kept the steel sitting at about
1300 degrees C.

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:44.590
And you want good mixing so there
is a far bit of turbulence here.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:48.190
And, towards the end, you stopped
the turbulence and let

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:52.070
things separate.
Just as after you have shaken salad

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:56.210
dressing. You have oil.
In an aqueous phase vinegar.

00:19:56.210 --> 00:20:00.350
And then you watch. Slowly the
bubbles start to rise and so on,

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:04.490
the globules of oil. Well, clearly
what happened on the day they made

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:08.630
the heat for this vessel,
rivets, somebody got greedy and

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:12.780
tapped the metal too soon.
With the result, there was still a

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:16.920
lot of this glassy slag-like
material in the metal.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.820
Then the ingots were poured.
And then from the ingots they made

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:24.460
the rivets. Well,
when they make rivets they draw them.

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:28.110
And so, instead of having little
globules of glass,

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:31.760
which would have been bad but not
super bad, by drawing them,

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.400
can you see from the center of the
rivet, these globules have turned

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.050
into long stringers.
Now, instead of having the strength

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:42.700
of steel across the cross-section,
it is as though you have these

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:46.350
perforations. If you cut the
cross-section the other way and look

00:20:46.350 --> 00:21:05.966
down, it would look like mortadella
luncheon meat.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:53.360
There is meat and globules of fat.
That is what this thing would look

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.730
like. And then down here at the
bottom, see, there are stringers

00:20:56.730 --> 00:21:00.100
everywhere. Now,
this thing does not have the

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.470
strength anymore.
When it hit the iceberg,

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:06.840
what should have happened is that
there would have been damage in the

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.200
hull in that local region,
it would have been taking up water,

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.570
and there would have been time for
five or six hours before the rescue

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:16.940
vessels arrived.
Instead what happens was these

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:20.310
rivets were so weakened by the
presence of the inclusions

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:24.150
that they broke.
But, as they broke,

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:28.460
it was just like a zipper unzipping.
It just went down the entire hull,

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:32.760
opened up, water rushed in and the
vessel didn't last very long.

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:37.070
It stayed afloat too short a time.
And, of course, there were not

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:41.380
enough life vessels on it and so on.
You know the rest of the story.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.690
Anyway, it started with a bad
metallurgical heat which gave us the

00:21:45.690 --> 00:22:04.780
trapped foreign matter which is
insoluble and so on.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:55.830
Before leaving,
this is pretty much the catalog of

00:21:55.830 --> 00:22:01.660
defects, I want to return to
something I hinted at last day.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:07.490
I want to be clear with you about
the chemical origins of mechanical

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:13.330
behavior. And this is a part of 3.
91 that sets it apart from a

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:19.160
classical chemistry subject,
because what we have been looking at

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:36.786
is how electronic structure informs
chemical bonding.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:29.330
Well, that is no surprise.
You would expect to get that in

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:33.660
chemistry class.
But then chemical bonding informs

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:37.990
atomic arrangement,
and that is where the rubber meets

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:42.330
the road when it comes to mechanical
behavior. You have to know where

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:46.660
the atoms are.
I want to talk about deformation.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:23:05.586
That is what makes metals in
particular so useful.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:54.410
That is why they have been
historically utilized by humans

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:57.820
going back to prehistory,
because they have the special

00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:01.230
property of ductility.
We can take them in the solid form

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:04.640
and have them change shape.
And the reason they can change

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.050
shape has to do with,
first of all, their electronic

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:11.460
structure which leads to metallic
bonding which gives us these cubic

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:14.880
crystalline arrangements.
And then we introduce dislocations

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:18.290
and things slip.
I want to talk about two types of

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:22.900
deformation.
First of all, I want to look at

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:28.700
elastic deformation.
And this is deformation that is

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:46.366
reversible. It is characterized by
its reversibility.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:40.300
And the simplest way to define it
is strain. That is strain only

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:46.090
under stress. Release the stress,
the material relaxes back to its

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:51.580
initial state. Only under stress.
Or, if you want,

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:56.740
you could say displacement only
under the action of applied force.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:01.910
And Hooke's Law applies for this.
And I want to show you the chemical

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:07.080
origin of Hooke's Law.
We saw, when we looked at the force

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:12.240
curves that defined the equilibrium
separation of two atoms,

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:17.410
regardless of the type of bonding,
that we could plot energy as a

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:22.300
function of interatomic separation.
And we find that we have some kind

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:26.920
of a repulsive energy up here and we
have some kind of an attractive

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:31.530
energy down here.
And we went through the strict

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:36.150
derivation for ionic crystals,
but analogous derivations exist for

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:40.760
other types of crystals.
And if we go through we find that

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:45.380
there is a minimum energy which
defines this r naught which is the

00:24:45.380 --> 00:25:04.560
equilibrium interatomic separation.
And this is E minimum.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:54.800
Well, I can keep going.
What I can do is look at the

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:59.600
derivative of that and show you
where you get Hooke's Law.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:04.400
If I look at the derivative of this
then that will give me force,

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:23.400
because I know if I plot force which
is equal to dE by dr,

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:54.000
the derivative of the energy with
respect to displacement.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:18.800
And right here about r naught you
can see that the curve is positive

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:23.590
slope to the right,
negative slope to the left and is

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:28.790
flat at the origin.
I am exaggerating this over a wider

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:34.390
range, but it is fair to say that
about r equals r naught,

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:39.990
F is linear in r. Well, doesn't
that remind you of this from physics

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:45.590
where you have a spring and you hang
a mass on a spring,

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:51.190
and that mass on a spring in a
gravitational field gives

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:56.160
rise to a force?
And you can look at the displacement

00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:00.490
versus an initial displacement.
Here is an x and here is an x

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:04.830
naught with no mass.
And I think you have seen this.

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:09.160
You've seen that some constant
times x minus x naught is force.

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:13.490
That's Hooke's Law, that there is a
linear relationship between applied

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:17.830
force and the displacement of the
string. And that is the same thing

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:22.140
happening with atoms.
For a tiny force I get a tiny

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:26.420
displacement, for a larger force I
get a larger displacement,

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.710
and if I relax the force the atom
springs back to its rest position.

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:34.990
What you are seeing on a macro
scale here is what is being played

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:39.280
out at the nanoscale here.
Hooke's Law is related directly to

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:43.570
the linearity in the force curve as
a function of position.

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:47.850
And, by the way, here is how he
published Hooke's Law in 1676.

00:26:47.850 --> 00:27:02.966
It was first published as follows.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
That is Hooke's Law as he first
published it. This is an anagram

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000
and it is in Latin.
Hooke was a wise guy,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000
to be sure. He was a contemporary
of Newton. They hated each other's

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000
guts. They fought bitterly.
Three years later he published the

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
solution to this, Ut
tensio, sic uis.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
As the extension,
thus the force. He was quite a guy.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
There it is. That is elastic
deformation. Now let's look at

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
plastic deformation.
Plastic deformation is the other

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
form, and that is permanent
deformation. Plastic deformation is

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
permanent. Let's look at the
chemical origins of that.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
And now we will do another
experiment.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:54.420
Instead of a spring this is a wire.
This is a wire and we hang a mass

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:58.850
on it. And this mass is very,
very heavy so that the force here is

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:03.280
great enough to actually cause
elongation. We have elongation of

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:07.710
the wire here.
Let's make this a simple copper

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:12.140
wire. It is pure copper FCC.
The only thing we have in there is

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:16.560
it has high purity copper.
There are vacancies, there are

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:34.986
grain boundaries and there
are dislocations.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:25.570
Let's look at this a little bit more
carefully. Here is the wire,

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:30.140
and we are going to make it
polycrystalline.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:34.710
I am going to indicate
polycrystalline as follows.

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:39.280
Different grains have different
orientations of the atoms.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:43.850
And I am applying a force in the
vertical direction.

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:48.420
The question is how does this
deform? If we go down to the next

00:28:48.420 --> 00:29:07.373
level, I will take a look over here
on the right side.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.000
And I can imagine that I have here
atoms touching as follows.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:45.000
It is in an FCC lattice, but I am
pulling in the vertical direction.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Now, maybe around the early 1800s
we might argue that the atoms start

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:57.000
off as spherical and then they
become elongated under

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:22.180
the action of a force.
But I think that is kind of goofy so

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:26.540
we are going to turn that one down.
Instead what we are going to do is

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:30.900
say, well, we know about
dislocations and we know that

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:35.270
dislocations allow atoms to glide
over one another.

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:39.630
So what is the problem here?
The problem is that the atom planes

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:59.860
are lined up on a 45 degree angle.
What the system does is it reforms.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:30.000
It reconstitutes the applied stress
and resolves it into a resolved

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.000
sheer stress that moves along the
componentry of the atoms.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:42.000
What happens is this atom plane
underneath slides down to the lower

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.000
right. The next plane slides to the
upper left. And,

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:54.000
from a distance, we see that the
wire is becoming narrower and longer,

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.000
but it is happening thanks
to the atom slip.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
And we went through the reasoning
last day of what the slip systems

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000
will be. The atoms are going to
slip in such a way that preserves

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
the strength of the planes.
The planes that will slip over one

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
another are the planes that have the
tightest binding.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
And the tightest binding comes from
neighboring atoms.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:31:02.250
The planes that have the tightest

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:06.750
binding are the planes that have the
highest populations.

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:11.250
That would be the planes of highest
packing. We have gone through this.

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:15.750
And just to return. The planes
that have the highest packing are

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:20.250
the ones that have the highest atom
density, and that is going to be the

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:24.750
highest binding.
The highest density plane in FCC is

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:28.920
{111}.
And then the plane will slip along

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.760
the direction that has the highest
density. Because what we are

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:36.610
thinking of are rigid rafts and
rigid rods. To make the most rigid

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:40.460
raft you have the highest density of
bonds. And once you are in the

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:44.300
plane, how do you slip?
Are you going to push a wet noodle

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:48.150
or are you going to push something
that is rigid?

00:31:48.150 --> 00:32:08.766
The highest rigidity comes from the
direction where the atoms touch.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:40.000
And so all of this goes back right
to the very beginning and explains

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:48.000
how slip systems work.
And so slip systems operate in

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:56.000
close packed planes along close
packed directions with the

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:05.000
aid of dislocations.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:30.400
Which provide for the ability to
move in permanent displacement at

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:48.266
stresses that are less than what is
critical. Now,

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:21.200
what I would like to do is show you
something that comes from a bubble

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:46.600
raft model that was constructed by
Krystyn Van Vliet as part of her PhD.

00:32:46.600 --> 00:33:04.200
She is now a faculty member
in our department.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.000
This is a bubble raft model that
represents the movement of atoms

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.000
under an applied stress.
Let's look at the first one here.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:33:00.000
What you are going to see is --

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:24.160
-- the application of stress,
you will see the grain boundary,

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:28.330
and then you will see a dislocation
here. And you will see the atom

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:32.490
squirt up. The force is being
applied from top to bottom but the

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:36.660
atoms are on an angle,
so there is a dislocation that

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:40.830
issues from this triple junction.
And now it is up in here and is

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:59.260
getting ready to squirt
up to this side.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:48.850
You can see how the atoms are moving
side-by-side on a 45 degree angle in

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:52.710
order to allow for what,
in essence, has to be compression in

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:56.560
the vertical direction.
I will show you another one that

00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:00.420
involves a single crystal and the
same thing. The pressure gets high

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:04.280
enough that finally a dislocation
originates in the center of a single

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:08.140
crystal, the dislocation shoots up
to the surface,

00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:26.813
and now you have a step at the
surface.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:34:28.660
Now we have a single crystal.

00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:33.990
You are going to see a dislocation
originate right in here.

00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:39.330
There it is. You see it squirt.
And now there is a step here. This

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:44.660
side of the surface is one atom step
higher. We will see it one more

00:34:44.660 --> 00:35:03.120
time. It will originate right down
in here. There it goes.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
The atoms are slipping over the
highest population.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:35:08.800
Now you know the origins of

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:14.400
mechanical behavior.
Now I want to talk about the

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:31.466
ultimate defect, which
is total disorder.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:31.750
And so what we are going to look at

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:35.250
is a loss of crystallinity and go to
amorphous materials.

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:38.750
I will take you back to the big
picture, which was about a week or

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:42.250
so ago, where we looked at how we
got to solids.

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:45.750
And we said there are two types of
solids. We saw that we have ordered

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:49.250
solids, and that is what we have
been talking about for

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:53.630
the last week or so.
And now I want to get over here to

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:58.900
disordered solids.
These are solids that lack

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:04.180
long-range order.
There is a little bit of

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:09.450
short-range order.
Amorphous solids. And the

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:14.720
colloquial word for them is glasses.
Amorphous solids or glasses. And

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:32.306
these are solids that lack
long-range order.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:32.660
What kind of solids can form glasses?

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:37.990
Well, anything that is capable of
being solidified in a way that

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:43.330
prevents crystallization.
I can show you inorganic glasses

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:48.660
such as the silicates that sank the
Titanic and are also used in

00:36:48.660 --> 00:37:07.386
everything from window glass to
beverage containers and so on.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:59.160
These are made of SiO2,
and we are going to return to that

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:04.330
as a prototypical system to study
very shortly. There is organic

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:09.490
glasses, the most common being
polymers. For example,

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:14.660
the polymethylmethacrylate that we
use in such applications as

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:19.830
substitution for window glass,
the polymethylmethacrylate you use

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:38.126
in your eye glasses,
this material is all disordered.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:11.000
And we even have elements that have
certain features.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:17.000
For example, sulfur.
Sulfur typically when it solidifies

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:23.000
does not form a crystal but rather
forms a glass.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:29.000
It is an amorphous material when it
solidifies.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:54.630
The point here is that we do not
classify things as amorphous based

00:37:54.630 --> 00:38:00.270
on their chemical composition but
rather based upon atomic order.

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:05.900
And specifically here the lack of
long-range order.

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:11.540
And some do both.
For example, SiO2,

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:17.180
silica, silicon oxide.
If it forms a crystal,

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:34.993
we call it quartz.
And the quartz crystal in our

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:07.500
watches is made of high purity SiO2
which has been hydrothermally

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:12.500
processed to give it a high degree
of crystallinity.

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:17.500
And it has a very characteristic
vibrational frequency from which we

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:22.500
derive the ability to set the time.
But we can also have amorphous SiO2.

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:27.500
And this is the only time you are
going to see me use this term as the

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:52.580
general public uses it.
It gives you glass,

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:57.740
as you know glass. Window glass,
bottle glass and so on. But only

00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:02.910
when I put quotation marks am I
using this vernacular,

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:08.080
this vulgar term. When I use the
term glass up here,

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:13.240
I mean no long-range order.
And so I think just to get some

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:18.410
nomenclature here so that you will
know, you have silicon which is the

00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:23.830
metal. The oxide is silica, SiO2.
And the anion is silicate.

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:29.490
And so we will refer to silicate
glasses. SiO4 four minus is the

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:35.160
maximum coordination.
You can go through. You have

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:40.830
aluminum. Al2O3 is alumina,
AlO3 is aluminate and so on. I

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:46.490
thought, since it is Friday and
people are kind of in a festive mood

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:52.160
after the quiz on Wednesday,
I would take a look at the geography

00:39:52.160 --> 00:40:09.353
here.
I think we can learn a little bit

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:42.500
here. This is Si.
I am going to now look at oxides.

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:47.500
This is silica, so this would be
Germania. GeO2 would be Germania,

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:52.500
which is Latin for...Germania. I
wonder what the Latin is.

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:57.500
How about Germany? Maybe Germany.
Gallium, the oxide is Gallia. What

00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:22.060
is Gallia? France.
France lies to the west of Germany.

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:26.190
See, that is making sense. In 203
would be India.

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:30.330
India is south of France.
This is the oxide of Polonium,

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:34.460
so that would be Polonia. That is
Poland. Poland is east of Germany.

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:38.590
It is not south of India so it is
not so good. This is Francia,

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:42.730
which is France. So France is twice
on the table here.

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:46.860
We have got to do something about
that. This is Ruthenia,

00:40:46.860 --> 00:41:05.653
which could be Russia, more properly
Ukraine.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:57.440
Scandia, well,
it is almost Scandinavia,

00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:03.880
not quite. Hafnia, hafnium was
discovered in Copenhagen under the

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:10.330
direction of Niels Bohr.
It was an impurity in zirconium.

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:16.770
Hafnia is the Latin name for
Copenhagen. Holmia is Stockholm.

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:22.660
Lutecia is the Latin name for Paris.
If you go surfing,

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:27.990
you go to Cf 3, California.
While we are on the Periodic Table,

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:33.330
copper is also geography. It is a
corruption of the ancient word for

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:38.660
Cyprus. Cyprus and copper have the
same root because copper was mined

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:43.990
in Cyprus. Strontium,
that comes from the Latin for

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:49.330
Scotland. That should cheer the
hearts of McDonald and

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:54.410
McTavish and so on.
Hesse is the province where

00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:59.240
Darmstadt is located in Germany
where they have that accelerator.

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:04.080
So that's Hassium, Dubnium is for
Dubna in former Soviet Union.

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:08.910
And Berkeley is where we have the
accelerator in the United States.

00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:13.740
If you had the oxide of Americium,
it wouldn't quite be America. It is

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:18.580
Americia. There is Europia.
Terbia. One town in Sweden is

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:23.720
called Ytterby.
And we get yttrium,

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:29.180
ytterbium, erbium and terbium.
Four elements from one little town.

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:34.630
What do you think is in that town?
There must be a resource of minerals

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:40.080
from which all of these elements
were discovered.

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:45.540
What else is up here?
People. Rutherfordium.

00:42:45.540 --> 00:43:04.213
Seaborgium. This is Niels Bohr,
Bohrium. This is Elisa Meitner.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:55.140
And now we have our pal Roentgen.
He looks like he is going to go on

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:59.280
111. There are Curies,
Einstein, Fermi, Mendeleev,

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:03.420
Nobel and Lawrence. E.O. Lawrence
was the designer of the accelerator

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:07.560
that was put at Berkeley.
That is why you have the Lawrence

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:11.710
Berkeley Laboratory.
There is astronomy here,

00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:15.850
too. Did you see the lunar eclipse
the other night?

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:34.500
Tellus is the earth and Selene is
the moon.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:25.450
The moon is above the earth.
That is good. Mercury is a fast

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:30.900
running planet and it is a liquid
metal. Pallas and Ceres are

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:36.360
asteroids. And there is the outer
reaches of the solar system,

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:41.810
Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. There is
so much information.

00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:47.270
Can you believe it? Enough fun.
Now let's look at the conditions

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:52.770
that stabilize glasses.
And I am going to look at it from

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:58.330
the perspective of solidification.
Liquid goes to solid. And I want

00:43:58.330 --> 00:44:03.880
to ask why something would decide to
solidify as an amorphous solid

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:09.440
rather than a crystalline solid.
And so there are basically three

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:26.480
factors to consider.
The first one is --

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:19.660
Let's do it in an analogy.
Suppose you were thinking about a

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:24.330
game that your younger siblings play,
musical chairs.

00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:28.990
Musical chairs involve moving
around while music is playing,

00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:33.660
and then there is a rush to get to a
certain site, a certain chair.

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:38.330
So the chairs are the lattice sites
and the people are the liquid in

00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:42.990
motion. What is going to enhance
the ability to get to the lattice

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:47.660
site? In other words,
to crystallize? Mobility is an

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:52.750
issue.
Mobility of atoms in the liquid is

00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:58.250
going to enhance the ability to
crystallize. What is another factor?

00:44:58.250 --> 00:45:03.750
Well, the arrangement of the chairs.
If the chairs are simply arranged,

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:09.250
it is easy to get to them. If the
chairs have complexity in their

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:14.750
arrangement then it is more
difficult. Let's liken that to the

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:20.250
complexity of the crystal lattice,
complexity of the solid crystal

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:38.366
structure.
Systems that have complex crystal

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.000
structures are more apt to form
glasses than systems that have

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000
simple crystal structures.
And then the last thing is how

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000
you're told to race for the chairs.
Normally the music is shut off

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000
abruptly, but suppose I had a turn
on the volume.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.000
In some cases,
I turn the volume down slowly and in

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000
other cases I turn the
volume down quickly.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:53.530
That is your cue to start moving to
the lattice site.

00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:58.060
And the analogous quantity in the
basic physics is temperature,

00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:02.590
so cooling rate has an effect.
High cooling rates are apt to

00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:07.130
quench in the liquid disorder.
High complexity of the solid is apt

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:11.660
to make it difficult to make a solid
crystal. High mobility is in favor

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:16.190
of crystallinity,
so I am going to replace mobility

00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:20.730
with the analogous quantity so that
when all of these are high I do not

00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:25.850
form a crystal.
The inverse of mobility,

00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:31.570
at the liquid level, would be
viscosity of the liquid.

00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:37.280
Highly viscous liquids that have
very complex solid state crystals

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:54.626
that are cooled very rapidly
will form glasses.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:49.690
And we will look at that in a little

00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:53.090
more detail next day,
but here is what I would like to do,

00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:56.490
show you something very interesting.
And I said anything could be made

00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:59.890
noncrystalline.
And the one I am going to show you

00:46:59.890 --> 00:47:03.290
here comes from 1959 when somebody
decided I am going to make

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:07.350
a metallic glass.
And what happened here is Pol Duwez

00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:12.070
at Caltech, not far from some of the
places we just looked at on the

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:16.780
chart, decided to cool a gold
silicon, drop the temperature down

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:21.490
very, very low where he could get
down to hundreds and hundreds of

00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:26.210
degrees below the normal
solidification temperature,

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:30.920
put it on a water-cooled copper
wheel, cooled at a rate succeeding a

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:35.640
million degrees per second and
quenched in the disorder

00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:39.710
of the liquid state.
So this is metallic glass.

00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:43.140
This has no long-range order.
This is one giant amorphous mess.

00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:46.570
There are no grain boundaries.
There are no grains.

00:47:46.570 --> 00:48:05.873
There are no dislocations.
Listen to this.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:54.280
It doesn't have the ductility of
aluminum. It is very,

00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:58.570
very different. We will talk a
little bit more about that,

00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:02.850
but I have to do something special
today because Sunday is Halloween

00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:07.140
and I cannot have you all coming to
my place. Oh,

00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:11.420
I forgot to show you this.
Somebody sent me this. Natalia

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:15.710
Cherenkov sent me this.
This was late in the game on

00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:34.086
Wednesday. Did you catch
this? [APPLAUSE]

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:27.250
See, we are everywhere.

00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:31.750
3.091 is everywhere. I am going to
show you some beautiful glasswork of

00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:36.250
Dale Chihuly from Seattle.
And then what we are going to do is

00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:40.750
do some trick or treating here.
Do you think we could dim the

00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:45.250
lights a little bit?
I think it is a little bit too

00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:49.750
bright for this sort of thing.
What we are going to do is share.

00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:58.500
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:42.000 --> 00:49:06.600
I don't want to hit one of those
cameras, though,

00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:11.200
because I don't have insurance like
that. What we are going to do is

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:15.800
cheat a little bit and come up here
and throw some up this way and up

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:20.400
this way and up that way and over
there. Now, you have to open them

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:39.800
up and share. You're supposed to be
very group-oriented here.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:15.000
And those who don't get any,

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:21.000
they're bad for your teeth anyway.
Who didn't get anything? Oh, you

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:27.000
didn't? Who is sharing here?
Come on. If you didn't get the

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:51.750
handout, raise your hand.
You guys got about four bags and you

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:55.250
are asking for more.
One last one. Where is it going to

00:49:55.250 --> 00:50:09.500
go?

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.500
I've thrown about five bags up there,
so I am going to put this one and

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:51.000
you can share.
All right. Stay out of trouble

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.333
this weekend. I will
see you Monday.
