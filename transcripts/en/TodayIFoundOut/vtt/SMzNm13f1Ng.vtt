00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.660
As we’ve discussed in detail before (see:
The Curious Case of the Claque), audiences

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.820
haven’t always been kind to performers throughout
history as evidenced by the fact that there

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.880
was a thriving industry of people who made
a rather lucrative living during the 19th

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.660
and early 20th centuries by simply booing
plays and operas unless the actors paid them

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.660
to stop.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.590
But the question at hand is: Did audiences
ever go further than this and express their

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.340
dissatisfaction by pelting the performers
with rotten fruit as countless TV shows and

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.080
movies have depicted or is that simply a fictional
plot device?

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.290
Despite the idea of rotten tomatoes being
synonymous with a poor performance to such

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.040
an extent that one of the leading film review
websites in the world is named for it, audiences

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.829
throughout most of history have thrown pretty
much everything at performers but tomatoes.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.690
For example, audience members in the cheap
seats at vaudevillian shows often liked to

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.810
chuck peanuts at performers, leading to the
creation of the term “peanut gallery”.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.790
Going back significantly further in history,
rowdy and notoriously fickle Roman audiences

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.790
watching the gladiatorial games would sometimes
throw objects, though not necessarily food,

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.860
at gladiators if they displeased them.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.860
Of course, audiences back then sometimes got
as good as they gave.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.070
For example, Emperor Elagabalus was known
to have baskets full of deadly venomous snakes

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.409
thrown into crowds, sometimes to disperse
them, and sometimes just for his own general

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.409
amusement.

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.410
(He was notorious for such “practical jokes”.)

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:46.030
Long before this in AD 63, it was noted by
Suetonius that then governor of Africa and

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.300
later Emperor of Rome, Vespasian, governed
the region “with great justice and high

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.880
honour, save that in a riot at Hadrumetum
he was pelted with turnips”.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.229
Fast-forwarding a bit through history, we
know it was a popular practise in Shakespearean

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.820
times to huck various food items at performers
at Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre during its

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.820
heyday.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.220
But despite what is often stated, they almost
certainly wouldn’t have thrown tomatoes.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.650
How can we be so sure?

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.690
Tomatoes are a “New World” item and they
weren’t commonly found in Britain until

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.060
the mid-18th century.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.991
That said, they technically were introduced
to Europe around the 16th century, but tomatoes

00:02:22.991 --> 00:02:28.610
were greeted with disdain and outright fear
– rumors even circulated that tomatoes were

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.610
poisonous.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.740
(A similar thing happened with potatoes, with
this tuber not becoming widely popular until

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.680
some clever tricks and antics used by Frenchman
Antoine-Augustine Parmentier in which he managed

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.670
to convince the masses that potatoes were
just fine to eat.)

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.989
So while it’s technically possible that
a performer was hit with a tomato at this

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.220
point (the original Globe being built in 1599),
the odds of someone in the cheap seats of

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.400
a play here having one on hand, let alone
enough to pass around to ensure a performer

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.120
got hit, is highly unlikely and there is no
documented evidence of it, despite many claims

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.330
to the contrary.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.650
Lacking tomatoes, a popular missile of choice
for overly critical audiences was eggs largely

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.670
due to them being easy to throw, cheap, smelly
(when rotten), hard to wipe off, and perhaps

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.650
most importantly, infinitely satisfying to
land a direct hit with.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.000
It’s noted that audience members in the
pit at the Globe regularly hurled eggs at

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.370
actors if they got bored and as a result,
Shakespeare often tried to sandwich his more

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.860
serious scenes with either comedy (often of
a bawdy nature) or violence to placate those

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.840
in the cheap seats so that the show could
go on.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.849
To find documented examples of audiences throwing
tomatoes at performers, you have to fast-forward

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:46.819
to the 19th century and travel to America
where the practise eventually became surprisingly

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:47.819
common.

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.239
American audiences of this period are noted
as being among the “rowdiest of all” and

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.510
it wasn’t uncommon for them to turn up to
performances carrying armfuls of potential

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.830
missiles (including tomatoes).

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.780
Much like rotten eggs, rotten tomatoes were
cheap in some regions and made for a conveniently

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.930
proportioned object to throw that also made
a very satisfactory splat when the target

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:08.930
was hit.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.760
Beyond culinary items, American audiences
of the age were also known to go so far as

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.259
to tear up chairs and throw them at the performers
if they weren’t happy with the way the show

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:19.289
was going.

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.259
Even on an occasion where the crowd enjoyed
a performance, actors and singers of this

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:27.570
period still weren’t safe and they’d often
be required to “repeat a speech as many

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.529
times as the crowd demanded” or risk having
fruit, eggs, stones, and pretty much anything

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:34.770
that wasn’t nailed down thrown at them.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.369
A particularly notable example of the former
(and the first known documented instance of

00:04:39.369 --> 00:04:45.110
tomato lobbing at a show) occurred in 1883
when an acrobat called John Ritchie was forced

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.639
to flee from the stage.

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.110
The New York Times article covering the event
noted,

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.210
John Ritchie… made his debut before a Hempstead
audience at Washington Hall a few evenings

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.210
ago.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.650
He had a crowded house, and was warmly received,
in fact, it was altogether too hot for him,

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.599
there being distributed among the audience
a bushel or two of rotten tomatoes.

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:05.770
The first act opened with Mr. Ritchie trying
to turn a somersault.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.949
He probably would have succeeded had not a
great many tomatoes struck him, throwing him

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.080
off his balance and demoralizing him.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.919
It was some time before the audience could
induce him to go on with the performance.

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.080
He next attempted to perform on the trapeze.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.719
As he lay upon the bar with his face toward
the audience, a large tomato thrown from the

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:27.580
gallery struck him square between the eyes,
and he fell to the stage floor just as several

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.590
bad eggs dropped upon his head.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.699
Then the tomatoes flew thick and fast, and
Ritchie fled for the stage door.

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:37.149
The door was locked, and he ran the gauntlet
for the ticket office through a perfect shower

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:38.210
of tomatoes.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.650
He reached it, and the show was over.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:46.930
This leads us to the obvious question of why
exactly did audiences feel the need to express

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.770
themselves so violently through most of history,
particularly when it would sometimes result

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.809
in the show they paid to see being canceled
and even an occasional riot?

00:05:56.809 --> 00:06:01.249
Mob mentality obviously plays a large role
and it has already been clearly demonstrated,

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:05.599
both via anecdotal instances and controlled
experiments, that people’s behaviour in

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.699
a group can be strongly influenced by a few
bad eggs.

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:12.919
In fact, this was the major point of the Claque
in the first place.

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:16.490
Those on stage found that they could easily
control audience reactions by having a few

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.139
well paid individuals in the crowd set the
tone.

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:23.479
Humans being humans, the rest of the crowd
generally followed, regardless of the actual

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:25.839
quality of the show in question.

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:29.939
Beyond all this, the idea of a “passive
audience” is noted to be a fairly recent

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:34.309
phenomenon in theatre and throughout history
crowds have always been encouraged in some

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:38.570
way to express their enthusiasm, and even
sometimes take part in the show in some way,

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.559
starting way back in Ancient Greece where
audience participation in plays and speeches

00:06:43.559 --> 00:06:46.620
was considered practically a civic duty.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.029
The obvious downside of this is that crowds
also felt entitled to express their displeasure

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:52.449
in any way they pleased.

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:56.610
And while the quality of the show on the stage
may well have been improved by performers

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.279
not having to worry about things thrown at
them or an audience member running onto the

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:04.569
stage, because people were so willing to do
this sort of thing, a performer admonishing

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:08.909
the crowd for doing this would have been a
brave act indeed.

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:12.550
Beyond this, the audience themselves didn’t
mind as half the fun of going to these shows

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.080
was interacting with the performers in some
way for some (particularly in the cheap seats)

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.080
and for others observing what certain members
of the crowd would get up to during the show.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.569
So how did we go from many hundreds of years
of audience participation in theatre to the

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:24.360
passive audiences we have today, less than
a century later?

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.539
To begin with, shows began shifting from the
actors actively acknowledging the audience

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:32.759
was there, generally purposefully interacting
with them, to instead pretending the audience

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:35.889
was non-existent and performing as though
what was happening on the stage was real and

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:38.139
sort of “in another dimension”, so to
speak.

00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:43.289
Essentially, the invisible fourth wall was
created to preserve the illusion, and audiences

00:07:43.289 --> 00:07:48.969
began to more and more be expected not to
break that wall down by interrupting the performance.

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:52.580
Other factors that helped this switch along
included advancements in stage lighting, allowing

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:58.229
for shifting the focus from both the audience
and the stage to just the stage, further solidifying

00:07:58.229 --> 00:08:00.300
the invisible “fourth wall”.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.759
Accordingly, theatres were redesigned and
rather than having the classic horseshoe shape

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:08.499
(so wealthy spectators in the seats high up
could enjoy the audience’s show as much

00:08:08.499 --> 00:08:12.300
as what was happening on the stage, as well
as easily observe what other wealthy patrons

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.809
were getting up to), now every seat commonly
faced towards the stage and it became difficult

00:08:16.809 --> 00:08:19.650
to see what members of the audience were doing.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:23.629
Effectively, the audience ceased to be part
of the night’s entertainment.

00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:27.150
As the show began to focus more on what was
happening on the stage, the cheap seats in

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:32.060
the pit began to be upgraded from simple wooden
benches to plush seats where the wealthy began

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.630
to sit so they could see the performers better.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:38.900
When this happened, the cheap seats switched
to being up high and far away from the stage,

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.800
where the expensive seats used to be.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.710
From this vantage point, it became much more
difficult to throw food at the performers,

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:48.779
and those wealthy patrons sitting near the
stage were less than enthusiastic about getting

00:08:48.779 --> 00:08:53.680
hit by poorly aimed projectiles, helping to
morph the rules to this being no longer accepted

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.839
behavior in the theatre, though it has persist
somewhat in certain other venues.

00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:03.060
For instance, throwing things on the stage
at pop music concerts is relatively common,

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:08.050
and even the Beatles once lamented that for
a little over a year period they were continually

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:12.740
hit on stage, first with soft Jelly Babies
in England and then in America with the much

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.430
harder Jelly Beans.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.779
George stated of one particularly bad show
in Washington D.C.,

00:09:17.779 --> 00:09:21.140
“…that night we were absolutely pelted
by the f*****g things…

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:25.209
To make matters worse, we were on a circular
stage, so they hit us from all sides.

00:09:25.209 --> 00:09:29.780
Imagine waves of rock-hard little bullets
raining down on you from the sky… if Jelly

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:33.740
Beans traveling about 50 miles an hour through
the air hit you in the eye, you’re finished.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.060
You’re blind, aren’t you?

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.050
We’ve never liked people throwing stuff
like that.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:41.129
We don’t mind them throwing streamers, but
Jelly Beans are a bit dangerous, you see!

00:09:41.129 --> 00:09:45.110
… Every now and again, one would hit a string
on my guitar and plonk off a bad note as I

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:46.110
was trying to play.”

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:50.040
In fact, the Beatles’ 1964 performance in
San Francisco had to be completely stopped

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:55.750
twice due to the barrage of Jelly Beans becoming
too intense, forcing them to retreat and implore

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.600
the audience to knock it off.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:03.500
(For more on all this and how it started,
see: When the Beatles were Pelted with Jelly

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.500
Beans)

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.790
Beyond the occasional heckler at comedy shows,
sporting events are another venue that more

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.100
classic audience participation has endured.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:15.959
For instance, in the early days of baseball,
players sprawled on the grass along each baseline

00:10:15.959 --> 00:10:17.769
with the fans right behind them.

00:10:17.769 --> 00:10:20.800
This provided fans with easy access to those
athletes…

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.579
Too easy.

00:10:22.579 --> 00:10:26.529
If spectators didn’t like what was going
on, they could scream directly behind the

00:10:26.529 --> 00:10:30.339
players and also weren’t opposed to chucking
objects at them.

00:10:30.339 --> 00:10:34.329
Dugouts with walls and a roof, located below
ground, eventually were created, providing

00:10:34.329 --> 00:10:35.540
much needed separation.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:39.220
kitty_Burke-340x513In the 1930s, this type
of common audience interaction even led to

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.829
a fan batting during a Major League Baseball
game.

00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:46.800
Audience member Kitty Burke, who’d been
incessantly heckling Joe “Ducky” Medwick,

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.069
eventually marched onto the field and grabbed
a bat, intending to show Medwick how it was

00:10:51.069 --> 00:10:52.069
done.

00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:56.379
Nobody objected and so pitcher Paul “Daffy”
Dean threw her a pitch, with Kitty swinging

00:10:56.379 --> 00:10:58.000
and grounding out.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.780
This made Kitty the only woman to bat during
an official Major League Baseball game.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:05.470
While a fan trying this today would soon find
themselves the recipient of a night in the

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:10.250
Clink, the boisterous behavior of patrons
at many sporting events still often resembles

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:12.560
that of audiences through most of history.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.480
But due to stricter rules and that the rowdier
members of the crowd are typically further

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.879
from the field of play, this doesn’t usually
disrupt the sporting spectacle, though the

00:11:20.879 --> 00:11:23.209
athletes still have to endure non-stop taunting
or cheering (and the occasional projectile)

00:11:23.209 --> 00:11:24.589
in many professional sports from fans at all
levels.

00:11:24.589 --> 00:11:28.570
Of course, it is not uncommon to have a (often
inebriated) fan running onto the field of

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:31.320
play and being chased around by security.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.930
Despite this interrupting the show the rest
of the audience paid to see, everyone tends

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:38.600
to cheer for the runner and find the whole
thing thoroughly enjoyable, particularly the

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.750
longer the fan on the field can manage to
evade capture…

00:11:41.750 --> 00:12:11.420
We really haven’t changed that much 
at all, it turns out.
