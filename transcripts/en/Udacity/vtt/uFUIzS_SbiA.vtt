00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.000
Jonathan has the same amount
in both cases and packs.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.354
Jonathan bought four of
the two by three packs, so

00:00:10.354 --> 00:00:16.097
he bought 4 by 2 by 3,
2 times 3 equal 6,

00:00:16.097 --> 00:00:19.750
and 4 times 6 equals 24.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.940
Jonathan bought two of
the three by four cases.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.050
So he bought two times three times four.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.311
Three times four equals 12 and
two times 12 equals 24.

00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:35.360
The sodas group differently, but

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.000
Jonathan still ends up with the same
amount and packs and in cases.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.310
We saw that multiplication
follows the associative property.
