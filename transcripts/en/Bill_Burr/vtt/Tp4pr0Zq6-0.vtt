00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.610
Hey,

It's Bill Burr.

00:00:05.611 --> 00:00:09.390

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.550
I'm checking in on the ladies to make sure that you feel okay,

7
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.530
that you feel like you're in a safe space to listen to this podcast.

8
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.240
Not because I care,
because I want to start trending on Twitter.

9
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.900
<v 1>MMM.</v>

10
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.800
<v 0>Jesus Christ.</v>

11
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.030
Jesus Christ with the award shows in the fucking the same speech given every

12
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.830
awards show,
always called brave as if somebody's going to heckle it.
Okay.

13
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.190
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.640
<v 1>You know,
like somebody that shut the fuck up and get out the shite there,</v>

15
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.610
your log winded jacket.

16
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.640
<v 0>Nobody's going to say that.
We're all going to sit there and be like,
wow.</v>

17
00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:56.280
That thing that was already said was just said again,

18
00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:59.700
but this time it was said even better.
Hey,

19
00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:02.040
keep saying the thing you already said.

20
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.590
<v 3>I want to go out there and say the thing that was already said.</v>

21
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.550
I want to be that person.
I wouldn't be brave.

22
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.710
<v 0>You want to be brave.
You go the other way.
Listen,</v>

23
00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:19.890
I know there's a lot of guys out there took the dicks out at work,

24
00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:21.600
but what about these gold digging whores?

25
00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:24.660
Am I right fellas that now that would be brave.

26
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.590
Be Brave.
Okay.
Yeah,
I'd like to see you fucking walk out of that one.
Yeah.

27
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.780
<v 1>MMM.</v>

28
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.440
<v 0>Saying the thing that's been said that everybody gets,</v>

29
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.060
once again,

30
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.080
we'll be right back with the saying the thing that's always said at everything.

31
00:01:41.081 --> 00:01:45.850
Now award show after these messages,
you know,
people,
while we were away,

32
00:01:45.851 --> 00:01:49.630
something else was said that was already said that needed to be said again in

33
00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:53.050
case anybody didn't hear it the first 19,000 times it was said.

34
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.760
<v 1>MMM.</v>

35
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.370
<v 0>You know,
and like,
I swear to God,
and this is all it does,</v>

36
00:01:57.371 --> 00:02:00.490
is it just causes of copycat fucking behavior.

37
00:02:00.491 --> 00:02:02.080
Same thing with these mass shootings,
you know,

38
00:02:02.081 --> 00:02:05.140
which is why they should report on them because then everybody wants to do it.

39
00:02:05.141 --> 00:02:09.370
Right.
Fucking some chick makes a porn and becomes fucking super famous.

40
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.180
Now every broad out there starts fucking dropping their panties.
I looked it up.

41
00:02:13.181 --> 00:02:16.300
It happens.
Right?
So now fucking Pete is getting into it.

42
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.600
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

43
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.860
<v 0>they're trying to say,
you can't say beat a dead horse and then they,</v>

44
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.690
they came up with all this dumb shit.
There's no fucking way that this,

45
00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:27.380
this can't be coming from Peter.
Like they said,
when it's raining out,

46
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.310
don't say it's raining cats and dogs that promotes violence towards,
it's just,

47
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.283
you know,

48
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:33.683
<v 1>okay.</v>

49
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.840
<v 0>You know,
can you say it's a frog strangler?</v>

50
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.000
<v 1>MMM [inaudible]</v>

51
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.280
<v 0>you can't listen to Christmas music.</v>

52
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.213
<v 1>You know what I mean?</v>

53
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.550
<v 0>They're going to go through all of the catalog now.
That song I really cared.</v>

54
00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:53.230
Stay cause baby,
it's cold outside.

55
00:02:53.231 --> 00:02:58.231
I really can't stay was saying that that promoted some sort of rape or then

56
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.990
don't under the apple tree.
What?
Anyone else?

57
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.480
What me that's controlling.

58
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.170
She can sit under whatever apple tree she wants to.

59
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.660
I think the meeting was that was,
hey,

60
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:15.370
don't go and fucking suck some other Dick while I'm off fighting war.
You know,

61
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.880
fight in a war here defending the country,
you know?
But you know,

62
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:22.060
you couldn't say that back then.
Right baby?

63
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:26.860
It's cold out or is it good?
I really can't stay baby.
It's cold outside.

64
00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:29.680
I got to go away,
baby.
It's cold outside

65
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.940
this evening has been been hoping that you drop in.
So,
but it's,
it's,

66
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.560
it's such a cute fucking SOG.

67
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.080
There's a bunch of fucking songs out there that you could just turn into some

68
00:03:41.081 --> 00:03:45.280
shit.
Right.
Um,
anyways,
needless to say,

69
00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:47.320
that's my new walk on music when I do a stand up.

70
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.193
<v 1>Sure.</v>

71
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.330
<v 0>You know,
it's funny,
I don't even like that song.</v>

72
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.080
It's a fucking Corny God damn song.
I don't even fucking like it,

73
00:03:59.081 --> 00:04:02.740
but I'm such a cunt,
you know?
Actually to be honest with you,

74
00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:07.360
I think there needs to be some sort of turning down the spigot on this fucking

75
00:04:07.361 --> 00:04:12.361
insanity because it's literally 8% of the population is acting like they're

76
00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:15.970
speaking for or evidently babysitting the fucking rest of us.

77
00:04:15.971 --> 00:04:20.050
But like I think I can listen to that song and not rape anybody.

78
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.390
I've done it for 50 years.

79
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.240
I'm going to go out on a limb and to think I'm going to be okay.
You know,

80
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:26.740
this goes like back to when they thought,

81
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.400
listen to Judas priest and all of that Shit,
you know,

82
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.270
made you go out and fucking kill yourself and do all,
which we all know is,

83
00:04:35.271 --> 00:04:39.640
is it really comes down to just bad parenting.
Um,

84
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.520
it is a thing I know most women don't give a fuck about,
you know,

85
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.320
if you put on that song,
you know what I mean?
I know.
Okay.
I don't know.

86
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.850
Was it brave to do what I just did?
That's what you do.

87
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.460
You go on an award show,
you do a fucking tap dance.
Two,

88
00:04:56.461 --> 00:04:57.540
I really can't stay.

89
00:04:57.541 --> 00:05:00.060
And then you come out and you talk about gold digging whores.

90
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.393
<v 1>MMM.</v>

91
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.370
<v 0>You know,
and then you'd try to like,
you go for the,</v>

92
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.500
the anti that crowd.
I bet that could still fill in arena.
Right?

93
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.080
I'm sorry,
I don't,
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about here.

94
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.553
<v 1>MMM.</v>

95
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.160
<v 0>Fucking Peta.
I love animals too.</v>

96
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.780
Did you know how much of a dose you have to be for somebody to be behind your

97
00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:27.840
cause and also to be sitting there going the ace people are fucking assholes.

98
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.163
<v 1>MMM.</v>

99
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.310
<v 0>I think I just described myself as a person because my wife loves me,</v>

100
00:05:33.311 --> 00:05:35.980
but she really seems to side with other people a lot of the times,

101
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.660
<v 1>you know?
Um,</v>

102
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.020
<v 0>so let's,
let's,
let's,
let's plow ahead here into the podcast,
into the podcast.</v>

103
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.220
I want to thank everybody on the Seth Meyers show for having me on.

104
00:05:48.221 --> 00:05:50.290
I had a great time promoting a season.

105
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.920
Three of F is for family as far as I can tell from the tweets.

106
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.440
It seems to be going really well.
People seems to be really enjoying it.

107
00:05:57.441 --> 00:06:00.680
But why wouldn't they?
We already have a great cast.

108
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.480
We already have a bunch of murderers in the writers' room and we added Vince

109
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.010
Vaughn.
That's right.
Spoiler alert.
Listen closely,

110
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:10.844
Vince Vaughn,

111
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.870
you'll hear his voice or the character that he's doing on season three.

112
00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:17.120
And I'm really excited that people are enjoying it.

113
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.320
And I just want to say right now to all the brave people out there that are

114
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:24.440
fighting out there to try and get Netflix.

115
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.760
I just want you to know that your voice is heard.
It's heard by me,

116
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.900
and that there's a bunch of people out there that love you when you try to sign

117
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:36.230
on and just,
you know,
try to stay positive.

118
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.290
Um,
I flew back from New York,
uh,

119
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.320
yesterday and I'm one of those,

120
00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:50.321
one of the rare times of the year where you land over the water on a,

121
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.620
in at lax usually,
you know,
usually the winds coming in off the water,

122
00:06:54.621 --> 00:06:56.270
so you take off and land into the wind.

123
00:06:56.271 --> 00:06:59.420
But this is the time we actually became around landed.

124
00:06:59.421 --> 00:07:03.770
It was pretty fucking cool.
Um,
except was too cloudy for me to see the approach.

125
00:07:03.771 --> 00:07:07.340
You know,
I'm a fucking nerd when it comes to that stuff.
But anyways,

126
00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:11.270
when I was on the plane,
I actually watched the premiere league soccer game.

127
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.950
I watched,
I watched a arsenal versus man United and I gotta Tell Ya,

128
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.920
I really fucking enjoyed the game.
You know,
and I'm starting to understand it.

129
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.680
I saw,
now I understand why

130
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:27.750
one thing was offsite.

131
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.240
Do you know when they all line up and they cover the junk and somebody tries to

132
00:07:31.241 --> 00:07:34.360
fucking bend it like Beckham around them?
You know like that's stupid ass movie.

133
00:07:34.361 --> 00:07:38.170
I never fucking saw they were saying that this,
they scored a goal on that.

134
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.640
Maybe they were off site.
It's basically any party,

135
00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:45.641
a body that could score a goal if it's behind that line on the offensive.

136
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:50.020
If you're an offensive player.
So this guy went to go make a move and it's,

137
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.790
you know,
you lead with your head when you start to run and listen,
I don't know.

138
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.950
You're doing that dance underneath the stick there.
Right.
Um,

139
00:07:58.590 --> 00:07:59.800
so I guess he was offsite.

140
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:04.880
So I guess I understand that it really takes away a lot of the excitement he

141
00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:07.270
should be able to take off a little bit.
Why get it?

142
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.950
Cause they have to stand there and try to block it.
Yeah.

143
00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.980
None of the offensive players,
you know,
they don't give a shit they want.

144
00:08:11.981 --> 00:08:15.580
They're just going to take off.
Okay,
I get it.
Um,

145
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:20.680
but I gotta tell you something bad,
bad,
bad fucking defense in that Goddamn game.

146
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:22.130
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

147
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:23.670
<v 0>You time Arsenal score.
Then they turn around,</v>

148
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.000
they just fucking gave up another one,
that long fucking pass.

149
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.530
I don't know any of the terminology,

150
00:08:28.531 --> 00:08:30.270
but I just know that that that shouldn't happen.

151
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:35.240
Sorry lolly gag and going after the ball and that little cut came running up and

152
00:08:35.241 --> 00:08:39.710
kicked it in with his fucking toe hair.
That shouldn't happen.
Um,

153
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:45.160
but it was a,
it was a great game and um,
I dunno,
I haven't been drinking.

154
00:08:45.161 --> 00:08:46.360
It just made me want to booze.

155
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:48.610
There's something about watching a premier league game at night.

156
00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:52.510
It's always fucking raining.
It's always like misty.
It just looks like,
yeah,

157
00:08:52.511 --> 00:08:57.060
I want to fucking start the fire and drink,
you know,
seven or eight pints.

158
00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.640
Why wouldn't you?
The cell about saying a pint.

159
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.760
You feel like you're a fucking world traveler and you don't feel like you're a

160
00:09:02.761 --> 00:09:05.010
fucking alcoholic.
Speaking of which,

161
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:10.050
I actually watched this thing on youtube called what kind of drink or am I that?

162
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:14.780
I'll be discussing what Joe de Rosa on uninformed the next episode I might

163
00:09:14.781 --> 00:09:17.940
Patrion page and um,

164
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.360
I went and I looked up those alkie questions.

165
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.150
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

166
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.770
<v 0>Cause this guy sounded like me.
Like,
you know,
I can stop when I want to.</v>

167
00:09:25.771 --> 00:09:28.860
I don't wake up shaking and I have to drink fucking booze.
I'm not an alcoholic.

168
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.510
What kind of drink or am I okay.
Are and I answered the questions dude.
All right.

169
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:38.170
Are you an El Co Hall?
Lik Alright,

170
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.970
here we go.
Here we go.
Drug addiction treatment.

171
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.290
Are you high functioning?
Uh,
wait,
I got to see.
Oh,
quiz,

172
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:53.520
alcohol problems.
Screening,
quiz.
Oh boy.
Oh boy.
If I,
okay.

173
00:09:53.521 --> 00:09:58.320
Question.
Wow.
Okay.
Do you sometimes drink more than you planned to drink?

174
00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.380
Oh,
I don't have a plan other than I'm going out.

175
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:07.290
Let's see if I drink it all.
I have only one or two before dinner.
Okay.

176
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.820
I hope any joke I tell tonight we'll be funnier than that line.
No,
that's not me.

177
00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:16.110
I will occasionally skip or delay meals to have a couple more drinks.

178
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:23.240
Uh,
well I've drank for a period where I didn't realize.

179
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:25.760
I mean I drink until I'm hungry,
you know,

180
00:10:25.761 --> 00:10:28.460
and then I can get a slice at the end of the night.
Wait,

181
00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:33.110
sometimes a few with the boys slash girls turns into an entire evening.

182
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:38.340
Well,
I never just go out for a few.
I go out with this specific,

183
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:45.360
um,
I go out to get hammered.
I've been on benders that lasted for days.

184
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.940
No,
I haven't done that.
I mean,
I,
my,

185
00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:52.940
unless you call consecutive nights of drinking,
but I mean,

186
00:10:52.941 --> 00:10:54.730
I sober up and be like,
oh,
what am I doing?

187
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.840
And then the next night I have another one.
All right.

188
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:59.910
Do you sometimes drink more than you planned to drink,
if at all?
Uh,

189
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:04.730
occasionally skip.
Sometimes.
I guess the closest one was,
would be the third one.

190
00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:09.640
C sometimes a few with the boys slash girls turns into an entire view.

191
00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.890
Yeah,
that's fair.
All right,
let's check that.

192
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:14.380
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

193
00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.920
<v 0>Did the end of this quiz.
Someone's trying to make money off of me so you know,</v>

194
00:11:16.921 --> 00:11:19.380
I'm going to flunk it and I need their help.
All right.

195
00:11:19.381 --> 00:11:22.470
Have you ever tried to quit drinking and were unsuccessful?

196
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:28.110
I don't want to quit.
I enjoy an occasional drink.
I've thought about quitting,

197
00:11:28.111 --> 00:11:30.930
but I've just gotten around,
but I haven't got around to it.

198
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.290
I've tried to control my drinking,
but it hasn't worked for very long.

199
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:38.730
I've tried to quit drinking many times.
Uh,
I go on sabbaticals.
I like,

200
00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:43.140
I need to shut it down
and I've been able to do that,

201
00:11:43.141 --> 00:11:48.100
but then I just get bored.
I just get poured and I,
you know,

202
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:50.170
like what am I never going to have another drink?

203
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:55.510
So I guess I've tried to my drinking and it hasn't worked for very long.
Well,

204
00:11:55.511 --> 00:12:00.030
I've gone a year.
Right.
How much time do you spend each week drinking?
Oh,

205
00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:05.050
Jesus Christ.
I don't know.
I only drink on special occasions at,
no,
no,
no.

206
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.440
I only drink on weekend and I drank at least three nights a week.

207
00:12:08.441 --> 00:12:12.250
Now we're getting there.
I drank almost daily.
As soon as I get off work.
Ding,

208
00:12:12.251 --> 00:12:16.840
Ding,
Ding,
Ding,
Ding.
All right.
Do you have an,

209
00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:21.460
do you ever get an urge to drink or a craving for alcohol?
Yes.

210
00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.770
Okay.
No,
I can take it or leave it.
Jesus Christ.

211
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:30.100
Somebody works at a library.
All right.

212
00:12:30.101 --> 00:12:34.540
Sometimes if I've gone a few days without a drink,
I'll get a desire to drink.

213
00:12:34.541 --> 00:12:37.930
Yes.
If I skip a day drinking,
I'll have an urge to drink the next day.
No,

214
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:42.970
I can't wait until happy hour every day.
I'd say to,
uh,
the second one.

215
00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.200
Number five.
Oh,
Billy booze hound.

216
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:50.950
He's almost halfway there.
Right.
How many fucking questions are there?
11.

217
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.630
Do you have to get bored taking multiple choice questions?
No.

218
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:59.440
Do you often miss work or school or obligations that no.

219
00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:05.570
I don't ever remember.
Miss?
No.
I've never,
I've never
now,

220
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:09.370
no.
Never.
I'm a pro.
I wait till after the work's done.

221
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:11.100
Uh,

222
00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:16.100
has your drinking negatively effected your social or family relationships?

223
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.570
No.
I rarely drink enough to become intoxicated.
No.

224
00:13:19.571 --> 00:13:22.030
Sometimes I haven't embarrassed myself while drinking.
Yes.

225
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.770
I prefer to hang out with people who drink as much as I do.
Yes.
To that.

226
00:13:26.771 --> 00:13:30.870
I have lost friends relationship?
No,
it's somewhere between B and C in.

227
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.100
Sometimes I have embarrassed myself while drinking and I also prefer to hang out

228
00:13:36.101 --> 00:13:38.680
with people who drink as much as I do.
Um,

229
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.160
so I guess I picked the worst of the two.
That's only fair.

230
00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:47.410
Have you given up hobbies or activities you used to enjoy?
No.

231
00:13:47.411 --> 00:13:52.390
Alcohol doesn't interfere with my life.
No,
it doesn't,
I think,
am I functioning?

232
00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.960
Does your drinking ever put you in a dangerous situation?

233
00:13:55.961 --> 00:13:59.320
When I drink it's only at home.
Uh,
that's not true.

234
00:13:59.321 --> 00:14:03.430
I have had a couple of drinks at lunch.
No return to work.
I've drank.

235
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:08.410
I have drinking.
I've driven after drinking before,
but I was not really drunk,

236
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.680
bad back in the day before I got arrested when I was 21.

237
00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:14.890
I regularly drive home from the bar.
No,
I don't drive home.

238
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:21.220
So where do I go with that one?
I have driven after drinking before,

239
00:14:21.221 --> 00:14:23.860
but I wasn't,
not really drunk.
Well,
I've done that.
Yeah.

240
00:14:23.861 --> 00:14:25.660
You wait till you're sober.
I'll click on that one.

241
00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.650
Has drinking caused you any persistent health problems now?

242
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:36.640
Uh,
all right.
There we go.
Does alcohol still give you the same feeling?

243
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:42.040
One drink helps me relax.
Yeah.
Three beers used to do it.
Now it takes a six pack.

244
00:14:42.041 --> 00:14:45.130
I changed to liquor because wine wasn't giving me a buzz.

245
00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:49.600
I changed the liquor cause for the out for the calories.
Thought it was,
you know,

246
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:53.000
I mean I know they all have calories but I figured I'm just got a little shot

247
00:14:53.001 --> 00:14:57.890
glass of it's supposed to 12 ounces.
Um,

248
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.660
alcohol still give you the same feeling?
Well,
I guess the closest one had one.

249
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.050
One drink helps me relax.

250
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.490
Um,
but I have changed the liquor cause wine wouldn't give me a buck.
Well would,

251
00:15:10.491 --> 00:15:14.150
but I have to drink too many and then I get like fucking acid reflux with that

252
00:15:14.151 --> 00:15:16.160
shit.
All right.
When you go out.

253
00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:18.323
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

254
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:22.990
<v 0>Um,
without alcohol,
do you get withdrawal symptoms now?
I don't feel any negative.</v>

255
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.940
All right,
so now what does that mean?

256
00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.180
Could you have an a,
you got a moderate alcohol problems?

257
00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:43.350
Well,
I could have fucking told you that.
Um,

258
00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.430
anyways,
yeah,
no,
I've been a,
I've been a good boy.

259
00:15:47.431 --> 00:15:51.150
I haven't drank since the end of fucking November.
I'm coming up on two weeks.

260
00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.700
You know what?
I'm doing it during the holidays and everybody's like,

261
00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:57.030
lane am around,
ain't doing that.

262
00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:01.950
I got to get in shape for this fucking European run that I'm doing.

263
00:16:01.951 --> 00:16:05.910
European run.
Bill,
you don't say I've seen it on your website,
boy.
Oh boy.

264
00:16:05.911 --> 00:16:09.660
A lot of them sold out.
Any chance that he had his second shows in some cities.

265
00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:13.560
Why yesterday?

I Dunno.

I got to pick a team,

272
00:16:38.701 --> 00:16:41.550
but I think it's gotta be them and I'm doing it because I liked the Beatles.

273
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:49.050
Uh,
London,

I love it.

275
00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.760
All right.
Oh,
daddy's going to be over there fucking working.
So,
uh,

276
00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:03.680
yeah,
that's why I cut it off.
I,

277
00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:07.650
I got some sort of fucking issue goes last night I was sitting by the fire with

278
00:17:07.651 --> 00:17:09.510
my wife.
I'd let you know,

279
00:17:09.511 --> 00:17:11.940
put the Christmas lights on the tree and all of that shit.

280
00:17:11.941 --> 00:17:14.580
We're having a great time.
I love the holidays.
So she goes,

281
00:17:14.581 --> 00:17:18.750
you want some eggnog with a little in there,
you know,
she says,
and I said,
Nah,

282
00:17:18.751 --> 00:17:21.480
I'll just take the eggnog.
But I,
you know,
a little bit of a,

283
00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:24.690
what's that shit you put on top of it?
The brown stuff,

284
00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:28.670
not make a little nutmeg on top and I'll be good excuse.

285
00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:30.270
Can't have just a little bit.
I go,
no,

286
00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:35.340
because then I'll want to have a bunch more and then that could turn into a,

287
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:39.030
you know,
me drinking every night for the next week or for the next year.

288
00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:44.520
Just about,
you know,
I'm a habit guy and if I'm not drinking I,
I,

289
00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.250
I'm either on or fucking off.
I be honest with you,

290
00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:52.710
I lost that to kind of just like,
you know,
occasionally have a beer.

291
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:56.430
I have to like be not doing it or fucking doing it now.
I cannot do it.

292
00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.050
I guess
stirfry free time,
man.

293
00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:02.580
I got too much fucking free time.

294
00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:07.213
Um,

295
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:07.760
<v 2>okay.</v>

296
00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.860
<v 0>If I had like an,
you know what,
I need this.</v>

297
00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:14.180
I think the biggest problem with my Busan is,
is I don't,
I,

298
00:18:14.181 --> 00:18:18.860
there's no rules.
That's all I need because with like cigars,
I have rules,

299
00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.670
you know,
as far as to how many I'm going to have a,

300
00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.380
I just have to have rules with alcohol.

301
00:18:24.381 --> 00:18:28.370
So maybe like I was thinking what if like,
uh,

302
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.730
two Saturdays a month,
you know,

303
00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.810
that would be perfect cause then I'd still go out and get to drink cause I

304
00:18:35.811 --> 00:18:40.490
fucking love booze,
but then I won't be like negatively affected myself.

305
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.930
Um,
you know,

306
00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:49.340
I also won't be bored shitless and they also won't be a bloated fuck.

307
00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:52.520
So maybe in,
I feel like in a,

308
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.340
when I do the European tour,

309
00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:59.960
maybe the second to last night just so I'm not hung over for the flight or

310
00:18:59.961 --> 00:19:04.070
whatever.
No,
cause I know me.
Then I'll be like,
oh my God,

311
00:19:04.071 --> 00:19:05.420
this flight's fucking long as shit.

312
00:19:05.421 --> 00:19:09.800
Why don't we just have fucking three doubles real quick and just pass out.

313
00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:14.660
Wake up over fucking Greenland.
It'd be like,
yeah,
fuck.
We only have,
we did man.

314
00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:20.180
Um,
whatever.
I'll figure it out.
I'll figure it out.
Um,

315
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:23.083
<v 2>let's see here.</v>

316
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.730
<v 0>Maybe I'll go to an AA meeting.</v>

317
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:31.080
Every time I go to a fucking AA meeting like Jesus Christ,
he's fucking,

318
00:19:31.081 --> 00:19:32.010
people are crazy.

319
00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.880
I just sit in a bar and drink and I get hammered and then I fucking go home.

320
00:19:38.881 --> 00:19:40.890
That's it.
You know,
there's no cops.

321
00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.610
There's no fucking family fucking coming down there

322
00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:51.000
like these fucking stories.
Um,
there's no blood

323
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:56.400

that George Bush book that I was telling you where it talked about him flying

391
00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:13.180
and all of that shit that was called fly boys,
not flags of our father.

392
00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:18.540
It's fucking hilarious.
I barely,
yeah,
read.
I know it's not a surprise.
Um,

393
00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.690
and I can't even remember the name of the Goddamn book than I fucking red.

394
00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:25.720
That was the one with the George Bush stories that,
but you know,
I,

395
00:24:25.721 --> 00:24:28.680
I didn't feel too bad that I picked the other book too,

396
00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:33.540
cause they're both incredible books.
Um,
all right,
what else do we got here?

397
00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.930
Uh,
let's see.
Award show speeches,
talked about that,

398
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:40.470
or subtle menus at the mayas Christmas tree.
No booze.

399
00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:47.220
Oh,
oh,
whoa,
whoa,
whoa.
I told you,
I'm thinking about switching to smoke in a pipe.

400
00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:51.210
Both my grandparents smoked a pipe and they're dead now,

401
00:24:51.211 --> 00:24:55.470
so I think it's a good note kit.
Um,
I should've been thinking about doing that.

402
00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:59.850
I like it.
I like the whole fucking ritual.
It just seems really cool.
Sit down,

403
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.250
packing the thing,
lighten it,
having to relight it,

404
00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:05.220
pack it down with that little fucking thing,
cleaning it out,

405
00:25:05.221 --> 00:25:10.050
the whole goddamn thing.
Um,
somebody get,
when I was in,

406
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.050
of course,
one of my favorite cities of all time,
Milwaukee,
Wisconsin,

407
00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:16.890
I was there and they gave me a pipe,
you know,
and I just,

408
00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:21.540
I lost the thing and I just recently founded it.
Let me,
let me,
let me see.

409
00:25:21.541 --> 00:25:25.550
I got it right over here next to the ball and like things here.
There's,

410
00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.770
all of my things are out here.
Wait a minute.
With a flare.
It is,

411
00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.700
let's see what I got in here.
Is it just the pipe?
What?
I have the little,

412
00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:37.560
the little packer thing,
like I don't know the name of all this.
I also like,

413
00:25:37.561 --> 00:25:41.550
you know what I like about cigar smoking and,
and also,
uh,

414
00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:44.610
smoking a pipe is,
it's really fucking obnoxious.

415
00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:49.200
Like cigar smoke is just because it's just all encompassing and nobody can get

416
00:25:49.201 --> 00:25:51.360
away with,
get away from it.
All right,
so I've got a pipe.

417
00:25:51.361 --> 00:25:56.160
I have some pipe cleaner and then do I have in here?
Do I have a little fucking,

418
00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:02.070
oh,
I still got to buy the thing to pack it down.
Oh my God.
Dude,

419
00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:04.080
are you serious?

420
00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:09.580
<v 5>I gotta.
I gotta try this fucking thing out,
you know?</v>

421
00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:15.100
<v 0>Oh,
there's a little thing for that,
that I watched this whole thing,
like I,</v>

422
00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:19.740
first of all,
I noticed people who smoked pipes have crazy facial hair.
Like,

423
00:26:19.741 --> 00:26:22.580
I don't know if I'm going to fit in.
Like when I show up and go,

424
00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:26.400
that is a Newbie look at him.
He doesn't look like he,
uh,
you know,

425
00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.610
he's a conductor or something like that.
Now Jesus,

426
00:26:29.611 --> 00:26:32.550
you know what I want for Christmas?
I,
I really have to fucking fix this.

427
00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:36.840
Fucking God damn headphones here.
Why do I do this to myself?

428
00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:43.120
What is,
you know,
it's gotta be this adapter thing.
That's what it is.

429
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.690
<v 6>I just have to buy a nice one.</v>

430
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:48.803
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

431
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.020
<v 6>I'm literally,
I'm handling this right now.
I'm going not right now,</v>

432
00:26:52.021 --> 00:26:54.960
but the podcast is over in a couple minutes and then we have some greatest hits,

433
00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:58.380
another half hour.
So please by all means.
Okay.

434
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:02.070
This is a safe space to listen to a podcast.
Um,

435
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:06.510
anyways,
I,
I'm going,
I'm going to order one of those goddamn things.

436
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:10.920
Then I also got a bunch of nieces and nephews and they're all getting Boston

437
00:27:10.921 --> 00:27:14.280
fucking sports shit.
All right,
I don't want to hear it.

438
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:17.810
Okay.
That's it.
I care

439
00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:20.460
<v 0>about sports.
Therefore you're going to care for two and stuff.</v>

440
00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.870
<v 6>Speaking of which,
let's see when Liverpool's next game is</v>

441
00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:30.350
Liverpool.
Uh,
Liverpool.
Come on.

442
00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:34.970
Cause you know what?
I have the whole fucking month off and by the,

443
00:27:34.971 --> 00:27:39.110
I just be by that I just mean I'm not going to fucking,
oh,

444
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:43.430
it always goes to fucking Wikipedia.
Jesus fucking Christ.
These cunts.

445
00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:49.450
When the fuck did Google become set?
Why do I care?
Why do you care?

446
00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:53.020
Who gives a fuck?
Premier Li,

447
00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:57.580
they go premiere league daily.
Come on now.
Come on.
Gimme a break here.

448
00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:02.770
All right.
They beat Fullam to nothing.
They beat Everton one nothing.

449
00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:07.300
The next game is Saturday 4:30 AM

450
00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:12.230
Jesus Christ.
Fuck.
Am I going to watch that?

451
00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:17.930
They got man United coming up.
That's gotta be a big one.
Sunday the 16th

452
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:23.970
Oh shit.
All right,
well let's see what is,
what step fucking.
That's it.

453
00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:28.470
They play once every 10 days.
I can't be right.
That can't be right.

454
00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:32.281
All right,

455
00:28:32.281 --> 00:28:37.281
I'm clicking on Liverpool three to one stat timeline.

456
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.700
See,
everything's different in another fucking timeline.
What the fuck does it do?

457
00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:46.710
How do,
how do I get scheduled?
All right,
let me hit pause here.
Sorry.
Hold on.

458
00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:50.610
All right.
Yeah.
Did these Games a nice and spread out?

459
00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:55.890
Jesus Christ.
This is fucking easy to follow.
All right,
so what do we got?

460
00:28:55.891 --> 00:28:57.390
They got one on Saturday.

461
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:04.520
Then they got Saturday the eighth and they got Sunday the 16th

462
00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:09.580
then they got the 21st and the 26th

463
00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:15.300
then the 29th oh by,
if I watch all of those games,
I'll be on board.

464
00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:18.940
I'll be on board.
All right.
That'd be great.

465
00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:21.670
<v 0>With Liverpool on,
on one of these tours coming up,
you know,</v>

466
00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.940
I'm also doing Manchester City,
so Jesus Christ,
they'll get a bunch of shifts.

467
00:29:24.941 --> 00:29:25.880
They don't give a fuck.
Right?

468
00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.720
I'm just his stupid yet because then I could give a shit.
Just be happy.

469
00:29:28.721 --> 00:29:31.120
I'm watching.
They won't give a shit.

470
00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:36.270
The perfect scenario would be if I become a Liverpool fan and then they lose

471
00:29:36.281 --> 00:29:38.850
demand city.
Right.
So then like Liverpool,

472
00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:41.590
people will be happy that I'm rooting for their fucking team.
Then man,
see,

473
00:29:41.591 --> 00:29:44.600
won't give a fuck because my team didn't win bill.

474
00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:46.980
I don't think they're going to give a fuck either way.
Hey,
fair enough.

475
00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:50.050
Fair enough.
All right.

476
00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:54.910
<v 6>Um,
anyways,
I'm so psyched to be home.
I'm so fucking psyched to be home.</v>

477
00:29:54.911 --> 00:29:56.470
I have the best fucking life in the world.

478
00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.750
Get married was the smartest thing I ever did,

479
00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:01.810
could skid considering all the pitch and I do about it.
It's fucking great.

480
00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:06.430
I'm going to go inside.
Go have a nice fucking ah,
get out of the garage here,

481
00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.500
calling to get a nice fucking warm meal here.

482
00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:11.890
Sit around the God damn Christmas tree,
right.
Have a good time.

483
00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.630
And in the meantime we're going to be listening to this,

484
00:30:13.631 --> 00:30:16.720

The podcast isn't over yet.</v>

496
00:30:57.851 --> 00:31:00.370
I was supposed to do an inch after the music.

497
00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:04.300
There's gonna be a little clip from one of the uninformed episode three,

498
00:31:04.301 --> 00:31:07.630
I believe from the Patrion page.
Give you a little taste.

499
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.720
They're like a drug dealer will hopefully make you go to the fucking patriot and

500
00:31:10.721 --> 00:31:14.770
listen to the rest of it.
So here it is,

Me Being a dad

503

<v 6>on this one.
I'm not sure.
I don't remember.
All right.
Enjoy it.</v>

504
00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:34.130
<v 7>[inaudible] a bit.
This fall called women's ways.</v>

505
00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:37.350
The trap you,
Dan

506
00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:47.270

507
00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:51.200
<v 0>the beauty.
Awesome joke.
God bless the people that love those things.
You know,</v>

508
00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:55.610
those are the kinds of people that fucking decorate their house on the holidays.

509
00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:59.540
Neil loves him knee as a fucking best and he is going to fucking,
you know,

510
00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:02.430
deck the hall.
She's going to deck the halls.
I'll tell you right now,
Joe,

511
00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:06.170
I'm going to throw up my back pushing my fucking trash cans to the corner

512
00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:10.770
because there was fold with like $300 with the fucking Pumpkin's that she bought

513
00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.120
it for fucking
um,

514
00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:16.250
Halloween and Thanksgiving and it looked great.
Joe.

515
00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:19.250
I like Martha Stewart would have walked in,
she would have been nervous and like,

516
00:32:19.251 --> 00:32:23.030
oh shit,
this,
this chick is coming.
Right.
Then at the end of the day,

517
00:32:23.031 --> 00:32:25.700
they got a fucking,
you know,
they gotta go out to the curb.

518
00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.810
I was sitting there like to,
I never get one.
I'm like,

519
00:32:29.811 --> 00:32:31.160
I'm just going to have to throw it away.

520
00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:34.790
It felt like there was a fucking dead body in there.
Dude.
It was like,
wait,

521
00:32:34.791 --> 00:32:35.750
as much as a person,

522
00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:39.590
I never get one cause I'm gonna am I gonna and then I also never put my up

523
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:42.020
[inaudible] think if you did stuff like that,

524
00:32:42.021 --> 00:32:46.310
maybe you could sleep a little better.
Dude,
listen,
I love nothing more than,

525
00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:48.350
than putting the tree up and decorated for Christmas.

526
00:32:48.351 --> 00:32:49.210
Here's why I don't do it yet.

527
00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:53.570
<v 8>Dolls with balls of Holly follow La la La</v>

528
00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:58.230
<v 0>got balls bells.
What a bells.
Bells that they're like shaped by Holly.</v>

529
00:32:58.231 --> 00:33:02.750
Bells are shaped like fucking people.
They're trying to get the quarters.
We are.

530
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:06.150
Those are army people later on.
What branch they were in.
Dang to Dang.
Dang.

531
00:33:06.151 --> 00:33:09.090
You know those guys at the mall?
No,
that's no.

532
00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:13.920
Holly Bill The fucking Green Shit with the berries on it.
Holly,

533
00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.430
are you saying those ELLs?
Yeah,
they're called bells of Holly.

534
00:33:17.431 --> 00:33:20.820
Like the things that you hang up,
those little bunches of Holly.
Oh,

535
00:33:20.821 --> 00:33:23.390
I always had it.
I just thought it was literally bell's first.

536
00:33:23.391 --> 00:33:26.680
I thought it was balls.
Maybe it means bells go.
I gotta be honest.

537
00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:29.810
I'll shoot it my way through.
I think that's what it is.
Fluid.

538
00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.520
And we've got to look up this fucking Joe is,

539
00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:36.900
has there ever been a fucking show named more perfectly uninformed.

540
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:41.120
I took a wild swing,
but I have a feeling of working title was dumb fucks.

541
00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.420
That's gotta be,
it's gotta be what it is though.

542
00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:49.590
Bells of Holly like,
like,
uh,
like bales of Hay or you know,

543
00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:53.820
what the fuck does,
hey,
you have to do with Holly.
I'm saying it's like the term,

544
00:33:53.821 --> 00:33:57.450
like how you call a thing,
a hay bale of Hay.
All right.

545
00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:02.460
I think you just call it a bell of Holly.
You know,
a Bushel of fruit.

546
00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:06.360
In other words,
you know the everything,
so many shape bushels out there for me.

547
00:34:06.361 --> 00:34:07.920
If you don't know what it means to bill,

548
00:34:07.921 --> 00:34:12.620
you've been sharing your Bushel for years.
Oh,
I had to it.
Ah,

549
00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:16.380
we're both wrong.
Deck the halls with Bose of Holly,

568
00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:32.030
A branch of limb and Ah Dude.

569
00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:34.190
That's where a bow and Arrow comes from.

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:08.940
And then why do you know you're going to fuck her in the air?

594
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:13.190
It's the most wonderful time.

595
00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:15.770
<v 7>Oh Wow.</v>

It's built Burt's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,</v>

598
00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:33.080
December six,
2010 I'll come.

599
00:37:33.081 --> 00:37:36.620
I can't fucking hear myself just going on here.
Hello?
Hello.

600
00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:42.920
Yeah,

What is going on?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello.
Hello,
hello.

601
00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:47.210
All the levels seem right.
The fuck am I doing wrong lately?

602
00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.480
I used to have this shit down.
Well,

603
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:54.080
I hope it's all right because it's late in the day and I have a football game to

604
00:37:54.081 --> 00:37:56.000
watch.
Patriots are playing the jets,

605
00:37:56.001 --> 00:37:59.510
you know those two fucking teams up and talking up out for fucking 19 weeks in a

606
00:37:59.511 --> 00:38:02.000
row.
Uh,
they're playing tonight.

607
00:38:02.001 --> 00:38:04.820
So I gotta fucking hustle through this thing because I'm doing this thing late

608
00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:09.200
cause I just flew back from San Francisco.

609
00:38:09.201 --> 00:38:11.340
I left my balls.

610
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:16.670
San Francisco.
Isn't that all the song goes?

611
00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:21.510
Tony Bennett comes out,
luck be a lady to night.

612
00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:26.270
Um,
that's Frank Sinatra.
Go Fuck yourself there.
Crooner fans.

613
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:31.460
What do think about that during the holiday month,
as you can tell,
I,

614
00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:32.713
um,

615
00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:37.140
I blew out my voice when I was doing cobb's club up in,
uh,

616
00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:41.200
San Francisco.
And,
uh,
I had a great fucking time.

617
00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:46.390
I'm 51 days without drinking and I got to tell you,
that's,
um,

618
00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:50.590
San Francisco was one of those cities that makes you want to drink.
You know,

619
00:38:50.591 --> 00:38:54.910
it was just an awesome city.
You go up there,
uh,
that's two weekends in a row.

620
00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:59.970
I've absolutely loved the city Seattle last week and now San Francisco this week

621
00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:03.010
in San Francisco.
It's really,

622
00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:06.610
I don't know how people stay sober there because every time you walk around the

623
00:39:06.611 --> 00:39:09.970
corner you just see one of those bars.
You know,

624
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:13.900
it's just got that warm old

625
00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:16.361
dingy,

626
00:39:16.361 --> 00:39:20.620
but it's got some character and he just want to fucking go in there and get a

627
00:39:20.621 --> 00:39:24.280
pint and just start talking some shit,
you know,

628
00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:27.910
fucking cold and rainy there the whole fucking weekend.

629
00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.400
So psyched to be back in La those first time.

630
00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:32.800
I've seen the sun in like 10 fucking days.
It feels like,

631
00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:38.770
look at me with the potty mouth this week.
Um,
but anyways,
yeah,

632
00:39:38.771 --> 00:39:42.340
I was up there and I worked cobb's comedy club and I want to thank all those

633
00:39:42.341 --> 00:39:47.120
people who came out to see me.
It was ridiculous turnout.
Uh,
carbs is a,
uh,

634
00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:52.660
it's a giant room for a comedy club and the place was packed the entire weekend

635
00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:56.910
and uh,
it was great.
Everybody was showing up.

636
00:39:56.911 --> 00:40:00.310
A bunch of people came up and told me that they loved the podcast and I had like

637
00:40:00.311 --> 00:40:04.240
five people come up to me and tell me how much they liked the,
uh,

638
00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:09.310
Socorro work.
They love it.
So I'm thinking actually turning that into a bit,

639
00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:11.310
stick it into my act.
Um,

640
00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:14.890
I just don't know if it's gonna work cause uh,

641
00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:18.780
I think maybe if I stick my mouth close enough actually know.
And I listen.

642
00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:22.300
Listen back to the podcast,
it sounded like the,
uh,

643
00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:26.860
it sounded like the same sort of distortion.
I got to try it out.

644
00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:30.150
I really got to fucking try it out.
You know what?
There's a rum out here called,

645
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:34.690
uh,
the comedy union,
uh,
used to be called mixed nuts.

646
00:40:34.691 --> 00:40:39.300
It's called the comedy union is down on Labrea and uh,
well it's awful.

647
00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:43.740
Labrea can't remember.
It's right down the street from uh,
uh,

648
00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:47.980
Roscoe's waffle house,
chicken and waffles.
Roscoe's chicken and waffles.
Huh?

649
00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.610
African-Americans.
You listen to the podcast,

650
00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:56.650
there's a big shout out to that fucking restaurant.
Uh,
but anyways,

651
00:40:56.651 --> 00:41:00.700
it's a club.
Um,
you know,
any comedian can go down there,

652
00:41:00.701 --> 00:41:04.900
but it's a predominantly black audience.
Remember that from the news?

653
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:08.230
They used to say that all the time,
but predominantly black neighborhood,

654
00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:12.880
predominantly black
neighborhoods.

655
00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:15.400
So that's like put the crowds are so whenever I have a joke like that,

656
00:41:15.401 --> 00:41:19.390
I like to go down to rooms like that or maybe do Tuesday night at the comedy

657
00:41:19.391 --> 00:41:23.200
store because I want to make sure that a,
I'm saying the shit the right way.

658
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:24.543
You know,

659
00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:28.930
granted that opens the door to some awkwardness if it doesn't come off the right

660
00:41:28.931 --> 00:41:31.090
way.
But that's the fun of doing what I do.

661
00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:34.220
So may have been going to head down there and speaking Roscoe's chicken and

662
00:41:34.221 --> 00:41:36.650
waffles.
I heard so much about that shit.

663
00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:42.110
A so called white man heard so much about that ship from the predominantly black

664
00:41:42.891 --> 00:41:47.660
comedians
always hyping that place up.

665
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:48.583
You got to go down there.

666
00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.900
You got to go down there and I got to tell you something.

667
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:55.310
I like chicken and I like Waffles,
but I do not like that shit together.

668
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:56.563
All right.

669
00:41:56.810 --> 00:42:01.220
At no point in my life did syrup ever need to touch a chicken?

670
00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:05.540
It's a,
it's fucking gross.
And uh,

671
00:42:05.541 --> 00:42:09.900
I went there once and I'll never go there again.
Was One of those,
uh,

672
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:14.000
you have to go to like a soul food place and it's like fucking like hardcore

673
00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:18.620
African American and you feel foolish as you're ordering cause everything's

674
00:42:18.621 --> 00:42:22.550
named after like some civil rights leader.
Uh,
you know,

675
00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:24.650
welcome to Roscoe's chicken.
Walter's going to take you on it.
Yeah.

676
00:42:24.651 --> 00:42:28.970
Let me get the,
uh,
Frederick Douglas a Chili fries at,

677
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.380
can I get the,
uh,
Medgar Evers,
uh,

678
00:42:33.381 --> 00:42:37.380
at a mommy?
Whatever the fuck.
Um,

679
00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:42.200
you just feel dumb saying so I don't know if it's that bad where the file was at

680
00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:46.790
.
Amy Ruth's,
we're going back in my career here,
back in my career when I used to,

681
00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:51.500
uh,
I used to fucking jump over on both sides of the fence all the Goddamn time.

682
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:54.620
Back in the good old days,
there was,

683
00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:57.770
that was a period in my career where I made sure that I,
uh,

684
00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:03.410
on a regular basis when I was trying to figure out how to say what,
you know,

685
00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:06.470
these glorious Dick Jokes and shit jokes that I do on stage.

686
00:43:06.471 --> 00:43:09.500
There was a period during my career when I would,
when I would,
uh,

687
00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:13.730
I would do all the rooms,
I could get in front of all the crowds.

688
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:14.511
And if you're a comedian,

689
00:43:14.511 --> 00:43:19.100
I suggest that you do that cause it can do nothing but help you.
And um,

690
00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:22.730
you know,
if you're really,
you know what I mean?

691
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:26.540
I learned that shit cause I saw Eddie Murphy on the raw tour way back in the
day.

692
00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:31.340
I saw Rodney Dangerfield,
danger fields.
There was two of them,

693
00:43:31.341 --> 00:43:34.610
Rodney Dangerfield.
And then two weeks later I say Eddie Murphy on the raw tour.

694
00:43:34.611 --> 00:43:36.260
And I was like,
fuck at 18 years old.

695
00:43:36.261 --> 00:43:40.820
And I remember looking at Eddie's crowd versus a Rodney's crowd.

696
00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:45.680
And for some fucking reason that just clicked to me like Rodney's hilarious.

697
00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:49.720
But Eddie is making everybody laugh.
So I remember,
uh,

698
00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:51.770
kind of knew I wanted to be a comedian at that point,

699
00:43:51.771 --> 00:43:56.420
but it took me another few years to get the balls,
you know,
to go on stage.

700
00:43:56.421 --> 00:43:58.550
And then I'll say,
I had this fucking thing in my head that,
you know,

701
00:43:58.551 --> 00:44:00.320
I had to make sure I finished college,

702
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:05.420
got to make sure I got tens of thousands of dollars worth of debt worth of debt.

703
00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:09.500
So then I can then go on stage and talk about my Dick,
right.

704
00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:13.790
To make my life even more difficult.
Um,

705
00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:18.320
look,
I'm not saying whether or not you should go to college or you shouldn't,

706
00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:23.060
but,
uh,
if you will like me and you just fucking knew,

707
00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:27.950
you know,
you looked at standup comedy and you just,
you just fucking knew.
Uh,
I,

708
00:44:27.951 --> 00:44:31.680
I don't think it would be the worst thing if he just said to hell with the next,

709
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:35.160
you know,
$40,000 worth of debt.
But who the fuck am I?

710
00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:38.070
Who am I to say that?
How far are we into the,
ah,

711
00:44:38.071 --> 00:44:41.400
seven minutes in seven fucking minutes.
And I got to tell you,
oh my God,

712
00:44:41.401 --> 00:44:45.210
I'm fucking red line.
And on
the Shittier I'm seven minutes in,

713
00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:47.610
I don't think I have anything left to talk about.

714
00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:49.250
I am so fucking frazzled because I,

715
00:44:49.251 --> 00:44:54.251
I don't know what happens when I fly back on the day of a podcast.

716
00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:57.870
It's just,
I don't have any funny,
is no funny in me right now.

717
00:44:57.871 --> 00:45:00.420
I'm just sitting here like I might as well be on meet the press.

718
00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:05.430
You don't talking about budgets for the upcoming fiscal year?

719
00:45:07.450 --> 00:45:11.670
Uh,
uh,
did anything interesting happened to me in San Francisco?
Of course not.

720
00:45:11.671 --> 00:45:13.200
I wasn't drinking.
I'll tell you that.

721
00:45:13.201 --> 00:45:16.060
I went out and I tried a bunch of food up there and I'll,

722
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:21.720
this is something I can guarantee you.
All right.
If you like a Burrito,

723
00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:24.510
go to San Francisco.
Those guys,

724
00:45:24.511 --> 00:45:28.680
I had a Burrito when I was up in San Francisco.
I've been thinking about,

725
00:45:28.681 --> 00:45:31.650
I'm always fucking thinking about it before even said what I just said.

726
00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:34.050
I've been thinking about this shit.
Like,
you know,

727
00:45:34.051 --> 00:45:36.780
you have of just bang some fucking just,
you know,

728
00:45:36.781 --> 00:45:40.560
some girl you never get to marry,
but she,
I dunno what she does.

729
00:45:40.561 --> 00:45:44.130
I don't want to get graphic.
I try to stay away from the sex ship,
but you know,

730
00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:48.810
and you just cared.
Stop fucking think it and your brain's going,

731
00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:53.400
don't go back to her.
She's out of her fucking mind.
She's like,

732
00:45:53.401 --> 00:45:57.150
that's not a mother.
It's not a mom.
You're not going to marry her.

733
00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:01.530
Don't fucking go back.
But what she did on the other side,

734
00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:05.640
right.
Come on.
We're all adults.
You know what I'm talking.

735
00:46:05.641 --> 00:46:07.140
You can't stop fucking ticket about it.

736
00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:09.900
I had the food version of that and God dammit,

737
00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:14.670
it was a Burrito in San Francisco in like a fucking asshole.

738
00:46:14.671 --> 00:46:17.640
I can't even tell you where I got it.
Uh,

739
00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:22.350
I guess I can go a,
I can go on the Internet here and try and find it.
By the way,

740
00:46:22.351 --> 00:46:25.590
here's a youtube video for you.
I'm a huge Stevie Ray Vaughan fan.

741
00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:28.770
Huge Stevie Ray Vaughan Fan.
And,
uh,

742
00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:33.390
he did a cover of an Albert King Song called,
uh,
a,

743
00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:38.640
I just say any kind of give up on love,
but it's ain't gone in,
give up on love.

744
00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:42.360
Uh,
I'm too white to say it that way.
So I say,
I ain't going to give up on love.

745
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:47.390
And the guy who put it up is a SRV music like Stevie Ray Vaughan music video,

746
00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:51.210
SRV music video.
Um,

747
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:55.200
you put it up like a year ago for some reason I missed it.
And uh,

748
00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:59.190
you gotta see this if you're a fan of guitar playing,

749
00:46:59.191 --> 00:47:02.340
even if you don't like Blues Guitar.
Stevie Ray Vaughn,

750
00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:07.400
he gets like three quarters of the way through his second blistering solo and he

751
00:47:09.691 --> 00:47:12.750
fucking does this little spin move on,

752
00:47:12.751 --> 00:47:17.010
does the fucking guitar straps in unal the guitars behind them,

753
00:47:17.011 --> 00:47:21.810
straps the fucking guitar back on and proceeds to finish the solo behind his

754
00:47:21.811 --> 00:47:22.644
back.

755
00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:26.880
And not only is he playing with the guitar behind his back,

756
00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:32.050
he takes the solo to a whole nother level beyond the Stevie Ray Vaughan level.

757
00:47:32.051 --> 00:47:34.360
He was just at,
it's the fucking,
like,

758
00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:38.080
if somebody could show me anybody who can play behind their back with that level

759
00:47:38.081 --> 00:47:41.530
of passion,
that fucking good.
I mean,
I don't even know if Hendrix could do that.

760
00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:45.250
Hendrix used to fucking,
I mean,
I know Hendrix is a better fucking guitars.

761
00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:48.090
I'm not even going to start that fucking argument.
All right.

762
00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:51.760
That's like compare and Jordan to Coby.
I get it.

763
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:56.440
I'm not even trying to say it before we even have this fucking argument.

764
00:47:56.441 --> 00:48:00.980
Jimmy is,
yeah,
you can't even touch that guy.
But I'm just saying he took that,

765
00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:01.690
that you know,

766
00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:06.690
that stage trick to a whole nother fucking let's just watch it and actually if

767
00:48:07.901 --> 00:48:11.020
you can find me one,
uh,
Jimmy doing it better,
which I'm sure you can,

768
00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:12.580
maybe I haven't looked hard enough.

769
00:48:12.581 --> 00:48:15.970
I'd love to see it because I get fucking chills watching this shit.
So anyways,

770
00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:18.340
I'm going to,
uh,
I'm going to get rid of this screen here.

771
00:48:18.341 --> 00:48:21.880
I'm going to find the name of this fucking burrito place because it was,

772
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:25.060
it was fucking amazing.
Um,

773
00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:28.360
now I can't look for this as I'm doing this podcast.

774
00:48:28.361 --> 00:48:31.320
Isn't this going to get boring for you guys?
Huh?
How's,

775
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:33.470
I'm typing with my middle fingers.

776
00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.970
Cisco Years Funny About People in San Francisco and where every time I go there

777
00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:43.600
is somewhere I either read or somebody tells me that nobody calls the city San

778
00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:48.040
Fran.
And I really want to tell him that nobody I know calls it San Fran.

779
00:48:48.041 --> 00:48:51.550
We just say San Francisco.
We don't call it Frisco either.

780
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:55.570
Like you fucking hit people in San Francisco.
We don't call it,

781
00:48:55.571 --> 00:48:58.780
we just say fe San Francisco.
Go to San Francisco.

782
00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:03.250
I wouldn't say I'm going to shy instead of Chicago would I?

783
00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:06.820
I guess people say shy town.
All right,
here we go.

784
00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:12.250
I am fucking zeroing in where I got this God Damn Burrito.

785
00:49:12.251 --> 00:49:13.200
I'm going to find this.
Somebody,

786
00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:15.640
one of the satellite like the fucking Illuminati does.

787
00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:20.500
You know that when they're staring at you,
watching you fucking rubbing one out,

788
00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:25.930
saving the video.
So if you ever go against,
all right,
it's on,

789
00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:30.760
uh,
you motherfucker,
give me the satellite.
Come on,
give me that shit.

790
00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:34.120
Don't you like how the Illuminati is allowed us to do this too,

791
00:49:34.450 --> 00:49:39.010
so it won't seem as creepy when they'd fucking do it to us.
Is that it?

792
00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:42.070
All right.
There you go.
I got it.
It's on a,

793
00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:44.470
you can't you fucking cunt.

794
00:49:48.490 --> 00:49:53.170
There it is right there.
It's on ninth avenue and Irving Street.
All right.

795
00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:57.400
Just beyond Yancey saloon on that side of the road,
you walk down,

796
00:49:57.401 --> 00:50:01.210
you make a right on nine fucking avenue.
Now we take the little yellow man,

797
00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:05.170
the little Asian Dude,
right?
Is that always supposed to be?
Huh?

798
00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:07.270
Put him down on the street.

799
00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:12.540
Look at me and there's where the fuck I was slowly going down the street isn't

800
00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:16.270
as exciting,
isn't this is what you get when you get a free fucking podcast.

801
00:50:16.271 --> 00:50:19.660
You get absolutely no.
They'll get a poodle that the satellite took a picture of.

802
00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:23.080
You think it's still alive?
It's one of those bigger poodles.
You know,

803
00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:26.320
like the George Meichin have poodles.

804
00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.330
You know those big ones are actually really good at Frisbee.

805
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:32.570
They actually become a dog when they get that big.
All right,

806
00:50:32.571 --> 00:50:37.250
where the fuck is it?
You fucking whore.
Don't be like this.
I don't fucking know.

807
00:50:37.251 --> 00:50:40.820
I told you basically where it is and it's on the fucking west side of the
street.

808
00:50:40.821 --> 00:50:43.320
Anyways,
I had a god Damn Burrito.
I'm still thinking about it.

809
00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:46.700
And here I am in the middle of the podcast doing one of the most boring things I

810
00:50:46.701 --> 00:50:48.650
could possibly do is,
which is search for the thing.

811
00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:50.510
That's how good this fucking Burrito was.

812
00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:55.800
I'm literally stocking it just so I can look on stand outside the window via my

813
00:50:56.541 --> 00:51:00.740
fucking laptop.
Um,
all right.
That was excruciatingly boring.

814
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:05.870
And if this podcast wasn't free,
I'd fucking apologize for it.
Uh,

815
00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:10.880
[inaudible] so,
hey,
I'm going to let her hear for some,
a fan from Alaska.

816
00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:12.760
All right.

817
00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:15.800
Do you ever hear that expression where they say you can't run from your
problems?

818
00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:18.140
Well,
uh,
tell people in Alaska,

819
00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:23.510
because most people up there are wanted,
you know,
and not in a good way.
Mike,

820
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:26.000
we really love you to come back to South Dakota.

821
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:30.920
They are wanted in uh,
one of those,
you know,

822
00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:34.400
those fucking idiots,
those spur of the moment,
bank robbers.

823
00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:39.110
We standing there and the only reason why you rob the bank was because the line

824
00:51:39.111 --> 00:51:43.250
was just long enough to give you enough time to think like,
you know what?

825
00:51:43.251 --> 00:51:46.940
I could always rob this fucking bank and if there was no one in front of you,

826
00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:51.020
you just want it gone in and found out what,
you know,
what your balance was.

827
00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:54.320
But there was just,
you know,
seven people in front of you.

828
00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:58.010
You started working out the whole thing.
You know,
the fuck's going on.

829
00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:59.623
Look at everybody.

830
00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:04.730
We all work every single day in every week.

831
00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:08.030
They give us a check.
They don't give us cash.
They give us a check.

832
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:10.310
They give us these numbers on a piece of paper.

833
00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:12.680
What do we deal with that we take it right down to these clients.

834
00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:17.750
We give them all our money.
You know,
it's,

835
00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:21.080
is this,
I feel like a fucking hooker right now.

836
00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:24.050
I went out and I worked all right.

837
00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:28.580
I get my money in this form of fucking currency that I can't,

838
00:52:28.581 --> 00:52:31.310
I can't even use unless I go to you.
You fucking asshole.

839
00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:32.660
And then you keep the shit.

840
00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:35.390
I got to stick it in there and you give it out to be $20.

841
00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:38.150
If time telling me everything's going to be okay,

842
00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:41.210
I want you to know something.

843
00:52:41.211 --> 00:52:44.390
I would love to go to a bank where they actually had the nerve to walk around

844
00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:47.690
and like purple sparkly suits with big feathers,
you know,

845
00:52:47.691 --> 00:52:50.150
driving Lincoln continentals from 1975.

846
00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:54.080
Just dress like the fucking pimp that you are.
I'll give a shit.

847
00:52:54.081 --> 00:52:57.200
I'll doll myself up to go in there and try and get my money.
You fucking cons.

848
00:52:57.530 --> 00:53:02.120
So anyways,
this is a,
uh,
this is a,
um,

849
00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:05.990
a letter from a crazy Alaskan fan set up.
Bill,
I bought,

850
00:53:05.991 --> 00:53:09.500
let it go on iTunes.
Thank you.
Um,

851
00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:12.170
earlier this evening and had,
uh,

852
00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:17.030
quite the fucking goat rope.
I don't know what that means.

853
00:53:17.050 --> 00:53:19.670
I'm sure that means like,
I was freaking out in Alaska.

854
00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:22.430
I had quite the fucking goat rope.

855
00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:28.020
The fuck would that the Italia go to your cabin up there.

856
00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:33.330
Goats eat everything.
I don't get it.

857
00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:37.560
Crazy Alaskan fan.
Can you please explain that to me?
I don't know.

858
00:53:37.590 --> 00:53:41.670
You had quite the fucking goat rope.
Okay.
That doesn't sound like it was good.

859
00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:47.130
Um,
anyways,
I live out in the middle of BFE Alaska.

860
00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:49.471
I don't know what that means.

861
00:53:49.471 --> 00:53:54.090
Either set up an area or is that bum fucking East Alaska,

862
00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:58.800
I dunno and have no need for the Internet in my Ted Kaczynski cabin.

863
00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:01.550
According to Mark Marin on Twitter,
uh,

864
00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:05.670
Ted Kaczynski is a cabin is actually for sale.
Um,

865
00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:09.510
but I digress.
Here we go.
Continuing my neighbor who is down the road has,

866
00:54:09.511 --> 00:54:11.610
has the Internet and if I sit,

867
00:54:11.611 --> 00:54:16.611
my laptop's sideways facing due south on the very top of my Warren commission

868
00:54:18.301 --> 00:54:19.134
volumes,

869
00:54:19.830 --> 00:54:23.580
I can connect at tip top 1997 speed.

870
00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:28.290
I only do this once a month.
So I went on iTunes and I bought,
let it go,

871
00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:30.120
Joe to roses album,

872
00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:35.570
the depression auction and some Chuck Berry that you got great taste too.

873
00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:39.390
Great Comedians and one of the greatest guitarists of all time.

874
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:46.170
Um,
all right,
Michael Graves.
I Dunno what that,
if I'm saying that right,

875
00:54:46.171 --> 00:54:48.060
and the latest iron maiden effort,

876
00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:52.530
I picked all the tunes out that I wanted sat my laptop on.

877
00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:57.450
It's seven foot perch on its side so I could download,
let it go.

878
00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:59.790
So I let it download all that shit.
All right.

879
00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:04.970
I sat down and out of the corner of my eye I saw Sarah McLaughlin written on the

880
00:55:06.811 --> 00:55:09.600
screen and I immediately thought,
Oh fuck,

881
00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:14.370
I somehow hit the wrong button and I fucking bought some Sarah McLaughlin Song.

882
00:55:15.330 --> 00:55:19.770
Uh,
so I grabbed the for the computer and there it went right down the to the

883
00:55:19.771 --> 00:55:23.610
fucking floor,
seven feet down onto a linoleum for boom.

884
00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:29.100
I started screaming at the top of my lungs about that concern Mclaughlin and

885
00:55:29.101 --> 00:55:32.850
those prick bastards that I tuned for faking me out and making me buy that dumb

886
00:55:32.851 --> 00:55:34.590
shit.
I was really freaking out.

887
00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:39.060
I opened my front door to cool off and they are four feet in front of me was a

888
00:55:39.061 --> 00:55:42.390
big brown bear looking at me like I was some kind of asshole.

889
00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:47.720
I grabbed the door and ran like hell back in liquid lickety split lickety split.

890
00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:51.810
And that's the kind of fucking expression you use if you live in a camp.

891
00:55:52.530 --> 00:55:57.420
Fucking goat rope.
Lickety split.
Uh,
my heart was beating like crazy.

892
00:55:57.570 --> 00:55:58.980
I was surprised to see,

893
00:55:58.981 --> 00:56:01.950
and I walked up to my computer and I was surprised to see that my screen was

894
00:56:01.951 --> 00:56:06.410
okay on the laptop.
It fired right up away.
Holy Shit.
It works.

895
00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:08.670
When I reloaded Itunes I saw,

896
00:56:09.110 --> 00:56:14.040
or Sarah McLaughlin was actually one of the comedy cuts on,
let it go.

897
00:56:15.330 --> 00:56:19.260
Uh,
I let it go.
All right,
you're crazy.
Alaskan Fan,
Pete Jesus Christ piece.

898
00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:23.740
It sounds like some shit I would do.
You guys do that a lot.

899
00:56:23.741 --> 00:56:27.460
Do you absolutely lose your shit?
You know,

900
00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:28.781
you build up some,

901
00:56:28.781 --> 00:56:32.710
some sort of conspiracy in your fucking head and then you realize in the end

902
00:56:32.711 --> 00:56:37.390
that you were actually wrong,
you know?
But in that moment,
you by yourself

903
00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:42.310
and you try to blow it off by turning the car radio on and try to drown out that

904
00:56:42.311 --> 00:56:43.144
voice,

905
00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:47.750
that screaming voice in your head and that feeling of embarrassment that you,

906
00:56:47.751 --> 00:56:52.540
you are actually the Douche bag and then you just wasted the last whatever,
five,

907
00:56:52.541 --> 00:56:53.590
seven minutes of your life.

908
00:56:53.591 --> 00:56:58.180
Absolute flipping out about some shit that you know really didn't,

909
00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:02.770
didn't even fucking happen or maybe some shit that you created.
If you did,

910
00:57:02.771 --> 00:57:05.530
then you can relate to the first 37 years of my life people.

911
00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:10.160
Cause that's what the fuck I did to get my goddamn fingernails.

912
00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:13.700
I need to cut my fingernails.
I've been on the road too,

913
00:57:14.010 --> 00:57:17.860
God damn long get guys who said,
okay,
if I just tap out,
can I just,
you know,

914
00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:20.380
you know what I feel like right now when you guys are at work and you just don't

915
00:57:20.381 --> 00:57:24.760
want to be there.
So then you just,
you start faking sick.
You know,

916
00:57:24.761 --> 00:57:29.200
you get that Douchey look on your face.
You know,
just,
you know,

917
00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:33.910
you just start speaking in a Wayne East.
Suffolk ain't really,
excuse me.

918
00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:38.650
Path.
Excuse me.
Yeah,
I don't,
I don't know if it's something I ate.

919
00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:42.160
I started feeling like this the other day.
You guys have to give it credibility.

920
00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:44.980
I started feeling this way the other day.
Really?

921
00:57:44.981 --> 00:57:48.580
You were pretty fucking chipper when he came walking in,
you know?

922
00:57:49.930 --> 00:57:53.580
Can I tell you guys about that coke head I used to work with a long time ago.

923
00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:57.850
He used to come walking into the warehouse like four hours late on a sunny day

924
00:57:57.851 --> 00:58:02.830
with his hair soak and wet from a shower and his excuse was always the same.

925
00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:06.310
Oh,
the traffic traffic was unbelievable.
Really?

926
00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:11.800
It's fucking 92 degrees out there,
buddy with you're soaking wet hair.

927
00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:13.570
I don't even know if it was from a shower.

928
00:58:13.571 --> 00:58:14.950
It could have been like that drug sweat.

929
00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:19.660
What time I was doing the opion Anthony's show and they had some guys,

930
00:58:19.661 --> 00:58:22.210
some fucking rock band guys in there that were the shit,

931
00:58:22.211 --> 00:58:26.470
I'm not gonna fucking blow up this spot and say their name because it was like

932
00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:28.840
eight 30 in the morning when they came.

933
00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:33.730
And we interviewed him for like an hour and at nine 30 in the morning I asked

934
00:58:33.731 --> 00:58:37.690
the lead singer if I can get a picture with them.
And he goes,
sure.

935
00:58:37.691 --> 00:58:42.691
He fucking pulled me into him and his head's fucking side of his face up against

936
00:58:43.751 --> 00:58:48.340
my side of the face.
And it was just,
I don't know what it was.

937
00:58:49.090 --> 00:58:53.470
Flop sweat,
drug,
sweat,
meth,
sweats.
I don't know what the fuck it was.

938
00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:56.350
But you have,
have you ever fucking played basketball?

939
00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:01.150
And you play shirts and skins and the fatty.
Not only you got to cover the fatty,

940
00:59:01.151 --> 00:59:05.920
but he fucking is skins and they're in their transition games and you fucking,

941
00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:08.770
you're standing there and the paint and that fatty goes running by you and you

942
00:59:08.771 --> 00:59:12.790
feel like,
ah,
like somebody just emptied a Jacuzzi on you.

943
00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:22.290
That's what it felt like was fucking disgusting.
Oh,
wait a minute.

944
00:59:22.291 --> 00:59:27.160
There it is.
There's the Burrito spot.
It's called Gordo,

945
00:59:27.700 --> 00:59:31.530
g.
O.
R.
D.
O.
There we go.

946
00:59:31.590 --> 00:59:36.590
There we go on ninth avenue in Irving.

947
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.260
Just walk North on Ninth Avenue.
Irving street.
Who's the fucking shit?

948
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.140
It's one of those things.
If I was like Elvis Presley,
you know,
hi my ass.

949
00:59:48.141 --> 00:59:52.520
Go get a fucking Burrito,
man.
I'm all hopped up on coil leaves and shit.

950
00:59:52.521 --> 00:59:53.870
I want to fucking Burrito man.

951
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:58.220
I would get him a private jet and Van Nuys and I'd fly like nine of my friends

952
00:59:58.221 --> 01:00:01.970
up who don't really like me and at that point that just there for the money and

953
01:00:01.971 --> 01:00:05.840
they're laughing at all my jokes,
like I'm the funniest fuck or ever,
you know.

954
01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:09.230
Hey man,
where'd you get those shoes at a shoe store.
And they're all like,

955
01:00:10.210 --> 01:00:11.043
<v 2>wow,</v>

956
01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:16.230
<v 9>good man,
you killed us.
The kilos on.
Oh Man.
Everything I say it's funny.</v>

957
01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:20.040
Everything.
Every sing I sing is a fucking hit.
Let's go get a fucking burrito.

958
01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.590
That stewardess,
she thinks she'll suck my dick.

959
01:00:24.490 --> 01:00:28.750
Everybody laughing like sexual sexual harassment didn't exist back then.

960
01:00:28.751 --> 01:00:33.751
If you sold enough fucking records in the 70s sexual harassment didn't exist in

961
01:00:35.091 --> 01:00:37.130
the 60s yeah,
you could just,

962
01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:39.660
you could just rip somebody if you want to hit record,

963
01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:43.530
if anybody complains.
Ah,
pipe down.

964
01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:46.880
How many albums did you sell there sweetheart?

965
01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:50.930
So brutal fucking time to be a female,
you know,

966
01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:55.250
so we had to correct it and the only way we knew we would have known,

967
01:00:56.380 --> 01:01:01.380
we never would have found out if those ladies didn't start burning their bras.

968
01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:06.250
How many of those fucking ex hippies do you think that regret that moment?

969
01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:09.170
Standing in the street?
What?

970
01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:13.090
What exactly was their fucking problem with the Brazil?

971
01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:18.350
You know,
what do you want?
You want your titties hanging down to your waist.

972
01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:23.930
You don't want that.
The number one fucking thing that gets you some shit.

973
01:01:24.370 --> 01:01:27.850
Little things during the course of the day.
Oh Man.
Would you like to go first?

974
01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:31.690
Go ahead.
You think I'm being a gentleman?
I'm not being a gentleman.

975
01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:34.290
It's cause you have perky titties.
All right?

976
01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:38.530
And you have the fucking decency to only button your shirt right up to just

977
01:01:38.531 --> 01:01:42.400
below your cleavage.
And because of that,
yes,
madam,
you can go before me.

978
01:01:42.401 --> 01:01:46.570
If I had a hat,
I would take it off and I would bend over at the waist like,
like,

979
01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:48.520
like one of those three musketeers,
you know,

980
01:01:48.521 --> 01:01:51.910
throw my fucking coat down over a puddle of water.
You know,

981
01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:56.240
there you are ma'am.
Right?
It's cause he had titties.

982
01:01:57.690 --> 01:02:01.610
What keeps your titties perky ladies?
What keeps him?
Yeah.

983
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:05.660
Side for meeting steamed vegetables instead of a quarter pounder with cheese.

984
01:02:05.661 --> 01:02:10.630
Come on.
We all know it's your God damn.
[inaudible].
All right,
Si.
Si.

985
01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.640
Fucking the Sports Bra.
Whatever the fuck you want.

986
01:02:13.641 --> 01:02:16.700
If you want to keep those babies high and tight.
All right.

987
01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.720
I know it's hard for you to hear this from a man.

988
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:23.190
It's coming off showed chauvinist sticker,
right?
But if I was,
you know,

989
01:02:23.191 --> 01:02:27.510
some fucking motivational speaker and I was a female standing up here saying the

990
01:02:27.511 --> 01:02:31.770
exact same shit,
but I had a clam,
you'd be less than,
you'd be listening.

991
01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:37.050
You buy my stupid books and I'd have those fucking arms smart glasses on,

992
01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:40.320
you know,
you know those women dress,

993
01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:44.250
they walked that fine line to have enough business suit on,

994
01:02:44.251 --> 01:02:47.580
but they still look like,
you know,
I'll fuck the shit out of you.

995
01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:52.430
You know that look,
exactly.
Speaking of that,
you guys seen that fucking,

996
01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:56.100
I'm walking around right now.
I gotta stand up.
Let the funny fall down.

997
01:02:56.250 --> 01:03:00.390
Wash over me.
You guys watch that show up.

998
01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:05.130
I don't know what the hell it's called,
but you know what I mean?
That's it's,

999
01:03:05.310 --> 01:03:09.130
it stars this woman.
Um,
it's Kinda like that Shane,

1000
01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:13.530
I'll let show that bald guy screaming about the stocks and he's throwing stuffed

1001
01:03:13.531 --> 01:03:16.080
animals around and for some stupid fucking reason,

1002
01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:21.120
people that I know why people listen because he's loud.
He's passionate.

1003
01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:23.010
I've made a fucking career out of that.

1004
01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:28.470
If you just say my jokes without screaming them and working up a sweat,

1005
01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:29.670
I don't think that funny.

1006
01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:34.493
You know,

1007
01:03:35.790 --> 01:03:39.900
the true masters to build bill Cosby can sit in a lawn chair and killed for two

1008
01:03:39.901 --> 01:03:44.310
straight hours.
I couldn't do that.
Jesus Christ.

1009
01:03:44.311 --> 01:03:46.590
If I sat down for two hours to try to tell jokes,

1010
01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:49.410
just the sound of my own voice with,
they'd put me asleep,

1011
01:03:49.411 --> 01:03:51.930
forget about the fucking crowd.
But anyways,

1012
01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:56.310
so I'm watching the show late night cause I'm not drinking,
you know,

1013
01:03:56.340 --> 01:04:01.340
staying in his fucking hotel down on Jefferson Street and hide the Apocalypto,

1014
01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:04.410
whatever the fuck it's called.
You know,
it's funny.
I think I took a picture too.

1015
01:04:04.411 --> 01:04:08.700
I'm going to put it on the MLM,
podcast.com for some fucking reason.

1016
01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:13.920
Did you guys ever see that movie a Shaka Zulu?
Is that the name of it?

1017
01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:19.080
Chuck a Zulu,
Shaka Zulu Zulu for Hulu,
whatever the fuck it's called,
right?

1018
01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:22.500
It was basically about a,
Ah,
gee,

1019
01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:24.900
I know what the fuck was imposed by an English guys in Africa.

1020
01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:26.250
And they went down there and uh,

1021
01:04:26.251 --> 01:04:29.730
they took over some shit and the Zulu nation and had enough.

1022
01:04:30.810 --> 01:04:33.210
Right.
And they are,

1023
01:04:33.211 --> 01:04:36.350
they all stood on the fucking hill and that the,

1024
01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:41.610
there's slamming their fucking weapons against their,
uh,
their shields there.

1025
01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:46.140
It's the Shit,
you know,
Michael Caine and all those guys,

1026
01:04:46.141 --> 01:04:50.250
remember how they were dressed?
No stupid white hats.

1027
01:04:51.690 --> 01:04:54.810
I don't know what,
I don't know what it looked like.
You know what it looked like?

1028
01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:56.790
Do you guys ever watched bonanza?

1029
01:04:57.390 --> 01:05:01.050
Remember that Guy Hos or that 10 gallon fucking hatchets?

1030
01:05:01.051 --> 01:05:04.170
Imagine if you had that hat,
but you cut the brim off of it.

1031
01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:06.660
He just left that big stupid hat on.
Amy.

1032
01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:11.730
You've got a little bit of a brim on the front and on the back.
Like if,

1033
01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:14.010
uh,
what do you call those?
Those little hats.

1034
01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:18.040
You know those little hats that fucking people were like Charlie Chaplin.

1035
01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:19.390
Just imagine if that had,

1036
01:05:19.391 --> 01:05:22.900
could get an erection right in the fucking brim was the balls.

1037
01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:26.410
So you know that just fucking stay in the same,
that's what the hat look like.

1038
01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:30.670
Okay.
For some fucked up reason.
The,
the,
as I say,

1039
01:05:30.671 --> 01:05:35.671
the guards the do to stand outside on the sidewalk and go,

1040
01:05:36.491 --> 01:05:36.701
hey,

1041
01:05:36.701 --> 01:05:41.110
can I help you with that bag that you obviously carried here with no problems so

1042
01:05:41.111 --> 01:05:45.910
I can possibly make a couple of dollars.
Those guys,
the doorman,
they go,

1043
01:05:46.570 --> 01:05:51.570
they were dressed like those fucking Englishman and Shaka Zulu or chuck or Zulu,

1044
01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:53.950
Zulu,
Hulu,
whatever the fuck it's called.

1045
01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:58.480
I don't know why I thought to need to bring that up.
Let's talk about the hotel.

1046
01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:02.500
They had a wine tasting place right next door,
you know,

1047
01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:05.740
which just attracts soccer moms.
It's fucking ridiculous.

1048
01:06:06.370 --> 01:06:10.240
You know those God damn brides,
when they get older,
they have a couple of kids,

1049
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:12.490
they can't go out and do keg stands with their,

1050
01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:15.220
who ha hanging out of their panties anymore.
They're a fucking mom.

1051
01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:18.220
So they gotta be,
you know,
they've got to be more mature with their drinking.

1052
01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:23.260
So they go out to places like those little,
those wine bars.
Music isn't too loud,

1053
01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:26.890
you know,
it doesn't make their tits quiver.
Right.
So they can sit down,

1054
01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:30.370
sit down with their friends,
they have cheese,
they got wine,

1055
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:34.210
and they could sit there and discuss shit,
you know,

1056
01:06:34.211 --> 01:06:37.780
and act like they're fucking adults rather than just scared teenagers with

1057
01:06:37.781 --> 01:06:42.330
children.
Um,
the fuck.

1058
01:06:42.331 --> 01:06:43.810
So I had to walk by that shit all the time.

1059
01:06:43.811 --> 01:06:46.690
And evidently one of these broads had too much to drink.

1060
01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:50.200
I don't know what somebody's fucking yakked on my floor.

1061
01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:54.430
It was cleaned up before I got there,
but she know that,
you know,

1062
01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:57.790
once somebody pukes them as just going to be there,
it's going to be there for,

1063
01:06:57.791 --> 01:07:02.680
we need,
you need a new rug.
Who's Ken Hill?
All right.
Few puke enough.

1064
01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:05.800
They really need to tear down the building.
So anyways,

1065
01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:09.370
I know how I got on that fucking subject,
but this is good man.

1066
01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:14.200
It got a little bit of momentum.
I stood up filling.
All right.
All right.
Oh,

1067
01:07:14.201 --> 01:07:15.250
I know what I was talking about.

1068
01:07:15.251 --> 01:07:19.450
I was talking about that lady I was watching on the show.

1069
01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:22.250
So,
uh,

1070
01:07:23.070 --> 01:07:26.170
I'm not drinking saw back in the hotel where the dude's address,

1071
01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:30.190
like the fucking apartheid Englishman at the door and somebody yakked on my

1072
01:07:30.191 --> 01:07:33.040
floor.
I'm sitting there watching this fucking show.
That's how I got there.

1073
01:07:33.041 --> 01:07:33.580
All right,

1074
01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:38.580
so I'm watching the show and a flipping through the channels and watching TV and

1075
01:07:39.761 --> 01:07:43.510
I'm flipping through the fucking channels.
I'm losing all my goddamn bet.

1076
01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:46.710
Someone one in three this week.
Um,

1077
01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:50.590
and I'm flipping through the fucking channels and I stop on this show

1078
01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:54.340
and it's this lady,
I don't know what her deal is,

1079
01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:58.840
but like adults call her up and say,
I want to buy this.

1080
01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:02.110
Can I afford it?
You know,

1081
01:08:03.130 --> 01:08:07.520
like they're fucking eight years old
just calling.
Hey isn't,

1082
01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:08.890
isn't this is jail.

1083
01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:12.490
I'm counting from Arkansas for thoughts will tell you I love your show.

1084
01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:17.270
I absolutely love it.
Me and my husband,
we it all the time.
We absolutely love it.

1085
01:08:17.271 --> 01:08:18.980
We think you're great.
And you know,

1086
01:08:18.981 --> 01:08:21.920
a lot of people probably think that you put too much bleach in your teeth,

1087
01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:24.950
especially with that orange fake Tan,
you know,

1088
01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:29.180
so you look like that fucking plant in little shop of horrors.
But that's not me.

1089
01:08:29.181 --> 01:08:33.200
I think you look great,
right?
They go through all that bullshit.

1090
01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:35.420
So this bitch calls up and go,
why do I say that?

1091
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:40.280
I never talked to women that way.
So this lady says,
I want a fucking,

1092
01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:44.150
uh,
I want,
I want to buy a,
I want to buy a fucking condo down in Florida.

1093
01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:47.600
Do I have enough money?
Y'All haven't,
can I afford it?

1094
01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:51.140
That's what the fuck she said called up.

1095
01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:54.710
This complete fucking stranger says,

1096
01:08:54.711 --> 01:08:59.711
I want to buy a condo and as this other fucking complete fucking strange,

1097
01:09:00.021 --> 01:09:03.800
can I afford it?
It's like,

1098
01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:09.980
did you mail this woman all your bank records like five fucking years ago and

1099
01:09:09.981 --> 01:09:13.520
you haven't,
you have no fucking idea how much money you have.
You dumped cons,

1100
01:09:15.830 --> 01:09:20.060
Jesus,
and what the whole fucking hour was.
Hey,

1101
01:09:20.061 --> 01:09:23.930
my name's Mike call calling in from Rhode Island.
Let's shit.

1102
01:09:24.290 --> 01:09:27.080
I want to get a tattoo on my fucking ball bag,

1103
01:09:27.230 --> 01:09:30.470
but I also want to cut out the ropes so I can get t tarps.

1104
01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:34.850
Oh my fucking 85 rally sport.
Can I afford to do that?

1105
01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:39.410
That's what the show was.
This woman telling adults

1106
01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:43.370
who had jobs and lives and probably children,

1107
01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:48.200
whether or not they could afford something.
It just really was.
You know,

1108
01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:51.890
I was one of those times where it's just like,
you know what,

1109
01:09:51.891 --> 01:09:55.520
there's not enough lightning in the world.
You know?

1110
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:58.070
Just as far as the odds of being struck by lightning.

1111
01:09:58.070 --> 01:10:02.330
We need to bring that average up because the amount of fucking morons out there

1112
01:10:02.331 --> 01:10:05.990
versus actually intelligent people,
you're going to hit a fucking moron,

1113
01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:10.640
you know basically going to hit a moron or are you going to hit the ocean?

1114
01:10:10.670 --> 01:10:13.190
Those are going to be the top two in that order.

1115
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:17.270
Even though the fucking world is three quarters fucking water,

1116
01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:22.340
you still got a higher chance as lightening to fucking hit a moron.
That's that.

1117
01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:23.150
That's,
I'm telling you.

1118
01:10:23.150 --> 01:10:26.180
That's my goddamn theory and that's what I want the new stat to be.

1119
01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:29.390
Rather than being like,
you know the,

1120
01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:32.780
the odds of getting hit by lightning or higher of then blah,
blah,
blah.

1121
01:10:32.810 --> 01:10:36.090
I want it to turn into,
I want so much lightening that,
that,

1122
01:10:36.091 --> 01:10:40.820
that the new stat is the odds of an intelligent person actually being hit by

1123
01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:43.430
lightning are x,
y,
and Z.

1124
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:46.550
Do you like how in my own little style and esque world that I'm actually

1125
01:10:46.551 --> 01:10:50.000
intelligent and everybody else is just a sea of morons?
Huh?

1126
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:53.390
You don't have thoughts like that.
Murderous thoughts.

1127
01:10:55.100 --> 01:11:00.100
I was actually talking to this broad up in San Francisco and

1128
01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:09.070
I got this whole chunk about hitting women that I've been doing on stage and uh,

1129
01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:13.010
it's actually something embarrassing I have to admit about myself as much as I,

1130
01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:14.970
the,
the comedy thing for a living.

1131
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:19.000
I'm really bad at picking up on sarcasm.

1132
01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:25.200
I'm just,
I don't know why I use sarcasm.
I'm sarcastic,
right?

1133
01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:31.410
But for some reason when someone uses it against me,
I,

1134
01:11:32.230 --> 01:11:34.120
I've just like that old guy downstairs.

1135
01:11:34.121 --> 01:11:37.860
But if I told you that shit last year when I was dragging my Christmas tree down

1136
01:11:37.861 --> 01:11:42.490
the stairs,
he stuck his head out the window and he just goes,
beautiful morning,

1137
01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:46.950
isn't it?
And he had this fucked up look on his face,
but he said,

1138
01:11:46.951 --> 01:11:51.380
beautiful morning,
isn't it?
So I was confused and I just want,
yeah,
yeah,

1139
01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:54.460
there's a beautiful morning.
I'll pick a,
why is he yelling with that,

1140
01:11:54.461 --> 01:11:57.250
twist that up,
look in his face.
And then I walked around the corner.
I was like,

1141
01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:00.910
oh,
he didn't mean it.
He,

1142
01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:04.110
what he really meant was she making a lot of fucking noise ruining this

1143
01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:08.370
beautiful morning.
So he got me.
Then I always end up feeling stupid.
So you know,

1144
01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:11.160
I'm doing this whole chunk on hitting the broads over there.
Right.

1145
01:12:12.250 --> 01:12:17.020
And I'm standing afterwards whoring myself out,
right.
Sell on my DVD,

1146
01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:19.210
shown a little bit of leg doing what I gotta do.

1147
01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:24.590
And this fucking woman is walking out and her husband is sort of shuffling her

1148
01:12:24.591 --> 01:12:28.200
out and she starts going,
ah,

1149
01:12:29.670 --> 01:12:34.080
oh yeah,
she,
she has once again the twist it up,
look on her face.
She goes,

1150
01:12:34.081 --> 01:12:37.470
thanks for the domestic violence jokes.
I really appreciated it.

1151
01:12:37.530 --> 01:12:40.110
I really appreciated the domestic violence jugs.

1152
01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:43.380
Thanks a lot for the domestic violence jokes.
That's what she was doing.

1153
01:12:44.170 --> 01:12:48.790
And because she was saying thanks,
it just,
it went totally pass my head.

1154
01:12:49.150 --> 01:12:52.510
I was more just confused by her facial expressions.
So she said,
oh yeah,

1155
01:12:52.511 --> 01:12:56.890
I really appreciated it.
Thanks a lot.
I'm literally just waving,
gone.
Alright,

1156
01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:58.360
glad you enjoy the show.

1157
01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:03.040
Which is funny because it probably pissed her off more,

1158
01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:07.750
but I was sincerely thanking her completely missing her sarcasm.

1159
01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:11.020
What she was really saying was ivy the dealt with that personally,

1160
01:13:11.021 --> 01:13:15.130
or that's happening to somebody right now or has happened to someone or I grew

1161
01:13:15.131 --> 01:13:16.210
up with it or whatever,

1162
01:13:16.450 --> 01:13:19.270
and you brought up bad memories and you ruined my fucking evening.

1163
01:13:19.890 --> 01:13:22.710
That's what she was really saying.
But of course I took it at face value,

1164
01:13:22.711 --> 01:13:24.030
which actually when I look back on it,

1165
01:13:24.031 --> 01:13:26.520
I think makes it even funnier because who's kidding who?

1166
01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:31.050
She already thinks I'm a fucking moron at that point,
you know?

1167
01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:37.280
So it would actually would have made her a little bit happier if I tried to

1168
01:13:37.931 --> 01:13:38.980
appear intelligent.

1169
01:13:39.690 --> 01:13:42.310
<v 10>If like actually you missed the point of the Geo Code.</v>

1170
01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:47.110
It was really trying to do is expose the hypocrisy of some of the relationships

1171
01:13:47.111 --> 01:13:50.200
between the male and female fixes.
If I went that route,

1172
01:13:51.730 --> 01:13:54.430
<v 9>you know?
Yeah.
Then she could have gotten this hot.</v>

1173
01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:58.900
But the fact that I literally was the moron that she thought I was,

1174
01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:03.210
and then that there was this whole line of people,
you know what,

1175
01:14:03.211 --> 01:14:06.510
I just realized I should be struck by lightning.
Where the fuck is wrong with me?

1176
01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:11.380
I'm one of those fucking morons.
Um,
all right,

1177
01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:15.610
so there's that portion of the fucking program that's 36 minutes.
Do it.

1178
01:14:15.611 --> 01:14:17.740
I'm not this,
no way.
I'm going more than 50 minutes.

1179
01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.250
I gotta make a judgment call here.
Like,
uh,

1180
01:14:21.250 --> 01:14:24.190
I'm trying to find some friends where I can watch his patriots jets game.

1181
01:14:24.430 --> 01:14:25.263
Cause I,
I,

1182
01:14:25.530 --> 01:14:30.530
I can't go out and watch just regular games at a sports bar unless it's a team I

1183
01:14:30.611 --> 01:14:31.540
don't give a fuck about.

1184
01:14:31.541 --> 01:14:35.380
But there's no way a game like this that I care so much about.

1185
01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:40.540
Um,
I know too,
a lot of people,
this is going to be a huge fucking game,

1186
01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:44.680
which obviously it is,
but I gotta be honest with you.
I,
I,

1187
01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:49.630
I'm not feeling our defense.
I really want to talk some shit,

1188
01:14:49.631 --> 01:14:54.010
but I gotta be honest with you.
Okay?
You guys want to hear my big prediction?

1189
01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:57.040
I'm going to go on a limb here rather than all these other fucking assholes who

1190
01:14:57.410 --> 01:15:00.330
email me after the game and don't make any sort of predictions.

1191
01:15:00.331 --> 01:15:02.590
This is my prediction.
I think

1192
01:15:04.570 --> 01:15:07.030
obviously you guys know I don't like our fucking defense,

1193
01:15:07.031 --> 01:15:09.520
but I got up and I gotta tell you this,

1194
01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:14.940
we have no fucking pass rush and the jets haven't fucking incredible offensive

1195
01:15:14.981 --> 01:15:19.510
line.
Those guys are the shit.
So what's his face?

1196
01:15:19.511 --> 01:15:22.830
Sanchez is going to be sitting back there like bill Cosby doing a standup

1197
01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:25.000
special.
Um,

1198
01:15:26.170 --> 01:15:30.130
and then you combine the fact that we have a shit defense that lets up 24 to 30

1199
01:15:30.131 --> 01:15:33.400
fucking points a game.
I don't like that aspect of it,

1200
01:15:33.610 --> 01:15:36.550
but I believe in our offense.
I think our offense is great,

1201
01:15:36.970 --> 01:15:38.970
but they have a great defense.
So I dunno,

1202
01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:42.640
I just really see this being one of those 28 to 17,

1203
01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:46.810
you know,
don't listen to my gambling tips,
but if I was gambling,

1204
01:15:46.811 --> 01:15:50.620
I actually had to put money on this.
It was my last fucking 100 bucks.
I would,

1205
01:15:50.890 --> 01:15:53.840
I would take the jets in the fucking points.
But,
uh,

1206
01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:56.910
but if the Patriots to win because we got fucking Tom Brady,

1207
01:15:56.940 --> 01:16:01.940
we have the genius of Bill Belichick who can somehow figure out a way during the

1208
01:16:02.651 --> 01:16:06.790
second half to come back.
I think,
uh,
even if they win,

1209
01:16:06.850 --> 01:16:09.910
I still don't think it means shit other than that.

1210
01:16:09.911 --> 01:16:14.800
We've come a long way since September,
but we'd still have to,
I think write,

1211
01:16:14.801 --> 01:16:18.400
we'd still have to play
the J.
I don't know.

1212
01:16:18.401 --> 01:16:23.140
Then if the playoffs came around,
I had a play offs.
I don't know.
I don't know.

1213
01:16:23.141 --> 01:16:27.580
This game is going to be fucking awesome.
Plus you also got to look at,
but uh,

1214
01:16:27.610 --> 01:16:32.290
Rex Ryan has Buddy Ryan at his fingertips,
so this doesn't,

1215
01:16:32.291 --> 01:16:33.790
this is going to be a fucking awesome game.

1216
01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:39.460
This is really going to be an awesome game and I am going to age at least eight

1217
01:16:39.461 --> 01:16:41.740
fucking years.
I'm not going to be able to handle it.

1218
01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:45.550
Like I gotta tell you some games like this,
how fucking psycho I get.

1219
01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:47.350
Like I give a shit so much.

1220
01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:52.060
Sometimes I taped the game and I don't even watch it.

1221
01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:56.500
And then I just find out if my team wins,
then I'll sit down and watch it.

1222
01:16:56.501 --> 01:16:57.370
But if they lose,

1223
01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:01.210
I just fucking erase the game because that's how much it affects me,

1224
01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:05.890
you know?
And I know what you think.
Oh,
what are you a fucking pussy?
Yes.

1225
01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:09.830
I don't know if I'm pushing you from fucking intelligent,
it's like I don't want,

1226
01:17:09.831 --> 01:17:13.460
I don't want to waste that amount of my fucking life.

1227
01:17:13.461 --> 01:17:17.990
I don't want to care that much in it,
but I do.
So I tried to protect myself.

1228
01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:23.720
Oh,
so let me tell you guys about San Francisco.
If you go into San Francisco,

1229
01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:29.180
if you're going to San Francisco,
um,

1230
01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:33.860
here's some shit to know.
Uh,
their public transportation system takes,

1231
01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:36.980
it takes a minute to kind of get to figure it out.

1232
01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:41.870
They have like all these different subway lines that they're like street cars

1233
01:17:41.871 --> 01:17:46.160
and then they go under ground.
They all sort of funnel inter down there.

1234
01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:50.150
The Union Square area,
the Union Square area,
as far as I can tell,

1235
01:17:50.151 --> 01:17:51.590
is the most touristy fucking place.

1236
01:17:51.591 --> 01:17:56.591
Like the Times Square of San Francisco in that,

1237
01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:59.840
I don't think anybody from San Francisco goes there.

1238
01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:02.830
I think people from Oakland go in it.

1239
01:18:03.070 --> 01:18:05.810
Douche bags like me go down there before they figure out like,
oh,

1240
01:18:05.811 --> 01:18:09.650
this place sucks.
But,
uh,
I actually,
uh,

1241
01:18:10.730 --> 01:18:13.580
if the line's not too long and you can jump on one of those rice,

1242
01:18:13.581 --> 01:18:18.581
a Roni trolleys and he can go all the way up to fucking north beach and hang on,

1243
01:18:18.981 --> 01:18:23.630
who do we got here?
Ah,
Jesus.
He says the guy's calling about the game.

1244
01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:27.830
Hey Ben,
I'm doing my podcast.
Let me call you back in like 20 minutes.
All right,

1245
01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:34.070
right.
Cool.
Um,
all right.

1246
01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:36.830
Yeah.
So I don't know if you go there with your girl,

1247
01:18:36.831 --> 01:18:39.020
there's all the shops at down there,
so you're gonna want to go,

1248
01:18:39.170 --> 01:18:41.300
they already told you where to get a burrito.
Actually,

1249
01:18:41.301 --> 01:18:44.690
if you just want to go to Burrito ground central,
go to go to a,

1250
01:18:44.691 --> 01:18:45.740
the mission district.

1251
01:18:46.610 --> 01:18:49.340
And this is just for people if you're going to San Francisco.

1252
01:18:49.341 --> 01:18:51.440
And then there's just all kinds of fucking awesome bars.

1253
01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:55.070
And I actually was staying.
Uh,
you know what?

1254
01:18:55.071 --> 01:18:58.730
It fucking rained the entire time I was there.
Where else did I go?

1255
01:18:58.731 --> 01:19:02.210
I got some decent Italian food.
I went to that place,
Mama's for breakfast.

1256
01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:03.770
I wasn't really impressed,

1257
01:19:03.771 --> 01:19:06.260
but I got French toast and I figured most people don't.
You know,

1258
01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:08.810
something that's something that a lot of people don't know how to make.

1259
01:19:08.811 --> 01:19:10.900
I can actually make better French toast then.

1260
01:19:10.901 --> 01:19:15.560
Most of the fucking assholes out there.
You know,
they just don't do it right.

1261
01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:19.820
They just don't fucking do it right.
The bread just doesn't taste right.

1262
01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:25.400
I go old fashioned way.
My mom used to make it,
you know,

1263
01:19:26.090 --> 01:19:28.820
he actually use white bread that Wonderbread shit.

1264
01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:32.060
And I know it's a lower quality meat,
a fucking bread than they use.

1265
01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:35.360
But I'm telling you,
sometimes you can overthink something.

1266
01:19:35.490 --> 01:19:38.390
He get to fucking fancy.
Like I'll tell you right now,

1267
01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:42.230
you go out and make yourself a fried egg.
You fried up and butter.
All right.

1268
01:19:42.231 --> 01:19:43.900
Fuck the surgeon general.
Every once in a,

1269
01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:48.420
you got to tell that guy to stand the fuck down.
All right,

1270
01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:53.480
sit down.
Oh man,
I'm cooking this shit and butter,
right?

1271
01:19:54.710 --> 01:19:57.320
You stupid fucking half a beard,

1272
01:20:00.070 --> 01:20:04.940
sergeant general looks like he already fucking die.
Did he die?
We had that like,

1273
01:20:04.941 --> 01:20:09.000
like he was the commander in chief of all love boats.
Steph fucking uniform.

1274
01:20:10.110 --> 01:20:13.920
Um,
so whatever you fry it up in butter.
All right.

1275
01:20:13.921 --> 01:20:17.550
You Cook it over Eg.
Take it easy.
All right.

1276
01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:21.110
Cook it over easy.
I don't know how to fuck you guys do a porn.

1277
01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:25.200
I do something over easy.
I fucking uh,
I turned the egg once.
All right,

1278
01:20:25.201 --> 01:20:29.130
after I cook the fucking egg and I get it to the consistency.
I want what?

1279
01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:30.780
I cook it on low heat too,
by the way.

1280
01:20:30.810 --> 01:20:34.660
Russia cooked Christ your cook the shit out of it.
Um,

1281
01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:40.440
you cook it on a low heat,
right?
And then once you do is once you get it,

1282
01:20:40.441 --> 01:20:42.240
look in the way you want it to look.
Y'All see,

1283
01:20:42.290 --> 01:20:45.390
you put your salt and pepper on the top right as it's fucking cooking in the

1284
01:20:45.391 --> 01:20:50.280
butter.
Then you flip it over and the second you flip it over,

1285
01:20:50.281 --> 01:20:55.140
you take it off the heat.
All right?
And you let,
how hot the uh,

1286
01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:58.260
the pan already is cooked the other side.
All right,

1287
01:20:58.261 --> 01:21:01.140
so almost like marketing stake.
That's how you do the other side.

1288
01:21:01.141 --> 01:21:04.470
That way you get the,
you know the egg isn't runny,
you know,

1289
01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:07.740
but you still got the yolk there.
All right?
Oh,

1290
01:21:07.741 --> 01:21:11.100
that's how I make an egg over easy.
But if I'm making a fucking fried egg,

1291
01:21:11.130 --> 01:21:14.520
you know,
you got to cook a thing over hard.
Same Shit.
You're cook it in butter.

1292
01:21:14.670 --> 01:21:18.560
Sit the fuck down old man.
He kicked you cook it in butter and he'd do that.

1293
01:21:18.561 --> 01:21:21.640
All that bullshit and he just,
you want wonder bread.

1294
01:21:21.700 --> 01:21:25.130
Do you want the shittiest fucking bread ever?
All right.
That kind of shit.
It's,

1295
01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:29.170
you're not going to digest.
He like 62 slices a bread.
All right,

1296
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:31.530
you salt and pepper.
That bitch.
She cook it and fucking butter.

1297
01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:34.950
You put it on the God damn sandwich and he put a little mustard on top of it.

1298
01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:38.340
Nothing fucking fancy that,
that grey poupon shit.

1299
01:21:38.341 --> 01:21:43.110
I'm talking broke ass white trash.
Fucking my mustard.
All right.

1300
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:48.750
Yellow plastic container comes out yellow like mustard.

1301
01:21:48.751 --> 01:21:53.480
Should be not that golden shit.
None of that stuff.
Straight up.
All right?

1302
01:21:55.770 --> 01:21:56.820
You fucking,
you know,

1303
01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:01.890
put that bitch on a plate and you go to Tom's delicious,

1304
01:22:02.610 --> 01:22:06.960
straight up fucking comfort food,
all those fucking places.

1305
01:22:06.961 --> 01:22:10.980
I don't know why they don't just make shit like that.
Just,
you know,

1306
01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:14.790
it's like the Mcdonald's concept,
but you actually use sort of real food.

1307
01:22:15.730 --> 01:22:16.561
I was speaking to that,
you know,

1308
01:22:16.561 --> 01:22:19.680
when I was walking through Haight Ashbury or the hate,

1309
01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:22.530
you don't want to get a fucking look like,
oh,
you're a tourist.
Just say,

1310
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:25.380
I want to go to the hate.
How did we get to the hate?
Right?

1311
01:22:25.470 --> 01:22:28.140
You go to fucking in that.
I don't,
what the fuck?
I still feel stupid saying that.

1312
01:22:29.170 --> 01:22:31.110
Uh,
but you go out there,
you know,

1313
01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:34.630
and that's where all the dirty white people are,
Amy,

1314
01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:39.240
and can you spirits from fucking change me in?
They got dreadlocks and shit.

1315
01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:40.103
You know,

1316
01:22:40.150 --> 01:22:44.160
they're dirty fucking wrangler jeans from sitting on the fucking sidewalk.

1317
01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:46.900
I really am reverse racist when it comes to fucking

1318
01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:52.260
white homeless people,
you know?
Okay.

1319
01:22:52.261 --> 01:22:56.790
If you're white and you're fucking homeless and you're under the age of 62

1320
01:22:56.791 --> 01:23:00.510
you're not getting a fucking dime out of me.
You're just not unless you,

1321
01:23:00.690 --> 01:23:04.620
maybe if you're a female,
then he got that look.
You know you've got that right.

1322
01:23:04.621 --> 01:23:09.160
Look,
I'll do it,
you know?
But other than that,
it's like,
come on man,

1323
01:23:09.161 --> 01:23:12.850
seriously get a fucking job.
You're a fucking white tube.

1324
01:23:12.851 --> 01:23:17.140
Go get a fucking job.
I really should be making those jokes in this economy.

1325
01:23:17.141 --> 01:23:20.740
I apologize,
but you know what I'm saying?
All right,
talking about,

1326
01:23:20.741 --> 01:23:21.700
I'm not talking about you.

1327
01:23:21.790 --> 01:23:24.430
If you're out of work right now and you looking for a job,
hang in there.

1328
01:23:24.431 --> 01:23:27.340
I fucking respect.
You're right.
But I'm talking about those other bumps.

1329
01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:32.170
Talking about bumps in their twenties all right,

1330
01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:35.350
this is a deal.
If you're white,
if you look like boxcar Willie,

1331
01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:39.070
you know you've got to stick with that little current chief tad to it.

1332
01:23:39.071 --> 01:23:42.070
I'll give you some money.
You know,

1333
01:23:42.450 --> 01:23:45.850
if you can stick him knows in your mouth because you don't have any fucking

1334
01:23:45.851 --> 01:23:50.350
teeth,
I'll give you some money,

1335
01:23:51.970 --> 01:23:55.690
you know?
But as far as the rest of the people go,

1336
01:23:56.260 --> 01:23:59.920
you get money out of me.
If you look like you're sober,
other than that,

1337
01:23:59.950 --> 01:24:02.650
you can go fuck yourself,
whatever.
Hap Who,
what,

1338
01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:04.630
who does shit like this and December,

1339
01:24:04.990 --> 01:24:08.050
this is what all saint nick is coming down the fucking tube.
Right?

1340
01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:13.960
Oh,
you better watch out.
You better not cry.

1341
01:24:13.961 --> 01:24:18.961
You better not pout up telling you why Santa Claus is coming to town.

1342
01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:24.850
Um,
you know,
did I tell you guys,
I went up to a,

1343
01:24:24.851 --> 01:24:28.150
I went to this observatory and I was looking at stars the other night cause I'm

1344
01:24:28.151 --> 01:24:31.240
not fucking drinking and I'm desperately trying to fill these hours.

1345
01:24:31.630 --> 01:24:34.930
When I used to have fun in my life and uh,

1346
01:24:34.931 --> 01:24:38.510
I was looking at the moons of Jupiter and uh,

1347
01:24:38.530 --> 01:24:41.620
one of the moons was named after some fucking,
um,

1348
01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:46.600
let's see if I have the information here was named after,

1349
01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:52.360
what the fuck would I think?
Like,
you know what,
I can wing this.

1350
01:24:52.390 --> 01:24:54.430
You guys don't need to know the name.
You don't give a fuck.

1351
01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:59.290
One of the moons of Jupiter is named after a,

1352
01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:04.060
Jupiter was basically the Roman Zeus,
right when it comes to mythology,

1353
01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:05.410
if I remember correctly,

1354
01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:10.210
they basically stole other gods like stealing like a fucking script idea.

1355
01:25:10.270 --> 01:25:12.910
They just changed up the names of the characters like,
Nah man,

1356
01:25:12.911 --> 01:25:14.260
it's different when you talking about,

1357
01:25:15.010 --> 01:25:18.910
so Jupiter was married to a,
I dunno,

1358
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:22.480
I dunno what the fuck her name was.
Apollonia right.

1359
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:27.700
We're just gonna use fake names here.
And they had a daughter named die,

1360
01:25:27.730 --> 01:25:30.070
Heather,
her Helena,
I don't know what the fuck her name was.

1361
01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:35.380
One of the moons is named after this girl now evidently,
uh,
this is how this,

1362
01:25:35.381 --> 01:25:39.160
this is how the story goes in mythology,
is

1363
01:25:40.690 --> 01:25:45.690
Jupiter had basically a crush on his own fucking daughter and his wife,

1364
01:25:46.810 --> 01:25:51.550
rather than reporting it to the proper authorities,
was just simply jealous.

1365
01:25:52.030 --> 01:25:56.350
Like he was banging some hottie down the street rather than her fucking
daughter.

1366
01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:02.380
So Jupiter is banging his own daughter.
His wife gets wind of it,

1367
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:06.650
he gets fucking nervous.
So he turns her into a cow,

1368
01:26:08.570 --> 01:26:09.410
not his wife.

1369
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:14.590
He turns his beautiful daughter that he was banging into a Heifer Heifer

1370
01:26:15.351 --> 01:26:19.580
evidently is a fucking a fucking cow that doesn't give an a calf yet.

1371
01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:25.190
You know,
it's ready to be fucking banged raw dog style,
right?

1372
01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:30.680
That's a fucking story.
I swear to God,
if all you,

1373
01:26:30.681 --> 01:26:34.260
Jesus freaks out there who are looking down your nose at that sort of mythical

1374
01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:38.000
mythology,
you'll fucking religion starts to same goddamn way.

1375
01:26:38.810 --> 01:26:42.980
Adam and Eve,
first two fucking people,
they were hanging out.

1376
01:26:43.610 --> 01:26:47.810
Somehow they became more people.
It's really weird.

1377
01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:49.280
Like that guy was basically,

1378
01:26:50.030 --> 01:26:54.530
this guy told this fucking story or at least brought it up.

1379
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:58.300
I guess he didn't tell the whole story.
Then I researched it.
It's just the,
um,

1380
01:26:59.690 --> 01:27:02.960
the incest,
you was the acceptance of incest back in the day.

1381
01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:07.790
I don't know if it's creepy or if it just makes sense.
You know,
you gotta be,

1382
01:27:07.791 --> 01:27:10.610
you gotta be asking yourself this.
All right.

1383
01:27:11.330 --> 01:27:15.590
There's only 40 people on the planet.
All right,

1384
01:27:16.430 --> 01:27:19.760
let's just say 25 of them are women.

1385
01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:25.220
15 of a woman that doesn't even add up does it?

1386
01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:31.100
Is 40 care does 25 and 15 is 40 see that we all learned something here today on

1387
01:27:31.101 --> 01:27:33.830
the podcast.
All right?
Let's say

1388
01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:41.570
let's say 15 or men in 25 are fucking women.
All right?

1389
01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:46.760
Now who's kidding?
Who you been to a bar?
Does 25 fucking women in there?

1390
01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:51.050
All right.
How many of them could you completely give a shit?

1391
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:55.940
About 12 good.
Half of them.
You don't give a fuck.

1392
01:27:57.020 --> 01:28:01.970
You stone sober.
Yeah,
whatever with you fucking jeans beat it.
All right?

1393
01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:04.700
You got weird eyebrows.
Get the fuck away from me.
I don't care.

1394
01:28:05.390 --> 01:28:08.570
It's a 12 of them are out the window.
Now you're down to 13 women.

1395
01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:14.600
How many of them are going to be hot?
Let's use the bar analogy.

1396
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:19.520
There's going to be about four hot once.
All right,
not this.

1397
01:28:19.521 --> 01:28:24.110
25 women in 15 guys and only four of those women.

1398
01:28:24.111 --> 01:28:28.700
A fucking hot is a good God damn chance that one of those women is going to be

1399
01:28:28.701 --> 01:28:29.534
your daughter.

1400
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:35.610
No laws have been made about it.

1401
01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:39.100
You know there's no real Saudi.

1402
01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:42.380
We know they haven't even invented the fucking wheel yet or the hammer.

1403
01:28:42.590 --> 01:28:46.970
There's no does,
no jurisdiction is known jurisdiction.

1404
01:28:46.971 --> 01:28:51.560
There's no laws.
I guess that that's why it made sense.

1405
01:28:51.561 --> 01:28:53.600
Like why all these religions started that way.

1406
01:28:55.510 --> 01:29:00.470
And then Thor banged his sister in front of his daughter and Nope,

1407
01:29:00.471 --> 01:29:03.060
nobody the shit.
So anyways,

1408
01:29:04.370 --> 01:29:06.260
I dunno what the fuck I'm talking about here.
People,

1409
01:29:06.261 --> 01:29:09.020
I'm just trying to get to 50 and it's 51 minutes.

1410
01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:12.560
45 seconds bump up,
bump up,

1411
01:29:12.850 --> 01:29:15.360
vote up bone up to the door to do.
Uh,

1412
01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:18.710
it's time to go watch Monday night football.
Everybody.
All right,

1413
01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:21.020
let's hope we have a nice fair game.

1414
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:27.690
I got a lot of balls saying that as a patriots fan.
Um,
anyways,

1415
01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:31.920
I'm looking forward to this.
I don't like it.
I don't have a good fucking feeling.

1416
01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:33.870
I just,
I don't like it.
But what's great is,

1417
01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:37.920
is I had a feeling that I was going to go undefeated this week,
four no,

1418
01:29:37.921 --> 01:29:41.290
with my picks and I went one and three.
So,
uh,

1419
01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:46.300
the odds have it that the fact that I think the jets are going to win means my

1420
01:29:46.750 --> 01:29:50.140
patriots might win.
Right?
Does that make any fucking sense?
All right.

1421
01:29:50.170 --> 01:29:51.400
Listen to this fuck faces.

1422
01:29:51.850 --> 01:29:54.970
I'm going to upload this thing and I'm going to put up some pictures that I took

1423
01:29:54.971 --> 01:29:59.200
when I was in San Francisco.
How hilarious is that?
You know,

1424
01:29:59.650 --> 01:30:03.770
it's like all of a sudden,
I'm not drinking on the road and now,

1425
01:30:03.771 --> 01:30:05.860
now I'm taking pictures like Goddamn tourists,

1426
01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:08.840
and I'm telling you how to fry a fucking egg.
I don't know if I like it,

1427
01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:13.210
but I'm 51 days,
then I'm definitely gonna drink again.
Um,

1428
01:30:13.420 --> 01:30:16.720
I just need to learn to do it in moderation so my head doesn't get all big and

1429
01:30:16.721 --> 01:30:19.210
fat.
All right,
well,
that's the podcast this week.

1430
01:30:19.211 --> 01:30:20.560
You guys all have a wonderful week.

1431
01:30:21.070 --> 01:30:23.680
I hope all your dreams come true and go fuck yourself.

1432
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.823
<v 7>Okay?</v>

1433
01:30:37.610 --> 01:30:37.610
