00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.840
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Hey.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.780
&gt;&gt;Dan Galpin: [laughs] That was good.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.210
You tried not to scare me that time.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.210
[laughs]

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.220
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Welcome to the Friday Review of
Games.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.860
As always, I am Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.929
&gt;&gt;Galpin: And I'm Dan Galpin.

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:26.070
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Joining us today is the Widmer
Brothers' Pitch Black IPA.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.220
It's like IPA for Batman.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.729
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I like that.

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:35.260
Since the Dark Knight Returns is now premiering
in lots of other places in the world other

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.020
than the United States, it makes sense for
us to have a Batman brew, right?

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.020
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.870
Because we wouldn't want to just stick to
the US and ignore the rest of the world.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:44.870
&gt;&gt;Galpin: That's not--

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.290
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That wouldn't be our way at all.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.700
&gt;&gt;Galpin: That is not the Google way.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.950
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: By the way, I have to also mention
that Mountain Dew really let me down.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.270
They used to have Pitch Black Mountain Dew,
which was black.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.270
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Exactly.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.270
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: It was great.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.720
But then they did a Batman tie-in, and I guess
they just figured they couldn't reuse it,

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.720
or whatever.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.720
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Right, exactly.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.720
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: So what do they come up with?

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.720
Dark Berry.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.930
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Dark-- ugh. [shudders]

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.930
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I know!

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.549
It's like a batsuit with nipples on it.

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:13.549
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Exactly.

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:14.549
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Right?

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.549
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Mmhmm.

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:16.549
I know exactly what you're talking about.

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:17.549
All right.

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.549
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: All right.

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:19.549
Let's get to the games.

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:20.869
We are looking at Tower Defense games.

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.170
&gt;&gt;Galpin: That means we have a lot of games
to look at--

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.170
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh yeah.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.469
&gt;&gt;Galpin: --because there are a lot of fantastically
good Tower Defense games on Google Play.

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:30.689
Ian has played almost all of them.

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.439
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: But Dan's played them more recently
because yesterday while he was playing games,

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.079
I was celebrating my birthday.

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:37.170
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.259
Happy birthday, Ian.

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.200
And actually, I wanted to apologize to all
of the Android Camp participants this year,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.270
because while they were doing their final
project presentations, I was playing video

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.499
games in order to prepare for this show.

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:52.189
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Especially that one dude in the
back that I never learned his name, but he

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:53.369
said he watches our show.

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.369
Hey dude!

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:55.369
How's it going?

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:56.369
All right.

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.369
&gt;&gt;Galpin: [laughs] All right.

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.210
Yes, it's a dude from Sri Lanka who goes to
University of Toronto.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.210
How does that sound?

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.210
Is that close enough?

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.210
All right.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.210
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: We can track him down.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.210
Watch out.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.210
&gt;&gt;Galpin: That's right.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.800
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Okay, so Tower Defense games,
if you watched my review of Radiant Defense

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.850
a couple weeks ago, you'll know that they're
one of my favorite genres.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.850
I don't know why.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.510
I think it's partly the strategy, it's partly
the fact that I can pick them up and put them

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.880
down really easily.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.840
I don't need great reflexes for most Tower
Defense games, which is good.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.520
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, if you're drinking, for example,
right?

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.250
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, or if you've ever seen my
production of Reto Meier's app review, you

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.550
know that my reflexes are not the canniest
in the world.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.550
&gt;&gt;Galpin: [laughs] Move to the tablet!

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.020
Move to the tablet! [laughs]

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.860
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Damn it!

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.860
When we looked for Tower Defense games, I
was hoping that I'd see some new ones.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.700
We actually saw a lot that we'd looked at
before, but there were a couple that were

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.700
brand new.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.700
&gt;&gt;Galpin: There were.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.700
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I think that's very cool.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.700
What are we going to look at first?

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.630
Let's get the junk out of the way first.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.800
Well, junk is a harsh term.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.020
There were some nominations that we're going
to go ahead and reject, because they're not

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.250
really Tower Defense games.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.880
&gt;&gt;Galpin: There are so many schemes that are
specific in this genre that are--.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.700
To have a game that's really not a Tower Defense
game but just has towers in it is definitely

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.750
something that we don't need.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.470
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Cartoon Wars, for instance, which
is not a Tower Defense game, but a game in

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.020
which you defend a tower.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.380
&gt;&gt;Galpin: By the way, this is--.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.740
Actually, let's bring up something.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.740
Let's bring up the tablet.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.930
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, Reto, why don't you show
us what's going on.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.170
&gt;&gt;Galpin: We don't currently have network.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.230
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, Reto, can you show us the
tablet please?

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.620
&gt;&gt;Galpin: [laughs] When you don't have a network,
you can't play the game.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.740
It just pops up a dialog.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.740
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That's unfortunate.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.010
&gt;&gt;Galpin: This is so sad.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.250
There are a lot of games that do this, if
they require a network.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.250
It's so jarring.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.600
One, I'd like to, â€“ I don't think there's
any strong reason why this game can't be played

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.600
offline.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.260
But two, if you're going to do this, make
it feel like it's actually part of the game,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.250
not like this giant error happens.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.260
It's not a great user experience.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.870
There are potentially things you might want
to be able to see within the game.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.680
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I'm a little confused, actually.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.680
I've played this game.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.680
It's not a bad game.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.790
It's not a Tower Defense game.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.900
It's more of a one dimensional.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.720
What would you call this?

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.100
There was the Army of Darkness, uh, Gladiator.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.500
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, it's a different genre.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.700
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, it's a 'buy dudes and send
them to the right' game.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.120
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It's sort of a resource management,
battlefield simulation, almost.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.120
It's like you have to--.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.090
There is a strategy, but you're not placing
towers, you're just like, "Ahh!" and your

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.090
guys--

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.490
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Anyway, the point I was trying
to make without getting too long winded is

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.490
I've played this game.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.370
I don't see any reason that it has to be connected
to a network.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.820
A lot of people don't have reliable network
service.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.620
We don't because we're in the middle of the
Android building where people feel completely

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.870
free to just use all of the available air
space for random test projects--

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:55.870
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Absolutely.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.870
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: --that block our WiFi.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.860
&gt;&gt;Galpin: You do have to realize when you
have several thousand devices on the WiFi

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.550
in a building, it's going to stress things
out.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:09.900
I think, actually, this device has just lost
WiFi due to, probably, some sort of issue.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.500
I don't, oh, it's in airplane mode.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.500
Haha!

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.500
Never mind.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.500
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh, well, there you go.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.360
But that brings to mind my other point, which
is, "Hey!

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.500
You know where I love to play games?

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.389
On airplanes!"

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:27.270
It's true that not everybody travels as much
as your typical Googler.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.270
&gt;&gt;Galpin: We're good here.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.820
We're not even going to look at Cartoon Wars,
because it's not a Tower Defense game.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:32.820
We wanted to mention that.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.900
I wanted to mention that I actually like playing
games offline.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.970
I did go and test that.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.630
And let's get into the actual Tower Defense
games themselves.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.130
Now, we're going to go pretty quickly through
things we've looked at already.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.070
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Why don't we start with one of
the classics, Fieldrunners?

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.780
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Absolutely.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.220
Just to display.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.380
Now, I'm not sure we have a title card for
this one, Reto.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.380
We might not.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.580
So we're just going to have to go to a non
title card equipped display.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.120
There we are.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.370
Fieldrunners is one of--.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.189
There's a couple of variations in the genre.

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:17.210
Fieldrunners is the variation where you get
to, where you have guys running from one side

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.060
to the other, and you actually get to change
their course by putting down towers.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.060
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.960
It's an open field with path defined by towers.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.590
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Exactly.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:32.730
And the key strategy element is the characters
will always take the shortest path from one

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.710
side to the other.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.730
Your goal is to make their path long.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:43.400
Then, just when you think you've gotten this
all taken care of, you'll realize that people

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.820
actually will fly in the shortest path over
and will ignore all of your defenses.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.180
Ultimately, you have to make some decisions,
whether you're going to continue to build

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:57.550
towers in the most logical, crazy pattern,
or whether you're going to build towers that

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.550
will hit planes.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.870
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Let's contrast that with--.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:09.610
Oh, by the way, let's contrast that with another
Tower Defense game that's been quite popular.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.360
It's also a very good game.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:17.330
But it takes a completely different approach,
where everything is constrained.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:22.940
Both the location of the towers and the path
that people are going to follow.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.830
This game is a beautiful game.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:27.830
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Absolutely.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.240
Actually, it's interesting, because this game
involves levels that have a significant amount

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.710
of craft in the levels.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:38.440
Because the goal of the level is to provide
a puzzle for which towers you place where.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.600
They limit the number of options.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:48.110
So in a sense, this game has a little more
of a different kind of a variation.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:53.400
The design of the levels is actually more
critical than the design of the individual

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.400
element.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:00.730
A lot of times, they'll throw new players
at you in order to change the game up a lot,

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.540
or new enemies.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.540
This game actually does both.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.479
It throws completely different levels and
completely different enemies, and you have

00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:09.699
to use different strategies based upon the
different places you're actually allowed to

00:08:09.699 --> 00:08:11.030
place towers.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.580
But it's not as open ended.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.020
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.020
I agree.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.830
It's more of a puzzle type of atmosphere.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.750
It doesn't feel like I'm playing a strategy
game.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:25.250
It feels like I'm trying to figure out what
the correct combination is.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.950
That can be its own set of fun.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:37.360
Jelly Defense has a fairly typical user interface
where you're dragging towers from some UI

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:44.770
area, in this case, down in the corner, and
then you're placing them on specific points

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:45.770
on the map.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:46.960
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, one of the things I actually--.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.380
One of the UI changes is--

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.380
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Do you collect those?

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:50.380
&gt;&gt;Galpin: --you do have to collect them, yeah.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.800
One-- and you see I just completely screwed
this up, because the blue tower doesn't do

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.279
anything against the red guys.

00:08:56.279 --> 00:08:57.580
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Ah, yes, that's right.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.760
But you can have a tower that does both red
and blue.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:01.760
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yes, exactly.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.779
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: It's that one.

00:09:02.779 --> 00:09:05.430
&gt;&gt;Galpin: That's actually one of the unique
things about this game, is that they actually

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:10.500
have this concept of towers that are ineffective
against one color or another.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.910
That's not going to probably build fast enough.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.380
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh, I know.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.600
Yeah, that's another interesting thing, is
that some games will have towers that build

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:22.399
immediately, and some games will have towers
that take a little bit of time.

00:09:22.399 --> 00:09:27.050
Another thing that will differentiate these
is when we pause, can we still build towers?

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:29.440
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Exactly.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.830
Some games are real time Tower Defense games.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:35.399
This one is a true real time Tower Defense
game.

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:36.399
That's the only way it's played.

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:38.830
Now, from a menuing structure, there's really
two styles.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:40.160
One is where you drag from the corner.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.480
Another one is where you select where you
want to build and--.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:48.290
By the way, this is one of these things where
if you have icons, sometimes it's tricky to

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:54.220
see just what your icon is actually going
to do at any given point.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:57.050
So yeah, this is the drag one.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:01.700
I actually really like the select where you
want to build a tower and get a menu on the

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.420
spot, because it's less clicking.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.420
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, definitely.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.120
Let's take a look at one that does that.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:15.930
Com2uS, a large Korean game company, has actually
copyrighted, or trademarked the term Tower

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.190
Defense.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:24.080
Any game that calls itself Tower Defense or
has Tower Defense in the title will actually

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.120
get a nice polite letter from their lawyers.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:36.210
But yeah, Tower Defense has a nice UI to it,
where most of the UI elements are hidden until

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:38.300
you absolutely need them.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.610
Clicking on the screen will actually activate
them.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:41.750
I do really like that.

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:46.230
&gt;&gt;Galpin: And this game has really nice, high
res, sharp graphics.

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:47.230
It's fun.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:53.240
The only thing about this particular game
is this is another one--.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.950
This is a fixed path Tower Defense game.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:00.660
It's not as limited, in Jelly Defense, in
the sense that you can place towers in lots

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.810
and lots of different and varied places.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:06.709
But the path in which the characters run is
fixed.

00:11:06.709 --> 00:11:12.050
But it is really cool just to build towers
willy-nilly like that.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:13.170
You can see, there's actually--

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.370
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: And they build immediately in
this one.

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:16.640
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, exactly.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.640
There's not nearly as much time, where, you
know, space and no time.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.260
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I think we've compared and contrasted
some of the styles.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.350
Let's talk about some of the--.

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:29.770
Now, Jelly Defense, I think one of the things
that we saw with it--.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:30.770
Oh, go ahead.

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:32.300
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I was going to say actually just
one comment.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:36.010
This game has very, very high resolution background
artwork.

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:38.640
You can actually see that on the icons and
text.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.360
It is a little lower resolution in the screen.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.510
You might not be able to see that on the live
stream, but this is--.

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:50.839
Even in this game, which looks amazing, if
we had a slightly higher resolution font,

00:11:50.839 --> 00:11:53.290
it would look a little less blurry.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:56.160
I would say, that would be my one comment
on the visuals here.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.800
Because otherwise, the game is so high resolution
and so polished.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.850
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, all of the tiles are really
high res.

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:06.140
&gt;&gt;Galpin: But again, if you actually polish
the backgrounds without actually making a

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:09.850
higher resolution font, that is going to make
the game look worse.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:13.170
We see some other games here that have fallen
into that trap as well.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:18.430
If you're going to spend, strangely enough,
if you're going to spend some extra application

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:23.520
real estate on anything in terms of high resolution,
a font is great.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:28.310
Especially since you can, for a lot of these
games, take advantage of the fact that we

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:30.300
have really nice open type implementations.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:34.790
If you can get an outline font that will work,
we do a pretty good job of rendering that

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:35.790
pretty quickly.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.070
That is really the way to go.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.950
You'll see a bunch of games that do use that
as well.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:43.140
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: This game also has reasonably
good animation.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.300
It's not the best I've ever seen.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:49.290
There's not depth animation for the enemies.

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:56.530
It has the, it's got the feature where you
can actually call a wave early.

00:12:56.530 --> 00:13:00.610
Reto, if you wouldn't mind going to the tablet
now.

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:04.420
[pause] See, not so easy, is it, when you're
on the other side, yeah?

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:05.420
Okay.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.290
If you have an early call button--.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:10.980
And this is something that you'll see in a
lot of these games, where you'll hit a button

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.280
and you can actually send out the waves a
little faster.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.660
Another thing you'll see is being able to--

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.140
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Speed up time.

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:19.140
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: --speed up time, yeah.

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:23.150
Because, really, these are the sort of games
where you take relatively few actions, but

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:24.150
you do them very frequently.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.150
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.670
Actually, one of the things I really like
is you can actually see in this game, it actually

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.600
shows you as waves are coming through.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.959
This game is good.

00:13:31.959 --> 00:13:37.100
My main thing about this game is that it is--
It implements the basics of Tower Defense

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.290
incredibly, incredibly well.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:39.399
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:13:39.399 --> 00:13:43.560
&gt;&gt;Galpin: But, to me, it's not as fun as some
of the other games.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:48.300
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, I thought, it's definitely
got a good selection of towers.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:54.730
You have some different situations where you
need to use a particular mix of towers.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:55.730
And I like that.

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:56.730
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Ooh, look at that.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:58.030
[whispers] Back button now, Ricky.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:59.030
Bad.

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.350
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: But I felt like, I don't know.

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:02.930
I felt like it introduced them a little too
slowly.

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:07.029
I don't know, there's just something about
the game play that wasn't quite as fun.

00:14:07.029 --> 00:14:10.020
Some of the maps were maybe a little too hard
to begin with.

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:13.330
&gt;&gt;Galpin: By the way, the back key really
is not working here.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.209
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: No, the back key isn't working.

00:14:15.209 --> 00:14:17.370
That's a real problem.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.860
Other than that, most of these things--

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.400
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Also, the ads were kinda funny.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.410
Sometimes they do come up full screen, but
when you're putting, especially your own ads,

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:26.850
on a tablet, you know that.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:31.600
That's another thing, is some of the menus,
I wanted to see a little bit larger when I

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.089
was on the tablet, in terms of scale.

00:14:33.089 --> 00:14:37.110
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, you can definitely use a
little bit more testing on large devices.

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:38.110
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.279
But overall, the game looks good.

00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:40.370
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: It really does.

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:41.370
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It's a beautiful game.

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:46.180
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I just wanted to contrast Jelly
Defense really quickly.

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:51.519
There's nothing wrong with what they've done
here, but it's a little more obvious that

00:14:51.519 --> 00:14:57.420
they've poured it from a 4:3 build and gone
16:9.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:04.700
Now, we would always prefer that you actually
just do a 16:9 build.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.470
That's always going to look better.

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:11.839
But, in this case, at least they haven't just
squished everything and letterboxed the whole

00:15:11.839 --> 00:15:13.589
thing, or pillarboxed the whole thing.

00:15:13.589 --> 00:15:18.180
They've got a nice set of UI around here.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.779
Ooh, it's got little trails that follow my
finger.

00:15:20.779 --> 00:15:21.779
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Trails, yeah.

00:15:21.779 --> 00:15:22.779
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That's so sweet.

00:15:22.779 --> 00:15:23.779
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, this game is really a work
of art.

00:15:23.779 --> 00:15:24.779
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, it really is nice.

00:15:24.779 --> 00:15:29.730
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I really do wish, though, just honestly,
all they need is a little bit of extra graphic

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:34.209
on the side that's not interacted-- that we're
interacting with, and it would be just so

00:15:34.209 --> 00:15:35.209
beautiful and so perfect.

00:15:35.209 --> 00:15:36.209
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That really is all you need.

00:15:36.209 --> 00:15:37.600
Just fill those out.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.610
&gt;&gt;Galpin: And again, that's something that
if you design at the beginning, it's very

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:42.610
easy.

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:45.700
If you come into it, we're like "Oh, all of
a sudden, we need lots and lots of new art."

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.839
That's hard.

00:15:47.839 --> 00:15:49.500
But I really would love to see that for this
game.

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.860
That would be the thing that takes it over
the top, as far as I'm concerned.

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:57.550
As I said, it's a little bit of a preference
what style of Tower Defense game you prefer.

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:01.610
I think for people who haven't done a lot
of these games, this is actually really nice.

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:03.240
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: This is a great entry level Tower
Defense.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.240
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It really, really is.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.240
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.240
Look at the animation.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.760
Look at the care they've done.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.589
All of the transitions are perfect.

00:16:10.589 --> 00:16:19.660
All of the game play just has this really
nice look and feel to it where everything's

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.680
moving and everything's believable.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.020
Everything looks 3-D.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.150
&gt;&gt;Galpin: And the graphical style is brilliant.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:30.279
I think, actually, everything, I think a lot
of the elements may actually be 3-D. They

00:16:30.279 --> 00:16:31.970
certainly do have a giant 3-D--.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:34.040
If we go back to the menu here.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.060
I don't want to restart the level, I want
to go--.

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.790
This is actually, by the way, one of my complaints
is this is how you get to the menu.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:43.149
The level selector is that other thing, which
doesn't look like anything.

00:16:43.149 --> 00:16:44.149
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:16:44.149 --> 00:16:45.579
Well, it looks like one of those dudes, right?

00:16:45.579 --> 00:16:46.639
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It looks like one of those dudes,
which--.

00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:50.740
It doesn't look like it means this, but actually,
this is the level selector here, which is

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:51.740
a nice--

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:52.959
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh, it kinda looks like that guy.

00:16:52.959 --> 00:16:55.110
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It kinda looks like that guy, yeah.

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.519
This is a nice 3-D element and is cool.

00:16:57.519 --> 00:17:00.430
You see we're in this incredibly cool space,
this place.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:04.230
Again, there is, and actually, if we didn't
have HDMI connected, you would see that it's

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.160
actually even running a little more smoothly
than it looks here.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.160
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.060
The HDMI removes 10 pounds.

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:11.610
I mean, fps.

00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:14.510
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, it does hurt the frame rate
a little.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:15.510
But yeah.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:17.060
This is a beautifully, beautifully done game.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.060
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.060
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It's got feet!

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.060
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That's cute.

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.110
&gt;&gt;Galpin: All right, let's go back.

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:22.209
Let's go look at another one.

00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:24.740
We want to cover something a little different.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:28.150
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Well, why don't we take a look
at Sentinel 3.

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.730
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Sentinel 3 or the Space Station,
which one?

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:34.880
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Well, let's start with Sentinel
3, because I want to contrast the Space Station.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:43.130
Sentinel 3, when I was on parental leave last
year, I spent almost every waking moment that

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.570
I could playing Sentinel 3.

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:46.970
I love this game.

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:49.270
There's a couple things that I really loved
about it.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:56.300
The first is it's a-- It is a fixed path Tower
Defense game, but there are multiple paths

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.510
that enemies will come down.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:07.910
But its more interesting feature is that it
has an avatar system where, in addition to

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:14.830
building towers, you also control this guy
in a suit of Mecca Armor that has special

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:15.830
powers, special abilities.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:19.620
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, it's awesome.

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:20.880
It adds a really great twist.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.910
The art style is beautiful.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:23.910
This is just--

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.419
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: It reminds me a lot of the games
like Starcraft or something like those.

00:18:26.419 --> 00:18:27.419
Really well done.

00:18:27.419 --> 00:18:28.419
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:18:28.419 --> 00:18:29.419
This is a gorgeous, gorgeous game.

00:18:29.419 --> 00:18:30.419
Especially--

00:18:30.419 --> 00:18:31.419
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Especially if you download the
HD pack.

00:18:31.419 --> 00:18:32.419
Did you?

00:18:32.419 --> 00:18:33.419
You did, right?

00:18:33.419 --> 00:18:34.419
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yes, I downloaded the HD pack.

00:18:34.419 --> 00:18:35.419
That's the thing I was going to say.

00:18:35.419 --> 00:18:37.250
What's also nice about this game is that it
actually comes with an SD pack that runs pretty

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:38.840
much everywhere.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.350
And then, with just a little bit of--.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:43.790
Let me actually place some towers here [laughs]
so we don't die.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:49.250
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Now this, again, is the drag and
drop method of Tower.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:51.030
I'm not a big fan.

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:55.890
There's a few things about this interface
that make it a little bit difficult.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:19:05.750
I think that first, the fact that you have
to drag and drop is annoying, but fine.

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:12.940
The fact, though, that the UI actually sits
over areas of the map that, not in this map,

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.750
but in other maps, are actually playable--.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:19.400
So you see the pause and the fast forward
button here.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.040
Those will actually cover areas of the map
where you have to place towers.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:30.240
To me, that's unacceptable because it means
that I have to do a lot of map navigation

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:38.280
that's just in-- for the sole purpose of keeping
the UI from getting in my way.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:44.640
[pause] Going with the philosophy that you
should always be fighting the enemies in the

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.400
game and not fighting the UI, I think this
one fails just a little bit.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.910
Now, we actually talked to the developers
about that, and they were looking into some

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:53.910
ways to fix it.

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:55.250
They certainly helped some.

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:59.120
I think there used to be a big OpenFeint button
here.

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.080
And nothing against OpenFeint.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:05.810
The problem, though, was that if you press
that button, it would start an OpenFeint cycle

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:08.130
that took about 20 seconds, and you couldn't
get out of it.

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:09.130
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, yeah.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:13.361
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: It's very, very easy to press
those by accident, because, you can see, if

00:20:13.361 --> 00:20:15.160
I wanted to place a tower up here--.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.400
Well, what am I trying to do there?

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.530
Am I trying to place the tower or click the
settings?

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:23.530
What's it going to decide?

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:24.530
It decided--

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:25.530
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I was trying to--

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:26.530
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: --both, actually.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:27.530
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Did you place a tower, too?

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:28.669
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yes, it did.

00:20:28.669 --> 00:20:30.800
There's a tower there, see?

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.650
I'll show you because you have to zoom in.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:34.650
There it is.

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:35.650
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Oh yeah.

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:36.679
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: And see, if I want to upgrade
the tower--.

00:20:36.679 --> 00:20:41.770
Now, the upgrade, you click on the tower and
hit the upgrade button.

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:46.270
You can see that that tower is almost impossible
to upgrade without doing--

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:48.750
&gt;&gt;Galpin: A zoom and a manipulation.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:49.750
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: --a zoom.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:54.210
It's one of those things where if they just
limited the playable areas a little bit.

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:55.210
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Mmhmm.

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:56.770
Now, it does help that there's only two buttons.

00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:04.100
But actually, to be honest, there's no, I
would actually say that you could actually,

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.429
the fast forward button is nice to have.

00:21:06.429 --> 00:21:08.059
That's have there.

00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:09.299
Whether you need both is--

00:21:09.299 --> 00:21:11.470
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh, well, no, no.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:12.650
The fast forward button is fine.

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:15.410
The pause button is actually really important
because in this game--

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:16.410
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yes.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:17.410
No, absolutely.

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:18.410
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: --you want to be able to pause.

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:23.970
But put it in an area where you're not going
to have a lot of game play.

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:32.010
One of the major problems of this game is
that there are maps where the first choke

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:36.220
point is underneath one of these buttons.

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:43.440
All of the initial action is confined to just
a corner of the screen.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:48.090
If you're just in a corner of the screen and
there's buttons in the way, it can be immensely

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:49.090
frustrating.

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:50.090
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Mmhmm.

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:51.090
Absolutely.

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:53.070
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: There's a couple of other things
that are interesting.

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:54.610
You've got the avatar.

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:58.350
You've also got these gates that he defends.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:05.110
You get bonus points if the gates don't fall,
but the level doesn't end if the gate falls.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:11.700
So you actually have several different things
that you're defending, and not just your ultimate

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.020
base.

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:16.850
You also have the ability to collect resources
in later levels, although I felt that was

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:22.049
balanced a little poorly, because I could
never get to the point where resource collection

00:22:22.049 --> 00:22:24.800
was actually paying for itself.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:29.299
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Also, one thing that's interesting
is that it is by placing towers, in this case

00:22:29.299 --> 00:22:35.080
close to my main sentinel, that actually makes
them more powerful.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.780
That's what that little circle there means.

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:37.780
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:42.640
As your sentinel gains levels, that circle
actually gets bigger.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.640
You have this--.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:48.080
And of course, that affects your strategy
later on when there's multiple gates that

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:54.100
enemies could be coming through, because what
you'll do is you'll [clears throat] you'll

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.760
send your sentinel over to one gate, and then
another one starts getting attacked so you

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.760
jump over there.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.410
You really need to pay attention to where
that guy is.

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:03.760
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, it adds a lot of RPG--.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.530
RPG elements in these kinds of games are cool.

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:07.530
I think that's--.

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:12.820
This game mashes it up a little, even though
at its basis, it is what we call fixed path,

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.510
which is one of the simpler kinds of these
games.

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:23.840
I'm actually kinda sad because one of the
games that I played a lot was Guns'n'Glory.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.760
That's a very similar kind of game.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:26.760
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That's a fixed path game, right?

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.289
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It's a fixed path game as well,
so I was kinda sad that it didn't get nominated.

00:23:30.289 --> 00:23:31.360
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Why didn't you nominate it?

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.870
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Well, I should have, but I was--.

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:35.780
There were so many nominations already that
were good, I decided we'd just stick with

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:36.780
the ones that we had.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:37.780
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Ah, that's a good point.

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:38.780
By the way, thank you very much.

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:42.350
We were really excited to see so many nominations
in this category.

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:45.970
It's really exciting when we can find games
that we haven't seen before.

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:49.850
We feel like we're really unearthing some
diamonds in the rough by getting you guys

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:50.850
involved.

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:51.850
We really appreciate that.

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:56.380
With that in mind, why don't we take a look
at one of the games that we haven't seen before?

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:57.460
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Looked at before.

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:58.460
All right.

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.850
There's a couple of interesting ones here.

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:05.460
What we've looked at on the show versus what
we've looked at elsewhere, which--.

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:10.400
Why don't you pick one of these, since I know
that, I've looked at all of them.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.700
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Well, do you have a Knight--?

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:13.700
Yeah.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.039
I hadn't seen A Knight's Dawn at all.

00:24:15.039 --> 00:24:16.990
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It's a Unity game.

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:20.530
You can tell because it's actually using an
older version of Unity.

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:21.530
Oh, wait!

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:22.530
Did this game?

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:23.530
I wonder if I ever did--

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:24.530
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh no.

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:25.530
&gt;&gt;Galpin: This game might actually crash.

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.690
I can't remember whether I got this game to
work now that I'm thinking about it.

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:28.690
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh, okay.

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:29.850
We'll totally take a look at that later.

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:31.830
&gt;&gt;Galpin: We'll take a look at that later.

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:35.440
That was the one game that I hadn't had a
chance to look at, now that, because it crashed.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.940
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Wow, I sure can pick 'em.

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:38.730
How about Myth Defense?

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:44.299
&gt;&gt;Galpin: [laughs] The fact that it had that
Unity splash team means that they're using

00:24:44.299 --> 00:24:45.960
a really, really old version of Unity.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:46.960
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:47.960
So they need to update.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.059
&gt;&gt;Galpin: They do need to update that.

00:24:49.059 --> 00:24:51.169
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Myth is pretty.

00:24:51.169 --> 00:24:52.890
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Myth Defense is beautiful.

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:54.360
I was really, really glad to see that.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.030
Do we have a title card for this one or not?

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:57.410
Yeah, this is one of the ones that's beyond
the first ten--

00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:00.050
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I think we had title cards for
the first ten.

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:02.690
We should probably spend very little time
on this.

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:04.429
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, exactly.

00:25:04.429 --> 00:25:08.250
But this game, actually, I really, really
like.

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:09.371
I'm glad we got to mention it.

00:25:09.371 --> 00:25:13.679
It is definitely in the non fixed path style
of Tower Defense games.

00:25:13.679 --> 00:25:16.730
But I really like the fact that it's using
this particular theme.

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:21.010
You see I was able to just continue back from
where I left off.

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:23.429
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Well, almost.

00:25:23.429 --> 00:25:26.940
You had a game in progress, but it still made
you go through all those menus to begin with.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:27.940
That's kinda annoying.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:28.940
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It's true.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:29.940
It's true.

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:32.360
But actually, if I close, I think I actually
didn't fully close the game.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.360
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh, okay.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:37.289
So if I just hit home, what's going to happen?

00:25:37.289 --> 00:25:38.650
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Let's try it.

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:39.650
Let's find out.

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:40.650
This is a really good question.

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:41.650
Restoring.

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:42.650
So, I'm right there.

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:44.140
I'm just going to have to hit play in order
to continue.

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:45.720
That's, it did the right thing there.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.650
I think the fact that the game did completely
close.

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:48.650
Now, whether or not--.

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:50.450
The only thing I don't remember is whether
I hit the home screen.

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:53.640
I think I did "exit the game" before.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.640
Legitimately.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.890
I was testing what happens when the back key
was pressed.

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:01.170
I think the artwork is really pretty.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:03.520
The style is fun.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:08.720
It is, again, this is the most traditional,
I'd say, of these kinds of games.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:14.350
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I think we're always really impressed
when someone takes the time to really do a

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:16.610
good job at these high resolution displays.

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:18.160
Remember, this is an ASUS EEE Transformer
Prime.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:24.720
This is by far not the highest resolution
display that's going to be on the market this

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:25.720
year.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:32.070
I think I've already talked about at least
one 10 ADP display.

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:36.580
But you can tell that the crispness of these
graphics, especially if we zoom in a little

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:44.919
bit-- on these graphics, Reto-- you'll see
that each one of the graphics, from the towers

00:26:44.919 --> 00:26:50.160
to the UI, is really, really detailed.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.820
It's not just high res, it's detailed high
res.

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:54.780
Look at those cobblestones.

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.970
Look at the detail on those towers.

00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:58.530
Look at the vegetation.

00:26:58.530 --> 00:26:59.530
It's amazing.

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:01.240
It's really, really well done.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.240
That's impressive to me.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.240
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, absolutely.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.890
The other thing I would say about this one
is that if you've looked at this game, you've

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:11.250
looked at the Com2uS' Tower Defense game side
by side, if you look at the tiles in the background,

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:15.110
they look relatively similarly detailed, but
if you look at the fonts here, the fonts here

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:17.270
are really sharp, really high res.

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:18.270
That makes a huge difference.

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:23.830
They are also rendered in a style that looks
semi 3D.

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:24.830
It just adds--

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:25.830
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: You get a little bit of a drop
shadow.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:26.980
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, a little bit of a drop shadow.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:27.980
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That's nice.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:31.790
&gt;&gt;Galpin: They've also got a little bit of
a gradient on them.

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:33.980
It just looks really pro.

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:35.960
They did a really nice job with this.

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:41.279
Again, I haven't played the game long enough
to be able to give a full, in depth review,

00:27:41.279 --> 00:27:43.410
but I like what I've seen so far.

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:48.390
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: You can see, by the way, that
this is not a full 16:9 playing surface.

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:49.830
It's not 4:3 either.

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:50.840
It's interesting.

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.159
I'm not sure where that came from.

00:27:53.159 --> 00:27:57.909
But-- Or, maybe it was 4:3 and they've just
chosen to do it this way, right?

00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:58.909
Can you zoom?

00:27:58.909 --> 00:28:00.120
&gt;&gt;Galpin: No.

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.190
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: No, okay.

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:03.580
That's interesting.

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.990
What you can see is they've done a little
bit of fill on the edges.

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:12.450
By doing a tiny bit of fill on the edges,
they've made something that, I think, actually

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:18.539
works on both a 4:3 and a 16:9 just as easily.

00:28:18.539 --> 00:28:19.539
It looks great!

00:28:19.539 --> 00:28:25.450
It looks intentional on both resolutions instead
of looking like it's been ported from one

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:26.450
or the other.

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:27.450
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Exactly.

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:31.669
What they did, putting this little border
on the side here in order to get some additional

00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:35.010
real estate, makes a huge difference, rather
than having black bars.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:38.000
Sometimes, even a little thing like that makes
a huge difference.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.520
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: And again, notice that the borders
are not just borders.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:46.610
They've also moved the UI into those areas
so that it's not wasted space.

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:47.610
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Absolutely.

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:50.809
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Which is great, because the more
UI on the playing field, the more irritating

00:28:50.809 --> 00:28:52.740
the game will get, honestly.

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:53.740
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.539
It's great to be able to get that stuff out
of the way.

00:28:56.539 --> 00:28:57.760
They really do a good job with that.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:00.230
So yeah, in general, this is a model.

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:03.250
If you don't actually want to go deeper and
create--.

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:07.140
What would even be nicer is if they extended
this border all the way out, and it didn't

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:10.270
look like there was this hard ledge here on
the sides.

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:12.640
But if you can't do that, this is the next
best thing.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.309
Honestly, it really makes a huge difference.

00:29:14.309 --> 00:29:18.520
It may not seem like it, but if we just saw
black bars here, it would feel wrong.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.470
It would feel like we were watching an experience.

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:21.470
Just less.

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:22.470
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: It would.

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:23.470
It would.

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:27.720
If you've got a solid color, that's even worse.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:35.211
This is something that developers should understand,
that this year, [pause] Google, as you can

00:29:35.211 --> 00:29:41.799
see with the launch of the Nexus 7, were very,
very serious about Android tablets.

00:29:41.799 --> 00:29:46.860
We've talked to the Play team, and they've
said to us many times that they are going

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:53.690
to stop, as much as possible, stop featuring
games that don't have good tablet support.

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:55.150
There are--.

00:29:55.150 --> 00:30:00.190
Some apps and some games just don't, they're
not a natural tablet fit.

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:04.150
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Honestly, almost any game is going
to play better on something like a Nexus 7

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:06.110
than it's going to play on most phones.

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:10.010
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: And remember, too, that tablet
owners tend to buy about four times as many

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:11.230
games as phone owners.

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:12.410
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, per owner.

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:13.590
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Per owner, yeah.

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:15.590
&gt;&gt;Galpin: People look at them as consumption
devices.

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:18.960
People buy a lot of phones, they use it as
a phone, they use it for their Gmail.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:23.610
A lot of people who buy tablets do think of
it as a primary game device as well as another

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:24.610
consumption device.

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:28.920
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, if you're doing another
Bubble Breaker that's just going to help somebody

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:33.230
to waste time while they're waiting for the
bus, maybe you can get by with the phone version.

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:38.110
But if you're doing a great detailed game
like this, you should absolutely be planning

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:41.570
for Android tablets of all shapes and sizes.

00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:42.570
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Let's take--.

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:44.950
Speaking of tablets, let's go to a completely
different kind of game.

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:45.950
This is Orc Genocide.

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:46.980
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh, nice.

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:47.980
Ooh.

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:48.980
And it's--

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:53.230
&gt;&gt;Galpin: You can actually play this head
to head over a LAN.

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:55.659
It is portrait.

00:30:55.659 --> 00:30:57.130
Let's play against the CPU.

00:30:57.130 --> 00:30:59.570
We'll play against the green CPU here.

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:03.820
You'll see that it actually is a game that's
set up for two people to play against each

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:04.890
other, by default.

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:06.679
I've got some things here.

00:31:06.679 --> 00:31:09.539
I can actually start placing my towers.

00:31:09.539 --> 00:31:13.320
This is, again, a very different style of
game.

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:17.649
I was even debating whether we would call
this a true Tower Defense game.

00:31:17.649 --> 00:31:19.610
There's also a couple of options here.

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:25.580
I can actually start upgrading my characters
that are going to be produced here.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:32.390
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: So are you producing mobile characters,
or are you just putting down towers?

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:39.490
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I'm putting down towers which are
going to produce tanks or footmen.

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:43.670
This is sort of, I would say it's, each one
of these guys are going to produce little

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:46.529
characters that are ultimately going to do
my battling for me.

00:31:46.529 --> 00:31:50.770
The towers aren't actually, aren't necessarily
fighting themselves, although sometimes they

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:51.770
are.

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:53.299
But they're also producing characters.

00:31:53.299 --> 00:31:54.539
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Interesting.

00:31:54.539 --> 00:31:57.990
Sort of a cross between a Tower Defense and
something more like Cartoon Wars.

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:00.090
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yes, yeah.

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:01.500
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Interesting.

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:02.909
The graphics.

00:32:02.909 --> 00:32:03.909
Really ugly.

00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:05.650
I say that advisedly.

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:06.940
Do you think it's an homage?

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:09.409
It feels like I'm playing a Commodore 64.

00:32:09.409 --> 00:32:10.409
Is that intentional?

00:32:10.409 --> 00:32:14.600
&gt;&gt;Galpin: You know, I think that there's a
lot of low res graphics intentionally on this,

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:18.679
but I also do feel that it's this weird combination
of both.

00:32:18.679 --> 00:32:21.490
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I do see that sword that looks
kinda high res.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:25.250
Do you think maybe they're just stretched
on this display?

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:27.179
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I don't think so.

00:32:27.179 --> 00:32:33.240
I think that the idea is the little orcs are
APIC throwbacks--

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.240
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Okay.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.120
&gt;&gt;Galpin: --and that the other graphics are
intended to be high res.

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.270
Unfortunately, because the resolution of this
tablet is very high, a lot of them just look

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:41.270
really, really low res.

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:42.270
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I see.

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:45.360
&gt;&gt;Galpin: But I really like the idea of head
to head combat.

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:49.220
It makes so much sense with this tablet, form
factor.

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:53.350
I can't wait to see where they would go with
this.

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:56.790
It seems like there's a lot of potential here.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:33:00.990
I'm not sure about all of the strategy, but
you can build towers in all sorts of different

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:01.990
places.

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.990
You see they get attacked from all sides,
now.

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:08.140
You can drop, I just got killed by the CPU
on the lowest levels, so I clearly didn't

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.760
do a very good job at this game.

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.580
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Well, you are playing sideways.

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:13.100
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I am playing sideways.

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.649
That's mostly to keep the cable from getting
pulled out--

00:33:15.649 --> 00:33:16.649
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That's true.

00:33:16.649 --> 00:33:17.649
&gt;&gt;Galpin: --so you guys can see what's going
on.

00:33:17.649 --> 00:33:19.029
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, we need some cable glue
or something.

00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:21.190
&gt;&gt;Galpin: [laughs] Exactly.

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:22.990
Some duct tape would work, I think.

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:26.169
Yes, that's pretty much all I wanted to say
there.

00:33:26.169 --> 00:33:30.130
As far as the game itself, obviously there
are resolution issues in Orc Genocide.

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:36.180
I'm not, I didn't get to try the WLAN version,
but split screen is kinda awesome.

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:38.320
This is where it really shines, on a tablet.

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:40.990
This is why I want to see them upgrade their
graphics.

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:41.990
We can now--

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.990
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: We can play together here.

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:43.990
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, exactly.

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.990
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Nice.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:48.760
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I can summon towers, you can summon
towers.

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.600
Again, we can start sending guys out.

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:54.929
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh, do I have to explicitly send
guys out, or do they just kinda happen?

00:33:54.929 --> 00:33:58.409
&gt;&gt;Galpin: They just happen if you summon the
right kind of buildings.

00:33:58.409 --> 00:34:04.919
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Okay, apparently I am totally
not summoning the right kind of anything because

00:34:04.919 --> 00:34:07.980
I'm just getting my ass kicked here.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:09.279
&gt;&gt;Galpin: [hums]

00:34:09.279 --> 00:34:11.219
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Whatever, dude.

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:13.659
&gt;&gt;Galpin: [laughs] Well, you know.

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:14.729
It is your first time playing.

00:34:14.729 --> 00:34:16.899
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, what'd I do wrong here?

00:34:16.899 --> 00:34:20.419
&gt;&gt;Galpin: You summoned defense buildings,
but you didn't summon them where I've summoned--.

00:34:20.419 --> 00:34:23.419
You have to summon them actually in front
of where I summoned my--

00:34:23.419 --> 00:34:24.799
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Attack buildings?

00:34:24.799 --> 00:34:26.190
&gt;&gt;Galpin: --attack buildings.

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:28.039
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Sure, sure, sure.

00:34:28.039 --> 00:34:29.039
Yeah.

00:34:29.039 --> 00:34:30.039
That makes sense.

00:34:30.039 --> 00:34:31.729
Okay, well, lesson learned.

00:34:31.729 --> 00:34:32.729
Next game!

00:34:32.729 --> 00:34:34.929
&gt;&gt;Galpin: [laughs] Let's go on to--.

00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:35.929
Let's see.

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:37.819
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Let's get back into the top ten.

00:34:37.819 --> 00:34:40.169
Well, Orc Genocide was in there, right?

00:34:40.169 --> 00:34:41.169
We had the--

00:34:41.169 --> 00:34:42.649
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yes, Orc Genocide was in the top
ten.

00:34:42.649 --> 00:34:43.649
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That's right.

00:34:43.649 --> 00:34:44.649
Did we have a title card for that, Reto?

00:34:44.649 --> 00:34:45.819
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: We absolutely did.

00:34:45.819 --> 00:34:46.819
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Awesome.

00:34:46.819 --> 00:34:47.819
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Did we use it?

00:34:47.819 --> 00:34:48.819
&gt;&gt;Meier: We did.

00:34:48.819 --> 00:34:53.299
While I've got you guys, actually, we have
a couple of questions on the YouTube stream

00:34:53.299 --> 00:34:54.369
and on the event stream.

00:34:54.369 --> 00:34:56.889
I thought I'd throw them out to you.

00:34:56.889 --> 00:34:57.889
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Awesome!!!

00:34:57.889 --> 00:34:58.889
&gt;&gt;Galpin: All right.

00:34:58.889 --> 00:34:59.889
Cool.

00:34:59.889 --> 00:35:00.889
&gt;&gt;Meier: They're fairly straightforward.

00:35:00.889 --> 00:35:01.889
Let's see.

00:35:01.889 --> 00:35:05.509
On YouTube, who'd like to know "Is it easy
to make apps and games if a person doesn't

00:35:05.509 --> 00:35:07.759
know anything about it?

00:35:07.759 --> 00:35:10.640
Can they still do it, or do they have to study
coding or something?

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.670
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Okay, hang on.

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:15.220
First, turn your producer cam on, Reto.

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.809
I think the world wants to see you.

00:35:17.809 --> 00:35:19.719
&gt;&gt;Meier: We can probably do that.

00:35:19.719 --> 00:35:21.499
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It is pretty dark over there, though.

00:35:21.499 --> 00:35:22.980
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Just use the Hangout thing.

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:26.180
Oh no, it's just Reto surrounded by a halo
of light, as always.

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:27.180
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Oh, okay.

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:28.180
&gt;&gt;Meier: Fine.

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:29.180
&gt;&gt;Galpin: There we are.

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:30.630
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: It gets a little bit annoying
sometimes.

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:31.630
&gt;&gt;Galpin: [laughs]

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:34.599
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: The answer to that is, can you
make a game--

00:35:34.599 --> 00:35:35.720
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I'm covered up.

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:36.720
I like this.

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:37.720
Go on.

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:38.720
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: [laughs] There is another shot
that won't cover Dan's face

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.779
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Hold on, let me see.

00:35:39.779 --> 00:35:45.839
Now I can pretend that if Reto looks at the
camera, now he can pretend to be me, and we

00:35:45.839 --> 00:35:47.180
put the hat on.

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:48.190
There we are.

00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:53.130
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: So I think, I've been in video
games for almost 20 years now.

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:58.569
I think it's a really good question: can you
make a video game without knowing coding.

00:35:58.569 --> 00:36:00.900
Well, [pause] no.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:02.299
No, you really can't.

00:36:02.299 --> 00:36:03.299
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, you can't--

00:36:03.299 --> 00:36:08.460
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I mean, there are some tools that
will allow you to try and put together a game,

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:13.239
but eventually it boils down to some form
of coding, whether it's typing in a language

00:36:13.239 --> 00:36:20.150
like C- Sharp or C++ or Java, or whether it's
connecting bricks together in some sort of

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:22.109
a game maker environment.

00:36:22.109 --> 00:36:25.019
You are going to be writing computer instructions.

00:36:25.019 --> 00:36:26.019
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:36:26.019 --> 00:36:29.559
There's certain kinds of tools that allow
you to build really cookie cutter games that

00:36:29.559 --> 00:36:30.779
are very, very similar.

00:36:30.779 --> 00:36:35.230
But even for a Tower Defense game, you want
to know things like pathing.

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:38.039
You want to make sure that those guys are
always following the shortest path.

00:36:38.039 --> 00:36:39.720
That requires a little bit of code.

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.589
You might want to have some AI in a lot of
other kinds of games.

00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:46.869
Even if you have a system that gives you a
lot of stuff for free like that, you're still

00:36:46.869 --> 00:36:47.910
going to want to code.

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:53.480
That being said, there are really great tools
out there that do a lot of work for you.

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:57.959
Honestly, I'm a firm believer that anyone
with the drive can learn how to code.

00:36:57.959 --> 00:36:59.920
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh, I'm not.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:00.920
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Okay.

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.700
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Because I used to teach coding.

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.920
I used to teach computer science.

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.020
&gt;&gt;Galpin: [laughs] Right.

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:12.329
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: The truth is, if coding frustrates
you and you really don't get it, my experience

00:37:12.329 --> 00:37:13.849
is you probably won't get it--

00:37:13.849 --> 00:37:14.849
&gt;&gt;Galpin: --are more than likely not

00:37:14.849 --> 00:37:18.019
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: --because the people that I saw
be really successful in my classes, it clicked

00:37:18.019 --> 00:37:19.519
with them fairly early on.

00:37:19.519 --> 00:37:24.009
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Well, and there's also a difference
between, I think my experience with coding

00:37:24.009 --> 00:37:27.690
classwork versus coding in, one of the people
I went to school with who was terrible at

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:30.819
coding classwork became one of the most sex--
successful engineers I know building tools.

00:37:30.819 --> 00:37:32.599
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: One of the most sexual engineers
you know?

00:37:32.599 --> 00:37:33.599
Yes!

00:37:33.599 --> 00:37:35.299
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Successful engineers I know building
tools.

00:37:35.299 --> 00:37:37.660
&gt;&gt;Meier: Wait, where's the red button here?

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:38.660
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: [laughs]

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:39.660
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:46.109
I would say that mostly, to me, it's all,
at least, a lot of the coding is really just

00:37:46.109 --> 00:37:47.109
about--

00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:48.109
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:49.209
And let's also make a distinction, too.

00:37:49.209 --> 00:37:55.920
If you want to build a game all by yourself,
then yeah, you might be, you might end up

00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:00.220
with one of these tools that help you to make
a cookie cutter game, but there's nothing

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:02.230
really super special about it.

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:08.420
But there are so many things that you can
do with a game that don't involve coding.

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:09.420
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Absolutely.

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:13.239
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: And I think that you would find
that there are far more frustrated coders

00:38:13.239 --> 00:38:20.809
out there with decent game engine ideas and
interesting ideas about game design who don't

00:38:20.809 --> 00:38:25.130
have someone that can produce art or animation
or music.

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:26.130
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Exactly.

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:27.859
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Or even polished level design.

00:38:27.859 --> 00:38:34.989
So if you've got talents for games, and you
can share, if you know how to use Blender

00:38:34.989 --> 00:38:39.760
or MIAP, or if you know how to use Photoshop,
if you know how to write music.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.709
All of these skills are in incredible demand.

00:38:42.709 --> 00:38:46.459
There's lots of people out there that would
love to help you code.

00:38:46.459 --> 00:38:48.759
&gt;&gt;Galpin: There's great modding tools out
there.

00:38:48.759 --> 00:38:52.609
That's one thing you might want to start playing
with, is one of the existing titles that has

00:38:52.609 --> 00:38:55.369
really, really great tools that allow you
to modify the levels.

00:38:55.369 --> 00:38:56.369
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:38:56.369 --> 00:38:59.260
Look at, Bethesda's games always ship with
great modding tools.

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:01.979
I've gotten to the point where I haven't even
finished Skyrim.

00:39:01.979 --> 00:39:03.660
I just like playing with the mods.

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:04.660
Absolutely.

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:05.660
There's some incredible--.

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:07.520
And it really enriches and enhances the games.

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:09.160
We have a lot of games to get through here.

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.160
Is there another question?

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.420
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Do we have another question?

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:15.849
&gt;&gt;Meier: Yeah, one more question, which is
"You mentioned that the Play team reviews

00:39:15.849 --> 00:39:17.799
several times in your shows."

00:39:17.799 --> 00:39:22.479
They're curious to know, "Is there a way to
figure out if your app has already been reviewed?

00:39:22.479 --> 00:39:27.280
It would be nice to have this info, even if
the app is ultimately rejected."

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.779
And the specific reasons.

00:39:28.779 --> 00:39:30.180
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That's a good question.

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:32.349
We have that data.

00:39:32.349 --> 00:39:35.230
If you ping us, we can tell you.

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:41.950
We generally-- [pause] When we suggest apps
and they get rejected, we generally don't

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:47.479
contact the developer unless they got rejected
for a reason that's easy to fix.

00:39:47.479 --> 00:39:50.450
But if you're curious, yeah.

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:53.859
Drop me an email, tell me what game it is,
and I'll look it up for you.

00:39:53.859 --> 00:39:59.700
We might consider making that information
public, but as with all internal information,

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:01.989
making it public involves jumping through
a lot of hoops.

00:40:01.989 --> 00:40:05.180
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I think it's a really interesting
thing.

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:07.650
I think the best thing is to really give feedback.

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:11.881
I think that if a game is rejected because,
well, it's just never going to featured, it's

00:40:11.881 --> 00:40:12.881
not very useful.

00:40:12.881 --> 00:40:17.530
If a game is rejected because it has this
or this wrong with it, then the developer

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:18.599
is contacted.

00:40:18.599 --> 00:40:21.400
I think the real question is, "Was it looked
at at all?"

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.279
A lot of people feel like it goes into a cloud
and they don't know.

00:40:24.279 --> 00:40:27.369
I'd love to at least have a way that a developer
could check.

00:40:27.369 --> 00:40:28.369
That would cool.

00:40:28.369 --> 00:40:29.369
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That would be great.

00:40:29.369 --> 00:40:31.039
Okay, so let's look at a couple--.

00:40:31.039 --> 00:40:35.369
Why don't we take a look at Space Station
now?

00:40:35.369 --> 00:40:39.390
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Oh, yeah!

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:40.519
This is a cool game.

00:40:40.519 --> 00:40:45.580
It does have the button of shame, and it does
have the compatibility mode stuff in it, which

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:46.580
is sad.

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:47.619
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, it is very sad, actually.

00:40:47.619 --> 00:40:52.369
&gt;&gt;Galpin: What is interesting about it, though,
is that it does actually have both HD and

00:40:52.369 --> 00:40:55.619
low resolution graphics, and the graphics
are really different.

00:40:55.619 --> 00:40:57.869
I think that's part of the reason why I love
it.

00:40:57.869 --> 00:41:02.859
I actually, in some ways, liked the low res
layout, but the HD graphics are really, really

00:41:02.859 --> 00:41:03.859
nice.

00:41:03.859 --> 00:41:04.859
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: They're very pretty.

00:41:04.859 --> 00:41:06.759
I'm very impressed.

00:41:06.759 --> 00:41:08.099
The layout isn't quite as creative.

00:41:08.099 --> 00:41:09.869
It doesn't have that circle thing.

00:41:09.869 --> 00:41:13.170
It's just a little bit, feels a little more
thrown together.

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:14.170
But it's very, very crisp.

00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:15.930
Let's go ahead and get into the game.

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:18.519
The interesting thing about this game is that--.

00:41:18.519 --> 00:41:26.739
Well, we've talked about open field games
where the enemies' path is determined by the

00:41:26.739 --> 00:41:27.739
towers that you build.

00:41:27.739 --> 00:41:31.709
We also talked about fixed path games, where
the enemies always follow a single path, no

00:41:31.709 --> 00:41:33.979
matter what you build.

00:41:33.979 --> 00:41:36.049
This is a little more interesting.

00:41:36.049 --> 00:41:42.369
You start with a space station core, and then
you build out from that core.

00:41:42.369 --> 00:41:43.369
[pause]

00:41:43.369 --> 00:41:48.880
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, ultimately, the goal is to--
And you have to do two things.

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:49.880
You've got to--.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.559
You see I've got asteroids surrounding me.

00:41:51.559 --> 00:41:55.509
I've got to actually build power nodes so
that I can mine the asteroids.

00:41:55.509 --> 00:41:56.509
I don't have--

00:41:56.509 --> 00:41:59.180
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Right, so you have a resource
collection issue as well as just a defense

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.180
issue.

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:01.180
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Exactly.

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:06.079
The most important thing is to get mining,
but if you obviously mine too much and you

00:42:06.079 --> 00:42:08.900
don't actually build defenses, then your miners
will just get destroyed.

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:12.599
So you've got to start building things like
turrets.

00:42:12.599 --> 00:42:15.910
And unfortunately, now that I've built miners,
I don't actually have money to build anything

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:16.910
else.

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:20.920
I'm just going to try to collect as much resource
as possible.

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.299
I've got incoming destroyers.

00:42:22.299 --> 00:42:23.920
I'm going to get killed here.

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.529
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Way to go, dude.

00:42:26.529 --> 00:42:27.529
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I'm dead.

00:42:27.529 --> 00:42:28.529
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Where are they coming from?

00:42:28.529 --> 00:42:29.529
Where are they coming from?

00:42:29.529 --> 00:42:30.529
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I don't know.

00:42:30.529 --> 00:42:31.529
Let's see.

00:42:31.529 --> 00:42:32.529
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Over to the left.

00:42:32.529 --> 00:42:33.529
&gt;&gt;Galpin: You can zoom in.

00:42:33.529 --> 00:42:34.529
You can see them in the top.

00:42:34.529 --> 00:42:35.529
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh, yeah, the top.

00:42:35.529 --> 00:42:36.529
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, you can zoom in.

00:42:36.529 --> 00:42:37.529
I'm hosed.

00:42:37.529 --> 00:42:38.529
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Can you build something now?

00:42:38.529 --> 00:42:39.529
You got some money!

00:42:39.529 --> 00:42:40.529
Can you build something?

00:42:40.529 --> 00:42:41.529
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I can't build anything useful.

00:42:41.529 --> 00:42:42.529
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh my God, yeah, the--

00:42:42.529 --> 00:42:43.529
&gt;&gt;Meier: I'm sorry, guys, I'm not sure if
it's from the zoom or something else, but

00:42:43.529 --> 00:42:45.719
the video is no longer coming in.

00:42:45.719 --> 00:42:47.289
I've got a black screen.

00:42:47.289 --> 00:42:48.289
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Oh, hold on.

00:42:48.289 --> 00:42:49.539
Let's try it one more time.

00:42:49.539 --> 00:42:52.579
One, two, three, let's plug this in.

00:42:52.579 --> 00:42:57.170
It is very easy to lose the connection on
this particular micro HDMI.

00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:58.769
&gt;&gt;Meier: That's got it.

00:42:58.769 --> 00:42:59.769
Thanks.

00:42:59.769 --> 00:43:00.769
&gt;&gt;Galpin: There we are.

00:43:00.769 --> 00:43:02.359
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Back to it.

00:43:02.359 --> 00:43:03.749
&gt;&gt;Galpin: All right.

00:43:03.749 --> 00:43:04.749
Yes.

00:43:04.749 --> 00:43:06.180
Building a missile launcher would be super
useful.

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:07.940
I almost have enough money to do that.

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:10.509
Or a rail cannon.

00:43:10.509 --> 00:43:11.959
[pause]

00:43:11.959 --> 00:43:15.990
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Almost, almost there!

00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:17.710
Okay, missile launcher!

00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:22.000
This is cool because most Tower Defense games
will just give you money for enemies killed.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.549
So if you're not killing enemies, you don't
get anything.

00:43:25.549 --> 00:43:27.900
Whereas this one, you've got this continuous
thing.

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:30.719
Even between waves of enemies, you're cranking
up the money.

00:43:30.719 --> 00:43:33.029
I think that's a cool idea.

00:43:33.029 --> 00:43:34.430
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Absolutely.

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:36.759
You'll see now, I have another laser turret.

00:43:36.759 --> 00:43:39.299
It takes time to build things.

00:43:39.299 --> 00:43:45.369
If I don't build the power nodes, then I cannot
actually build out a laser turret there, because

00:43:45.369 --> 00:43:48.559
I only have a limited number of connections,
also.

00:43:48.559 --> 00:43:51.509
There is a lot of detail in this game.

00:43:51.509 --> 00:43:52.839
And you do need to know where people are coming
from.

00:43:52.839 --> 00:43:53.940
So now they're coming from there.

00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:55.660
Do I have any defenses out there?

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:56.660
No.

00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:57.660
That's where all my miners are.

00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:00.920
This is a really serious problem for me now.

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:02.430
I'm going to want to build, oh.

00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:05.479
Do I not have a power node to that miner?

00:44:05.479 --> 00:44:07.160
That's not good.

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:10.229
I'm getting completely squashed here by these
guys.

00:44:10.229 --> 00:44:12.609
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Ooooh.

00:44:12.609 --> 00:44:18.170
Now, how important is the actual topology
of your station?

00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:22.049
Or I should say the physical locations of
things, rather than general topology.

00:44:22.049 --> 00:44:24.650
&gt;&gt;Galpin: The general topology is more important.

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:27.549
You need to make sure there's enough nodes
connecting things.

00:44:27.549 --> 00:44:32.670
Yeah, I'm about to lose the laser turret here,
which is sad.

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:35.059
But at least he'll start firing on that guy.

00:44:35.059 --> 00:44:36.200
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.200
This is interesting.

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:43.460
It is more of a hybrid because the, while
we have a lot of elements of Tower Defense

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:47.039
games, it feels like a Tower Defense game,
the enemies behave very differently.

00:44:47.039 --> 00:44:52.219
They come in from different directions, they
sit there, and they actually attack your towers,

00:44:52.219 --> 00:44:54.029
which is uncommon.

00:44:54.029 --> 00:44:55.729
There are some other Tower Defense games.

00:44:55.729 --> 00:45:00.319
I think one of the other ones, Towers and
Trolls, I think they will attack your towers.

00:45:00.319 --> 00:45:01.329
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yes.

00:45:01.329 --> 00:45:05.640
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I'm a little, I have mixed feelings
on that, because, especially for Towers and

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:09.489
Trolls, that felt a little gimmicky.

00:45:09.489 --> 00:45:13.529
That felt like just, Okay, well, every now
and then, I look and my tower's health is

00:45:13.529 --> 00:45:14.529
down.

00:45:14.529 --> 00:45:16.380
I need to go fix it with some money.

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:17.380
That's annoying.

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:21.390
Whereas this is like they're attacking my
tower and they're stopping to attack--

00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:22.390
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yes.

00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:27.960
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: --so the fact that they're attacking
my tower has some significant impact on the

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.940
way that the defense is going to go.

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:30.940
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Absolutely.

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:33.680
The goal is usually you're to survive for
a period of time.

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:37.460
Usually you're waiting for reinforcements
or something like that.

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:40.790
So you may not necessarily defeat these enemies.

00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:44.240
Your main space station also has a certain
amount of health.

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:48.289
It's holding off various things for a long
enough period of time.

00:45:48.289 --> 00:45:51.549
Let's build one more of these guys.

00:45:51.549 --> 00:45:54.720
It's sending an enormous quantity of enemies
at me right now, so.

00:45:54.720 --> 00:46:00.369
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: But yeah, I think, in terms of
smoothness, it's a pretty smooth game.

00:46:00.369 --> 00:46:02.130
The graphics are pretty good.

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:03.880
I think they could be a little bit higher
resolution.

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:05.329
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Even with the HD--

00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:09.750
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: It always bums me out a little
bit when games allow you to zoom in maybe

00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:11.890
one or two steps further than they should.

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:12.890
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:17.980
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Essentially, as soon as a pixel
in your art covers more than a pixel on the

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:20.549
screen, that's probably where you ought to
stop.

00:46:20.549 --> 00:46:21.549
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:46:21.549 --> 00:46:24.969
I'm about to lose all of my defenses here,
but I only have to survive for another five

00:46:24.969 --> 00:46:25.969
seconds.

00:46:25.969 --> 00:46:26.969
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: There you go.

00:46:26.969 --> 00:46:29.700
&gt;&gt;Galpin: So I may actually make it, despite
everything.

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:30.789
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: You are, yeah.

00:46:30.789 --> 00:46:31.880
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, I see.

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:32.880
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Victory!

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.140
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Even though I got completely obliterated--

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:35.140
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Pyrrhic victory.

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:38.079
&gt;&gt;Galpin: --I still actually made it through
the level.

00:46:38.079 --> 00:46:39.079
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Awesome.

00:46:39.079 --> 00:46:42.710
I think I want to close down with Anomaly
HD.

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:46.670
That is a bit of a genre buster there.

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:51.200
Anomaly puts you sort of on the other side.

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.150
It's a Tower Offense game.

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:54.190
A lot of people have tried this.

00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:57.299
A lot of people have said, "I'm going to build
a Tower Offense game.

00:46:57.299 --> 00:47:00.749
Wouldn't it be interesting if we turned Tower
Defense on its head?"

00:47:00.749 --> 00:47:04.180
This is one that I think has succeeded better
than most.

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:09.259
You can see, first, that they've got an extremely
professional looking intro.

00:47:09.259 --> 00:47:14.989
Really reminds me of a desktop video game
or a console game.

00:47:14.989 --> 00:47:17.520
The UI is very crisp.

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:19.289
The game play is very interesting.

00:47:19.289 --> 00:47:21.170
I wouldn't say they've nailed it.

00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:25.189
I wouldn't say I feel like this is really
the reverse of a Tower Defense game.

00:47:25.189 --> 00:47:27.170
&gt;&gt;Galpin: But it is beautiful.

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:30.349
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, it's a beautiful game, and
it's a lot of fun.

00:47:30.349 --> 00:47:33.260
Essentially, what you do is you're--.

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:39.910
[pause] You have a convoy of enemies, essentially,
that are going to attack towers.

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:42.660
Or try to get through towers.

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:43.719
[pause] Oh.

00:47:43.719 --> 00:47:44.769
Advanced difficulty.

00:47:44.769 --> 00:47:46.359
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Oh yeah.

00:47:46.359 --> 00:47:48.069
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Feeling frisky today, are we?

00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:49.069
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Absolutely.

00:47:49.069 --> 00:47:50.069
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: All right, then.

00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:51.069
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I'm wearing the Android hat.

00:47:51.069 --> 00:47:52.690
I've got the Android Jesus look going.

00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:53.690
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Excellent.

00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:54.690
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Exactly.

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:55.690
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Or Android Santa.

00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:56.690
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Android Santa.

00:47:56.690 --> 00:47:58.119
Something like that.

00:47:58.119 --> 00:48:01.739
[laughs] All right.

00:48:01.739 --> 00:48:04.800
I actually haven't played it on this tablet,
so this is the first time it's run here.

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:09.509
So my apologies, you're getting to see all
of the starting up of the game.

00:48:09.509 --> 00:48:12.130
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, notice how crisp and smooth
all of that is.

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:13.130
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Exactly.

00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:14.799
It's really well done.

00:48:14.799 --> 00:48:19.700
And again, I think, again, even here, I can
zoom in and out.

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:20.930
I can pan around.

00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:23.099
It's, you know.

00:48:23.099 --> 00:48:25.270
I'm now playing, again--.

00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:31.359
My goal is, I can change my route here however
I want to get to the target.

00:48:31.359 --> 00:48:34.019
I can go like that if I want to.

00:48:34.019 --> 00:48:35.759
Obviously, that's not going to help me.

00:48:35.759 --> 00:48:37.420
Again, I just--

00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:41.769
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Well, and you can change it in
the middle of the game, too, right?

00:48:41.769 --> 00:48:43.229
But that's what this game is about.

00:48:43.229 --> 00:48:49.210
It's about planning your route based on where
the towers are.

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:50.989
You do have some offensive weaponry.

00:48:50.989 --> 00:48:54.009
You also end up getting power ups through
the game.

00:48:54.009 --> 00:48:58.920
Planning the route and determining when to
deploy your power ups is the extent of the

00:48:58.920 --> 00:48:59.920
game play.

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:02.939
It ends up being a lot of fun.

00:49:02.939 --> 00:49:03.939
When I played it--.

00:49:03.939 --> 00:49:05.900
Check that out.

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:06.900
Wow.

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:10.089
That's a great transition, and those are some
beautiful graphics.

00:49:10.089 --> 00:49:14.930
When I actually played the game, it held my
attention for a while.

00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:22.049
Eventually, I felt like the number of choices
I had in the game play maybe weren't enough

00:49:22.049 --> 00:49:24.660
to keep my interest for a long time.

00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:25.680
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Mmhmm.

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:26.680
This is--

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:27.680
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: But there are some--.

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:29.309
They do have some interesting twists.

00:49:29.309 --> 00:49:30.309
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:49:30.309 --> 00:49:31.689
This is what the strategic part is.

00:49:31.689 --> 00:49:34.809
I can deploy a repair icon as well.

00:49:34.809 --> 00:49:38.509
Then I tap where I want it to be deployed.

00:49:38.509 --> 00:49:43.029
In this case, I want it to be deployed on
top of my guys here.

00:49:43.029 --> 00:49:44.029
So boom.

00:49:44.029 --> 00:49:45.230
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Now you can start 'em going.

00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:46.880
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Now I can start 'em going.

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:49.670
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: [deep voice] Checkpoint!

00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:52.049
&gt;&gt;Galpin: And you see, I've got a certain
amount of repairs.

00:49:52.049 --> 00:49:54.809
I've got to use that strategically, also,
in the game.

00:49:54.809 --> 00:49:55.809
[pause]

00:49:55.809 --> 00:49:56.969
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: [deep voice] Boom!

00:49:56.969 --> 00:49:58.259
Look at that.

00:49:58.259 --> 00:50:01.279
They've got some smoke, they've got shadows.

00:50:01.279 --> 00:50:05.119
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, there's all sorts of great
things going on here.

00:50:05.119 --> 00:50:09.549
Again, this is a game that could have been
done as a 2-D game.

00:50:09.549 --> 00:50:16.749
But doing it in 3-D just allows-- Obviously,
I just start from checkpoint.

00:50:16.749 --> 00:50:17.749
Yes.

00:50:17.749 --> 00:50:20.380
Doing it in 3-D just allows for that much
more awesomeness.

00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:24.150
In this case, you can see all these details
are enabled through 3-D.

00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:27.569
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: You can drop the repair down there
or something.

00:50:27.569 --> 00:50:28.809
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:50:28.809 --> 00:50:31.300
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: [sneezes] Excuse me.

00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:32.450
That's a sneeze.

00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:33.450
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Bless you.

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:34.450
All right.

00:50:34.450 --> 00:50:35.450
Gesundheit, Gesundheit.

00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:36.450
All right.

00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:37.450
Let's repair a little bit there.

00:50:37.450 --> 00:50:38.450
Come on, guys!

00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:39.450
I've only got one repair left!

00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:40.880
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, and that's really what it
is.

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:45.119
How you deploy the repairs and the other power
ups is--.

00:50:45.119 --> 00:50:47.269
And see, in this case, you really haven't
deployed it well.

00:50:47.269 --> 00:50:51.729
You need to deploy it so the trailing edge
is there.

00:50:51.729 --> 00:50:56.549
But every time you destroy a tower, this airplane
comes by and drops you something cool.

00:50:56.549 --> 00:50:59.141
It's a great effect, although I did kinda
get mad at it after a while, because it's

00:50:59.141 --> 00:51:04.440
like, "Hey, airplane, why don't you just drop
the stuff I need when I need it?"

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:05.599
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Exactly!

00:51:05.599 --> 00:51:06.599
But then the game would be--

00:51:06.599 --> 00:51:07.599
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:51:07.599 --> 00:51:09.369
Video game world logic doesn't always make
sense.

00:51:09.369 --> 00:51:12.039
Anyway, we're just about out of time.

00:51:12.039 --> 00:51:14.259
But we did want to show you Anomaly War Zone
Earth.

00:51:14.259 --> 00:51:15.589
It's a great game.

00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:17.299
Really, really impressive graphics.

00:51:17.299 --> 00:51:19.539
Like I said, the game play maybe isn't for
everybody.

00:51:19.539 --> 00:51:21.999
It's certainly not a Tower Defense game.

00:51:21.999 --> 00:51:25.089
But it's an interesting riff of the genre,
so we like it.

00:51:25.089 --> 00:51:28.439
Thanks a lot, everyone, for all your Tower
Defense suggestions.

00:51:28.439 --> 00:51:31.579
Now, we tried to get through as many suggestions
as we could today.

00:51:31.579 --> 00:51:32.689
And, I don't know.

00:51:32.689 --> 00:51:36.339
Part of me feels like that was awesome, and
part of me feels like maybe we didn't get

00:51:36.339 --> 00:51:39.359
through, or maybe we didn't spend enough time
on each game.

00:51:39.359 --> 00:51:40.359
What do you think?

00:51:40.359 --> 00:51:42.799
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Well, you know, I will personally
say that I've spent an enormous amount of

00:51:42.799 --> 00:51:43.799
time playing these games.

00:51:43.799 --> 00:51:48.039
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: No, I meant talking about them
on the show.

00:51:48.039 --> 00:51:49.420
&gt;&gt;Galpin: [laughs] I'm kidding.

00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:50.420
Yeah, no.

00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:53.229
I think that we really gave people a feeling
of the genre.

00:51:53.229 --> 00:51:55.400
We got through some of the best games.

00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:57.680
Hopefully, there's a few that we didn't get
through.

00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.730
We will definitely do another segment like
this.

00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:00.730
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh, no question, no question.

00:52:00.730 --> 00:52:03.119
&gt;&gt;Galpin: There's so many Tower Defense games
out there.

00:52:03.119 --> 00:52:04.259
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:52:04.259 --> 00:52:05.339
Let us know what you'd like to see.

00:52:05.339 --> 00:52:07.470
Let us know what you think of today's show.

00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:09.109
We're very interested to know.

00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:13.599
Now, again, the edited version will be up
on YouTube momentarily.

00:52:13.599 --> 00:52:15.249
Hopefully tonight.

00:52:15.249 --> 00:52:19.699
And next week, we will be back with another
theme, which is driving games.

00:52:19.699 --> 00:52:22.529
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Now get busy and nominate, because
I don't think there's--.

00:52:22.529 --> 00:52:23.589
Last time I looked, there was nothing.

00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:24.589
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: There was nothing, yeah.

00:52:24.589 --> 00:52:25.589
&gt;&gt;Galpin: There was nothing in the categories.

00:52:25.589 --> 00:52:28.479
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Unlike Tower Defense, driving
games is a pretty broad category.

00:52:28.479 --> 00:52:32.349
We're not going to kick anything out as long
as it involves driving [something scrapes]

00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:33.349
in some ways.

00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:34.349
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Exactly.

00:52:34.349 --> 00:52:37.750
You don't want just my nominations, because
ultimately, I will just nominate the whole

00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:38.750
category.

00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:39.750
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: And they will be all about zombies.

00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:41.839
&gt;&gt;Meier: To be clear, does that include golf
games?

00:52:41.839 --> 00:52:42.839
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: No.

00:52:42.839 --> 00:52:43.839
&gt;&gt;Galpin: No.

00:52:43.839 --> 00:52:44.839
No.

00:52:44.839 --> 00:52:47.400
We are talking about games where you drive
a vehicle.

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:48.400
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Driving.

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:49.400
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Driving, yeah.

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:50.730
But that is a good point, though.

00:52:50.730 --> 00:52:51.799
That is a good point.

00:52:51.799 --> 00:52:52.799
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:52:52.799 --> 00:52:56.799
Thank you for clarifying, because we would
have had some embarrassing situations on our

00:52:56.799 --> 00:52:57.799
hands, Reto.

00:52:57.799 --> 00:52:58.799
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:52:58.799 --> 00:52:59.849
Well, actually, it could have been quite entertaining,
really.

00:52:59.849 --> 00:53:00.859
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Indeed.

00:53:00.859 --> 00:53:02.911
So what do you think about something like
Demolition Earth?

00:53:02.911 --> 00:53:03.911
Is that a driving game?

00:53:03.911 --> 00:53:04.911
There are cars, right?

00:53:04.911 --> 00:53:05.911
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, yeah.

00:53:05.911 --> 00:53:07.630
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: But you're not driving them, you're
just--

00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:11.089
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Well, you know, a game like--.

00:53:11.089 --> 00:53:15.549
I think any kind of racing game is really
what we're talking about here, to a large

00:53:15.549 --> 00:53:16.549
degree.

00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:18.500
But if it has driving as a major mechanic,
we'll consider it.

00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:19.869
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Okay, sounds good.

00:53:19.869 --> 00:53:21.660
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Racing would probably be a little
closer.

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:25.160
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: So we're talking about things
like Lane Splitter or the--

00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:27.180
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Need for Speed and Asphalt.

00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:29.749
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Need for Speed, Fast and Furious,
that kind of thing.

00:53:29.749 --> 00:53:30.749
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Exactly.

00:53:30.749 --> 00:53:31.749
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: All right.

00:53:31.749 --> 00:53:35.349
So go ahead and nominate your favorites, especially
nominate the favorites that you haven't seen

00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:37.170
us feature or that aren't from the big guys.

00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:38.170
We'd really love to--

00:53:38.170 --> 00:53:39.329
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I consider Grand Theft Auto to be
a driving game.

00:53:39.329 --> 00:53:41.750
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That's true, it is frequently
a driving game.

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:42.750
Absolutely.

00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:43.750
Yeah.

00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:44.750
So nominate your favorite driving games.

00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:45.750
We'll love to take a look at them.

00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:47.609
We'll probably take the top five.

00:53:47.609 --> 00:53:53.030
We might drop a couple of them out if it's
something that Google Play has featured in

00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:57.839
the past or has given a lot of promotion to,
because the intent of this show is to find

00:53:57.839 --> 00:54:01.559
the stuff that really hasn't been looked at
as much.

00:54:01.559 --> 00:54:02.559
But either way.

00:54:02.559 --> 00:54:03.799
Nominate what you want.

00:54:03.799 --> 00:54:08.700
And also, when you nominate something, please
include your Google Play ID, or link to your

00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:14.579
Google Play profile, because, whereas in the
past, we've had the developers on, now that

00:54:14.579 --> 00:54:17.539
anyone can nominate, we actually want to know
why you like the game.

00:54:17.539 --> 00:54:21.209
If you'd like to come on the Hangout with
us and talk about why you like a particular

00:54:21.209 --> 00:54:27.380
game, if you include your Google+ link, we
will absolutely invite you to the Hangout

00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:29.160
and get you on air.

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:30.869
So is that about it?

00:54:30.869 --> 00:54:31.869
&gt;&gt;Galpin: That's about it.

00:54:31.869 --> 00:54:32.959
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: All right.

00:54:32.959 --> 00:54:35.349
We'll see you next week when we talk about
driving games.

00:54:35.349 --> 00:54:35.499
Thanks for joining us.
