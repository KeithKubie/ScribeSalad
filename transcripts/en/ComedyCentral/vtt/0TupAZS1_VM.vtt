00:00:01.368 --> 00:00:11.378
NOW IT'S TIME TO PLAY "THUG LIFE
OR HUG LIFE?"

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:13.447
&gt;&gt; IF YOU DON'T KNOW "UNEXPECTED
THUG LIFE"

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.882
THEN YOU DON'T KNOW ( BLEEP ).

00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:20.320
IT'S A CLASSIC INTERNET MEME
THAT EXPOSED SEEMINGLY INNOCENT

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:24.791
KIDS FOR THE HARD-ASS
MOTHERSUCKERS THEY ARE.

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:26.860
THIS IS WHAT THUG LIFE IS ALL
ABOUT.

00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:29.596
&gt;&gt; SAY HELLO TO THE CAMERA.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:37.437
HELLO MOTHER(BLEEP).

00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:41.909
&gt;&gt; I NEVER WANTED TO BE A FATHER
UNTIL RIGHT NOW.

00:00:41.942 --> 00:00:43.644
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: COMEDIANS I'M GOING TO
SHOW YOU A STILL OF SOMETHING

00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:45.512
ADORABLE AND FOR 250 POINTS, I
WANT YOU TO TELL ME IF THEY'RE

00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:49.750
CUTE LITTLE THUGS OR CUTE LITTLE
HUGS.

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:55.556
THE FIRST ONE, THIS GODDAMN
GINGER.

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:57.124
&gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO GO THUG LIFE.

00:00:57.157 --> 00:01:09.069
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: LET'S SEE.

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:13.006
&gt;&gt; EXCUSE MY POTTY MOUTH. SHUT
THE (BLEEP) UP.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.045
&gt;&gt; I HAVE TO GIVE RICHIE
CUNNINGHAM CREDIT FOR SAYING,

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:18.912
"EXCUSE MY LANGUAGE.

00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:21.181
SHUT THE ( BLEEP ) UP!" HE'S
VERY POLITE.

00:01:21.215 --> 00:01:23.450
&gt;&gt; THAT'S MY GINGE.

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:27.087
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: OH MY GOD, THERE'S TWO
OF YA.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.055
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: NEXT ONE.

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:30.791
HOW ABOUT THESE ADORABLE
CHILDREN?

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:32.359
JONAH?

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:34.595
&gt;&gt; HUG LIFE.

00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:47.941
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: I THINK YOU MAY BE
SURPRISED.

00:01:47.975 --> 00:01:51.979
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:01:52.012 --> 00:01:55.015
&gt;&gt; AS SOON AS HE STARTED
MUTTERING, THE BABY SHOULD HAVE

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:57.484
BEEN TAKEN AWAY.

00:01:57.518 --> 00:02:00.988
LIKE ANY WOMAN KNOWS AS SOON AS
A GUY IS MUTTERING ON THE

00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:02.456
SUBWAY, YOU SWITCH CARS.

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:03.924
&gt;&gt; I DID NOT EXPECT THAT.

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:06.226
THAT WAS SO ( BLEEP )ED UP.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.561
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: THEY'RE FINE,
PROBABLY.

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:13.033
&gt;&gt; I FEEL BAD FOR THE PARENT
THAT FILMS IT AND JUST GOES,

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.168
"THUG LIFE MEME."

00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:16.670
&gt;&gt; DON'T WORRY, WE'LL MAKE
ANOTHER ONE.

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:24.111
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS TAKE FOUR.

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:28.782
&gt;&gt; IT WAS A WHOLE BUCKET OF
BABIES THEY WERE GOING THROUGH.

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:32.152
A BUCKET OF BABIES.

00:02:32.186 --> 00:02:34.254
NEXT ONE, WHAT ABOUT THIS MATH
WHIZ?

00:02:34.288 --> 00:02:36.323
THUG LIFE OR HUG LIFE?

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:37.758
JULIE?

00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:40.527
&gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO HOPE HUG LIFE.

00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:42.896
&gt;&gt; I LOVE HOW PEOPLE ARE TELLING
ME I'M, LIKE, TWO-NINE YEARS

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:43.797
OLD.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.571
I'M ELEVEN, SO SHUT THE (BLEEP)
UP.

00:02:50.604 --> 00:02:52.239
THIS LI'L SELFIE.

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:54.041
THUG LIFE OR HUG LIFE?

00:02:54.074 --> 00:02:55.576
&gt;&gt; JONAH?

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:00.280
&gt;&gt; THUG LIFE BECAUSE HE LOOKS
LIKE A YOUNG EMINEM.

00:03:00.314 --> 00:03:04.952
&gt;&gt; "HEY KIDS, ARE YOU READY FOR
"MODERN WARFARE 3"? WELL,

00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:11.825
YOU'RE NOT OLD ENOUGH TO PLAY
IT, SO GET THE (BLEEP) OFF."

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.493
&gt;&gt; HE ALMOST DIDN'T MAKE IT.

00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:16.163
HE ALMOST WENT HUG.

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:18.832
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT'S HUG LIFE.

00:03:18.866 --> 00:03:19.266
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: HE WAS ON THE BORDER
OF HUG AND WENT STRAIGHT INTO

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.701
THUG.

00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:26.940
SHUT THE ( BLEEP ) UP.

00:03:26.974 --> 00:03:29.476
WHY ARE YOU WHISPERING SO YOUR
PARENTS WON'T HEAR

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.579
WHEN YOU WILL PUT IT ON THE
INTERNET?

00:03:32.613 --> 00:03:34.047
THIS ONE MAY SURPRISE YOU.

00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:35.382
THUG LIFE OR HUG LIFE?

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:37.217
&gt;&gt; I'LL SAY THUG LIFE BECAUSE
THEY'VE ALL BEEN THUG LIFE.

00:03:37.251 --> 00:03:40.454
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID YOU
LEARN IN SCHOOL TODAY?

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:43.056
HE LEARNED NOT TO GO PEE PEE IN
YOUR PANTS, HUH?

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.156
YAYY, GOOD JOB!
