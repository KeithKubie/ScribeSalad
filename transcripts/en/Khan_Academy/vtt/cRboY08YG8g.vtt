00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.560
In the last video, we were
able to get a pretty good sense

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.630
about how large of an x we
should cut out of each corner

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.030
in order to maximize our volume.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.254
And we did this graphically.

00:00:12.254 --> 00:00:13.670
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.760
use some of our calculus
tools to see if we can come up

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.054
with the same or maybe
even a better result.

00:00:19.054 --> 00:00:20.970
So to do that, I'm going
to have to figure out

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.000
the critical points of our
volume as a function of x.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.800
And to do that, I need to take
the derivative of the volume.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.810
So let me do that.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.660
And before I even do that,
it'll simplify things

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.950
so I don't have to use the
product rule in some way

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.540
and then have to
simplify that, let

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.830
me just multiply
this expression out.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.670
So let's rewrite volume as a
function of x is equal to--

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.610
and I'll write it all in yellow.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.710
So it's going to
be x times-- I'll

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.450
multiply these two
binomials first.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.310
So 20 times 30 is 600.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.500
Then I have 20 times negative
2x, which is negative 40x.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.470
Then I have negative 2x times
30, which is negative 60x.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.010
And then I have negative
2x times negative 2x,

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.620
which is positive 4x squared.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.360
So this part over
here simplifies

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:21.190
and I can change the order to
4x squared minus 100x plus 600.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.690
I just switched the order
in which I'm writing them.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:24.910
So that's that.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.260
And so I can rewrite
the volume of x

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.635
as being equal to x times all
of this business, which is-- let

00:01:30.635 --> 00:01:32.010
me make sure I
have enough space,

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.509
let me do it a
little higher-- which

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.710
is equal to 4x to the third
power minus 100x squared

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.985
plus 600x.

00:01:41.985 --> 00:01:43.860
And that'll be pretty
straightforward to take

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.980
the derivative.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.720
So let's say that v prime of
x is going to be equal to-- I

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.280
just have used the power rule
multiple times-- so 4 times 3

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.740
is 12.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.910
x to the 3 minus 1 power
12x squared minus 200 times

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:07.770
x to the first power,
which is just x, plus 600.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.940
And so now we just
have to figure out

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.810
when this is equal to 0.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.600
So we have to figure
out when 12x squared

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.830
minus 200x plus
600 is equal to 0.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.090
What x values gets my
derivative to be equal to 0?

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.299
When is my slope equal to 0?

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:27.840
I could also look
for critical points

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.720
where the derivative
is undefined,

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.640
but this derivative
is defined especially

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.980
throughout my domain of x that
I care about, between 0 and 10.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.620
So I could try to
factor this or try

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.910
to simplify this a little bit.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.493
But I'm just going
to cut to the chase

00:02:45.493 --> 00:02:47.810
and try to use the
quadratic formula here.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.390
So this is, the x's
that satisfy this

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.580
is going to be x is going to
be equal to-- So negative b.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.580
So it's 200.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.740
Negative, negative
200 is positive 200.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.910
Plus or minus the square
root of b squared,

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.340
which is negative 200 squared.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.812
So I could just write
that as 200 squared.

00:03:09.812 --> 00:03:12.270
Doesn't matter if it's negative
200 squared or 200 squared,

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.080
I'm going to get the same value.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.510
So let me give myself
some more space.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.210
So negative 200 squared.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.320
Well, that's going
to be 4 with 4 0's.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.620
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.280
So that's going to
be 40,000 minus 4ac.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:36.340
So minus 4 times
12, 12 times 600--

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.550
I still didn't give myself
enough space-- times 600.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.860
All of that over 2 times a.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.990
So all of that over 24.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.740
And I'll take out the calculator
again to try to calculate this.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.970
So let me get out
of graphing mode.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.970
All right, so first I'll
try when I add the radical.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:05.920
So I'm going to get 200 plus
the square root of 40,000.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.974
I could have just written
that as 200 squared,

00:04:08.974 --> 00:04:09.640
but that's fine.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:18.320
40,000 minus 4
times 12 times 600.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.750
And I get 305, which I
then need to divide by 24.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.470
Which I'll divide by
24, and I get 12.74.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.670
So one of my possible x's.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.959
So it equals 12.74.

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:36.500
And now let me do
the situation where

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.100
I subtract what I had
in the radical sign.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.960
So let me get my
calculator back.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.772
And so now let me
do 200-- I probably

00:04:43.772 --> 00:04:45.730
could have done this
slightly more efficiently,

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:51.870
but this is fine-- minus the
square root of 40,000-- 1, 2,

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:59.810
3-- minus 4 times 12 times 600.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.790
And I get that's
just the numerator.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:09.547
And then I'm going to divide
that by 24, and I get 3.92.

00:05:09.547 --> 00:05:10.380
Did I do that right?

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.170
200 minus 40,000 minus 4 times
12 times 600, all of that

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.360
divided by 24.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.060
My previous answer divided
by 24 gives me 3.92.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.390
So it's 12.74 or 3.92.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.710
Now which of these can I use?

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:36.890
Well x equals 12.74 is outside
of our valid values for x.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:42.190
If x was equal to
12.74, the x's would

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.720
start to overlap
with each other.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.070
So x cannot be 12.74.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.580
So we get a critical point
at x is equal to 3.92.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.830
And you could look at the
graph and you could say, oh,

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.550
well look, that looks
like a maximum value.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.440
But if you didn't have the
graph at your disposal,

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.440
you can then do the
second derivative test

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.370
and say, hey, are we concave
upwards or concave downwards

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.410
when x is equal to 3.92?

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.410
Well, in order to do the
second derivative test,

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.409
you have to figure out
the second derivative is.

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:12.940
So let's do that.
b prime prime of x

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:19.960
is going to be equal to 24x,
24 times x to the first,

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.240
minus 200.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.980
And you can just
look at inspection

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.890
that this number right
over here is less than 4.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.610
So this thing right over here
is going to be less than 100.

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.170
You subtract 200.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:40.140
So we can write the
second derivative at 3.92

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.670
is going to be less than 0.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:44.770
You can figure out what the
exact value is if you like.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.005
So because this is less than
0, we are concave downwards.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.610
Another way of saying
it is the slope

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.470
is decreasing the entire time.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:57.600
Concave downwards.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.770
When the slope is
decreasing the entire time,

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:00.980
our shape looks like that.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.350
The slope could start off
high, lower, lower, gets to 0,

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.070
even lower, lower, lower.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.410
And we even saw that on
the graph right over here.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.240
And since it's
concave downwards,

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.860
that implies that our
critical point that

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.820
sits where the interval
is concave downward,

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.435
that critical point
is a local maximum.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.000
So this is the x value
at which our function

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.520
attains our maximum.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.820
Now what is that maximum value?

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.060
Well, we could type that back
in into our original expression

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.170
for volume to
figure what that is.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:43.350
So let's figure out what the
volume when we get to 3.92

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:44.090
is equal to.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:45.790
What is our maximum volume?

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.900
So get the calculator back out.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.940
It's obviously roughly 3.92.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.340
I could use this exact value.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.010
Actually, I'll just use 3.92
to get a rough sense of what

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:59.070
our maximum value is,
our maximum volume.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:05.640
So it'll be 3.92.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.420
I'll just use this
expression for the volume

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:09.810
as a function of x.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:29.260
3.92 times 20 minus 2 times
3.92 times 30 minus 2 times 3.92

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:36.630
gives us-- and we deserve a drum
roll now-- gives us 1,056.3.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:42.470
So 1,056.3, which
is a higher volume

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:44.710
then we got when we just
inspected it graphically.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.425
We probably could have gotten
a little bit more precise

00:08:47.425 --> 00:08:50.050
if we zoomed in some and then we
would have gotten a little bit

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.080
better of an answer,
but there you have it.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.830
Analytically, we were
able to actually get

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.270
an even better
answer than we were

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:58.666
able to do at least on that
first pass graphically.
