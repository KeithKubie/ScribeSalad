Speaker 1:          00:01          Number two.

Speaker 2:          00:02          I hear, I hear the sound of a telephone. Hello. Hi. Bodies Assembly. A story from Greg Warner. Yes. Hi Jed. Greg is a NPRs east African correspondent. You are in, what time is it where you are? It's um, it's evening is based in Nairobi, around seven 30 in the evening, which is embarrassing cause I just told you good morning in Swahili. Um, but I forgot how to say. Good evening. So, oh, okay. So Greg, I mean we were just, uh, anyhow, we called Greg up because he had written this article for this great website called transom.org about being a foreign reporter and working with translators and all the mishaps, you know, when you have to go from one language to another. But there's actually a really good example that I didn't use in the piece about the failures to communicate. I can tell you that story.

Speaker 2:          00:50          Sure, sure. Yeah. So, so there's this word and you wouldn't think of it as untranslatable, but it's the word serious. And when serious, serious, serious, like S. E. R. I. O. U. S. Okay. Um, in my experience when you hear this word serious in east Africa does not mean solemn or thoughtful or stern. It actually almost never has something to do with your mood, but serious tends to mean is, are you just talking to me or are you serious? Are you doing something? And usually doing is like some kind of transaction, usually financial. I've been asked by many east African officials, are you going to be serious with me? And it obviously means, are you going to pay me a bribe? Usually I pretend to misunderstand that that key moment I said, yes, I'm a very serious international journalists and um, but the story that I want to tell you, uh, took place a couple months ago.

Speaker 3:          01:49          Good afternoon everybody. Um, I'm really pleased to be back in Africa. Secretary Kerry, Addis Ababa visited Ethiopia and city have enormous energy and the country. Few days before Carrie's visit, nine journalists had been arrested under this relatively recent anti terrorism law that basically says that any criticism of the government is illegal. I had a series of very productive meetings this morning with my foreign minister counterparts and secretary Kerry was giving this press conference. I shared my concerns about a young Ethiopian blogger that I met last year, uh, [inaudible] who, uh, with eight of his peers had been in prison. And I firmly believed that the work of journalists, whether it's print journalists or in the internet or media of other kinds, it makes societies stronger.

Speaker 2:          02:41          You know, he said all the things you'd, you'd expect him to say. He said, um, we believe that free speech and open dialogue is important to the economic development of a country, blah, blah, blah. But

Speaker 3:          02:49          we remain committed to our partnership with Ethiopia, with [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          02:53          This comment was also wrapped up in a lot of praise of Ethiopia engaged, and

Speaker 3:          02:58          I'd be delighted to answer a few questions. I'm not sure how that's even do that.

Speaker 2:          03:02          Then keep time for questions. He could took some vetted questions from the Ethiopian journalists to more from the traveling press and to carry [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          03:10          credit. Are you all give this gentleman? I want to give them a shot. I know he was very impatient. I'm going to sort of wait for, he left the podium, he was like, you know what, we're just going to try something different. We're gonna like call on an Ethiopian journalist. I want to make sure we get a fair distribution here.

Speaker 2:          03:24          Kerry pointed this one guy in the second row, young guy in his twenties, boyish face wearing a [inaudible]. I have only two questions for you, sir.

Speaker 3:          03:32          I may have invited the hardest question of the day now, but one question. Fair enough. Okay,

Speaker 2:          03:37          so let me choose. Uh, you have raised the issues of uh, Nathanael's [inaudible] who is a blogger and his friends. Yeah. In Mark 11, and then this guy's like, well, every time a journalist is arrested, the u s gives a statement about this, but these things are, this keeps happening, repeated, repeating. Very much so. Then he asks his question, is it lip service or are you seriously concerned about Zerorez? Is this lip service or are you seriously concerned? [inaudible] at this point, everybody's just not looking at Carrie. They're all looking at this journalist too. Obviously had to take considerable personal risks in a place like Ethiopia. In a crowd of journalists, including state run TV stations. He's, this guy's on camera asking this extremely sensitive question about the arrested journalists. We really demand a genuine answer from you. Thank you. And Carrie looks at him

Speaker 3:          04:39          like, well, you got to be kidding. When I stand up in public and I, and I, and I say something, uh, I, I try to be serious about it and I think the fact that I'm doing that is serious. And when I raised him by name in my comments today,

Speaker 2:          04:58          I can't, it sounds to me like he's sort of insulted by the question. And so, so remember serious, the word serious in east Africa can be translated very much as are you doing something preferably like a financial transaction, right? And so what this journalist is saying is, are you just talking about this or are you doing something maybe threatening if you be with a withdrawing aid or withdrawing support? And Carrie says, I am very seriously talking about that.

Speaker 3:          05:28          We have previously called for the release, uh, these individuals. And that is the policy of our government. And it's a serious policy. Thank you. Thank you all very, very much appreciate it.

Speaker 2:          05:40          And it seemed to me maybe, you know, you can judge, but it seemed like he was almost like, look, I'm like the most serious politician that's out there. I mean, I lost the presidential race in 2004 in part because I was deemed too serious by the American public, you know, like, what are you accusing me of? Not being serious. We put in a number of requests to speak to John Kerry or someone in the State Department, but there was no response. Do you think he was aware of the misunderstanding who carry this? Uh, this felon? Oh yeah, no, no. I followed him out afterwards. Hey, minute, minute. Can you pronounce your name for me? My name is [inaudible]. He's a easy young guy in his twenties he's an independent journalists. Yeah. I used to work in different newspapers and I was like, you know, when you, when you listen what happened there? And I almost felt like I had some kind of cultural, a guide maybe because that Americans think serious means I'm standing here. I'm not joking, I'm serious. But when African spacey series and I'm using a generally they say no. Are you going to not just speak? Are you going to do, yeah. [inaudible] that's exactly my point. Are you going to take sanctions? Maybe [inaudible] yeah. Do you feel that that question puts you at risk? Maybe. Who knows? Is that is a job description doing good journalism Muni tape yet.

Speaker 2:          07:01          Thanks so much. Thank you. Yeah. I'll give you a call. Give me a call. My number is on there. Yeah, so that conversation was about five months ago. Did do you know what his fate at all? Let me have you found out why there? Did he suffer for this question in any way? No, but I have his phone number so I can give him a call and find out. Hello? Hi [inaudible]. It's Gregory, Gregory Warner. Oh, good ego. I'm good. I'm good. Sorry. I reached him by Skype. He told me that actually after that press conference he did get strange calls to his home and some Facebook messages from people who didn't know telling him that he better rethink what he said.

Speaker 4:          07:42          Yeah, they are lying. Not Too with the current government direction and that

Speaker 2:          07:48          they said you should line up with the government's priorities. These messages were from the government. It's hard to tell. It has been reported that this Ethiopian Anti Terrorism Task Force will wage social media attacks by getting people to send messages on its behalf.

Speaker 4:          08:04          [inaudible] John PK reason, the task force are the ones that seem to these kind of [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          08:09          and were they threatening? Yeah,

Speaker 4:          08:11          some of them were, you know, [inaudible] that I would be punished accordingly when the train comes and it might come one day

Speaker 2:          08:22          the newspaper he founded got shut down after publishing one issue and he was planning for a while to fleet in Nairobi.

Speaker 4:          08:30          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          08:30          leave his wife and kid behind and then maybe return grabbed them, apply for asylum in the United States.
