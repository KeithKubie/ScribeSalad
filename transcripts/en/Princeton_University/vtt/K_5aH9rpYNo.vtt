LEKHA KANCHINADAM: The Humanities Sequence is all-encompassing.
We try to get music, philosophy, literature,

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.340 position:70%
history, politics, and we get professors that
are experts in the discipline to come and

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.250 position:88%
lecture.

works in relation to each other and you can

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.310 position:64%
see how one flows into the other; how two
texts present the same ideas.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.310 position:97%
ANDREW FRAZIER: As a freshman it sets you up for so many different
disciplines because it gives you, you know

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.039 position:70%
it builds you a scaffolding of all of Western
thought.

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.149 position:66%
goes, so it starts with Homer and goes all
the way up to Dante.

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.149 position:83%
PAUL FANTO: This new semester right now we're reading

in the music department. Professor Burnham

Don Giovanni, and this is while we were reading
Don Juan which has a lot of different parallels

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.240 position:98%
to it.
MAELI GOREN: You should not let the fact that it's an application

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.450 position:66%
process scare you because first of all you
