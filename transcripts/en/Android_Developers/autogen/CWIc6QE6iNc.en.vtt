series making apps beautiful thus far
 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.360
series making apps beautiful thus far
we've built a an app that didn't have a

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370
we've built a an app that didn't have a
 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.730
we've built a an app that didn't have a
lot of love we modernized it we

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740
lot of love we modernized it we
 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.519
lot of love we modernized it we
performance-tuned it but what we didn't

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529
performance-tuned it but what we didn't
 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.160
performance-tuned it but what we didn't
do is make it look exactly the same on

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170
do is make it look exactly the same on
 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.679
do is make it look exactly the same on
older versions of Android as compared to

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689
older versions of Android as compared to
 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.710
older versions of Android as compared to
newer versions so just to just to see

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720
newer versions so just to just to see
 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.810
newer versions so just to just to see
exactly where we were up to there let's

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820
exactly where we were up to there let's
 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.780
exactly where we were up to there let's
look at our app on an xss running

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790
look at our app on an xss running
 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.420
look at our app on an xss running
android 2.3 gingerbread so we're just

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430
android 2.3 gingerbread so we're just
 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.970
android 2.3 gingerbread so we're just
starting it up and here it is nice and

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980
starting it up and here it is nice and
 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.799
starting it up and here it is nice and
smooth but if we look at the title bar

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809
smooth but if we look at the title bar
 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.529
smooth but if we look at the title bar
it's it's the old style there is no

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539
it's it's the old style there is no
 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.400
it's it's the old style there is no
action bar here it's it's you wouldn't

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410
action bar here it's it's you wouldn't
 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.470
action bar here it's it's you wouldn't
call this a very modern looking app even

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480
call this a very modern looking app even
 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.520
call this a very modern looking app even
though it's running on an older version

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530
though it's running on an older version
 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.090
though it's running on an older version
of the platform and we can do better so

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100
of the platform and we can do better so
 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.360
of the platform and we can do better so
let's switch back to the slides and

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370
let's switch back to the slides and
 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.279
let's switch back to the slides and
let's talk about backward compatible

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289
let's talk about backward compatible
 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.160
let's talk about backward compatible
action bars so there are a number of

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170
action bars so there are a number of
 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.590
action bars so there are a number of
options that you have when it you when

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600
options that you have when it you when
 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.210
options that you have when it you when
it comes to backward compatible action

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220
it comes to backward compatible action
 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.039
it comes to backward compatible action
bars two of these are the

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049
bars two of these are the
 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.410
bars two of these are the
actionbarcompat which is part of the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420
actionbarcompat which is part of the
 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.649
actionbarcompat which is part of the
android sdk in the support library as

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659
android sdk in the support library as
 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.109
android sdk in the support library as
well as the actionbarsherlock library

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119
well as the actionbarsherlock library
 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.960
well as the actionbarsherlock library
which is a community effort and

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970
which is a community effort and
 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.210
which is a community effort and
much-loved so let's after having

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220
much-loved so let's after having
 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.980
much-loved so let's after having
integrated these into our apps let's see

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990
integrated these into our apps let's see
 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.819
integrated these into our apps let's see
what it look like on a nexus s we're

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829
what it look like on a nexus s we're
 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.170
what it look like on a nexus s we're
just going to launch that that version

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180
just going to launch that that version
 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.270
just going to launch that that version
of the app and there you have it you

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280
of the app and there you have it you
 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.789
of the app and there you have it you
have a beautiful action bar that is also

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799
have a beautiful action bar that is also
 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.450
have a beautiful action bar that is also
themed along with our brand so let's

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460
themed along with our brand so let's
 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.429
themed along with our brand so let's
just now bring it side-by-side with what

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439
just now bring it side-by-side with what
 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.600
just now bring it side-by-side with what
we have on a modern device and here we

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610
we have on a modern device and here we
 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.649
we have on a modern device and here we
have the the apps running side by side

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659
have the the apps running side by side
 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.999
have the the apps running side by side
on the Nexus S as well as a the current

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009
on the Nexus S as well as a the current
 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.359
on the Nexus S as well as a the current
versions of Android identical which is

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369
versions of Android identical which is
 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.580
versions of Android identical which is
fantastic so switching back to the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590
fantastic so switching back to the
 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.480
fantastic so switching back to the
slides the action bar can be used on

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490
slides the action bar can be used on
 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.760
slides the action bar can be used on
newer version of the platform as well as

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770
newer version of the platform as well as
 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.230
newer version of the platform as well as
the older versions of the platform with

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240
the older versions of the platform with
 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.600
the older versions of the platform with
these backward compatible compare

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610
these backward compatible compare
 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.040
these backward compatible compare
the nice thing about both

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050
the nice thing about both
 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.860
the nice thing about both
actionbarcompat and actionbarsherlock is

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870
actionbarcompat and actionbarsherlock is
 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.660
actionbarcompat and actionbarsherlock is
that on new version of the platform

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670
that on new version of the platform
 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.310
that on new version of the platform
they're basically thin wrappers for the

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320
they're basically thin wrappers for the
 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.680
they're basically thin wrappers for the
native action bar it's not implementing

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690
native action bar it's not implementing
 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.870
native action bar it's not implementing
everything from scratch the other thing

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880
everything from scratch the other thing
 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.310
everything from scratch the other thing
we should talk about is the viewpager

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320
we should talk about is the viewpager
 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.430
we should talk about is the viewpager
the few pager allows us to horizontally

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440
the few pager allows us to horizontally
 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.970
the few pager allows us to horizontally
swipe across pages to bring you know the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980
swipe across pages to bring you know the
 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.740
swipe across pages to bring you know the
previous or the next page of content

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750
previous or the next page of content
 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.090
previous or the next page of content
lets us let's see a demo of that on our

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100
lets us let's see a demo of that on our
 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.910
lets us let's see a demo of that on our
phone so we loaded the details page here

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920
phone so we loaded the details page here
 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.290
phone so we loaded the details page here
and you can see I can swipe left or

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300
and you can see I can swipe left or
 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.180
and you can see I can swipe left or
right and you'll notice here with

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190
right and you'll notice here with
 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.490
right and you'll notice here with
gestures I don't need to complete the

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500
gestures I don't need to complete the
 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.350
gestures I don't need to complete the
gesture in order for the next content

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360
gesture in order for the next content
 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.670
gesture in order for the next content
that come through while my finger is

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680
that come through while my finger is
 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.340
that come through while my finger is
still on the screen I can see it so the

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350
still on the screen I can see it so the
 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.220
still on the screen I can see it so the
view pager is a great way to page your

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230
view pager is a great way to page your
 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.100
view pager is a great way to page your
content and it's also backward

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110
content and it's also backward
 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.449
content and it's also backward
compatible so switching back to the

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459
compatible so switching back to the
 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.280
compatible so switching back to the
slides the view pager is also another

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290
slides the view pager is also another
 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.010
slides the view pager is also another
really nice utility class that you can

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020
really nice utility class that you can
 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.050
really nice utility class that you can
include in your apps through the support

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060
include in your apps through the support
 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.360
include in your apps through the support
library and it's backward compatible to

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370
library and it's backward compatible to
 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.449
library and it's backward compatible to
older versions of Android finally I want

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459
older versions of Android finally I want
 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.370
older versions of Android finally I want
to talk about the navigation drawer the

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380
to talk about the navigation drawer the
 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.050
to talk about the navigation drawer the
navigation drawer is a pattern that's

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060
navigation drawer is a pattern that's
 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.530
navigation drawer is a pattern that's
you've probably seen in many apps but we

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540
you've probably seen in many apps but we
 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.750
you've probably seen in many apps but we
have Android design guidelines that

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760
have Android design guidelines that
 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.479
have Android design guidelines that
describe exactly how that navigation

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489
describe exactly how that navigation
 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.820
describe exactly how that navigation
drawer should look like on Android now

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830
drawer should look like on Android now
 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.800
drawer should look like on Android now
you'll notice these screenshots aren't

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810
you'll notice these screenshots aren't
 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.960
you'll notice these screenshots aren't
from our bacon reader app and the reason

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970
from our bacon reader app and the reason
 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.100
from our bacon reader app and the reason
is is that we don't believe in

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110
is is that we don't believe in
 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.560
is is that we don't believe in
shoehorning these design of these UI

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570
shoehorning these design of these UI
 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.630
shoehorning these design of these UI
patterns into apps where they may not

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640
patterns into apps where they may not
 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.030
patterns into apps where they may not
fit so what we're going to look at here

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040
fit so what we're going to look at here
 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.460
fit so what we're going to look at here
is a another sample app it's not the

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470
is a another sample app it's not the
 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.530
is a another sample app it's not the
bacon reader app it's the sample demos

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540
bacon reader app it's the sample demos
 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.930
bacon reader app it's the sample demos
that come with the the sample code for

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940
that come with the the sample code for
 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.640
that come with the the sample code for
the navigation drawer so let's look at

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650
the navigation drawer so let's look at
 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.430
the navigation drawer so let's look at
that let's switch to our phone we're

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440
that let's switch to our phone we're
 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.979
that let's switch to our phone we're
going to load it up it's just a list of

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989
going to load it up it's just a list of
 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.660
going to load it up it's just a list of
planets but you'll see here on the on

the top left within the action bar it's
 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.539
the top left within the action bar it's
not the traditional up icon it's not the

the angle bracket pointing left it's
 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.280
the angle bracket pointing left it's
these three horizontal bars and when I

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290
these three horizontal bars and when I
 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.199
these three horizontal bars and when I
tap it these three horizontal bars will

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209
tap it these three horizontal bars will
 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.740

whether the navigation drawer has has

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730
whether the navigation drawer has has
 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.390
whether the navigation drawer has has
been expanded or collapsed the other

been expanded or collapsed the other
 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.370
been expanded or collapsed the other
nice thing is we can not only press the

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380
nice thing is we can not only press the
 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.300
nice thing is we can not only press the
V app icon we can actually swipe bezel

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310
V app icon we can actually swipe bezel
 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.150

swipe that navigation drawer
 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.580
swipe that navigation drawer
we can also dismiss it just by tapping

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590
we can also dismiss it just by tapping
 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.950
we can also dismiss it just by tapping
outside the navigation drawer the other

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960
outside the navigation drawer the other
 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.469
outside the navigation drawer the other
thing I want to point out is some other

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479
thing I want to point out is some other
 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.559
thing I want to point out is some other
subtleties of the action the navigation

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:32.569
subtleties of the action the navigation
 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:34.600
subtleties of the action the navigation
drawer and that is that when I slide it

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610
drawer and that is that when I slide it
 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.950
drawer and that is that when I slide it
in you'll see that the content kind of

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960
in you'll see that the content kind of
 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.950
in you'll see that the content kind of
fades so we're making a concerted effort

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960
fades so we're making a concerted effort
 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.290
fades so we're making a concerted effort
to show that the that the navigation

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300
to show that the that the navigation
 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.390
to show that the that the navigation
drawer isn't shifting the content to the

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400
drawer isn't shifting the content to the
 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.989
drawer isn't shifting the content to the
side it's over laying on top and more

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:49.999
side it's over laying on top and more
 

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:51.999
side it's over laying on top and more
importantly the action bar is staying in

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:52.009
importantly the action bar is staying in
 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:54.399
importantly the action bar is staying in
its place the action bar itself does not

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:54.409
its place the action bar itself does not
 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:56.830
its place the action bar itself does not
move as the navigation drawer slides in

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840
move as the navigation drawer slides in
 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.990
move as the navigation drawer slides in
and out so let's switch back to the

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000
and out so let's switch back to the
 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.119
and out so let's switch back to the
slides and the good news about all these

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:01.129
slides and the good news about all these
 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:03.580
slides and the good news about all these
subtleties that we're talking about for

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590
subtleties that we're talking about for
 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.589
subtleties that we're talking about for
the navigation drawer is that one we've

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599
the navigation drawer is that one we've
 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.260
the navigation drawer is that one we've
documented them in on the Android design

called navigation drawers and they

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110
called navigation drawers and they
 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.499
called navigation drawers and they
actually interview the engineers that

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:44.509
actually interview the engineers that
 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:47.139
actually interview the engineers that
built the engineers and designers that

built the engineers and designers that
 

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:50.170
built the engineers and designers that
built this navigation drawer so so far

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180
built this navigation drawer so so far
 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.429
built this navigation drawer so so far
we've talked a little bit about this

00:05:51.429 --> 00:05:51.439
we've talked a little bit about this
 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:54.519
we've talked a little bit about this
support library the great thing about

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:54.529
support library the great thing about
 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:55.929
support library the great thing about
the support library is it's just

00:05:55.929 --> 00:05:55.939
the support library is it's just
 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:57.790
the support library is it's just
available as part of the Android SDK

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800
available as part of the Android SDK
 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.740

manager so you can just go ahead and

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750
manager so you can just go ahead and
 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.350
manager so you can just go ahead and
select it and add it once you add that

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360
select it and add it once you add that
 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.589
select it and add it once you add that
support library to your to your app you

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:05.599
support library to your to your app you
 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:07.300
support library to your to your app you
get access to a whole range of

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310
get access to a whole range of
 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.249
get access to a whole range of
components that are backward compatible

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:09.259
components that are backward compatible
 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:11.800
components that are backward compatible
so things like fragments and we have

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810
so things like fragments and we have
 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.809
so things like fragments and we have
used fragments in this app we saw our

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:13.819
used fragments in this app we saw our
 

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:15.999
used fragments in this app we saw our
tablet layouts and our phone layouts so

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:16.009
tablet layouts and our phone layouts so
 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:17.619
tablet layouts and our phone layouts so
in order to make this fully backward

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:17.629
in order to make this fully backward
 

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:19.450
in order to make this fully backward
compatible we actually use the support

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460
compatible we actually use the support
 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.700
compatible we actually use the support
fragments from the support library then

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710
fragments from the support library then
 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.439
fragments from the support library then
there's new patterns like the viewpager

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:23.449
there's new patterns like the viewpager
 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.329
there's new patterns like the viewpager
in the navigation drawer we can't

00:06:25.329 --> 00:06:25.339
in the navigation drawer we can't
 

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:27.339
in the navigation drawer we can't
actually in the android framework yet

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:27.349
actually in the android framework yet
 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:29.409
actually in the android framework yet
but are available in the support library

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:29.419
but are available in the support library
 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:31.300
but are available in the support library
and of course we've got our

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.310
and of course we've got our
 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.369
and of course we've got our
actionbarcompat notification compat and

00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:33.379
actionbarcompat notification compat and
 

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:34.900
actionbarcompat notification compat and
others like loaders

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:34.910
others like loaders
 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.820
others like loaders
as well so the support library is full

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830
as well so the support library is full
 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.490
as well so the support library is full
of useful utility classes for developers

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500
of useful utility classes for developers
 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.650
of useful utility classes for developers
and pretty much there's no reason why

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:41.660
and pretty much there's no reason why
 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.650
and pretty much there's no reason why
you shouldn't be using it already so

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:44.660
you shouldn't be using it already so
 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.440
you shouldn't be using it already so
with that said we've come to the end of

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:46.450
with that said we've come to the end of
 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:50.260
with that said we've come to the end of

left is where we started on tablets and
phones not a very modern looking app

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.440
