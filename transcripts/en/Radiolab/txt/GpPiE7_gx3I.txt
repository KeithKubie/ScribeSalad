Speaker 1:          00:00          You're listening to radio [inaudible]. This is radiolab and I am Robert Krulwich and let's begin today with something deceptively familiar. Fireflies are something that we have all of those kids, right? Catching them in the backyard, putting them in in a jar and watching them glow so we don't tend to think of them as anything. All that mysterious. Well, they do one thing very nicely, which is flash on and off. That's how fireflies do flash, but what interests Steve Strogatz, a mathematician at Cornell University is that there are places in the world and not here, but in in Southeast Asia, in Malaysia or Thailand, where fireflies don't just flash randomly like we're used to. They somehow flashed together. There are enormous congregations of fireflies along riverbanks. How many, it could be tens of thousands of tree after tree extending for literally miles along the rivers, all flashing in sync like a Christmas tree rows and rows of Christmas trees all wired together going off and it's one of the most hypnotic and and spellbinding spectacles in nature because you have to keep in mind, it is absolutely silent. We picture it. There's a riverbank in Thailand, in the remote part of the jungle. You're in a canoe slipping down the river. There's no sound of anything, maybe the occasional, you know, exotic jungle bird or something and you're looking and you just see route with thousands of lights on and then off, all in sync.

Speaker 2:          01:36          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:36          imagine all the cheese as far as you can see are all brilliantly lit and then totally dark, brilliantly lit, total darkness, all of them in sync. Yeah, and no Wessler had ever seen this site. There was folklore, there's stories about it, but nobody had gone in and photographed and captured samples. Well, not until 1965 and this was done by John Bark. John Bark, the you guy, one of the great researchers on his other records. I'm 92 buck and his wife Elizabeth mass went to Thailand and captured bags full of mail. Firefly catched them, shaking them for anxious, fight-flight shouldn't rain down and brought them back to their hotel room and we turned off the lights. We turned them loose and saw that the fireflies flittered around on the walls and ceiling flew back and forth flashing random Elizabeth layer on the floor of the room. I was just tired. John stayed away and he was the one who saw within a few minutes little groups do o's and trios formed and after a while fourth one would join in a closer and closer together and then finally they were synchronized. The whole room was blinking in perfect harmony. He was excited. The next they

Speaker 1:          03:00          told me outlet. 20 years later John Buck is still asking this question, oh, what is going on? Because no one knows. There are literally 10 theories. What seems to be clear says Steve is there is no one firefly that makes it all happen. It just happens on its own order, materializes out of nothing. And that hasn't puzzled how can order come out of out of disorder and this is what the creation has loved to talk about and it's because they don't understand and neither do we this, this is the big, big mystery of science. I think bigger than black holes are bigger than superstrings. I mean, science has had hundreds of years of success since the time of Galileo and Newton from reductionism, from looking at the smallest parts, whether they're jeans or Adam's, whatever. That's great. We need to understand the individuals, but that's not enough. Obviously we're not just talking about fireflies anymore. Today on radio lab, we will do as Steve Urges and step away from the individual to find mystery, beauty and order in the group, not fireflies. They are groups of city dwellers, groups of Internet, surfers, stock traders, even the group of neurons that are inside your head. This is a science called emergence. So let's begin. In the beginning, God created [inaudible],

Speaker 3:          04:16          heaven and earth. That's the King James Bible. That's how it starts. The ultimate expression of the boss, God telling everything else what to be, how to be. It's a top down kind board.

Speaker 1:          04:29          What about midway through the Bible contains another passage, more of a bottom up thing from King Solomon, the wisest of the kings where he says, look to the ants, consider her ways and be wise. Nice.

Speaker 3:          04:42          So we start in California, they're good. The office of an ant expert. Hi, I'm Deborah Gordon, professor of biology at Stanford. Deborah Gordon has been studying ants for over two decades. It's because such mindless individuals collectively can do so much that I'm interested in is, you might say she's the reigning aunt queen, but as long as you bring up the raining part. When we went there, I thought, well, let's what's, she has a lot of answers, but I wanted to see what the boss and so she led us to our lab and going into the secret and place where we found to our disappointment that she keeps the ants and big Tupperware container. This is the foraging area of a colony that's stuck living in the lab instead of out in the desert where it would probably rather be in a big plastic box with plastic around it and build bits of sand on it. That's right. And so I'm going to take off the top. Maybe we can see the queen better, but I'm like this. I never seen it before. When I'm looking for the clean, when I'm, am I looking for the ant in the center of the biggest crunch of other hand? Well, usually there are a lot of other ants around her. She doesn't look much different, but she's bigger. Does the ants know that she's special?

Speaker 3:          05:58          I think the ants know that she's the queen and does it. What does that well, the Queen and the way we think about quicks. Yeah. I mean they do they know that as mommy or not even? I don't think so. No.

Speaker 4:          06:14          Uh,

Speaker 3:          06:14          I don't think they know anybody. Has Anybody. And remember she's not in charge. He's not telling anybody what to do. Wait a second, wait a second. Yeah. This is different than I had actually imagined. I thought that Queens gave commit, like, you know, an Alice in wonderland,

Speaker 1:          06:31          what bare hand kind of thing.

Speaker 3:          06:34          Ah, she says no, she's just a big hand that lays the eggs. That's it. That's it. Every year there's a meeting flight and all of the colonies send out their virgin queens who have wings and males who also have wings and they all go to one place and they gather and they mate and the newly made it queens fly off and start new colonies. That's how it starts. Queen scatter make babies, but that's all they do. They're just the colonies, ovaries. They don't sit on a throne and decree anything nor are their generals or even bosses. The colony somehow gets by without any of that, which is especially hard to believe when you watch these ants who tell us what's happening here. This is, that's an anchoring, a dead ant. I remember there was this one little EDBD and carrying a big fat dead and on her back and look at this.

Speaker 3:          07:23          She seems to be gradually, although with some difficulty moving towards my elbow. Then she dropped it. Then she picked it up again. Then she dropped it maybe then up again. Now she's training in the other direction. All the while carrying this heavy corpse. She may like it back and forth like that for hours sometimes can lead some objects we'll get in there that they can't all carry and they can spend months tagging it one way and taking it the other way. Month tugging back and forth on either side of one seed. It wasn't a seed, it was a little twig. One of them is thinking this way and I was thinking, oh this way, like this way, this way. And that's all that's going on. Well I don't know what they're thinking. Right. I know, I know one of them is pulling one way and because the stick feels like something that needs to be pulled and the other also feels the stick needs to be pulled and they just pull. It must be frustrating. Watching these mindless exchanges is, it can be very frustrating. I don't have very much empathy for ads there. So, um, the more you watch the ads, the more weird it seems, the way they never get discouraged. They don't care if they do something well. Um, it's very alien. I think she hates them.

Speaker 3:          08:42          Not really. Cause here's the thing, you can make an argument that

Speaker 1:          08:45          so the most successful species on the planet, they thrive in places that are too hot for us, too dry for us, even too cold for us. They outnumber us by a factor, many thousand

Speaker 3:          08:56          in pure evolutionary math terms. They're winning, which intrigues her and also forces her to think about them differently. I think about what the colony is doing and then I tried to think how it would work. If you do it like that, she says answer actually amazing, but you have to ignore the individual individually. They're totally incompetent and keep your focus big as colonies. They do great things. It's kind of a constant whiplash. You Zoom in stupid to ansible, a twig back and forth for months. You zoom out smart. I'm impressed that it works at all. It's somewhere between the zooming in and zooming out. Bizarre intelligence appears almost like a phantom. I think the most intelligent thing I've ever seen harvester ants do is to build a little turret around the opening of the nest, just as the summer months tunes are gathering. And then when it,

Speaker 5:          09:47          it rains and floods, it's raised up so that the water doesn't go in. So when I see the first few ants coming out with their little twigs and I look up in the sky and I see a few clouds in the distance and I realized that there's some link between the change in the barometric pressure or something and it really is a very tidy, um, and effective little

Speaker 3:          10:05          construction. And what else do aunts do? Let me just count them for you. Shall I? [inaudible] farm. They have livestock ants make garden, ants organize wars, generals and soldiers and things take slaves. There's young, it's tunnel involved. Incredibly good and sophisticated climate controls. You can start from two opposite directions and meet precisely midway answer engineer, hence orchestrate massive public work projects that put FDRs new deal. I'm talking about Tennessee Valley Authority from your home state. That's nothing compared to what ants could. Hello, which raises the question at the center of this program, which is how do so many very stupid creatures with no boss add up to be so smart. The scientist who first really tackled this idea with some success in the mid 1950s was e o Wilson from Harvard University cause he made one of the great discoveries in all of the science of communication. Certainly we know that creatures make noises to each other, sometimes touch each other, but he figured out pheromones. Pheromones are the key to

Speaker 6:          11:15          understand that communication of the vast majority of animals species. We didn't know it then. It's a neat story. He told me that a few years back up at 92nd street y in New York City. One day I shut out, I was culturing fire ranch then in the laboratory at Harvard and I said, I'm going to get to the bottom of this. And the way I did it was to, uh, dissect these tiny, tiny ass. Very difficult to do. But I just selected them. And under magnification I can see that it's sticking out, sting and dragging the Stinger. Something's coming out of that sting, kind of like a fountain pen or somethings through. Bit like that. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, I proceed to, um, believe me, folks, this was the way science goes. I mean, it really is simple minded. It's only later when you're doing the technical paper, you know, when you're producing the mathematical models and that it looks tough.

Speaker 6:          12:09          It's really, this is the way you're thinking when you're doing shots. So I said, I'm going to find out what the organs are inside this. And so what I did was to do anatomy and then, uh, you know, just the sect that I knew approximately what the different glands were in showing you snipped off the part where the glands, where you suited or well, you just distract open. Oh, you opened it. Right. You know, and, and, uh, and, and just the way you would any animal alerts exceedingly difficult when it's about the size of a great assault. That's the tough part. But anyway, I took out the various organs one after the other, and I made a preparation and I made an artificial trail, smeared out one organ after another. No effect. Oh, so they're ants over here and you're drawing lines. Oh, gut stuff. I guess basically what it is, Yo Justin or different origins. I've watched each one in churn and then smeared it out and finally I came to a little finger shaped organ, which we didn't know. The function of it is just the tiny little thing tucked down there and I mirrored that out and incredible. It wasn't, I didn't have to tell them to follow that trail. They exploded out of the nest running along that thing. I started playing around with this. It was so effective for demonstrations. I would write my name.

Speaker 4:          13:30          That's probably a column of 102 hundred three a hundred answers would come pouring out back and forth and they'd actually write my name and I am

Speaker 3:          13:48          so that was the first clues smell. [inaudible] ants may not take orders from above, but they can exchange information. See this one with the abdomen bend under? Yeah. That one is somehow reacted to us. Oh really strange smells that we're making back a debit. Go into lab. As we watched the colony, one of the aunts even stopped. What it was doing to smell us when they waved their antennae in the air. They're looking around because their antennae or their periscopes sounds simple enough. Ants follow scent trails sorta like dogs. But if you stare at them long enough, you will see that when these ants get together, lots of them. The simple sniffing talents they have add up to solve pretty amazing problems. Here's a forage or coming back. What's it in her mouth? It's a seed like this. Suppose there are a bunch of forage or ans in one part of town and something good to eat and another part of town, like if there's a picnic, how does the colony get more ants to your picnic?

Speaker 3:          14:47          They're blind and virtually brainless. So how do they do it? That's the question. How do they do it? Hello, I'm ABCDF t with that question in mind. We visited up Princeton biologists in Kusan. This one here? Yeah. What is this note? You pops open his laptop to show us a beautiful map he's made. So here on the on the screen you can see the individual paths coded by color and ant map. It's as if you gave a few hundred ants a paintbrush and then let them wander over on canvas on the computer has software which tracks the motion of each of these individuals. The resulting picture is vintage Jackson Pollock, lots and lots and lots of layers of squiggly lines so you can put the food down in here. For example, I've got droplets of sugar water here that the ants love for the feed on the end points to a splotch it white in the upper right hand corner, then flips in the next image. Jumping forward in time and what what? What I've actually shown with this is that the ants have begun forming a chemical trail and you can actually show how they've laid a trail to this, this, this good food source.

Speaker 7:          15:45          This is the type of image that makes you want to stare at static on your TV screen and look for patterns. It's downright eerie. One Minute, the screen is a mass chaos of squiggles overlapping no patterns at all. The next is this by magic, the squiggles of snapped together to form a vein leading directly to the sugar. It happens every time. And what's weirder says Ian is every time it happens, it happens by accident error. Really. I mean this is really what we're talking about is these ants probably just made a mistake. Error is architecture. Imagine 500 answer, exploring a space number 411 finds the sugar completely by accident except it's not an accident because the ant has left a scent trail and there their 500 other and so surely one other will come along and make the same mistake. Suddenly you've got two chemical trails on top of each other, doubly hot, attracting a third, which makes the trail AAA hot, attracting five more, which makes it octopussy hot and soon what you've got as a blazing pheromone highway of bumper to bumper and

Speaker 4:          16:50          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          16:50          not unlike mid town during rush hour.

Speaker 4:          16:52          Cool. [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          16:56          when I first saw the ants, uh, in person, one of the first thoughts I had was this looks like a small little city. Steven Johnson noticed this connection and wrote about it in a book called emergence, the connected lives of ants, brains, cities and software. A lot of what the ants do is positive feedback loops where they lay down a kind of fair amount of chemical signal to recruit other ants to do something that they're working on and those ants lay down more of the same signal can. So very quickly you can get a whole bunch of ants working on a single problem. That's the similar effect that you get in a way that city neighborhoods warrant accidents that always happen. That is how ants find food and he says how cities find their shape. It gets to what I sent was called the swirl

Speaker 4:          17:41          that comes with this

Speaker 8:          17:45          gun. When you're walking down the sidewalk going from point x to point why you're gone from subway back to your house and you pass by completely accidentally point Z, which is a new boutique or new restaurant, something that catches your eye and you swerve. You see this thing you've never seen before and you're like, hey, I want to check that out. The whole business in a sense of sidewalks and thriving urban centers revolves around the idea that somebody's coming to see boutique a is going to be swerving into Boutique B or Boutique c just because they're near each other and because they're kind of window shopping.

Speaker 3:          18:17          What a neat idea. Yeah. Right? You wake up thinking, well, here's what I'm going to do in a city. I'm going to walk my daughter to school. I'm going to go to the news stand and buy a paper, and then on your way, something that you didn't expect something new catches your eye, but goannas I will always want that in Sally. That's the Bagonia she wants, right, so you swerve, which begins as an accident, but all these kind of local unplanned decisions all add up into this larger macro unit that does have a distinct personality and that crucially can last for hundreds of years, which does make you wonder because the personalities of cities, we know about that. How come there are distinct neighborhoods for rich people? There are neighborhoods in some cities for artists, slums. Consider a 28th street in [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          18:59          today in the flower market we have hydrangeas and uh, some flowers from Florida. How many flowers? Doors are on this block? If I had to guess, I'd probably say about 25. There are flower stores all around. It's like a Walmart for flowers in a week. Okay. How did this begin? Let's propose that someone for some reason came here and set up a flower shop, which picked up a few customers. So then a second flower merchant and she's getting the traffic. Maybe if I open a store like a heady is on the block, maybe I'll be able to pull some people away from him, had him swerve into my store. Location, location, location, and let's say that gets more traffic. You gotta be with the traffic, so then you get third store. Matt works too. You could sell pencils that look like ducks and nothing else. And if you're writing them all time square, you know what?

Speaker 8:          19:46          You'll probably make money. That's the key. Traffic is everything. Once a neighborhood becomes the place for duck shaped pencils or the place for flowers, what began as an accident then becomes a neighborhood. So much. So if I blindfolded a flower salesman and dropped him onto a hundred blocks, would he know which one was 28th street? Oh absolutely. Yeah. Shit. Yeah, of course. Why I just, I now my street man, I this smell, the flower highest says you smell the highest as soon as you walk in there. I mean of course I would sound at the hen shrugs reef was screaming, yelling at me, please. It's okay. Cause I'm mystical concept. I really do think of it when you think about a neighborhood in a great city, whether it's in New York and the West village or Paris in the Latin quarter of America, right? You know, ask the question like who created this neighborhood, right? Who created things we love about this neighborhood? Who creates that kind of life force? And the answer is everybody and nobody at the same time.

Speaker 4:          20:47          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          20:48          so that brings us again to the central mystery of this hour. We're studying here the science of emergence, which asks where does the organization come from? How do you get a neighborhood, a district or a city? How do you get the complexity of an ant colony if there's no leader and everyone in town is stupid? Steve, Steve Johnson proposes that a city is the emergent quality of the swerve to series of accidents, you know is always going to happen. You multiply the swerves and you get a neighborhood.

Speaker 3:          21:18          Deborah Gordon is arguing that if you look very closely at the aunts and you watch them smelling and you multiply their smells, then you get to the complexity of any ad colony but buried in the system. Both of them say is a rule, a sense of direction, but how do you see that rule? That's the wrong thing. Question, and that's what's so uncomfortable. The instructions aren't anywhere. The instructions come out of the way that the colony lives and behaves. It is hard. If you had one aunt on its own, you couldn't take it apart and find the substance that would make it behave in a certain way. But you see how hard that is? Yes, I want to know. So when you asked her where we're gonna find the rule. Yeah. So when that added any individually as you see it, when all the ants get together, but where is it? Well, where is the thought in your brain? Is it in a neuron? Does each neuron have a little piece of the thought? If you took your neuron out and lay it on the table, could you see the little tiny bit of the thought that's in that neuron? No, it's not in the neuron. It's in the way the neurons interact with each other.

Speaker 4:          22:30          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          22:31          think about a syrup painting. That one where they're all on the banks of the Cen River. Yep. You're the one, if you look at it up close, all you see is dots, right? You pulled back and the picture emerges with all the ladies in their parents' sols. But the question with these systems, the big question is whether there is a syrup to make the dots to paint the picture, or if somehow the painting just materializes on its own.

Speaker 3:          22:55          Uh, well, you know that I have an opinion about this. It's not a, it's not a sciencey opinion. Ah, I think it's not just fascinating that there are these hidden patterns and hidden rules. I think it's just gonna change the whole tone. I think it's kind of holy and I don't have, there's no scientific evidence because there's no science behind this. It's just an instinct. I think when you look at the way ants work or the way it's SRAP painting emerges before your eyes, you're looking at an author.

Speaker 7:          23:28          When you say that, all the air just gets let out of the balloon. For me, it's like the magic is gone.

Speaker 3:          23:35          Really? Can I think so? Let's see what you're left with then everything that you see when you wake up in the morning as beautiful and you all agree that it's beautiful is empty of purpose.

Speaker 7:          23:46          Is that okay with you? Yeah. In a way it makes it even more mysterious to be alive in any case, author or not. There's really good reason why these systems would not centralize, put all their eggs into one basket, one supreme being, because if they did, they'd be vulnerable. Case in point, this story from producer Laura Star Chesky.

Speaker 1:          24:11          I'll walk you over toward the beehives, not about ants. So we're sort of in their flight zone, but don't worry bees and we'll just see if we have any luck here. She met up recently with a beekeeper named John Clayton. It's always hit and miss trying to find a queen, that's for sure.

Speaker 4:          24:28          She's right there. Get off me. Thank you.

Speaker 9:          24:35          One of the things that beekeepers really like to do is raise their own queens. All you need to do is take a frame out of an existing hive that has egg cells on it and a bunch of worker bees and put it in its very own box and they'll realize that they don't have a queen and they'll pull an egg or pull larva and start feeding it. The Royal Jelly make the peanut shape Queen Cell and 16 days later you got a brand new queen. Well, one time I uh, I made a brand new. Kwame was my first queen. I was probably 17 years old at the time and I had it out on my back porch and I knew to come. Day three, she goes out to mate. So I'm sitting there and here it sure enough comes to queen out the entrance and she flies off and she takes off and, and I'm watching and I'm watching the whole mating process take place and it takes place in flight.

Speaker 9:          25:25          She made a in flight with about 10 drones and uh, the drones die after mating. They come crashing to the ground dying and the queen goes back to the hive. And while she started coming back to the hive and then I realized I had a piece of sticky fly tape hanging up on the back porch and she flew right into it and there's my queen all stuck to the flight tape like this, you know, I said there's my first queen and I killed the poor thing cause there was nothing I could do to save it, you know, it was just a horrible story. So it's one of those things, it's you learn from experience, you know. But it was a sad moment because they a a special thing.

Speaker 4:          26:02          Ouch. Just got a chap there.

Speaker 1:          26:05          Thanks to producer Laura Starecheski and beekeeper, John Clayton coming up the science of how a trillion leaderless neurons in your head come together in musical fashion to sing the song of the thought you are thinking right now, which if you're a caffeine addict like me, just might be

Speaker 4:          26:23          the [inaudible].

Speaker 9:          26:29          I'm Janica, I'm Ron Robert Krulwich and I will continue to [inaudible].
