00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.880
- Hi, this is Nicholas again.
Welcome back to the shop.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.290
This is probably my most useful
tool in the shop.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.710
I love my Chinese power hammer.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.000
It's pneumatic,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.790
it creates its own air,

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.250
and it works fantastic.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.880
So this is
a Russian farmers anvil

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.460
that a friend gave me
a few years ago.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.790
This is where most
of my knives get all

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.330
their finishing work done.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.880
- Good morning.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.210
My name is Dave,
and here we are at the forge.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.170
This is my quench tank.
I made this

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.790
for the flamberge
rapier challenge.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.380
I got my oxy-acetylene rig
here.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.040
A portable all-purpose station.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.540
Right now I have a grinder
in there.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.830
I have my TIG welder,

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.210
my arc welder,

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.290
my band saw,
my little porta band.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.880
I put a little bracket--a brace
on here so I could clamp it

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.620
to the table and use it like
a table saw.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.170
In a small place like this,

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.460
many things have to do
double duty sometimes.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.380
The hammer I like to use
the most is this one here.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.000
I made this one.
It's a soft steel.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.710
And it's got a nice rebound.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.830
[taps, reverberates]
It's got a nice life to it.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.790
That's it.
It's a humble little forge,

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.540
and this is where I create.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.250
<i>[rock music]</i>

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.040
- So this is
my current armoring project.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.670
It's a reproduction
of a 16th-century

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.210
pikeman's armor.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.620
I have a long way to go.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.830
There's lots of spikes.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.170
I love making helmets.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.170
This is a 16th-century...

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.120
dusty, Italian version a--

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.170
what they call the Heroic age.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.120
So this is ode to the labors
of Hercules.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.790
From the 16th century

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.420
we can go all the way
back to Roman.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.460
This is
my Roman cavalry helmet.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.620
It's a little dusty too.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.330
This is all done

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.540
in a skill called
chasing and repoussÃ©,

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.670
which means from the front
and from the back.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.040
It's basically drawing
in steel, so it's a lot of fun.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.960
It's one of the things
I really enjoy.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.000
- A big part of being
a modern metal worker,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.120
a blacksmith, a farrier,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.920
an armorer is, you know,
you're wrestling with steel

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.920
all day long,
and my training in here

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.330
<i>allows me to go out
and move steel.</i>

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.000
[grunts]

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.500
And sometimes when I'm waiting,
let my body recuperate,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.330
I'll throw a few darts.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.210
You gotta show that.
That's pretty damn good.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.120
Train, take care of yourselves,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.120
and you can go out
and bang some steel.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.670
Have a good day.
