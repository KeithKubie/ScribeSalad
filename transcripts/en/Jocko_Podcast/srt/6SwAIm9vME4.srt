1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,200
It took me a long time to
understand what sacrifice meant. Um,

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,050
because on the surface of it,
especially the way it's acted out,

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,590
like burnt offerings and that sort
of thing, it just seems like, well,

4
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:14,760
it seems so archaic and, and distant from
us that it's not really comprehensible,

5
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:19,080
but partly from reading John Piaget,
I started and neat you for that matter.

6
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:22,680
I started to understand that people
often acted out conceptions before they

7
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:24,430
understood what they meant.
You know,

8
00:00:24,431 --> 00:00:27,570
when we act out a lot of things we
don't understand because we're much more

9
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:29,580
complex than we can represent.

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,770
So we're always acting out
things we don't understand.

11
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:37,310
But so there's this idea in Cain and
Abel that you have to make sacrifices in

12
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:42,460
order to stay on the good side of
God. And so I thought about that. Um,

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,110
practically say not so much
metaphysically but practically,

14
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:50,280
and realized that that was equivalent
to the discovery of time of the future

15
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,220
because we do,
we do act and that,

16
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,860
and this is a peculiar
discovery of human beings,

17
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:59,310
may be a consequence of our expanded
intelligences that we're actually aware of

18
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:00,144
the future.

19
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,780
And we actually treat the future as if
it's something that you can bargain with.

20
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,470
Now, partly it's because the future
is other people and they remember your

21
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,610
reputation, they remember your past
actions. And if you do someone a favor,

22
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:15,120
then that favor is in some
sense stored up in the future.

23
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,260
So you can think about the future as
a place of judgment about your moral

24
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:19,831
actions.

25
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:24,450
And it's not that far from
that to imagining a god
who's keeping track of that

26
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:27,300
or who even is that.
But in any case,

27
00:01:27,301 --> 00:01:32,301
the idea of sacrifice emerges in the
story of Cain and Abel and Cain and Abel

28
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:37,410
both make sacrifices to God in order
to stay on his good side, let's say.

29
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,790
And what a sacrifice means is that you
give up something of value in the present

30
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,380
so that you can be so that you can
improve the future. And you know,

31
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:50,190
that's no different from what we call
discipline. It's exactly the same thing.

32
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,450
It's just thought that concretely acted
out version of that. And so, you know,

33
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:55,980
the idea basically was that,

34
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,850
well God was in the transcendent heavens.
And,

35
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,410
and the first question would be, well,
why is that when it's like, well,

36
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,860
if you go out and, and really
dark night and look up at the sky,

37
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,720
you have a sense of what's
beyond you, what, what's
transcendent, what's infinite?

38
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,830
And,

39
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,630
and so to associate that with the highest
of values is a reasonable association,

40
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:21,210
right? From, from a say, from
an emotional point of view.

41
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,840
So it's not particularly
primitive. It's a smart, um,

42
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,850
metaphor or it's a smart intuition
that, that, that, and it's above you.

43
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:32,700
And you know, we tend to think of
when you're moving towards an ideal,

44
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:34,440
that you're moving up,
that you're moving above,

45
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:37,590
you're moving to the mountain top,
right? You're, you're going up, not down.

46
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,070
And so it all sits within
that same framework.

47
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:43,440
And it's partly because when you go up,
like on a mountain,

48
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:45,720
you can see for long distances,
right?

49
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:49,020
So those are all those things
are tangled together. So anyways,

50
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,580
so the idea is that you have to give
up something of value now, so you,

51
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,650
so that you make the future better.

52
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,100
And sometimes it's even
something you love now.

53
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,330
Now that's a good example too,

54
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:04,870
because often the things that
stop us from moving forward, our,

55
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:09,220
our attachments to things that we
should no longer be attached to. Right?

56
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,300
And in fact,

57
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,680
you can almost make that definitional if
you're not moving forward in your life.

58
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,150
There's a high probability that you
have some idea or some mode of action or

59
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:23,860
some habit that you're so in love
with that you won't let go of it. So,

60
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,150
all right,
so Cain and Abel,

61
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:30,000
Cain and Abel make sacrifices and there's
kind of a hint in the story that it's

62
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,030
just a hint that came sacrifices.
They're sort of second rate.

63
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,110
But in any case it's
ambivalent tay. But, but Abel,

64
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:41,830
he just does wonderfully well
and everything works out for him.

65
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,930
And everyone knows people like that,
you know?

66
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,240
And so God accepts his sacrifices.
But for some reason he rejects canes.

67
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:54,810
And maybe it's the arbitrary Agnes of
God or maybe it's cause Cains heart isn't

68
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:58,480
in the right place when he's making
his sacrifices, which is more likely.

69
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,720
And so Ken goes and has a
chat with God and he says,

70
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,000
basically what he says is something like,

71
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,830
how in the world can you possibly
justify this universe that you created?

72
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,090
You look at me and I'm breaking myself
and half trying to adapt and to make

73
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:15,790
things right and it's not working.

74
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,860
And then there's this able character and
things come easy to him and everything

75
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:23,740
is flourishing for him.
And so like what the hell?

76
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,160
And if you don't understand that question,

77
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,470
then you're not thinking
because it's very,

78
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:34,471
very frequently the case when a serious
catastrophe besets you in life that you

79
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:37,900
essentially ask exactly that question.
What's the meaning of life?

80
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:40,630
What's the purpose of the world?
How come there's suffering?

81
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,590
And it's easy to become resentful and
vengeful as a consequence of that.

82
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:49,591
And so you got to think about what state
of mind having your sacrifices rejected

83
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:50,921
puts you in,

84
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:54,070
especially when you see someone who's
successful because that's where the

85
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,280
jealousy and resentment starts to starts
to what faster is probably the right

86
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:01,384
word.

87
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:06,160
And so God says to Cain exactly what
he doesn't want to hear, which is,

88
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,860
well, yeah, okay,

89
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:13,540
but you have made lots of mistakes
in your life. So he basically says,

90
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:17,860
sin is at your door like a predatory
and sexually aroused animal,

91
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:21,400
and you've invited it into your house
to have its way with you and produce

92
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:25,690
something creative as a consequence. So
he was used as sexual metaphor, you know,

93
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,520
and so that you've willingly gone down
the negative path and you've allowed that

94
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:31,460
to enter into you and,

95
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,310
and to operate in a creative manner
and you've spun off all these terrible

96
00:05:36,311 --> 00:05:39,490
thoughts and, and this justification
for not acting properly.

97
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:41,620
And that's why things
aren't going well for you.

98
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:43,480
And so don't lay that at my feet,

99
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,200
which is the most brutal possible
message he could have got.

100
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,490
And so then he leaves the presence of God,
let's say.

101
00:05:51,491 --> 00:05:54,610
And it says in the story
that his countenance fell,

102
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:57,300
which meant he was basically enraged.
And so what does he do?

103
00:05:57,301 --> 00:06:00,500
It goes out and kills Abel.
And then that's,

104
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,240
that's a very fascinating idea
because Abel is his ideal.

105
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,780
So kills is ideal. And when you
kill your ideal, you're lost.

106
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:14,210
And then he does that to take revenge on
Abel, but also to take revenge on God,

107
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:17,840
which I think is extremely interesting.
And, and a deep, deep idea.

108
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,690
Like these kids who shoot
up high schools for example,

109
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,580
you cannot understand what they're doing
unless you understand the story of Cain

110
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:25,970
and Abel.

111
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:30,970
You cannot understand what possesses them
until you can understand that someone,

112
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,590
even someone who doesn't
believe it doesn't matter.

113
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:35,720
It's the psychological
state of mind that matters,

114
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,540
is they're out for
revenge on being itself.

115
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,470
And that's why they produce as much mayhem
as possible in the shortest period of

116
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:43,220
time.

117
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:48,220
That's why they sacrifice in innocent
people because it's much more vengeful

118
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:54,760
and, and demonstrative to kill innocent
people than to kill guilty people. Right?

119
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,290
Cause it's a worse sin,
so to speak.

120
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,190
And then they killed themselves and
they killed themselves as a final

121
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:05,960
demonstration of their belief in,
in nihilism and the horror of existence.

122
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:06,891
Because you might say,
well,

123
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:10,250
why don't they just kill themselves
first and save everyone the trouble?

124
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,590
You know?
And there's narcissism in that too,

125
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:15,290
because they know their names are
going to be splashed across the page.

126
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,920
That's their notoriety instead of
their accomplishment. And of course,

127
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:22,040
the media is unbelievably
complicit in that. Um,

128
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,260
but well, so when you're talking
about motivation for evil,

129
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:30,530
then you have to understand
what it is that's driving it.

130
00:07:30,531 --> 00:07:35,531
And it is a deep resentment about the
structure of being for being what?

131
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:38,870
Saturated with suffering,
but also for rejecting.

132
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:42,230
You're rejecting your sacrifices and that,
you know,

133
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:46,640
that produces the bitterness of failure.
And I'll stop with this.

134
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,150
One of the things that's
really interesting about
the old testament is that,

135
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,670
and the Jews in the Old Testament is that
they don't take the path of cane every

136
00:07:55,671 --> 00:08:00,260
time they're walloped by God, which
is like fairly frequently. They say,

137
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:05,270
we must have done something wrong and we
have to set ourself right. And that's,

138
00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:05,840
uh,

139
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,840
an unbelievably heroic attitude because
that's the alternative to cursing fate.

140
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,750
It's like you take the responsibility
for failure onto yourself.
