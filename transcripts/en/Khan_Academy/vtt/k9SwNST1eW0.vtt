00:00:00.408 --> 00:00:01.305
- [Voiceover] Voltage is one of

00:00:01.305 --> 00:00:04.808
the most important quantities
and ideas in electricity,

00:00:04.808 --> 00:00:07.301
and in this video we're gonna develop

00:00:07.301 --> 00:00:11.181
an intuitive feeling
for what voltage means.

00:00:11.181 --> 00:00:13.266
But it has to do with potential energy

00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:16.155
of electrical charges
and that's what we're

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:19.203
going to cover here, we're
not gonna do a derivation,

00:00:19.203 --> 00:00:22.145
but we are going to do
an intuitive description

00:00:22.145 --> 00:00:23.628
of what voltage means.

00:00:23.628 --> 00:00:26.579
We're gonna start with
an analogy to gravity.

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.329
Gravity and voltage are
really similar ideas.

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.380
I'm going to draw a mountain here.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.880
Here's some mountain-side with snow on it.

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:39.827
And I'm going to put a mass here,

00:00:39.827 --> 00:00:43.021
here's a mass of some mass M.

00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:46.229
And it was lifted up to the
top of the hill somehow,

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:50.116
by a ski lift, by a mountain
climber, something like that.

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:53.566
And if I put it on top of
the mountain and I let it go,

00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:56.387
the potential energy that it has is going

00:00:56.387 --> 00:00:59.352
to be dissipated as kinetic energy

00:00:59.352 --> 00:01:03.519
and that mass is going to
roll down the hill to here.

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:07.201
And as it does, it could do some work.

00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:10.620
It could hit some trees,
let's draw a tree.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.862
And it could run into a tree
and knock that tree around.

00:01:13.862 --> 00:01:16.846
It could hit a bear, it
could bounce off rocks,

00:01:16.846 --> 00:01:21.579
all kinds of things, so that's
a mass rolling down a hill.

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:24.495
Now if I draw, this is a
way to think about voltage,

00:01:24.495 --> 00:01:28.578
think about voltage as
being another mountaintop,

00:01:29.846 --> 00:01:31.834
and this time we'll put a battery in here.

00:01:31.834 --> 00:01:35.404
This is our battery, this is
what a battery does for us,

00:01:35.404 --> 00:01:38.071
it actually builds our mountain.

00:01:39.596 --> 00:01:42.846
The battery actually delivers electrons

00:01:45.446 --> 00:01:48.019
to the top of the hill, so
here's an electron coming

00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:52.003
out of the battery terminal,
the negative battery terminal.

00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:56.170
And if I release this, it is
going to roll down the hill.

00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:02.511
And eventually it's going to return

00:02:02.511 --> 00:02:03.901
to the bottom side of the battery.

00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:06.109
But the same thing, this
is the image you have

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:08.448
in your head when we hook up a circuit.

00:02:08.448 --> 00:02:12.031
Along the way I could put in
different circuit components

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:16.199
like resistors or capacitors
or anything like that,

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:18.029
and I could make this electron do work

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:20.249
and bump into things as it goes down.

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:22.748
So, the amount of voltage here

00:02:22.748 --> 00:02:24.861
is proportional to the
height of this mountain.

00:02:24.861 --> 00:02:27.205
A high voltage is a high mountain

00:02:27.205 --> 00:02:29.388
and a low voltage is a low mountain.

00:02:29.388 --> 00:02:33.194
The electrons are pushed
out the top by the battery

00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:35.983
and roll down to the bottom
doing work along the way,

00:02:35.983 --> 00:02:39.566
and this is where we
do our circuit design.

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:44.608
That's what we're doing over here,

00:02:44.608 --> 00:02:48.067
we buy batteries and we
do our circuit design

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:50.019
and study over here.

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.095
So this is a pretty good
analogy for thinking

00:02:53.095 --> 00:02:57.012
about voltage as you begin
to build your circuits.

00:02:57.012 --> 00:02:58.163
See you next time.
