You might have just looked at the data and seen that the prices for Snapzi are

00:00:04.053 --> 00:00:10.014
less than Irisa and LolaMoon, or you might have calculated the means. The mean

00:00:10.014 --> 00:00:16.711
shirt price for this sample from Snapzi brand is $13. For Irisa, the mean is

00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:21.987
48, snd for LolaMoon, 45. It looks like the price for Snapzi is different from

00:00:21.987 --> 00:00:28.260
both Irisa and LolaMoon. But, Irisa and LolaMoon appear to have similar prices.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.042
We could do three t-tests to statistically show if there's a significant

00:00:32.042 --> 00:00:37.190
difference or not, but in this lesson, you'll learn a simpler method.
