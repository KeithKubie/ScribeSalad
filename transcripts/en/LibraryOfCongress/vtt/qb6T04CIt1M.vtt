00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.550
&gt;&gt; GUHA SHANKAR: Hello.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.850
Good afternoon.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.780
Welcome to the third
and final program

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.960
in the Native American
Heritage Month Programs here

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.350
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.200
I'm Guha Shankar from the
American Folklife Center.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.940
I've been working with
colleagues in the Office

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.240
of Equal Employment Opportunity.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.100
Roberta Salazar also Eric Eldridge,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.870
Carla David Catro [assumed
spelling] from the Law Library.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.250
Jennifer in the back from CRS.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:47.330
In order to do a series of programs
here at the library for this month.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.280
It gives me great pleasure to
introduce Gabriela Pérez Báez,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.970
the curator of linguistics
the Museum of Natural History

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.640
at the Smithsonian Institution.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.920
I won't, obviously if I were
to sit here and read out all

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.820
of her accomplishments, that
would take up half the time.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.180
So. I'm going to keep it
brief and just let you know

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.480
that Gabriela Pérez Báez
has conducted research

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.930
on Zapotec languages since 2002.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.310
She's devoted much of her
work to studying factors

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.060
of language maintenance and
endangerment with a focus

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.490
on the impact of migration.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.960
In the community of diasporic
speakers of [foreign words]

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.720
and the influences on its sort

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.140
of sister mirror community
in Los Angeles.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.850
Importantly for the Library of
Congress, Gabriela is the co-PI

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.970
of the Breath of Life Languages two

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.620
about which she'll
be speaking today.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.520
And it's important to the Library
because the Library of Congress,

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.130 position:56%
and principally The American
Folklife Center, but also colleagues

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.330
in the Manuscripts Division,

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.150 position:56%
represented by Barbara Bear
[assumed spelling] and Julia Miller,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.580
along with colleagues in the
geography and maps division,

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.300
as well as the Prints and
Photographs Division host some

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.590
of these community members
who come and do research

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.950
in the National Library Collections
as part of their own programs

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.350
of linguistic maintenance, cultural
revitalization, and other purposes

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.040
for which they use the
collections here at the library.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.010 position:56%
So, it's been a very fruitful
collaboration for the last few years

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.090
and Gabrielle will talk
about that as well.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.850
And speaking of collaborations,
one of our other principles

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.800
in this enterprise is Judith
Grey, head of reference

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.910
at the American Folklife Center
who's trying to walk in the door,

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.430
I'm not sure what she's
doing [laughter].

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.830
Thank you, Judy.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.620
Come on in Judy.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.840
So, after all of that, I will
now turn it over to Gabriella.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.060
We will have about probably
25 minutes of presentation

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.840
and then we'll have;
30, who's keeping count.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.720
And that will mean
there will be ample room

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.610
for questions and answers
at the end.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.610
And please do make sure
that you do ask questions.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.910
This is an interactive session.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.690
We appreciate all of you
coming on your lunch hour.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.510
And without further ado let me turn
it over to Gabriela Pérez Báez.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.960
[ Applause ]

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; GABRIELA PÉREZ BÁEZ: Thank
you very much for that introduction.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.780
It's a real pleasure to be here.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.940
I was just telling Guha
that despite the fact

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.690
that we've been collaborating for
so long, because I'm always trying

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.750
to get things running for
Breath of Life at the Museum

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.030
of Natural History, I
don't get to be here.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.620
So, this is a real treat.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.230
So, I am currently serving as
director of Recovering Voices.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.010
It's the initiative I
want to talk to you about.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.550
And within that context,
I will talk specifically

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.590
about programmatic
activities like Breath of Life

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.910
and how they fit into our model.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.380
So, Recovering Voices is a priority
interdisciplinary initiative

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.180
of the National Museum of Natural
History at the Smithsonian.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.230
It's intended to respond to the
global loss of linguist diversity.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.920
And not only that, it also focuses
heavily on the loss of knowledge

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.120
that is associated with the
loss of linguistic diversity.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.370
The idea is to conduct and
enable research on languages

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.750 position:56%
and knowledge systems, to understand
the loss of cultural diversity

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.420
and develop effective
responses to reverse it.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.520
Access to collections is central
to the recovery in generation

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.220
of knowledge in the process.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.710
Global impact is achieved through
partnerships with communities

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.420
with academic institutions.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.630
We favor an interdisciplinary
approach in recognition

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.050
of the holistic approaches
to knowledge

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.640
that indigenous communities have.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.170
This initiative, Recovering Voices,

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.430
originated within the anthropology
department at the National Museum

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.900
of Natural History, but
it works with partners

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.010
across the Smithsonian,
you know partner units

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.140
across the Smithsonian,
as well as outside.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.840 position:56%
And again, our focus of today's talk
will be the partnership that we have

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.940
with the Library of Congress.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.410
What distinctive competence
do we offer?

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.350
Why should the Smithsonian
get involved in trying

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.760
to address the issue of
language endangerment?

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.060
Well, it's our collections.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.450
That's why collections-based
research is

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.790
such a strong focus
of Recovering Voices.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.000
We hold 9000 linear
feet of manuscripts,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.280
which I've been told
equals five times the height

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.980
of the Washington Monument.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.290
Generally, when I make this
analogy outside Washington,

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.760
nobody knows what it means.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.400
But you guys know.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.780
We also have 144.5, I was told,
million items in our collections

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.850
that cover the spectrum
of the seven disciplines

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.410
at the National Museum
of Natural History.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:06:02.540 position:56%
So, there's anthropology, mineral
sciences, zoology, etcetera, botany.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.120
So, the focus in very simple
terms is to use these collections

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.480
as stimuli to generate
or regenerate knowledge

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.850
and help revitalize languages.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.660
There's three of us.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.350
Three curators from
the National Museum

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.090
of Natural History
behind this initiative.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.650
Myself, serving currently
as director

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.790
for another couple more
weeks, and then my colleague,

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:33.780
Gwen Isaac who you see at the front
of this photo will be taking over.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.530
She, along with Joshua Bell

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.890
and myself have been the three
curators behind the initiative.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.090
And we have two program assistants.

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.080
And we have fellows,
interns, contractors depending

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.770
on what activity, what
special projects we have.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.690
We have collaborators across
the disciplines in the museum.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.920
Again, collaborators across
the Smithsonian Institution.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.180
Notably the National Museum of the
American Indian, and the center

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.910
for Folklife and Cultural Heritage.

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.760
And, we have a network of
partners, starting with the Library

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.100
of Congress, but also the Myaamia
Center, who is a critical partner

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:16.420
in Breath of Life, the UNESCO,
University of Hawaii and so on.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.170
So, let's talk about the
Recovering Voices model.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.830
So, again collections are
central and our focus is

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.530
to mobilize these collections to
foster community-based research

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.930
for language and knowledge
revitalization.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:33.480
And by community-based research
what we mean is community-driven,

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:40.170
or community-directed, or research
that is for community benefit

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:45.810
and that is designed in close
collaboration with a community.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.630
The model works for
collections-based research both

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.590
in the museum setting and
in the field and I will talk

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:55.510
about the two settings
and how that works.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.150
Our research priorities are three.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:02.730
We run a community research
program, which I'll talk about.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:06.440 position:56%
The National Breath of Life Archival
Institute for Indigenous Languages,

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:12.260
which for short I'll refer to it as
Breath of Life, and field research.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:17.070
So, let's start with the
Community Research Program.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:20.010
The Recovering Voices
has an operating fund

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:23.100
that allows us to fund this.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.860
It's by community researchers.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:28.830
Three different visits per
year, to come and carry

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:31.110
out research on our collections.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:34.210 position:56%
That is designed by the researchers.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.590
These researchers don't
need to be affiliated

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.400
with an academic institution.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.630
And they do not need to
have an academic background.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:46.090
Provided they are involved in
their community's activities

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:49.140
to revitalize culture,
language, knowledge.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.240 position:56%
And are able to articulate a project

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.790
around a particularly
robust collection

00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.050
of any kind in our museum.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:01.420
We're able to fund.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.630
Right now, we're in the process
of finalizing the selection

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:09.150
of the community research
visits for 2017.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.850
So, it's an annual
competitive process.

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:17.100
We don't get a ton of applications,
but we do get about a dozen.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.660
Which is probably enough,
because we're able to fund three

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.930
and that way we're able to
fund a higher percentage

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:24.660
of the applications.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:28.450
The idea is that we have
$10,000 that we're able

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:31.550
to put towards covering the
travel expenses, lodging,

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.760
etcetera of these visits.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:40.940
We have so far funded 17
research visits since 2012.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.220
And I know you're not
supposed to put,

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.370
you know, heavy text slides here.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.430
But I figured this would give
you a sense of the breadth

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:54.350 position:56%
of community research that has been
conducted so far under this program.

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:56.660
We recently, I'll mention
for example,

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.450
the last, the one at the bottom.

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:03.910
A group of Waija researchers,
I'm sorry Waija chiefs

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.940
who are also conducting research

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:15.170
from the northern Amazon
region were here in September,

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.570
seems like a long time ago.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.720
But they were here in September.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.740
They were able to work out an
arrangement with a local researcher

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:28.180
so that they could extend
their visit for up to a month

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.500
because they were staying
at this person's home.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:36.190
And so, they were able to be
here visiting the film archives

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:37.490
at the [inaudible] facility.

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:40.720
They were also, they visited
the entomology collecting,

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.470
the birds collecting,
the fish collection.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:44.770
It was really interesting.

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:47.080
I was just telling
Guha a few minutes ago

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:54.500
that it was very revealing for the
collections managers to be talking

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.960
to people who know these
species so incredibly well.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.280 position:56%
One of the Waija chiefs had actually
help collect some of the fish

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.450
that are in our collections
nowadays.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:06.810
And they were able to
engage in a conversation

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:10.910
about how climate change is
impacting some of these species.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.030
So, it's very much a dialogue.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:18.260
Sometimes we feel that we gain
more as collections managers,

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.990
as curators from this interaction.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:25.540
But, of course all of these
communities are walking away

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:29.990
with the ability to utilize these
collections, again as stimuli

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.570
for generating, or
regenerating knowledge.

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:38.140
Now, let me talk about
National Breath of Life.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:43.410
So, the National Breath
of Life is based in DC

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:46.720
because of the unparalleled
collections that we have here

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.790
across the institutions based
in the region, in the city.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:55.040
Specifically, there's
three partner institutions,

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.560
the National Anthropological
Archives

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.860
at the National Museum
of Natural History.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:06.430 position:56%
The National Museum of the American
Indian, and the Library of Congress.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:11.220
This is a program funded by the
National Science Foundation.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.580
And therefore, we partner closely

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:18.110 position:56%
with other institutions outside the
federal government system to be able

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:21.200
to receive or use these grants.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.090
So, we have partnered
with Yale University twice

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:26.810
and now we have a very
strong partnership

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:30.090
with the Myaamia Center
at Miami University.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:33.740
You might have heard from the
recent McArthur Fellowship Awards,

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:37.840
you might have heard about Darrell
Baldwin, who was the recipient

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.030
of one of these awards this year,

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:43.800
for his work in reclaiming
the Myaamia language.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.270
This is a language that
used to be spoken in the 40s

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:51.110
and through the work of Darrell
Baldwin, in collaboration

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.700
with a linguist from UC
Berkeley, they were able

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:57.420
to reconstruct the grammar
phonology of the language based

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:01.520
on archival materials, many
of which are at the NAA.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:06.560
And to make a very long, 30,
40-year long story short,

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.850
the community now has
speakers of the language

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:12.990
that have various degrees
of competence.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:17.140
But in his home, Darrell
and his family carry

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.660
out the daily life in Myaamia.

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.230
So, they've been effectively
able to reclaim the language,

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:27.220
something which we thought was
not possible even 20 years ago.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:31.300
So, it's following that model, the
relevance of archival materials

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:35.240
for languages that no longer have
speakers or have very few speakers,

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.640
or where knowledge has
been eroded significantly,

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:42.280
that Breath of Life is designed.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:46.950
And the model was actually
developed based on a document

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.100
that was produced by a group

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.910
in Australia called the
Australian Institute for Aboriginal

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:54.840 position:56%
and Torres Strait Icelander Studies.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:01.910
Breath of Life is a program that
has very long names throughout the

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:04.220
entire process.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.510
So, they had recognized

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:11.470
that archives were really valuable
resources, and wrote a document

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:17.390
to detail and model a method for
using them for revitalization.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.680
That model was taken and
further developed by,

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.980
and here's another long name,

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:25.920
the Advocates for Indigenous
California Language Revival,

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.850
in partnership with UC Berkeley.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:34.930
And we have been, now and
UC Berkeley the focus was

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:37.890
on California tribes only,

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.790
that no longer have
speakers of their languages.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:47.820 position:56%
In DC, because of the breadth of the
collections that are available here,

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:52.990
we can go beyond that
limited set of participants

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:57.370
to serve any communities primarily
in the US, but also Canada,

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:01.500
and we might be hosting
someone from Mexico this year.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:06.860
Independently of whether they have
speakers of the language or not.

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:12.000
Generally, because of the
situation in North America,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.580
we hold participants whose
languages have very few speakers,

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.880
or no speakers left.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.550
But that's not always the case.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:25.570
So, the structure of Breath
of Life, or the goal is

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:29.780
to familiarize participants with
the archives and provide them

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:33.570
with the skills to be able to
find materials on their languages.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:37.610 position:56%
We teach fundamentals in linguistics
so that they can begin to read

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.510
and interpret the materials.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:41.030
And anyone who's ever looked

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:44.450
at a manuscript knows
that it's not very easy.

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:47.520
There are idiosyncrasies
in the documentation,

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.440
there's handwriting quirks,

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.450
and you need to interpret what's
a noun, what's a verb etcetera.

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:58.600
So, we provide fundamental, you
know basics to be able to do that.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:04.760 position:56%
And, we discuss and demonstrate ways
that the materials can be utilized

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.930
for language revitalization
and we always have people

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:10.730
like Darrell Baldwin
and other people

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:15.680
who have very similarly
long-standing projects

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:20.270
in revitalization that come
and share their experience.

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:22.570
So, again there are
three core elements.

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:28.240
Basic linguistics, archival
research and applied approaches.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:33.460
So, Breath of Life, unlike Berkeley
and other Breath of Life models

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.980
that only last a week, the National
Breath of Life takes two weeks,

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:40.490
because again of the
amount of materials

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:42.140
that can be consulted here.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:46.610
During that time, the
participants who are selected,

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:52.140
it's a real competitive
process as well.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.810
This year we received
around 70 applications.

00:16:54.810 --> 00:17:00.490
And we'll be able to
hose about 30 of them.

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.890
So, every language group,

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:08.020 position:56%
and sometimes we get one single
individual, but generally we get two

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.660
or three people form
one language community

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.400
who come and work together.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:17.320
And each language group will get
an academically trained linguist

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:21.560
assigned to work with them one
on one throughout the two weeks.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:25.440
On our end, the curators,
the archivists,

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.980
the librarians will teach
the participants how

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.240
to navigate the catalogs.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.490
Every institution has a
different type of catalog,

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:35.210
but overall the principles

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:39.670
of catalog research are
applicable across the board.

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:43.420
So, we try to make sure that
when the participants leave,

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.720
they can still come back to
the catalog and find stuff

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.330
that they might be interested in.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:51.290
We, of course provide
access to the materials.

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:55.230
So, ahead of time we pull up
everything for this language

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:58.570
and that language, and the
participants are able to work

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:00.660
on the materials hands on.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.770
And we also produce
archival quality materials.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:08.170
We were just actually
talking about trying

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:13.900
to make a more concerted effort
to inform the Library of Congress

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:17.260
about the languages that will be
represented in the next Breath

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:22.170
of Life, which by the way happens
May 29th to June 9th in 2017.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:24.950
And that way the participants
can leave

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:32.160
with archival surrogates
of their materials.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:40.320 position:56%
So, Breath of Life national model
has evolved over the last few years.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:48.000 position:56%
We're going to have again the fourth
iteration in May 2017 for two weeks.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.430
To date, so if you look at the
number languages that we've had

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:59.110
over the year, 22 was really a
lot of languages; 14, 15 is more

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:02.270
or less the scope that is
manageable and we can attend

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:06.240
to everyone's needs more
effectively and efficiently.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:12.760
So, by the end of 2017 institute
we will have served about 70

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.540
or so language communities.

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.650
Every time provide
digital surrogates,

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:21.650
providing instruction,
access to the materials.

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:24.190
Now, we're trying to evolve,

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:29.800
because you know yes we could
keep doing this every 2 years

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:35.090
if the NSF documenting endangered
languages program is willing

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:36.830
to continue to fund us.

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:41.320
But we see a need to
evolve in a couple of ways.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:44.580
First of all, one thing we're
doing this year is we're doing an

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:47.030
assessment of the program
to make sure

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:51.210 position:56%
that indeed participants leave
knowing that they can always go back

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.410
to the catalogs and they
know how to use them.

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:58.710
That's something we haven't
been able to measure easily

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:01.670
without a structure to do so.

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:04.250
A person dedicated to
following up, and so on.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.470
So, we're going be doing that
assessment of the program,

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:10.370
not of the participants, but
of our program this year.

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:14.910
The other thing we are doing
also based on the experience,

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:20.740
of serving the experiences of these
researchers, is that we've come

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:26.410
to the realization that we're
asking these researchers to develop

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:31.430 position:56%
in two weeks the ability to research
catalogs, the ability to carry

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.920
out linguistic analysis
and the ability

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.760
to develop an implied
linguistics and pedagogy,

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.800
or language teaching approach.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.200
All of that in two weeks.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:47.490
So, that's a tremendous demand on
these researchers and we're trying

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:51.610
to figure out how to facilitate at
least a part that we know how to do

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:55.280
as curators, and archivist,
and library scientist.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:01.910
So, in collaboration
with Miami University,

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:04.860
we are taking this tool MIDA,

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.860
which is the Miami-Illinois
Digital Archives developed

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:13.260
by the Myaami tribe and apply
it, or make it available

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:16.440
to Breath of Life participants.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:21.490
What this tool does is it allows
you to upload digital surrogates,

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.710
high-quality archival tips.

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:29.160
You're able to code the
type of document that it is,

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.860
transcribe the language material.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:37.860
Translate it, gloss it, do whatever
level of analysis you need to do

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:42.700
and it also allows you to
output data from this analysis.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:47.510
So, the Myaami tribe is using
it to develop a dictionary,

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:50.330
which they don't yet have.

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:53.580
But when I learned about this
tool, which was developed through

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:59.270
and NEH grant, I figured that we
could tweak it to make it available

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:06.360
to any community that is ready,
that has the human resources

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.890
and an interest to do that kind
of work on their own language.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:13.040
So, we're planning to do a pilot
this summer during the Breath

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:17.600
of Life weeks to test it out,
we'll work with one community

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.680
that precisely had that experience.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.440
We were able to digitize everything

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.130
on their language,
deliver it to them.

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:28.550
We thought, we were very proud and
then they were very overwhelmed.

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:34.520
So, now we're to work through
the materials with this tool

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:41.140
and see how we can make it usable
within the Breath of Life context.

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:44.210
Let me see how am I doing on time.

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:48.250
I think I can still spend a little
bit of time on field research.

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:49.550
Maybe I wanted to do this

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:53.150
because that's something
I really like to do.

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:56.440 position:56%
So, many of us are out in the field.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:00.610
The three curators behind
Recovering Voices have field sites

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:04.690
that we've been working
at for a very long time.

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:09.960 position:56%
We have community relationships that
go back 15, 20 years and we work.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:14.720
We have fellows, and interns,
and collaborators that are

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.750
out in the field regularly.

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:21.770
I want to tell you little
bit about one project

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:25.160
that I've been involved
in for many, many years.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:28.370
Just to show you how
collections-based research,

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:32.300
how we conceive of
collections-based research based

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.810
on outside in the field.

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:37.530
We're not just tied to
the museum collections.

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:41.100
I'm going to talk about the
work that I've been doing

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.960 position:56%
to document the lexicon of Diidxaza,

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:47.690
which is Zapotec language
spoken in the south of Mexico.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:52.790
It's spoken by about 70,000
speakers, which sounds like a lot,

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:56.510
but in reality, of
the 22 municipalities

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:59.920
where the language is
spoken, only or two have kids

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.220
that are learning the language.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:05.270
So, at this point, in the
community that I work the most,

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:08.100
the youngest speakers are
in their late 20s already.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:15.540
So, in devising a dictionary
for this I came upon; so,

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:19.200
this is a dictionary with
well over 10,000 entries.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.460
Now it's about 13,000.

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:24.510
About 1000 of those entries
were related to plants.

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:28.420
And I had crazy entries
like the one I have here.

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:34.960 position:56%
Where a tree would be called
[foreign words], so different names.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:40.100 position:56%
They would give me different names
in Spanish for the for this one word

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.130
in Zapotec [foreign words].

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:48.130
And the descriptions I
had were all over the map.

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:53.870
It's you know sometimes I would
be told that the tree exfoliates,

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:55.290
sometimes it doesn't exfoliate.

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:56.590
Sometimes it has latex.

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:58.350
Sometimes it has sap.

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:00.070
Sometimes it has medicinal uses.

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:01.550
Sometimes it doesn't.

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:06.840
And that made me realize that the
documentation I had collected,

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:11.200
this was in 2010, was just not
going to give me the documentation

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.710
that would be adequate
for a dictionary.

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:15.990
So, because I was already at
the Museum of Natural History,

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:17.900
I start talking to botanists.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:21.290
I ran a pilot in 2012
to try to figure out how

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:23.990
to conduct botanical research,

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:27.880
which is something I did not
learn in linguistics school.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.510
And, to make a long story short,

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:34.880
we carried out a one-year
plant documentation project,

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.960
interdisciplinary looking
at documenting the plants

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.200
with two botanists in the project.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.500
Documenting knowledge with
several knowledge bearers

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:49.620
from the community, taking
audio, taking photographs

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.130
by a professional photographer.

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:56.570
And in the end, we ended
up with a huge database

00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:59.460
which we're tweaking, even today.

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:02.970
We did 92 field collection sights.

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:06.040
Lots of numbers that I
don't need to bore you with.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:11.230 position:56%
But we ended up with a collection; a
huge collection of botanical samples

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:14.360
like the one you can see there,
housed at the National Museum

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:18.070
of National History, at the
National Herbarium in Mexico,

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:21.090
and two herbaria in [inaudible],

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:24.760
in the state where the
community is located.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.950
And we have over 5000 high-quality,

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:31.280
high resolution images
of the plants.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.840
So, with that we were
able to clean things up.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:38.420
And I learned that there's an
entire, sort of the equivalent

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:42.320
of a genus of [foreign word] trees.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.580
And indeed, they have
very different properties

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:47.330
because they're very
different species.

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:49.140
They belong to different families.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.690
So, they're going to look
different and behave differently.

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:58.110
And now, we have a clear
understanding of why these trees,

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:00.340
despite their very
different properties,

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:03.640
are all lumped into
this one category.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:07.940
And it's the architecture of the
tree that brings them all together.

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:09.760
We did not realize that.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:12.860
These photos are from
the very last day

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:17.470
of one year of being in the field.

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:22.170
So, now let me just go back here.

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:26.690
This is a collection that
did not exist before.

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:29.980
Botanists, when they go out to the
field, they come back with hundreds

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:34.410
of plant samples, but the knowledge
is not something they have the

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:35.960
bandwidth to document.

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.260
We were able to do that.

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:40.980
We were able to also
create resources

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.730
that are meaningful
to the community.

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:44.950
The audios, the photographs.

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:49.280
The entire collection
is accessible online

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:52.120
through the botany
department's website.

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.660
But also, there's a dedicated
website for the collection.

00:27:55.660 --> 00:28:01.100
And we created educational
materials for children,

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:04.910
for schools that are being
disseminated free of charge.

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:11.140
And we also developed workshops
around the topics of language

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:18.080
and environmental conservation
for children

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:22.680
which have been a running
monthly for over two years.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.250
We also had a community visit
funded through the project.

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:30.700
This was a project funded by
the Museum of Natural History.

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:36.110
So, you can see here, the gentleman
in the photo, in the bottom photo,

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:37.890
was our key knowledge bearer.

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:41.070
He took us to the hills
for a full year.

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:44.140
And at the top, there's another
gentleman with his hands like this.

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:50.060
He is a historian and writer from
the community who was here working

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:53.770
with me to write definitions
for the plants in Zapotec.

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:56.710
So, we wrote, we didn't
translate but wrote in tandem.

00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:59.050
I wrote in Spanish and English

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:03.120
and he wrote the descriptions
in Zapotec.

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:07.340
So, again, a very robust
collections-based research

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.720
that is collaborative,
beneficial to the community

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.210
and that be done in the field.

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:17.210
So, just to summarize,
our research priorities.

00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:20.040
National Breath of
Life is a top priority.

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.900
The community research program,

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.640
right now we're serving
three communities.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.830
If we can serve six per year
we'll be very, very happy.

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:31.600
And collaborative field-based
research.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:35.310
We of course, because of the
type of institution that we are.

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:37.640
We have a lot of dissemination
and our reach.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:41.170
A lot of outreach in communities.

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:45.650 position:56%
As I mentioned the work on the
plants led to workshops for children

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:49.920 position:56%
that keep going even two years after
we finished the basic research.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:55.810
And we're constantly doing
public outreach at the museum.

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:58.830
We organize events such as the
Mother Tongue Film Festival,

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:02.390
which will be taking place
around the February 21st,

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:06.780
which is Mother Tongue Day,
observed internationally.

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:09.310
So, keep an eye out for that.

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:11.160
And that's it.

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:14.470 position:56%
I probably did; well, no 30 minutes.

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:18.510 position:56%
So, I'm available for any questions.

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:24.510
[ Applause ]

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:35.270
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:39.130
Yeah, so the question was whether
the [inaudible] community has

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:41.090 position:56%
participated in any of our programs.

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:43.030
They haven't.

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:49.110
But Jesse [inaudible] is of
course very; her background

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:51.370
and her contributions
are very comparable

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:52.820
to those of Darrell Baldwin.

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:56.310
So, we follow her work closely

00:30:56.310 --> 00:31:00.550
because it informs a great
deal of what we're doing.

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.840
Yes?

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:36.040
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:40.980
So, the question is whether
across the tribes, there's support

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:44.970
and networking for the purposes
of language revitalization.

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:47.140
They answer is yes.

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:48.440
so, there's a couple of things.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:52.040
Again, I think that Darrell
Baldwin's involvement in Breath

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:56.180
of Life is very much an attempt
to share the model that has worked

00:31:56.180 --> 00:32:00.610
so well for his tribe and his
language and put it to the service

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:04.430
of other tribes that might
be doing similar work.

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:07.890
One tricky thing with
revitalization overall is

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:10.420
that there's no one-size-fits-all.

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.410
And what works with one
community might totally bomb

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:14.890
in another community.

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:22.200
So, Breath of Life is a very
effective way for the experience

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:25.710
of people doing revitalization
in language reclamation.

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:28.730
So, in the cases where there
are no longer speakers,

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:33.700
or the base of first language
speakers was lost at some point.

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:37.180
And share those experiences
so that other practitioners

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:44.180
of revitalization can adapt those
experiences to their own benefit.

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:48.870
National Breath of Life, actually
one of the main objectives

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:53.650
of the program is to allow
participants to become part

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:57.360
of a growing network of
revitalization practitioners.

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.480
That's one of those things that
are a little bit intangible.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.790
It's difficult to measure.

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:08.140
But we know that over time, all of
these practitioners will be talking

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:10.760
to each other and learning
from each other.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:14.110
And in Breath of Life
we take participants

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:15.410
with different backgrounds.

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:19.180
We might have someone coming
in who has been involved

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:24.300
in the revitalization program for
20 years, and we might have someone

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.020
who is just getting into it
because now they have a baby

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:29.930
and they want the baby
to speak the language.

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:33.120
And you know all the
experiences in between.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:37.040
So, they're able to talk to each
other with observed conversations

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.500
when someone will say
well and I really want

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.350
to have a school in my community.

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:43.650
I don't know how to do it.

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:44.950
I'm really overwhelmed.

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:47.670
And that's a conversation at
the beginning of the two weeks.

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:49.160
And by the end of the two weeks,

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.560
the conversation is now I know
what I need to tell my tribe.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:53.860
Now I know how to do it.

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:55.580
Now I know people who
have been doing it

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:59.060
and who are willing to advise me.

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:02.970
So, yeah, there's very
much a lot of communication

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:06.370
and we try to foster that as well.

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:08.170
Yeah?

00:34:08.170 --> 00:35:01.310
[ Inaudible Audience Comment ]

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:04.510
Yeah, there was another
question here.

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:42.980
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:45.400
So, you're asking whether in a case

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:49.830
like the Quechua whether they
would be able to benefit from some

00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:53.340
of these programs that we're
running at Recovering Voices,

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:56.510
or from Breath of Life,
specifically?

00:35:56.510 --> 00:36:17.440
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:21.900 position:56%
Okay, so this is where the one size.

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:26.590
No one-size-fits-all
comment comes into play.

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:32.020
There are, actually one thing that
we're doing within Recovery Voices,

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:35.510
which is a separate line
of you know research,

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:41.430 position:56%
is to try to document revitalization
efforts around the world.

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:45.790
Because we know a great deal
about what's being done in the US,

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:49.080
in Canada, in Australia,
and New Zealand.

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:54.520
Hawaii's the US, but it's
slightly different context.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:58.050
But, we don't know much about
what the situation is elsewhere,

00:36:58.050 --> 00:36:59.350
and yet there's a lot

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:02.360
of revitalization happening
around the world.

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:07.020
The idea with this research is
to be able to kind of get a sense

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:10.260
of how people respond to
their needs and challenges

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.790
in a new revitalization process.

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:20.410
Every community that wants to do
revitalization faces the issue

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:24.490
of not having materials
to teach the language.

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:28.370
And something that is very curious
is that revitalization seems

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:32.530
to have moved away from a natural
transmission of the language

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:36.450
from parent to child,
or caregiver to child.

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:38.430
To a language teaching practice.

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:43.030
And the language teaching
requires ancillary materials

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:44.330
to support the work.

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:48.790
What my suggestion would
be in that particular case,

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:53.250
I mean Quechua has a lot of
support because there's been a lot

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:57.400
of linguistics, anthropology
research conducted

00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:00.800
on the various languages.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.180
So, it might just be a matter

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:08.190
of looking actually locally what
other communities have developed

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:13.330
in the way of resources, and
learn from those experiences.

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:16.350
It's a long process and
sometimes when you think,

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:18.300
well it's really only
the grandparents

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:21.890
that are speaking the language
and the kids need to learn it,

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:26.330
and by the time we write the
books we might have lost many

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:27.650
of the speakers.

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:30.600
And so, what might come in handy

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:34.740
in that case is the
master apprentice model.

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:40.470
Which is when a language
speaker gets paired

00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:42.890
up with a language learner.

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:46.300
Generally, adults, but it could
work with children as well,

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:50.900
for the purposes of creating a
kind of and immersion environment

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:54.460
between these two people for the
purposes of speaking the language,

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:57.370
and having the person learn
the language independently

00:38:57.370 --> 00:39:00.920
of whether there might be
materials to support that process.

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:05.170
And so, this model,
specifically, wants to go back

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:08.530
to the natural transmission of
language and the development

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:10.940
of an immersion environment.

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:13.710
So, it sounds like maybe
in this particular case,

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:16.010
there can be an effort
to develop materials,

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:19.970
but maybe a master apprentice
type of model would work.

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:25.280
One thing we did in La Ventosa
for those Zapotec language

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.990
that I've been working
on for the dictionary

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:31.410
and the plants documentation is
that, I mean I develop materials

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:37.310 position:56%
as part of the project, but we also,
we were not going to write a grammar

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:40.500
and you know a this and a that.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:43.310
So, really the workshops
are designed

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:46.640
to emphasize oral communication

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:49.890
between these knowledge
bearers and the children.

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:52.850
And when you work with
children it works like this.

00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:57.140
I mean you have to provide the
child with sufficient input.

00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:04.490
They need to be able to get well
over 20% of their day in Quechua

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:09.300
in order for them to have
sufficient input for their brain

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:14.440
to acquire the language and for the
child to develop into a competent,

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.450
especially confident speaker.

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:19.460
If they are not confident,
they're not going to speak.

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:23.680
So, if there can be a combination
on those elements, I think that,

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:28.010
based on what you just told
me maybe that can work.

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:31.500
Yeah?

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:37.230
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:38.880
Is there an audio or video
component to the work?

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:44.630
Yes. Audio has been critical
for the longest time.

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:50.460
And that's why you know, projects
like the, or documentation

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:55.820
as far back as when wax cylinders
were the medium has been critical.

00:40:55.820 --> 00:41:00.710
You can annotate as much as you
want, but you lose a lot of detail

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:09.080
if the documenter missed a slight
detail of the pronunciation,

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:12.260
then you already have
deficient documentation.

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:17.410
So, audio is really critical
and the audio needs to be done,

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:19.430
recorded at a very high quality.

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:24.390
So, yes. That's always an element.

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:29.490
We, in Breath of Life we very
much see the relevance of audio.

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:34.170 position:56%
Actually, one of the key reasons
why the partnership with the Library

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:36.600
of Congress makes so much sense is

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:42.960
that you know the wax cylinders
were moved here some time ago,

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:47.660
and that's a tremendous
resource for these communities.

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:53.490
Just to give you an example, there
are songs that are recorded that,

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:56.860
for example, for me as a linguist
they don't seem very interesting,

00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:59.270
because the vocabulary is limited.

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:03.370
Maybe the syntax will be
fairly simple and limited.

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:08.180
But the performance of the
song opens a domain of use

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:12.850 position:56%
of the language, which ultimately
is what these communities need to do

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:16.140
in order to bring back
active use of the language.

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:17.790
So, audio is critical.

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:24.550 position:56%
Now, video has now become a much
more accessible medium of recording.

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:26.980
And it allows for everything else.

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:31.900
I mean I'm always, I always
have my hands up in the air.

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:37.740
You know, the cultural elements
that dictate your body language,

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:43.550
your disposition provide a
great deal of information.

00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:47.680
I mentioned that the
Waija chiefs that came

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:51.940
in September spent a fair amount
of time at the film archives.

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:57.870
There are films produced in their
community 50 years ago or so.

00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:59.960
That they never saw.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.840
The filmmakers never went
back to the communities

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.200
to share that work with them.

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.500
So, they were able to see it.

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:08.420
And granted there's no
audio to go with it.

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:12.310
But there was so much cultural
information in that video

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:14.030
that they were just ecstatic.

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:18.830 position:56%
And we were able to give them copies
of the video finally to take back.

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:22.740 position:56%
So, long way to say, yes [laughter].

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:26.080
Yes?

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:41.120
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:45.450
Sure. Well, I mean again Breath of
Life is very much about outreach.

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:49.130
It's, you know a community member
that I'm never going to know

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:52.070
about because I'm working
in the south of Mexico.

00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:56.040
But because we have this
programmatic activity, we you know,

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:59.370
put out the call and you
know people get to apply

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:01.510
that otherwise we wouldn't
be able to reach.

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:04.570
So, it is very much about outreach.

00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:11.250
Now, the workshops that we designed

00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:14.450
for the community is
entirely outreach.

00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:17.730
And the material.

00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:22.870 position:56%
So, we curated in collaboration with
the knowledge bearers in La Ventosa,

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:25.050
we curated a selection of plants

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:27.710
that they felt were the
most representative,

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:29.740 position:56%
or the most important to know about.

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:37.130
Because we documented, we
collected 1300 botanical samples.

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:43.920
Out of those, we documented 288
Zapotec names and so we brought

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:47.010
that down to a selection
of 54 Zapotec names

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:51.180
that were the most important and we
produced a, which I meant to bring

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.510
and I forgot this morning.

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:53.810
I'm very sorry.

00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:56.000
But we produced these very big,

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.750
sturdy books that are
actually like fact cards.

00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:02.320
So, you can distribute
them in the classroom

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:07.870
and you know they can get beat
up and so on and they'll last.

00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:12.780
With information in
Zapotec first, then Spanish.

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:16.110
It has all the botanical
information.

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:20.190
You know, the family, genus types.

00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:26.700
So, that these materials can be
appealing for the knowledge bearer

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:31.670
without scholar-ization to
the natural sciences teacher

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:33.730
in the academic environment.

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:36.480
And we can bridge the
cultural knowledge

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:40.900
and the academic approaches
for the purposes

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:42.660
of learning about the local plants.

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:44.160
Learning about the names.

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:47.670
Also, inviting people
to read in Zapotec.

00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:51.970
This community has had a
writing system since the 50s,

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:54.790
but very few people
actually read and write.

00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:56.930
So, you know my colleague
there in pink,

00:45:56.930 --> 00:46:02.770
he's one of the most prolific
writers ever in this region,

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:05.150
but there are very few like him.

00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:10.200
So, the orange booklets there are
literacy manuals that we produced.

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:15.360
That was the one kind of applied
linguistics, item that we produced

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:19.730
for the project to invite people
to, in an accessible manner

00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:22.140
to start reading more
in their language.

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:23.830
So, that's all.

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:27.870
We also produced games, which
the child is actually holding.

00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:29.760
It's like a Bingo card with plants.

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.290
So, it's all outreach.

00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:35.390
You have to be very
strategic about how you do it.

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:38.380
You need to make sure that the
outreach happens independently

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:40.000
of whether you're present there.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.410
And that's really not easy to do.

00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:52.850
But I think that's one of the
challenges that we're most happy

00:46:52.850 --> 00:46:55.800
about in terms of how we've
been able to meet that.

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:58.560
So, the same thing we can
do here in the museum.

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:02.780
We can do the whole thing,
packaged, so-to-speak in the field.

00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:05.630
Yes?

00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:18.040
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.820
Okay, so amazing question.

00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:21.210
So, the question is how do you deal

00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:24.000
with the rich dialectology
of Zapotec languages.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:30.950 position:56%
So, the term Zapotec actually refers
to a family of languages as diverse

00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:33.040
as the romance languages.

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:37.930
So, you know someone who
speaks [inaudible] La Ventosa

00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:43.600 position:56%
like this gentleman and the kid will
not be able to understand the person

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:49.170
who is from the central valleys
near the capital city of the state.

00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:53.250
Different tonal systems,
different pronominal systems.

00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:56.560
Just like Spanish, and
Portuguese, and Italian.

00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.150
So, what do we do?

00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:01.420
Actually, the approach,
and this is the Zapotec

00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:04.520
and not necessarily the
approach of Recovering Voices.

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:07.810
The approach by Zapotec
is to document as many

00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:11.690
of these language varieties
as we possibly can,

00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:14.570
so that we can understand
the differences and so

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:18.140
that we can understand whether,
you know, how we can make decisions

00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:21.910
about what materials to produce
for each of these communities.

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:26.070
And there's an army of linguists
at this point in Waija tending

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:29.190
to Zapotec languages,
and many other languages.

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:33.130
Mystic languages have the same
level of dialectal diversity.

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:35.890
But it's, you know, the
materials that I produced

00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:42.130
in Zapotec can be used
across 22 communities

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:44.430
because of dialectal differences,

00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:48.130
they do not impede
mutual intelligibility.

00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:51.160
But it is very much the case
that from one town to the next,

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:55.060
the tonal system will be different.

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:56.620
So, it's a huge challenge.

00:48:56.620 --> 00:49:00.570
You really need a lot
of customization

00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:06.740
for a situation as diverse as that.

00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:08.540
Yes?

00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:44.070
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:49:44.070 --> 00:49:49.200
So, the question is can existing
materials from one language

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:53.200 position:56%
or one community be used for another
language and another community.

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:54.510
That's very much the case.

00:49:54.510 --> 00:50:02.000
Yes. And I would say that
definitely reclamation efforts

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.760
in the US are very much based
on that level of exchange.

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:10.970
And Guha was mentioning the
Wampanoag using the dictionary

00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:17.090
developed by the Passamaquoddy
because they had documented words

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:20.460
that the Wampanoag no
longer had access to.

00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:26.090
Similarly, for the Myaamia
language, they looked at Myaamia,

00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:27.830
they looked at Peoria
and they looked

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:33.770
at other related languages
in a similar way.

00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:36.860
The [inaudible] they're
always looking at all

00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:41.290
of the [inaudible] language, well
not all of them, but a set of,

00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:43.200
closely related [inaudible]
languages

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.760
because they can draw from.

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:48.390
And then they also share the
materials and the approaches.

00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:55.110
So, you know again, there is no one
size that fits all the situations,

00:50:55.110 --> 00:50:59.840 position:56%
but the exchange and taking a little
bit of here and applying it there,

00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:05.570
that's really how the communities
develop their approaches.

00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:08.730
And it's a massive effort.

00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:10.370
And I do know.

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:14.140
When I started studying
linguistics a really long time ago,

00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:16.680
things looked pretty grim.

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:18.270
And they don't look grim anymore.

00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:22.420
It's amazing how many people
are so incredibly devoted

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:28.140 position:56%
to restoring their cultural
knowledge, restoring their languages

00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:30.470
that it's really encouraging.

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:32.270
Yes?

[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:51:57.850 --> 00:52:01.780
Well, so the question is
can language communities

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:04.280
with just a couple speakers left,

00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:08.740
what resources or recourse
they have.

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:14.880 position:56%
Breath of Life is very much geared
towards assisting those communities.

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:19.420 position:56%
Also, community research program has
already worked with the [inaudible]

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:25.130
in California, and with
the [inaudible] language

00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:30.620
out of the Warm Springs
Confederated Tribes of Oregon.

00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:34.220
And the [inaudible] no longer
have first language speakers.

00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:36.330
So, they're rebuilding
a speaker base.

00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:41.730
For [inaudible], actually they
don't have first language speakers

00:52:41.730 --> 00:52:43.030
any more.

00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:45.000
But the process is the
same, they come here,

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000
they look at the materials,
they go back.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.700
There's always someone in the
community, or a group or people

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:53.590
in the community who are
dedicated to learning the language

00:52:53.590 --> 00:52:55.860
and becoming second-language
speakers.

00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:59.630
And you know, the master
apprentice program is a model

00:52:59.630 --> 00:53:02.440
that is often implemented when you
have just a couple of speakers.

00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:06.270
You have a couple of speakers and
you know someone pairs up with one

00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:11.180
of them and now you have an
exchange of linguistic knowledge

00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:15.920
and you know people who can
hold on to that language even

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:19.500
if these two last speakers
pass away.

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:22.840
I mean it's a less
than ideal situation.

00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:29.310
But Breath of Life is precisely
named Breath of Life because it's

00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:33.750
so heavily focused on
those kinds of situation.

00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:35.550
Yes?

[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:47.960
Yes. So, the question is
what interaction have I had

00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:52.540
with the diaspora community
of [inaudible] in Los Angeles.

00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:58.670
I dedicated my dissertation to the
study of the diaspora community

00:53:58.670 --> 00:54:02.080
and the relationship between them
and the home community and how

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:04.480
that affected language vitality.

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:10.090
And I carried out a couple
of extra field research trips

00:54:10.090 --> 00:54:14.240
to the LA area after
my dissertation.

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:20.070
Much to my regret,
it's the one project

00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:22.880 position:56%
that has fallen beyond my bandwidth.

00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:26.220
And it's not something I've
been able to follow up with.

00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:30.230
So, I've done it in
a number of ways.

00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:32.940
I've maintained my contact
in a number of ways.

00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:37.220
So, for example, the young
woman in the checkered shirt,

00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:42.270
kind of on your right of the
photography, she is a member

00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:45.870
of the [inaudible] community
in the Los Angeles area.

00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:50.570
She is one of very, very few people
in the community within the US

00:54:50.570 --> 00:54:55.150
or [inaudible] that have
gotten an undergraduate degree.

00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:58.100
She got it in biology.

00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:02.770
And when I met her during one of
my field research visits to LA,

00:55:02.770 --> 00:55:08.750
she told me that she was
interested in cultural elements.

00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:11.190
Recovery of cultural knowledge,

00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:15.560
considering in the
diasporic context.

00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:18.050 position:56%
And we know one thing led to another

00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:20.060
and when I put together
this project.

00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:21.880
I told her listen,
this is an example

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:25.970
of how you can bring your biology
background and your interest

00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:29.470
in culture and do something
very meaningful

00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:31.570
for many different stakeholders.

00:55:31.570 --> 00:55:34.430
And so, I was able to
fund a trip for her

00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:37.810
to come to the project from LA.

00:55:37.810 --> 00:55:40.590
So, it's not something I've
been able to follow up on.

00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:46.470
But, for example, I have it in
my radar may be a year from now

00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:51.320
to replicate this project in
three or four other communities.

00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:54.770
Zapotec communities in Mexico.

00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:57.950
And it's in my radar to keep
track of this young woman.

00:55:57.950 --> 00:56:01.750
Because the community
[inaudible] is one of the places

00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:03.580
where I would want
to do the research.

00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:05.900
And she could be the
person leading that effort.

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:10.690
So, again it's not something that's
going to happen like this, but yes,

00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:16.560
there's always a way to
you know pull them in.

00:56:35.590 --> 00:56:36.920
Yes, absolutely.

00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:39.230
They have to.

00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:45.790
Sometimes we have invited
linguists whose research is not

00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:47.840
in that language family.

00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:51.980
But, on the condition that
they need to get up to speed

00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:53.280
on the literature and so on.

00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:57.820
So yes, absolutely that
is a critical element

00:56:57.820 --> 00:57:00.710
of the selection of the linguist.

00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:03.510
And the linguist goes through
a competitive process too.

00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:09.090
This year, God, I mean we're
going to need 15 linguists.

00:57:09.090 --> 00:57:12.260 position:56%
And we've got about 35 applications.

00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:15.710
So, it's just as competitive
on that side.

00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:17.510
Which is great.

on an Algonquin language.

There might be a Zapotec
researcher coming this year.

00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:36.590
She happens to be at UMass Amherst.

00:57:36.590 --> 00:57:40.090

collection of untapped materials

from [inaudible], which is her town.

So, all of us, and you
know she speaks English

00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:47.940
and so she can be part of this.

00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:50.510

How do you turn it around?

00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:44.130 position:56%
So, the question is how do you turn
around, you know attitudes that are,

00:58:44.130 --> 00:58:52.700
yeah, apathy or what's the word.

00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:58.300 position:56%
Yes, indifference, or helpless ness,
yeah I think that's a big issue.

00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:00.780
And also, you know
there's other things,

00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:04.990
a lot of discrimination
involved and so on.

00:59:04.990 --> 00:59:11.590
So, language attitude
really is a critical factor.

00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:16.030
I mean after all it is language
attitudes and similar types

00:59:16.030 --> 00:59:19.620
of displays of tolerance
or intolerance

00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:24.240
that have driven these
languages to the state

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:28.450
of affairs that we have now.

00:59:28.450 --> 00:59:36.430
Changing them, as we know, social
change is a very long-term project.

00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:43.390
So, awareness raising
is really important.

00:59:43.390 --> 00:59:46.770
Raising awareness about
the value of diversity.

00:59:46.770 --> 00:59:51.520
Because we've been taught since the
1800s when nations were being built

00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:55.850
around the model of one nation, one
language, that that's the only way

00:59:55.850 --> 01:00:00.120
to sustain you know
the unity of a nation.

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:06.230
And you know with that comes a lot
of educational practices grounded

01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:10.550 position:56%
on the notion that people;
children can only learn one language

01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:13.730
and if they learn two or
more, they'll be delayed.

01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:16.140
They'll go crazy, etcetera.

01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:18.850
So, now, we're in a different
situation where we have

01:00:18.850 --> 01:00:26.840
to research backed data to show
that a child not only can earn more

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:33.490
than a language, but that the child
will develop certain abilities

01:00:33.490 --> 01:00:38.330 position:56%
beyond the levels that a monolingual
child will be able to develop them.

01:00:38.330 --> 01:00:40.660
And these are abilities
like executive function.

01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:42.970
The ability to focus on
one thing despite the fact

01:00:42.970 --> 01:00:46.160
that we might have a lot
of stimuli around you.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:49.600
That is much more developed
in a bilingual child

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:52.070
than in a monolingual child.

01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:54.070
So, we can start pushing that out

01:00:54.070 --> 01:00:57.660
and I think linguists are doing
a decent job in doing that.

01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:02.630 position:56%
It's just that perhaps there isn't a
very good centralized way to do it.

01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:04.900
Although UNESCO has
been trying to do so.

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:09.300
That's why the Mother Tongue
International Day exists.

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:13.090
To just raise awareness
internationally about the fact

01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:14.700
that there are 7000 languages.

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:19.200
They all are important for a reason
or another, and the reasons go

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:22.360
of the spectrum of human
rights to it's critical

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:25.970
for the advancement of science.

01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:31.410
And you know so, again, I think
that there are a lot of movements,

01:01:31.410 --> 01:01:34.740
perhaps not as widespread
as we would want them.

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:40.330
And certainly, revitalization
cannot wait for all

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:41.920
of these changes to happen.

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:45.790
They actually have to happen at
the same time and for example

01:01:45.790 --> 01:01:49.660
within the linguistics discipline
seeing communities engage

01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:54.140
with the revitalization of their
language just has pulled the entire

01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:55.440
discipline along.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.520
And there's still people
who are armchair linguists

01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.230
who are not going to get involved.

01:01:59.230 --> 01:02:04.140
But an entire generation
of linguists has emerged

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:07.120
that is dedicated to documenting
these languages and working

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:10.560
in a collaborative way
with these communities.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.990
So again, I think these are all
things that are going to have

01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:16.760
to happen at the same time.

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:19.780
I mean just to give
an example, in Mexico,

01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:24.250
the last 10 years have
been critical.

01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:26.670
Mexico has very progressive
legislation

01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:29.300
in support of indigenous languages.

01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:31.480 position:56%
The practice is a whole other issue.

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:39.760 position:56%
But because that legislation exists,
an organization that is a law based,

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:45.200
a legal consultancy, not-for-profit
legal consultancy grounded

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:49.640
on the observance of linguistic
rights has emerged in Oaxaca

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:53.580
that has entirely transformed
the scene in Oaxaca.

01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:58.250
They work with judges to educate
them, and so on and so forth.

01:02:58.250 --> 01:03:00.900
I mean it's work that is very
removed from what we're doing

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:04.780
in Recovering Voices,
because we can't do it all.

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:06.700
We're not going to go
and save the world.

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:11.230
But everybody is having to do
you know what they know how to do

01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:15.720
and apply it to supporting
the same goal.

01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:24.510
Any other questions?

01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:45.150
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:46.590
Yeah, very good question.

01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:49.880
So, the question is how many
languages can we support

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:51.180
with the collections that we have

01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:54.760
at the National Anthropological
Archives.

01:03:54.760 --> 01:04:01.050
We can very safely say that
we probably have something

01:04:01.050 --> 01:04:04.160
from every single language
that has been spoken

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:07.410
in the United States
since the 1800s.

01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:11.050
How much do we have is
a different question?

01:04:11.050 --> 01:04:15.950
We have very vast collections of
Algonquin languages, for example.

01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:20.440
There's a language that
was spoken in California

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:23.980
that no longer has speakers and
that was very poorly documented.

01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:28.630
The language is [inaudible] and
in 2011 we hosted a researcher

01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:30.590
from the [inaudible] community.

01:04:30.590 --> 01:04:35.130
And at first when I saw what we
had I was like well it's not a lot.

01:04:35.130 --> 01:04:39.450 position:56%
I don't think that she's going to be
able to do much with this material.

01:04:39.450 --> 01:04:41.490
But then I learned
about the situation

01:04:41.490 --> 01:04:45.080 position:56%
and this person was actually
scouting the world for documentation

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:48.780
on [inaudible], which meant that
her coming to see these materials

01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:53.590
and this was before we had a
more robust digitization element

01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:54.930
as we do now.

01:04:54.930 --> 01:04:56.780
But it made a lot of sense for her

01:04:56.780 --> 01:05:01.620
to come even though this was
not a massive collection.

01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:06.690
But the other thing is that that's
why we partner with the Library

01:05:06.690 --> 01:05:09.200
of Congress and NMAI,

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:14.490
because sometimes we might have
a little bit and they have a ton.

01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:18.410
So, yeah. So, right now, precisely
right now, we're in the process

01:05:18.410 --> 01:05:19.730
of looking at the collection.

01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:22.760
So, we've already done
our survey based on the 65

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:25.640
or 70 people who've
applied we've already looked

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:31.090
at our collections
to determine what we.

01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:35.200
And there were a few
cases where I noted

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:37.630
that we didn't have a
very robust collection.

01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:41.480
And so now our program
assistant is going to look

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:46.190
at what these languages and what
library of Congress and NMAI have

01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:51.360
for these languages because that
might change the picture entirely.

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:52.880
Yeah. Yeah.

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:56.640
And the thing is exchanging
resources and making all

01:05:56.640 --> 01:06:00.120
of these resources, not just
the NAA, but the resources

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:02.750 position:56%
in the three institutions available.

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:08.640
Well, thank you for
the great questions.

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:11.320

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:12.700
&gt;&gt; GUHA SHANKAR: So, thank
you so much Gabrielle,

01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:14.510
that was an amazing presentation.

01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:17.560
Thank you all for coming and
from the prospect of the Library

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:21.580
of Congress, we are very happy and
glad to be part of this enterprise

01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:26.510
that you have embarked on and we
look forward to working with you

01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:28.340
and give us some food
for thought here

01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:31.710
on how our collections might best
serve, you know this enterprise

01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:33.170
that we're all in together.

01:06:33.170 --> 01:06:34.970
So, thanks again.
