00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
How are all these problems classified?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's look on advanced search to see what the individual attibutes

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
of a bug report are.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Up here you can see the status of the problem.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Is it a new problem or is it a resolved problem?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If it's a resolved problem, you can look up the resolution here.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Was it fixed, or is it something that won't be fixed?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Further down you can see the version

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
of Mozilla that is affected by the problem

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
as well as the severity and the priority of the problem.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
What do these fields mean?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Let's look at them in detail.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So, what are all these fields?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
First there's severity, which describes the impact of the problem on the user.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The most severe problems are classified as blockers or show stoppers.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
These are problems that effectively halt all further development.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Then the are critical problems, major problems, minor problems,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
down to enhancement requests.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Enhancement requests are issues a user

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
would like to see in some future version.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
They are also stored in the problem database.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Let's say that other problems are more severe at this point.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Priority defines how soon the problem will be addressed.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The problems with the highest priority will be addressed first.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Problems with lower priority will be addressed later.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The Bug ID is a unique identifier or number,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
which allows you to precisely identify a single problem.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Comments are left by developers

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
adding additional information about the bug

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
or proposing fixes on how to address the bug.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Finally notification.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
These are the stakeholders.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Whoever is listed here will be notified automatically

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
whenever a problem gets a new status.
