has to do with the fact that the normal

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930
has to do with the fact that the normal
 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.709
has to do with the fact that the normal
ring on my home phone had been changed

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719
ring on my home phone had been changed
 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.510
ring on my home phone had been changed
inadvertently a couple days ago and I

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520
inadvertently a couple days ago and I
 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.790
inadvertently a couple days ago and I
never took the time to change it back to

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800
never took the time to change it back to
 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.700
never took the time to change it back to
the regular ring so it was actually

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710
the regular ring so it was actually
 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.300
the regular ring so it was actually
quite faint so I when I actually did

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.310
quite faint so I when I actually did
 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.190
quite faint so I when I actually did
finally wake up I actually heard

finally wake up I actually heard
 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.810
finally wake up I actually heard
something ringing and I thought up that

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820
something ringing and I thought up that
 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.610
something ringing and I thought up that
must be somewhere else another apartment

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620
must be somewhere else another apartment
 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.020
must be somewhere else another apartment

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030
how did you actually find out the user
 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.460
how did you actually find out the user
ah this is a sort of ridiculous

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490
they must have given the prize in
 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.389
they must have given the prize in
chemistry so i simply said okay who's

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399
chemistry so i simply said okay who's
 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:15.190
chemistry so i simply said okay who's
the schnook that got the price this size

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200

work for which you're awarded you had

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900
work for which you're awarded you had
 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.770
work for which you're awarded you had
the idea of using green fluorescent

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780
the idea of using green fluorescent
 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.960
the idea of using green fluorescent
protein in species other than the

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970
protein in species other than the
 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.210
protein in species other than the
jellyfish in which he was found and it

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220
jellyfish in which he was found and it
 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.520
jellyfish in which he was found and it
was Doug prasher who cloned it and then

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530
was Doug prasher who cloned it and then
 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.410
was Doug prasher who cloned it and then
you you had the idea of taking it from

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420
you you had the idea of taking it from
 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.050
you you had the idea of taking it from
him and expressing it in your systems

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060
him and expressing it in your systems
 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.359
him and expressing it in your systems
and see I would put it slightly I would

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369
and see I would put it slightly I would
 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.969
and see I would put it slightly I would
use the wording slightly differently I

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979
use the wording slightly differently I
 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.600
use the wording slightly differently I
had heard about gfp and a seminar that I

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610
had heard about gfp and a seminar that I
 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.100
had heard about gfp and a seminar that I
was listening to in about nineteen

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110
was listening to in about nineteen
 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.649
was listening to in about nineteen
eighty early nineteen eighty Max and I

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659
eighty early nineteen eighty Max and I
 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.480
eighty early nineteen eighty Max and I
tried to find out who was studying this

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490
tried to find out who was studying this
 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.490
tried to find out who was studying this
and whether we could work on it and I

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500
and whether we could work on it and I
 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.470
and whether we could work on it and I
talked to Doug and he had ideas that

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480
talked to Doug and he had ideas that
 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.030
talked to Doug and he had ideas that
this would work as well and he was

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040
this would work as well and he was
 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.530
this would work as well and he was
wondering about it me through that was

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540
wondering about it me through that was
 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.509
wondering about it me through that was
certainly the motivation he had in

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519
certainly the motivation he had in
 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.339
certainly the motivation he had in
cloning this dasteen and so we worked we

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349
cloning this dasteen and so we worked we
 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.260
cloning this dasteen and so we worked we
had very excited about a one hour

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270
had very excited about a one hour
 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.220
had very excited about a one hour
conversation on the phone and

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230
conversation on the phone and
 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.410
conversation on the phone and
the upshot of that was that we were

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420
the upshot of that was that we were
 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.020
the upshot of that was that we were
going to collaborate and see if this

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030
going to collaborate and see if this
 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.420
going to collaborate and see if this
would work in C elegans and through a

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430
would work in C elegans and through a
 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.860
would work in C elegans and through a
couple of Miss outs that took us a

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870
couple of Miss outs that took us a
 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.509
couple of Miss outs that took us a
couple of years to actually get back in

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519
couple of years to actually get back in
 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.930
couple of years to actually get back in
touch with one another but in 1992 we

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940
touch with one another but in 1992 we
 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.320
touch with one another but in 1992 we
did and we got the clones from Douglas

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330
did and we got the clones from Douglas
 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.890
did and we got the clones from Douglas
and a very good graduate student this

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900
and a very good graduate student this
 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.820
and a very good graduate student this
gives kirkin put this in e.coli and we

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830
gives kirkin put this in e.coli and we
 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.559
gives kirkin put this in e.coli and we
had green fluorescent e.coli within a

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569
had green fluorescent e.coli within a
 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.259
had green fluorescent e.coli within a
month this yes all quite amazing it and

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269
month this yes all quite amazing it and
 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:55.580
month this yes all quite amazing it and
the worm you study is actually

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590
the worm you study is actually
 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.380
the worm you study is actually
transparent so that you can you can

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390
transparent so that you can you can
 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.089
transparent so that you can you can
label cells and then see them in the

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099
label cells and then see them in the
 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.860
label cells and then see them in the
living world that's correct so when I

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870
living world that's correct so when I
 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.050
living world that's correct so when I
first heard that seminar describing gfp

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060
first heard that seminar describing gfp
 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.289
first heard that seminar describing gfp
and realize I work on a transparent

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299
and realize I work on a transparent
 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.849
and realize I work on a transparent
animal this is going to be terrific I'll

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859
animal this is going to be terrific I'll
 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.259
animal this is going to be terrific I'll
be able to see the cells within the

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269
be able to see the cells within the
 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.509
be able to see the cells within the
living animal that's what really was the

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519
living animal that's what really was the
 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.259
living animal that's what really was the
motivation right right so just one last

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269
motivation right right so just one last
 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:16.490
motivation right right so just one last
question do you have you thought about

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500
question do you have you thought about
 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.470
question do you have you thought about
how you might celebrate once you get off

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480
how you might celebrate once you get off
 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.160
how you might celebrate once you get off
the phone with you well they had a nice

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170

over to this evening and i'll try to
wake up tomorrow and say that it wasn't

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349
wake up tomorrow and say that it wasn't
 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.610
wake up tomorrow and say that it wasn't
a dream I think that'll be the
