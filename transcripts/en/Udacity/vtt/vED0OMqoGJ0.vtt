00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.320
To determine whether there are genetic factors

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:07.920
underlying bipolar disorder, monozygotic and dizygotic studies have

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.940
actually been employed. Now in these studies

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.618
it was found monozygotic twins show a concordance

00:00:14.618 --> 00:00:17.770
of 62% for bipolar disorder. And that

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.500
dizygotic twins show a concordance rate of 8%.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.480
This was true for twins reared together and twins reared apart. So based on just

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.720
this information alone I want you to tell

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.620
me which of the following is most likely to

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.040
be true. Bipolar disorder is explained completely by genetic

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.360
factors where there's a strong genetic component that's influenced

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.107
by the environment or there's a weak genetic component

00:00:39.107 --> 00:00:42.370
that's mainly influenced by the environment. Or the bipolar

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.220
disorder can be explained completely by environmental factors. Go

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.030
ahead and pick which answer you think is best.
