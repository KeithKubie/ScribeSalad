00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.240
Why is RSA secure?

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.140
The security of RSA is based
on the hypothesis that

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.490
factoring a very large number is very,
very hard.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.040
When we say a very large number, we
mean a integer that is at least 512 bit,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.095
but often in the range of
1024 bits to 4096 bits.

00:00:20.095 --> 00:00:22.930
That is, even such a large integer

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.990
is going to take a long time
to factor it into two primes.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.890
On the other hand,
if someone finds a very efficient way

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.180
to factor a large number into primes,
then the security of RSA can be broken.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.000
Here's why.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.692
The public key is given, so
we know n and we know e.

00:00:40.692 --> 00:00:46.440
If we can efficiently factor n into
p x q, where p and q are two primes,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.512
then we can computer
totient(n) as (p- 1)(q- 1).

00:00:51.512 --> 00:00:55.861
And if we can compute totient(n)
knowing the public key e,

00:00:55.861 --> 00:01:00.636
we can then find its multiplicative
inverse, mod totient(n),

00:01:00.636 --> 00:01:03.300
and this inverse is the public key d.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.320
Therefore if we can efficiently factor
a large integer into two primes

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.770
that would mean that from the public
key we can derive the private key.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.850
And that would break the security of RSA
because if you know the private key then

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.689
you can decrypt confidential messages or
you can also forge digital signatures.
