00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.360
You know that feeling when no one's cancelled for tonight

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.400
so you have to go out?

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.300
[sobbing]
[Bach's 'Toccata and Fugue in D minor' plays]

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.800
Ooh, this color is nice.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.160
Yeah, staying in is the new going out - you heard me, I'm not wrong.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.600
But anyway, what's worse than having committed to leaving your house for the evening is stalking your ex.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.800
Stop. Stalking. Your. Ex.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.100
I know I'm one to talk. I am guilty of stalking all of my exes.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.900
Even the ones that I no longer care about anymore. Sometimes I do it just to be like:

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.960
"Oh my gosh, I'm so glad that's over."

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.300
"Oh, and he got rid of that ugly couch, good for him!"

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.300
Sometimes, I do it to remind myself of how far I've come.

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.309
I've been alone for a long time.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.220
You'll get this joke the third time you watch it.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.560
But six months ago, I did it how most of us do it.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.160
As a form of torture, as a way to hang on to the past and pine

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.640
And reinforce all of my terrible feelings.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.940
And it's like, why are we doing this to ourselves?!

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.060
What could you possibly find that would make you feel better?

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.900
Okay, maybe like a clutch cat meme but like what else?

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.460
Do you think you're gonna find a video of them saying that they miss you?

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.220
A subtweet that indicates that they've made a horrible mistake?

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.480
A Facebook post reminiscing on an old photo of you both?

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.040
No, because no-one uses Facebook anymore except for event planning,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.260
which is why I avoid it at all costs.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.840
[sobbing] Why did I click attending? Why did I even log on?

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.260
I thought Facebook was this desolate place for our parents and relics from another time!

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.240
If they wanted to reach out, they would.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.240
If they wanted to be with you, they would.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.700
But they don't, and they're not.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.900
And you need to stop checking their social media.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.400
And I'm only making this video because now I am tired of torturing myself

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.460
So I'm holding you and me accountable and we're just not gonna do it anymore.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.040
"But Anna, I only check my ex's page when I --"

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.560
No! Stalking your ex is like drinking poison and expecting them to die.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.820
Not only is it stupid, but clearly you don't know how poison works, because guess what?

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.960
Poison's bad!

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.620
If stalking your ex on social media was poison, would'ya still do it?

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.660
- [sobs] Why did you keep refreshing? [sob] Why?

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.640
- [coughs] [wheeze] I knew that I shouldn't. But he curated such solid memes.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.640
- [cries]
- [cough] [phlegm-y cough]

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.780
I think it's time for me to go.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.920
- I don't want you to go. 
- [wheeze] I have one last request.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.040
- Anything!

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.760
- When I die...

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.660
...please donate my bones to dogs.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.540
- Wait, what?
- I just wanna be with good boys.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.720
I just want my final resting place to be...

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.100
with good boys.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:51.800
[long exhale]

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.880
[sobbing]Wow this is taking a long time.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.980
[confused sobs]

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.300
[exhale continues]
Oh wait it's not done.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.640
For real though. I mean, we donate our organs to humans

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.980
So like why don't we donate our bones to dogs?

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.840
Anyway, just don't stalk your ex.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.020
It extends your grief, prevents your healing

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.160
and reinforces your neural pathways in a pattern of rumination which causes depression and anxiety.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.220
Plus, I mean we're all showing our best face on social media

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.820
so you're misinterpreting something through a lens that is already very biased and skewed.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.400
I could go on and on, but we know it's a bad idea.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.880
So let's just stop torturing ourselves, okay?

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.120
Block, mute, unfollow, unlike, unsubscribe, undo, undo, undo.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.100
I'm Anna Akana, we're gonna get through this, baby.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.620
Also thank you to ExpressVPN for sponsoring today's video.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.400
I love and use VPNs for several reasons.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.900
First off, and most importantly: enhanced security.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.860
People are constantly trying to hack into my accounts whether it's social media sites

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.980
my bank, or my iCloud.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.420
Spoiler alert, hackers! The only pussy pics I have on there are my five cats.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.500
And secondly, I travel a lot for work

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.960
So VPNs allow me to beat location based streaming restrictions

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.340
Or just use the internet if I'm in a country with an oppressive government

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.740
that doesn't allow me to access information

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:10.660
[cough] China.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.660
But VPNs also provide a variety of services

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.480
such as improved online gaming speeds,
automatic encryption on everything,

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.120
and online anonymity in case you do want to keep stalking.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.120
