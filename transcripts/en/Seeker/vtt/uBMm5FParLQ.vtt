00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.040
Do you have a favorite pair of pjs?

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.790
So cozy that you wear them for more than a
few nights in a row?

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.570
You disgust me!

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.040
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.750
A recent survey by Ergoplex polled 2,500 young
adult couples about their pajama habits and

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.730
they found surprisingly gross answers.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.660
Most people wear the same PJS for more than
two weeks at a time.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.700
But men and women had slightly reasons for
their lazy loungewear habits.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:37.879
73% of men complained that someone else did
the laundry, so they didn’t have any control.

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.149
Women said they switched between a few pairs
of pjs, so it was hard to remember how long

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:42.399
they’d be wearing them for.

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.920
Both men and women do the old fashioned sniff
test.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.570
50% of men and 41% of women say their pjs
don’t smell bad, so why bother changing

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:50.570
them?

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.719
I mean, no one sees them, they don’t smell
that bad? so why do we need to bother?

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.319
Well in a word, bacteria.

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:00.949
Our body is crawling with bacteria.

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.229
We carry about three to five pounds of it
in and on us.

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.570
Our skin and intestines are kind of like their
own ecosystems.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.159
One study found 1,400 different strains of
bacteria, JUST IN THE BELLY BUTTON.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.380
Most of this bacteria is alright, it can be
pretty good for us.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.710
Some protect us from the outside world or
helps us digest things we couldn’t on our

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:19.710
own.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.310
But bacteria build up can do a lot of harm.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.920
In the oily parts of the body, called sebaceous
sites, like our head and face, the build of

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.799
a bacterial species P. acnes, causes, you
guessed it, acne.

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.870
We all carry harmless strains of E. Coli in
our guts, but if they get where they’re

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.250
not supposed to be, like in the urinary tract,
it can cause infection.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.229
There’s also a risk of getting staphylococcus
bacteria which, into cuts can cause serious

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:42.359
infections.

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:44.310
Our body is constantly shedding skin cells,
constantly.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.000
We slough off a more than a few skin cells,
30 to 40 thousand cells fall off an hour.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.700
As we spend a third of our lives asleep, that’s
a lot of time to shed some cells.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.899
If you don’t wash your pjs for at least
two weeks, washing them only once might spread

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.840
these microbes and skins cells to the rest
of your laundry!

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.369
Dirty pjs are nothing to shake a sheet at.

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.251
Speaking of sheets, how often do you change
yours?

00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:08.270
A fifth of responders to a recent survey say
it’s not even once a month.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.250
Dust mites are more than happy with this arrangement.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.550
They love to nibble on your dead skin cells.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.500
So much so, I bet right now, your mattress
and pillows are FILLED with the little critters.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.470
Old mattresses might have up to ten million
of them crawling around.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.700
And after two years, about ten percent of
a pillow’s weight might be dust mites and

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.700
their poo.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.280
Around 20 million Americans, are allergic
to dust mite poo, which can cause annoying

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.610
rashes and asthma.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.440
So please go wash your pjs and sheets at least
every two weeks.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.140
Change your pillows every six months.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.280
And you’ll be sleeping sweet and clean.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.010
Alright guys, time to admit, how long do you
go in the same pair of pjs?
