00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.050
So we want to do efficient exploration
in general stochastic MDPs.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.689
And so we're going to need to combine
the two ideas that we've been

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:07.360
talking about.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.220
&gt;&gt; Wait, what were the two
ideas we were talking about?

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.590
&gt;&gt; Well in the context of bandits,
we talked about stochastic processes.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.690
And the trick that we used was to use
something like a Hoeffding bound.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.060
We just keep repeating the stochastic
thing until we have enough data, so

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.500
that we can make accurate estimates.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.920
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.
&gt;&gt; And then we talked about

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.950
sequential domains
that are deterministic.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.100
And the main trick that we used there
was this r max trick that said,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.160
if there's a state action pair
that we don't know about,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.320
assume it's really, really good.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.880
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.790
&gt;&gt; We can put these two ideas together
and get a stochastic version of Rmax.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.060
&gt;&gt; Okay, so
we'll have Hoeffding regions.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.050
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.755
Good, good, good.

00:00:40.755 --> 00:00:43.740
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We're still going to use
Hoeffding bounds on the individual state

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.300
action pairs.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.010
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.140
&gt;&gt; In fact, regions probably
means state action pairs here.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.730
&gt;&gt; So I was right.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.450
&gt;&gt; Yes, you were right.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.970
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.200
Well, then I think we're done here.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.190
&gt;&gt; All right, so let's write down
what this algorithm looks like.
