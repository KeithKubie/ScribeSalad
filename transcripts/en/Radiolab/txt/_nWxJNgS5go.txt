Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab, radiolab from W and y. S. E. N. N. P. R. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Gilbert. This is radio lab, the podcast pod cast zo today where you're going to do something a little different on the podcast. We're going to present a story that you and I ran into uh, in Chicago and Chicago coast audio cause he won an award, this story and it's just quite wonderful. Really cool. This is about soccer and it happened to remind us about a show that we're putting together for the spring on the topic of symmetry, chemistry, symmetry submits, symmetry here, partying, symmetry, all different kinds. And by the way, but that's later. Yeah. Oh well I'm sorry you were about to say the cool part. It turns out that we get to do this show not only on the radio but in three fabulous cities in the United States of live.

Speaker 1:          00:52          Yeah, we have shows in New York. Unfortunately that one's sold out, but we will be in La March 23rd and Seattle March 30th and it's going to be really fun and it'll be about symmetry, which takes us back to our subject soccer, which uh, at least appears quite symmetrical. Yeah, you got two teams and people on each size, right? You got two coaches, two sets of fans yield. However, there are two people on that field, the goalkeepers on either side who are living in a very different psychological universe from the rest of the athletes. And that's the subject, the loneliness of the goalkeeper. And the reporter is hardly obscene coli. Who is, um, well frizzle he was in his earlier life, a goalkeeper himself. He's a book author and regular presenter on the BBC and he's talking to a guy named Bob Wilson who's goalkeeper for a very famous British soccer team arsenal that's right in the sixties and seventies that's the golden age.

Speaker 1:          01:46          And the piece begins with the following question. What is it about goalkeepers? All they agreed upon that they only individual in what is a team game. In other words, the other 10 guys can make numerous mistakes in a game. Even the star striker, he can miss five, six, eight chances in a game and scored a winning goal in the 89th minute of a match and he goes home. The hero on the reverse situation that is the goalkeeper, this lonely individual, the only one who's allowed to use his hands with the purpose of negating the game with the whole purpose of a game of football is to score goals and the one villain in the piece is the bloke between the stakes, the goalie and all the other 10 guys around. You understand that as well. They do sing. You're crazy. You're putting yourself in this position where for 89 minutes you do the reverse. You play brilliantly and in the 90th minute you make a positional era. All the ball moves swerves and dips and it looks as if it's your fault. I've got this image of goalkeepers mostly because I was that goalkeeper that lapse for that high ball only to see the ball go into the back of the net and that that moment. Can you explain to me that moment

Speaker 2:          03:00          Bob, when the rest of the team are walking back to the halfway line as you're picking the ball up of the net,

Speaker 1:          03:08          you're alone. I mean, I can give you a very, very good example of it playing in an FAA Cup final and five days earlier we've gone to White Hart Lane and we've become champions of England until we've got an opportunity to become an an as a second club that center you to win the double. So we go, we're playing Liverpool, everything to play for in the 1971 cup final and I've had the best season I've ever had in my career and there's suddenly Steve Highway cuts in from the left wing. I've probably got it wrong by a yard and a half. Are we on the edge of the box?

Speaker 3:          03:39          But

Speaker 1:          03:40          he strikes the goal and it flew in the back of the net one nil down the doubles out the window and Bob Wilson is suddenly the guy who is likely to cost arsenal that does Dave highway next it one mill politically. And as I spun around on my pants on the, on the floor, Frank McClintock, a captain put his hands on his hips and actually moused use

Speaker 3:          04:07          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          04:07          It didn't cost us Charlie George one is the devil. I finished out being asked and was player of the year in the double season. Fantastic. But to my dying day, when people meet me and they say, Oh, what did you do with Steve Highway? Then

Speaker 2:          04:20          Hey, he's always comes up. Not The million good safes on my to mate. It's all those about, oh, you got your Neopost wrong, didn't you? Now here's a challenge that I've never understood. If you're a goalkeeper in a team that isn't very good, you're constantly vigilant. The bull's always coming at you. If, however, you're Bob Wilson playing behind 10 of the best players in the world at that time, for 89 minutes of a 90 minute game, you don't have a great deal to do. How do you stay focused?

Speaker 1:          04:54          See, do you remember the bionic man when the ball was at the other end of the field? I imagined that the guy on the ball, the opponent was Steve Austin, so he could turn around any part of the pitch, 60 yards away, 70 yards away, 110 yards away and strike a ball towards my goal.

Speaker 3:          05:15          Fantastic. Say Bye to Michael [inaudible] Cross. Here's the chance. Oh my score doesn't brilliant. Say by Basso tips in try age again. Great Save for the crucial money is for the post. [inaudible] [inaudible] I said challenge [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          05:59          Here we go. Sunday morning, south coast of England, Brighton and in the background you can hear some under sixteens 22 of them chasing a ball around a patch. Well actually technically speaking it's 20 of them. There's two goalkeepers either side on their own with no one to talk to the game to watch the backs of their colleagues and their face of that opposition. Almost poetic. Lets me getting carried away with myself. Mom. We'll cross the road. I'm here. I meet a man called gem wall who is an actor. That was a good, we tackle that. Sorry. Slightly put off by great. We tackle now, Jim is acting in a Peter Flannery play called the boy's own story, which is all about a goalkeeper.

Speaker 4:          06:53          All right? So we've just kicked off then we just kicked off, but we're, we're about 10 minutes in the Preston Panthers go down, I'm afraid was that the goalkeeping era was not goalkeeping era. I'm a fully paid up member of the goalkeepers union. So I think even if had gone through his hands, I wouldn't have said it's to keep his foot. Uh, now it was a very good long range to them where I'd show up and a very good midfield pass. So don't lean to the cruel rope and see that. Go keep her there. Yeah. Is that all keeper her or that Chemo there? Keith and I keep as the quality looking keeper with the yellow top or a gloves. See their key.

Speaker 2:          07:26          But that's exactly what I looked like when I was a boy. I don't mean to be cruel. How would those drive in those slightly lardy slightly Lartey

Speaker 4:          07:35          I don't play and go, but I coached the goalkeepers down there. Um, but I have to say when, when I was a kid, the idea of going and go just baffled me. I thought, why would you want to go there and go? I've never known, I've always been fascinated by the kids who want to come and go. But later on in my life, when I became an actor, I ended up doing a play about a goalkeeper. So I've got to meet goalkeepers. Uh, I even did two days training down here with Brighton and hove Albion and no, no, no, no

Speaker 2:          08:04          sacco. Yeah, sorry. That's to nail to the other team. Look at the cute guy. He's looking skyward and he won't pick the book. It will put the ball up. It's gone actually through the next. Nobody that should have been cleared. The cross should never have commended the goalkeeper got the blame for that.

Speaker 4:          08:19          Yeah. I think I'll keep scout a rough deal. I mean, when we've been doing, during the play, it was very simple set. It was simply goalpost and net. Okay. It's a full size and set in the penalty area of John Mckenna, the greatest goalkeeper never to play for England. So he's asking for the bull talking, you know, as far as goalkeepers are supposed to do to keep this, keep themselves mentally alert. And the thing is he never gets the ball. They hate him, the team hating and they will never pass through it. Good tackle Dave layoff. Dave, come on Dave. If you need me or I don't know I apply. Dave. What? I mean, I'd rather do without me. I'm the last line of defense. When I'm called into the game. It means they failed and they don't like that there. Your lights, of course, they're glad to have me here just in case.

Speaker 4:          09:09          Glad it's me throwing myself about glad it's my head that goes in when the boots are flying, but they do without me. If they could wouldn't, yeah, the object of their game is to school goals. The objective of mine is to stop them. I made a spoil their game. I can't win again. I can only lose it. So how can I be one of them? Not that I want to be one of them when to them I'm just a necessary evil. Go a kid, have it shot. Let one go. No, no, no, don't tackle it. I could have saved that.

Speaker 5:          09:43          Well, what Greg saved the boat, tipped it up in the air, but not enough to put it over the bar and came down behind him and as he went for it, so he was charged by center Ford Lofthouse into the net goal as well.

Speaker 6:          09:57          I was a young goalkeeper. I played the St John's primary school in seminars, poet and keeper, Marie Lachlan, young keeper in the loosest sense of the word. We played a local big teams, sort of Manchester United of the area, which was Amhurst school and I think they beat a 17 nil. The scoring of which goal broke the young Marie, Lachlan Young. I think it was probably about five or six nil. When I realized that there was probably only about 10 minutes of the game gone, the team had gone from being encouraging to looking the other way. How long did it take you before you went back and goal? I think about 32 years. It may just be a coincidence that you are a poet and a writer and a performer. Do you think there is a commonality in that experience of the creative for maybe for people who think they're a bit special, perhaps. Perhaps it's things to be the ideal place because as a striker you may can always be partnered with another striker, but there is only one goalkeeper and he gets to wear a different strip than the rest of the team and has his own universe too to operate in

Speaker 3:          11:07          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          11:07          that full nails, full nail, that's not even half time we have gotten taken apart here. I wonder how much of his confidence has gone or not. I better not. I lucky lights, heads up character

Speaker 3:          11:18          both hours, other states by or headed the ball back to the Polish, go keep up. He goes, Jen, pick it up. Extraordinary

Speaker 4:          11:26          and I think of how I used to feel when I let a golden ridiculous, that feeling of letting everybody down,

Speaker 3:          11:33          oh, I save the Chive is let it go right through his body and into the back of the net that is in a pooling gold BB in his face.

Speaker 4:          11:41          I used to go home after a match, a city, and literally shed tears over a goal. I'd lay him blaming myself for the one that beat us over and over and over in my head. Why didn't I go for the, why didn't I see him coming in on the back stick? Where was my cover? Yeah. Where was my cover? Oh, what's the fullback sitting at home crying his eyes out.

Speaker 3:          12:13          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          12:13          hello. Paul Robinson. England goalkeeper was undone when a back pass came towards him. He aimed to kick at it, missed the ball, went into the goal. It wasn't his fault, the ball bobbled. It was a go. It was looked comic and looked like Robinson sport. He knows it wasn't, and yet it still destroyed him. Chief sportswriter of the Times, Simon Barnes, another writer, another man.

Speaker 7:          12:36          He spends his time alone hoping to make a mark on the world and yes, another former goalkeeper. We're everywhere. Let's see, I think I'm developing a theory here and Simon's got a role call of loners and Mavericks to support it.

Speaker 8:          12:52          Yes, the renascence goalkeepers, it's a fine list and it begins with Alabama [inaudible] author of the outsider or go Coupa is by definition a tone Jay. But Kennedy famously said that all that I know most surely about morality in the obligations of Man I know from sport. Others include who you Yglesias. Uh, Che Guevara. Che Guevara was a, a goalkeeper out of necessity because he loved football. But uh, he had asthma so he would couldn't cut it as an outfielder. The A, the late Pope John Paul, the second was a, also a goalkeeper and Laddie Amir Nabokov who liked to be seen as sublimely different from the crowd. And this was well Vladimir Nabokov, a goalkeeper and occasional novelists wrote about the higher of his two aunts. As with folded arms, I lent against the left goalposts. I enjoyed the luxury of closing my eyes and thus I would listen to my heart knocking and feel the blind drizzle on my face and hear in the distance, the broken sounds of the game. And think of myself as other fabulous exotic. Being in an English. Football is disguise. Composing my verse in a tongue. Nobody understood about a remote country. Nobody knew small wander. I was not very popular with my teammates. I think that's a beautiful moment of serenity that only a goalkeeper can know in the middle of a game of football. In the bustle of it all, you have time to yourself, time to reflect time which many goalkeepers eventually used to destroy themselves to suddenly to destroy their sporting nerve.

Speaker 7:          14:28          Now that comment by Simon Che Guevara pleading goal because of the severe childhood asthma. Now I've done a bit of research on that list of Renee small school is and do you know Albert Camou developed TB as a youngster? Yes. Vladimir Nabokov nearly died of pneumonia as a child and then was traumatized by having a flea revolutionary Russia, Pope John Paul the second mother died when he was nine. Brother three years later makes you think

Speaker 1:          14:58          there is a sense in which, uh, choosing to play goalkeeper does show. I'm understanding that one is not as other people and certainly a grief and trauma can do that. Particularly in children. You may accept that your position is to be, um, not to the same as the rest.

Speaker 7:          15:17          And what I consider proof from the BBC archives, childhood goalkeeper and solar violinist, emphasis on the word Solo. Itzhak Perlman, four years old,

Speaker 9:          15:27          polio. I did football, I was goalie because I worked with crutches so I could stop bowls a little easier than you know, I stuck with my feet with my crutches. The say that again. And this time you gotten

Speaker 3:          15:44          terrific one say just painted over the crossbar. He just fit like a dog of a bow. That and just deflected that one. It was very hard for the top, gone to that all the way and it was a novelty side by side glove

Speaker 9:          15:56          that was a grand and shot in the grand say

Speaker 8:          15:59          when I see a great goal, it seems to me an incomplete experience. You should have a great shot followed by a great save to be a, a fully complete and rounded experience. I don't expect people to understand that. In fact, I hope people don't understand it. Being misunderstood is part of the goalkeeper stocking tray. You wouldn't be a goalkeeper unless you wanted to be misunderstood. How can I not be obsessed with failure if I succeed? What have I done? What have I created? Nothing. Even the poorest goals go into the record books. Great saves or forgotten.

Speaker 7:          16:47          This could be a [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          16:51          eternal optimism. You half the time does get somewhere near the 18 year old box and Jim's thinking it could be a goal for Nyla half time.

Speaker 7:          16:58          What's up? Yes, he's in tears. Preston pump, this keepers in tears, poor lot gloves are off. He's crying. Poor boys crying. It's under sixteens football on a Sunday morning to go down to you. Can you hear that?

Speaker 1:          17:21          I tell you what it is the great goalkeepers when all else fails, those guys in front of you, those 10 guys need to look round and say the goalie will savers. Now that's the difference. Once you acquire greatness, true greatness and very few goalkeepers really acquire that, that aura about them and one of the greatest love sprays.

Speaker 3:          17:48          Wait, say the bias. Great, brilliant.

Speaker 7:          17:50          That's great. I mean this just about sums it up. It doesn't matter that he kept hundreds of clean sheets to get the cup and championship successes. Never mind that you saved the blushes of countless dodgy defenders and there are plenty of dodgy defenders. The thing that defines Gary Sprague, the loneliest of all lonely keepers is the goal. He scored against himself in 1967 and he's not even Scottish. Gone Sell Gary Son,

Speaker 10:         18:22          we were playing live at the one day in three minutes before half time costumer cross. I caught the ball ketocal booze on left wing, he shouted to throw at him. Jessica was going to throw it to him and they seen Ian Collagen run to him. So I changed my mind. I've done it millions of times, just brought the ball back to my chest. But on this occasion I miss my chest and went all my Shorelan and right in front of the cop and gestures walking off the dgs says, we dedicated this racket. The Getty guys are calling. It just made this record. Keller sentence

Speaker 3:          18:59          [inaudible] too. Okay. Yes. The return [inaudible] stony in the shop and Robertson spelter it for goodness sake. Preciado shopper and Carlson.

Speaker 2:          19:29          That's the second half of that to start. And that's, um, the best pandas keeper. Walking back to his goal alone, alone, and four girls down. Do you know what I wish you could say to you that I didn't know how that felt. I know how that feels. I remember now why I stopped being a goalkeeper.

Speaker 3:          19:50          Okay.

Speaker 11:         20:05          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          20:09          killed

Speaker 1:          20:09          his hands from the Elvis Presley. Do you think he was a goalie? He had to have been a goalie. No one could have captured the tenderness, the loss and the shame as well as Al Shaman his music. Yeah. He could have been forged between those two goalposts. Oh wait. I am now being told that was not Elvis. Okay. For getting thanks to producer Adam Valor and, uh, the, uh, the presenter of that piece, Hardeep Singh coli, and it was a lad Brooke radio production. It was originally broadcast on BBC radio four. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. We hope to see it, those live shows, or at least at the next podcast.
