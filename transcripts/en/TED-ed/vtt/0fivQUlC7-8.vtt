00:00:07.318 --> 00:00:09.003
Hey, congratulations!

00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:10.872
You've just won the lottery,

00:00:10.872 --> 00:00:14.374
only the prize isn't cash
or a luxury cruise.

00:00:14.374 --> 00:00:18.228
It's a position in your country's
national legislature.

00:00:18.228 --> 00:00:20.446
And you aren't the only lucky winner.

00:00:20.446 --> 00:00:24.547
All of your fellow lawmakers 
were chosen in the same way.

00:00:24.547 --> 00:00:27.666
This might strike you as a strange
way to run a government,

00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.725
let alone a democracy.

00:00:29.725 --> 00:00:32.960
Elections are the epitome 
of democracy, right?

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.489
Well, the ancient Athenians
who coined the word had another view.

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.271
In fact, elections only played
a small role in Athenian democracy,

00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:49.564
with most offices filled by random lottery
from a pool of citizen volunteers.

00:00:49.564 --> 00:00:52.680
Unlike the representative 
democracies common today,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.274
where voters elect leaders to make laws
and decisions on their behalf,

00:00:57.274 --> 00:01:00.903
5th Century BC Athens was 
a direct democracy

00:01:00.903 --> 00:01:02.965
that encouraged wide participation

00:01:02.965 --> 00:01:07.971
through the principle of ho boulomenos,
or anyone who wishes.

00:01:07.971 --> 00:01:12.019
This meant that any of its approximately
30,000 eligible citizens

00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:14.261
could attend the ecclesia,

00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:17.904
a general assembly meeting
several times a month.

00:01:17.904 --> 00:01:22.554
In principle, any of the 6,000 or so
who showed up at each session

00:01:22.554 --> 00:01:25.092
had the right to address 
their fellow citizens,

00:01:25.092 --> 00:01:26.343
propose a law,

00:01:26.343 --> 00:01:28.745
or bring a public lawsuit.

00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:32.766
Of course, a crowd of 6,000 people
trying to speak at the same time

00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:35.156
would not have made 
for effective government.

00:01:35.156 --> 00:01:40.076
So the Athenian system also relied on
a 500 member governing council

00:01:40.076 --> 00:01:41.458
called the Boule,

00:01:41.458 --> 00:01:44.606
to set the agenda
and evaluate proposals,

00:01:44.606 --> 00:01:49.971
in addition to hundreds of jurors
and magistrates to handle legal matters.

00:01:49.971 --> 00:01:52.053
Rather than being elected or appointed,

00:01:52.053 --> 00:01:57.580
the people in these positions
were chosen by lot.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.936
This process of randomized selection
is know as sortition.

00:02:03.936 --> 00:02:06.217
The only positions filled by elections

00:02:06.217 --> 00:02:09.564
were those recognized 
as requiring expertise,

00:02:09.564 --> 00:02:11.775
such as generals.

00:02:11.775 --> 00:02:16.105
But these were considered aristocratic,
meaning rule by the best,

00:02:16.105 --> 00:02:20.698
as opposed to democracies,
rule by the many.

00:02:20.698 --> 00:02:24.106
How did this system come to be?

00:02:24.106 --> 00:02:30.049
Well, democracy arose in Athens after long
periods of social and political tension

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.128
marked by conflict among nobles.

00:02:33.128 --> 00:02:35.191
Powers once restricted to elites,

00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:38.750
such as speaking in the assembly
and having their votes counted,

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.514
were expanded to ordinary citizens.

00:02:41.514 --> 00:02:44.664
And the ability of ordinary citizens
to perform these tasks

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:49.836
adequately became a central feature
of the democratice ideology of Athens.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.121
Rather than a privilege,

00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:54.692
civic participation 
was the duty of all citizens,

00:02:54.692 --> 00:02:58.446
with sortition and strict term limits
preventing governing classes

00:02:58.446 --> 00:03:01.757
or political parties from forming.

00:03:01.757 --> 00:03:03.681
By 21st century standards,

00:03:03.681 --> 00:03:08.372
Athenian rule by the many
excluded an awful lot of people.

00:03:08.372 --> 00:03:12.261
Women, slaves and foreigners
were denied full citizenship,

00:03:12.261 --> 00:03:15.085
and when we filter out 
those too young to serve,

00:03:15.085 --> 00:03:22.737
the pool of eligible Athenians drops
to only 10-20% of the overall population.

00:03:22.737 --> 00:03:25.436
Some ancient philosophers, 
including Plato,

00:03:25.436 --> 00:03:30.707
disparaged this form of democracy
as being anarchic and run by fools.

00:03:30.707 --> 00:03:33.502
But today the word 
has such positive associations,

00:03:33.502 --> 00:03:37.262
that vastly different regimes 
claim to embody it.

00:03:37.262 --> 00:03:42.143
At the same time, some share Plato's
skepticism about the wisdom of crowds.

00:03:42.143 --> 00:03:45.450
Many modern democracies 
reconcile this conflict

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.891
by having citizens elect 
those they consider qualified

00:03:48.891 --> 00:03:51.874
to legislate on their behalf.

00:03:51.874 --> 00:03:53.808
But this poses its own problems,

00:03:53.808 --> 00:03:55.672
including the influence of wealth,

00:03:55.672 --> 00:03:58.754
and the emergence 
of professional politicians

00:03:58.754 --> 00:04:02.345
with different interests 
than their constituents.

00:04:02.345 --> 00:04:06.362
Could reviving election by lottery
lead to more effective government

00:04:06.362 --> 00:04:09.777
through a more diverse and representative
group of legislatures?

00:04:09.777 --> 00:04:13.536
Or does modern political office,
like Athenian military command,

00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:16.710
require specialized knowledge and skills?

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:18.594
You probably shouldn't hold your breath

00:04:18.594 --> 00:04:21.103
to win a spot 
in your country's government.

00:04:21.103 --> 00:04:22.940
But depending on where you live,

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.990
you may still be selected 
to participate in a jury,

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.661
a citizens' assembly,

00:04:27.661 --> 00:04:29.720
or a deliberative poll,

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.385
all examples of how the democratic
principle behind sortition

00:04:33.385 --> 00:04:35.692
still survives today.
