at when we describe the basic word order

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380
at when we describe the basic word order
 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.160
at when we describe the basic word order
of a language the subject word the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170
of a language the subject word the
 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.519
of a language the subject word the
object word and the verb once we

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529
object word and the verb once we
 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.560

we can consider their arrangement many

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989

many languages have the basic word order

subject verb object in other words the

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570
subject verb object in other words the
 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.390
subject verb object in other words the
subject comes first followed by a verb

subject comes first followed by a verb
 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.420
subject comes first followed by a verb
and the verb is followed by its object

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430
and the verb is followed by its object
 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.520

another common configuration is subject

that is to say that we invert the verb

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:26.469
that is to say that we invert the verb
 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:29.160

be switch is to verb subject object so

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340
be switch is to verb subject object so
 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.319

we're inverting this subject and the

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740
we're inverting this subject and the
 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.099
we're inverting this subject and the
verb this explanation brings up the

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109
verb this explanation brings up the
 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.109
verb this explanation brings up the
concept of inversion in other words

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119
concept of inversion in other words
 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.719

switching the place of words but

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729
switching the place of words but
 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.459
switching the place of words but
consider a different explanation for the

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:50.469
consider a different explanation for the
 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:52.590
consider a different explanation for the
same change this one will use the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600
same change this one will use the
 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.980
same change this one will use the
concept of movement or just move in this

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990
concept of movement or just move in this
 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.749
concept of movement or just move in this
case we're performing an operation in

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759
case we're performing an operation in
 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.899
case we're performing an operation in
which we move one of the words so

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909
which we move one of the words so
 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.459
which we move one of the words so
instead of saying that we invert the

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469
instead of saying that we invert the
 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.910
instead of saying that we invert the
words B and the subject in our you there

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920
words B and the subject in our you there
 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.639
words B and the subject in our you there
we're just moving our before the subject

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649
we're just moving our before the subject
 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.400
we're just moving our before the subject
and this will give us basically the same

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410
and this will give us basically the same
 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.990
and this will give us basically the same
result by performing a different

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000
result by performing a different
 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.910
result by performing a different
operation instead of switching places

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920
operation instead of switching places
 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.980
operation instead of switching places
we're just moving one of the words

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990
we're just moving one of the words
 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.410
we're just moving one of the words
and a final concept to consider with

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420
and a final concept to consider with
 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.630
and a final concept to consider with
respect to word order is the adjunct an
