00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
Hey guys, remember ShamWow?

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.557
That hyper-absorbent towel hawked by the overeager ShamWow guy?

00:00:05.557 --> 00:00:06.480
Well, it turns out

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.510
That ShamWow was just a smelly hand mop, and the ShamWow guy?

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.498
He got bit by a prostitute and then got arrested for punching her.

00:00:13.498 --> 00:00:15.240
Where am I going with all this?

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.639
Donald Trump is the ShamWow guy of presidents. He's selling Americans on a presidency

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.930
that's dangerously ineffective, but he does it so so well

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.130
Newsbroke viewers know Trump is a crap businessman and that unless you staff them with llamas,

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.700
there's no excuse for bankrupting casinos.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.720
But being bad at running a business doesn't mean you're a bad salesman.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.880
It just means your bamboozler, a swindler, a big beautiful bullish*t artist.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.870
And Trump's really good at selling things.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.480
He's been doing it for years.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.820
We eat our pizza the wrong way.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.360
Crust first.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.180
So what do you think of my trump home mattress collection by Serta?

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.800
A Big and Tasty for just a dollar?

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.140
How do you do it? What's your secret?

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.659
How are you president?

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.659
What makes a good salesman? Knowing how to play on human psychology.

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.720
Social psychologist Robert Cialdini goes over the following manipulative sales tactics in his book, Influence.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.900
And they are eerily familiar.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.140
One is called "liking": making yourself likable by being

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.740
unavoidable. Research has found that when a person's face is constantly flashed on screen,

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.100
subjects instinctively come to like that person more.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.320
Right guys?

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.520
Love me....

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.460
And Trump knows all about screen time.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.000
His campaigns focused on a total saturation of news coverage and spent way more time than Hillary Clinton

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.700
traveling around the country doing large rallies.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.250
And he's used to that kind of overexposure because he's literally been putting his name on everything for years.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.439
Specifically symbols of wealth, like big buildings and golf courses, to make his name

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.280
synonymous with money.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.960
Just like George Foreman's name was synonymous with grilling

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.819
and Bill Cosby's name was synonymous with Jell-O.

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.369
Remember what it was Jell-O?

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.980
Another way to get people to buy your product is with "social proof,"

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.499
a phenomenon that says that people look to others to make

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.939
decisions. So a salesperson doesn't have to convince us directly that their product is good,

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.279
they just need to say that others think it's good.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.600
Lysol is the number one brand.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.767
I'm number one in the polls.

00:02:28.767 --> 00:02:30.560
Because it's America's number one brand.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.220
Now I'm number one in every single poll.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.060
America's number one brand.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.820
Number one in every single place.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.920
I'm number one in the polls

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:45.760
I'm the number one NBA draft pick. I'm the number one Latin recording artist of 2013 in Miami Beach (laughs)

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.060
And then there's the principle of "Authority," real or imagined.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.660
We're trained from birth to think that authority is good.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.819
So when someone with credentials tells you their product is legit,

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.900
you generally believe it. And credentials might mean whichever guy is wearing a suit.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.740
Take it from the guy who for decades

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.200
just wore a suit.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.100
You're gonna like the way you look. I guarantee it.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.520
I guarantee it.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.470
You're going to like the way you look. I guarantee it.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.239
Maybe it's the suit, maybe it's the beard, or maybe it's that little model ship

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.590
he keeps in his pretend home.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.730
But something makes me trust him. Or maybe it's that word ...

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.080
I guarantee

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.420
and I guarantee you

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.660
I guarantee you

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.649
I guarantee

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.550
a hundred percent

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.339
Here that? He just guaranteed it. I don't know what it is, but I'll take it.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.170
Racism? Aw...

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.869
So it's pretty terrifying to realize that the same way Trump sold himself on the campaign trail--

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.530
See I understand the tax cut better than anybody that's ever run for president

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.300
I understand the world much better than he does.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.460
I understand things I comprehend very well

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.080
--is exactly how he sold America on his steaks.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.540
"I understand steaks it's my favorite food and these are the best

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.920
"I understand it because it's my favorite food"?!

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.880
OK, but steak is also Scout's favorite food.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.640
But guess what? She's a f*cking dog. She understands nothing.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.400
The thing is, Trump knows he's a bullsh*t artist

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.380
Take Trump University, the fake real estate workshops that allegedly defrauded nearly 3800 clients

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.620
who Trump just settled with for $25 million.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.620
Trump University actually had a Trump University  playbook,

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.309
a manual given out to instructors to lead these seminars that

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.380
specifically advised them to do the following things:

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.139
only focus on the benefits of the program,

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:37.440
catalog objections and build rebuttals to any criticism,

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.159
and never give prospective clients details

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.680
about the program. And by following the playbook,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.329
instructors like this guy became the University's top seller.

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:53.959
James Harris's job was to get people to believe they too could be as successful at real estate as Donald Trump.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.180
Do you remember when you said this? "I'm a former licensed agent broker. At 29,

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.859
I became the top 1% broker in the country.

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:05.479
I build homes in Atlanta, Georgia, and I used to live in Beverly Hills."

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.229
Yes, I...

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.550
if I said those things then they are true.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.820
I did live in Beverly Hills and--

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.320
-We have no record of you ever living in Beverly Hills.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.180
Okay.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.020
We can't find your

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.040
broker's license anywhere.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.000
Okay.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.779
And I have no idea

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.480
what homes you built in Atlanta, Georgia. You build homes in Georgia?

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.620
I'm not prepared to answer those questions today.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.979
That is unless you'll let me consult the playbook one second ...

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:40.848
That guy was their top seller, so it's no wonder many attendees wound up feeling like this:

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:46.218
I started getting upset feeling that this was not an actual learning seminar

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:50.059
but maybe just an upselling seminar. I tried to get my money back and

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.568
two other instructors were brought over and basically

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.760
cornered me telling me that I just didn't understand the material.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.460
Focus on the benefits, deflect criticism,

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.320
be vague on the details, and corner your opponents.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.220
The art of the bullshit. Or the art of the Trump administration.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.780
Because instead of guys who definitely did not live in Beverly Hills,

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.460
Trump's instructors are now his team of well-heeled mouthpieces

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.189
who painstakingly and purely focus on Trump's benefits.

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:21.929
Our president is a man with broad shoulders

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:24.219
and a big heart.

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:25.660
Wait what?

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:26.849
From his first day in office

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.760
he's been keeping his promises to the American people.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.080
Promise number 1: lock her---uhh

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.169
Promise number 2:

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:36.169
drain the swa..

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:39.929
Promise number 3: don't bomb Syria...uhh

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:50.940
Like Trump University salesmen, Trump's advisors also preempt any criticism, and then deflect deflect deflect.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.420
Isn't it irresponsible for a president elect to make false statements like that?

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:57.508
I think it's groundless-- talk about fake news, the fake news

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:01.820
is that somehow the popular vote is more important than the Electoral college vote now.

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:03.819
Kelly Anne, that's not what I asked, no one's questioning

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:06.140
No, one's no one is questioning the victory.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.378
Oh, but that's not the point George. the point is Kellyanne said fake news twice.

00:07:10.899 --> 00:07:12.639
You lose.

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:14.289
And these salesmen/shills

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:16.289
keep the facts real vague.

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:22.400
Like Sean Spicer all the time. Even when he's asked pointedly if Trump knows the unemployment rate.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.398
He's not focused on

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:26.878
statistics as much as he is on whether or not the American people are

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:28.860
doing better as a whole.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.458
You see you people need to understand something: Trump is like a Magic Eye poster.

00:07:32.459 --> 00:07:34.300
You need to stand way back,

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:39.959
cross your eyes for a solid four years and just don't blink and eventually

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.669
you'll get it.

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:45.419
What happened to Trump University is happening to this country.

00:07:45.969 --> 00:07:50.669
Trump is not going to be able to deliver on his promise to a very white America.

00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:54.688
Already his health care bill failed, a new travel ban is held up in court

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:58.220
and Mexico most certainly will not pay for the border wall.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:02.459
So for some final advice on being a good salesman, let's remember:

00:08:03.219 --> 00:08:07.679
"You can't con people at least not for long. You can create excitement,

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.999
you can do wonderful promotion and get all kinds of press, and you can throw in a little hyperbole.

00:08:12.009 --> 00:08:16.139
But if you don't deliver on the goods people will eventually catch on.

00:08:18.129 --> 00:08:23.308
Thanks Mr. ShamWow president. We will catch on. Sham Now or Sham Later

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.319
"Location also is allowed to do is fashion. You can take a mediocre

00:08:28.659 --> 00:08:34.369
location and turn it into something considerably better just by attracting the right people" ... like Newsbroke.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:39.320
We've attracted you, you're the right people. Huh won't you subscribe you've gotten this far

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:42.019
What's it to you?
