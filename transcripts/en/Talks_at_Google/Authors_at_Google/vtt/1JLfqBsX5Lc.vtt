MALE SPEAKER: Hello, everyone.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.920
Thank you all for coming.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.130
And folks who are joining
remotely-- welcome, as well.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.250
Today we have a very, very
special speaker-- someone

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.750
whose work I deeply admire
and have been fond of.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.360
I was thinking about what is
the best way to introduce him?

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.430
Should I say he is a Managing
Director at Credit Suisse?

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.760
Should I say he's an Adjunct
Professor at Columbia?

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.230
Usually not all practitioners
are good academics

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.520
or appreciate academia.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.880
And not necessarily
all academics

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.570
are good practitioners.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.910
At lunch today our speaker said,
I love teaching and writing.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.990
And those are the two things
that he's most fond of.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.600
So I think that's the
best way to introduce him.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.510
He's a teacher and writer.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.630
So without further ado,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.620
please join me in welcoming
Michael Mauboussin.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.259
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:03.050
MICHAEL MAUBOUSSIN:
Thank you, [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.820
And good afternoon.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.695
It's a real pleasure to
be here, and I really

00:01:05.695 --> 00:01:07.310
look forward to
today's discussion.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.930
The topic today is an
unendingly fascinating topic

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.350
of skill and luck.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.970
I'll tell you my
own story of luck.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.470
When I was a senior
in college I had

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.178
no idea what I wanted
to do with my life,

00:01:17.178 --> 00:01:19.014
but I did know I needed a job.

00:01:19.014 --> 00:01:20.430
I went to school
in Washington, DC

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.660
and one of the firms
that came to recruit

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.240
was Drexel Burnham Lambert.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.290
Now this is probably
before most of your time.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.800
But it was a fairly hot
investment bank at the time.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.220
On campus interview--
did sufficiently well

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.670
that I was invited to
New York for the big day.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.710
So I get my very best
suit out, polish my shoes,

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:36.610
go to New York.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.110
The day of the big
interviews, we're

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.140
sitting around a conference
room and they go,

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.339
here is the basic setup.

00:01:42.339 --> 00:01:44.630
You're going to have six
interviews with various people

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.180
from our training
program, and you're

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.930
going to get 10 minutes
with the head guy.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.680
So of course, you want
to be good all day.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.774
But for those 10 minutes make
sure you have your A game.

00:01:53.774 --> 00:01:55.190
So I go through
my six interviews.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.950
They go reasonably well.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.040
I get my 10 minutes.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.400
I'm ushered into this
guy's huge office,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.680
and I see peeking out
from underneath his desk

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.210
a Washington Redskins trash can.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.210
Now I've been going to
school in Washington.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.660
The Redskins were
good back then.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.680
So I said to the
guy off-handedly,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.140
that's an awesome trashcan.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.810
This hits the guy in
the emotional seat.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.730
And my 10 minute interview
becomes 15 minutes

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.170
of him going on about
the virtues of athletics

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.390
and how much the football
team is a metaphor for life.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.460
And I'm basically going
like this the whole time.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.370
So I go back to school.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.509
Couple weeks later I
get the coveted letter

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:36.300
in the mail-- you've
been offered this job.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.009
This is great.

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:38.800
I'm gainfully employed,
I move to New York,

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.030
and I start my job.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.091
About three months into
it, one of the senior guys

00:02:44.091 --> 00:02:46.340
in the program pulls me
aside, puts his arm around me,

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.970
says, hey, kid you're doing OK.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:48.910
Everything's fine.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:49.910
I just want you to know.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.410
But I have to tell
you something now.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.790
The six people you interviewed
voted against hiring you.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:57.990
Very reassuring, right?

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.850
So I'm like, OK,
so why am I here?

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.390
And he said, well,
the senior guy

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.870
came in and overrode
all their decisions.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.060
And he insisted we hire you.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.660
So I like to say my career
was launched by a trash can.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.750
And that was pure luck.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.975
And thankfully there are
no Laszlo Bock algorithms

00:03:11.975 --> 00:03:13.100
involved with that, either.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.494
Otherwise, I'd
still be unemployed.

00:03:15.494 --> 00:03:16.910
The topic today
is skill and luck.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.310
I really want to talk
about three things.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.960
First I want to
define my terms a bit

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.490
and talk about what I call
the three easy lessons-- three

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.157
things you can take
away fairly quickly.

00:03:24.157 --> 00:03:26.198
In the middle part-- the
meat of the discussion--

00:03:26.198 --> 00:03:28.660
I want to talk about the
complexion of skill and luck--

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.950
what they look like and
how they change over time.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.780
And then finally I'll wrap up a
bit with what to do about this,

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.470
but also why we struggle
so much in our lives

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.666
to understand the role of luck.

00:03:39.666 --> 00:03:41.290
One way to think
about this is to think

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.710
about a continuum of activities.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.090
On the far left--
pure luck, no skill.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.750
You might think lotteries
or roulette wheels.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.600
On the far right--
pure skill, no luck.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.180
Maybe running races or
chess would be over there.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.750
It's very important
to define terms.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.190
So let me just take
a moment to do that.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.648
I'm going to define
skill right out

00:03:59.648 --> 00:04:01.570
of the dictionary,
which is the ability

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.234
to apply one's knowledge readily
in execution or performance.

00:04:04.234 --> 00:04:05.900
So you know how to
do something and when

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.006
you're called on to do
it, you can do it on cue.

00:04:09.006 --> 00:04:10.380
Now luck-- as you
might imagine--

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.680
is much more
difficult to define.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.960
It actually spills into moral
philosophy quite quickly.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.090
But I'm going to
say luck exists when

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.310
three conditions are in place.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.809
Number one is it operates for
an individual or organization.

00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:21.990
So it happens to you, or your
favorite team, or your company.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:23.747
The second is it
could be good or bad.

00:04:23.747 --> 00:04:25.580
And I don't mean to
suggest it's symmetrical

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.960
because we'll see in a few
moments it's certainly not

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.460
symmetrical.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.520
But there's a plus sign
and a minus sign possible.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.700
And third is it is
reasonable to expect

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.610
a different outcome
could have occurred.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.355
So if we rewound the tape of
time and we played it again,

00:04:37.355 --> 00:04:39.690
it's reasonable to expect
a different outcome could

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.300
have occurred.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.130
Now what I've done here for fun
is arrayed professional sports

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.997
leagues based on one
season of performance.

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:50.413
So this is where
they actually lie

00:04:50.413 --> 00:04:51.579
on the luck/skill continuum.

00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:55.910
That's the NBA, Barclays Premier
League Soccer, Major League

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.875
Baseball, the NFL, and
then finally the NHL.

00:04:59.875 --> 00:05:02.000
Now I'll mention one other
thing on luck and skill,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.750
which is kind of fun.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:03.880
There's a really
interesting test

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.509
which I learned from
the poker people

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:07.800
about figuring out if there's
any skill in an activity.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.580
And that is, ask if you
can lose on purpose.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.010
If you can lose on purpose,
there must be some skill.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.550
If you can't lose on purpose,
it's basically all luck.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.465
So that's another nice little
litmus test to figure that out.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.810
I'm going to go through this
very quickly, mostly as a set

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.240
up for the next discussion.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.730
You might imagine that
your outcome in life

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.960
is drawing from a luck
distribution and a skill

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.510
distribution.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.840
So I take the two
outcomes and combine them,

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.411
and that's going
to be my outcome.

00:05:36.411 --> 00:05:38.535
So in the far left it would
be a luck distribution,

00:05:38.535 --> 00:05:40.409
and you're drawing
only zeros for skill.

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:42.200
So only luck is going
to make a difference.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.616
On the right it's
going be drawing

00:05:43.616 --> 00:05:45.830
from a skill distribution
and zeros from luck.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:46.960
So only skill matters.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.460
And then everything
in life is going

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.240
to be some
distribution for each.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.781
So we're drawing
these distributions.

00:05:51.781 --> 00:05:54.170
So this very simplistic
set up allows

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.250
me to proceed with what I
call the three easy lessons.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.590
So easy lesson
number one-- whenever

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.500
you see an extreme
outlier-- and by the way,

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.370
most of the outliers
we observe are positive

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.260
outliers because negative
outliers almost always die,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.190
either literally
or metaphorically.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.820
So whenever you see
a positive outlier,

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.445
it's always the combination of
great skill plus great luck.

00:06:14.445 --> 00:06:16.070
And if you think
about it for a moment,

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.530
that really has to be true.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.479
It's a right hand draw from
both of those distributions.

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:22.520
Now there are many ways
I could demonstrate this.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.603
One of the convenient ways
is the world of sports.

00:06:24.603 --> 00:06:26.080
This, of course,
is Joe DiMaggio,

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.400
who hit in 56 straight
games in 1941.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.740
DiMaggio was a
.325 career hitter,

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.159
one of the best of all time.

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:37.450
And it turns out if you look
at all the players with 30

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.300
or more hitting streaks,
their career batting average

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.220
is over .300.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.340
They're about one and a
half standard deviations

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.080
above the average.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.980
So saying this very
differently-- not

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.510
all skillful players
have streaks,

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.869
but all the streaks are
held by skillful players.

00:06:52.869 --> 00:06:53.910
And it make sense, right?

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.909
Because skill is the
prerequisite, and then luck

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:59.120
comes on top to get
to be an outlier.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.870
The second observation--
second lesson--

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.430
is about reversion to the mean.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.240
By the way,
reversion to the mean

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.656
is a fascinating
concept because I

00:07:04.656 --> 00:07:07.247
think most people have a sense
that they know what it means.

00:07:07.247 --> 00:07:09.580
But if you actually observe
the behavior of most people,

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.250
they don't act as if
they understand reversion

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:11.530
to the mean.

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:12.696
So let me just be technical.

00:07:12.696 --> 00:07:13.910
You guys all understand this.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.159
Reversion to the mean says
that an outcome that is far

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:18.450
from average will be
followed by an outcome

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.860
with an expected value
closer to the average.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:21.360
Right?

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.910
Now here's the
classic example, which

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.743
you may remember from
your stats class years

00:07:24.743 --> 00:07:27.160
ago-- the heights
of fathers and sons.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.974
Very tall fathers
have tall sons.

00:07:28.974 --> 00:07:31.140
But the heights of the sons
are close to the average

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.260
of all the sons.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.094
And likewise, short
fathers have short sons.

00:07:34.094 --> 00:07:36.259
But the heights of the sons
are close to the average

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:37.462
of all heights of the sons.

00:07:37.462 --> 00:07:38.920
Now here's the one
thing I think is

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.130
very interesting
and practical about

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.410
this reversion to the mean
concept and the skill/luck

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.120
continuum, which is it
turns out where you lie

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.170
on the luck/skill continuum
defines the rate of reversion

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.110
to the mean-- not
just that it occurs,

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:52.990
but the rate of
reversion to the mean.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:54.930
So for example, if
you're on the pure luck

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:57.657
side of the continuum, there's
complete reversion to the mean.

00:07:57.657 --> 00:07:59.740
In other words, expected
value of the next outcome

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.450
is some measure of the
average, mean, or in some cases

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:03.900
the mode.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.490
If you're on the pure skill
side of the continuum,

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.330
there's no reversion
to the mean at all.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.130
We run a sprint against
Usain Bolt, he wins.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.360
We run again, he wins again.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.920
No reversion to the mean.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.200
So if you know where
your activity is,

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.865
you automatically have a sense
for the rate of reversion

00:08:19.865 --> 00:08:20.365
to the mean.

00:08:20.365 --> 00:08:22.364
So if you're thinking
about things like business

00:08:22.364 --> 00:08:24.040
performance or markets
or what have you,

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.172
it's a very, very helpful
and useful heuristic.

00:08:28.172 --> 00:08:30.130
Now the third lesson is
the one that's probably

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:32.840
garnered the most
interest from this book.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.872
It's a concept I call
the paradox of skill.

00:08:34.872 --> 00:08:36.580
I want to be clear
that it's not my idea,

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.008
but I gave it that name.

00:08:38.008 --> 00:08:40.549
And the paradox of skills says
in activities where both skill

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:43.890
and luck contribute to
outcomes, it is often the case

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:47.060
that as skill increases--
skill improves--

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.580
luck becomes more important.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.450
So how can we have
more skill leading

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:53.330
to more luck being important?

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.930
Now I learned about this
concept from Stephen Jay Gould,

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:57.934
a very eminent
biologist who wrote

00:08:57.934 --> 00:08:59.850
a lot about evolutionary
theory and also liked

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.580
to write about baseball.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.200
And one of my favorite
essays he wrote

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.650
was about Ted Williams,
who you see here.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.640
Ted Williams was the
last player to hit over

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.020
.400 in Major League Baseball.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.730
He also did it in the year 1941.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:14.590
And so the question
Gould was pondering

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:16.480
is why has no one
been able to replicate

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.652
this feat over the
ensuing 70 plus years?

00:09:19.652 --> 00:09:22.110
He said maybe it's because the
players play at night, maybe

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:23.693
because there are
relief pitchers now,

00:09:23.693 --> 00:09:26.870
maybe-- none of these
things actually checked out.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.030
The answer was, it turns out
the standard deviation of skill

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.420
for Major League Baseball
players has gotten narrower,

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.460
which is to say the difference
between the very best players

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.860
and the average
players is less today

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.130
than it was a generation ago.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:41.820
So if you accept that
batting average is

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.570
some skill plus
some luck combined,

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:48.554
if the standard deviation
of skill goes down,

00:09:48.554 --> 00:09:50.720
that means the standard
deviation of batting average

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.010
should go down.

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:53.260
And that's, indeed,
precisely what we've seen.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.750
So the standard deviation of
batting average in the 1940s

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.386
was .032.

00:09:57.386 --> 00:09:59.510
And the standard deviation
of batting average today

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.220
is about .027.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.010
So saying this
differently, Ted Williams

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:06.710
was a four standard
deviation event in 1941.

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:10.167
And if you were a four standard
deviation event in 2011--

00:10:10.167 --> 00:10:12.083
let's say 70 years later--
you would hit .380.

00:10:12.083 --> 00:10:14.500
Now .380 is obviously fantastic.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.642
But it doesn't get you over
that threshold of .400.

00:10:17.642 --> 00:10:19.350
Now here's the thing
I want to emphasize.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.490
It turns out the paradox of
skill is everywhere we look.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:24.160
It's very visibly
true in the world

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.990
of investing where the standard
deviation of excess returns

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.685
has been coming down
steadily for 50 years.

00:10:29.685 --> 00:10:31.060
It's true in the
world of sports,

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.322
as I've already mentioned.

00:10:32.322 --> 00:10:34.030
It's also true in the
world of business--

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:35.640
for example,
quality of products.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.290
Now it's much more uniform
than it was a generation or two

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:39.820
before.

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.994
I want to leave you
with this one thought.

00:10:41.994 --> 00:10:43.410
The distinction
I'm making here is

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.872
that absolute skill
has never been higher.

00:10:45.872 --> 00:10:47.330
And that's true
everywhere we look.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.420
But relative skill has
never been narrower.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.060
That means more is
being left to luck.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.810
And I want to just
keep that in your mind.

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:56.030
More is being left to
luck in our modern world

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.460
than it has been in years past.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.230
We'll come back to
that in a few moments.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:00.730
So those are the
three easy lessons.

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:03.580
The paradox skill says as
absolute skill improves,

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.069
if relative skill
comes down, more

00:11:05.069 --> 00:11:06.610
is actually going
to be left to luck.

00:11:09.995 --> 00:11:12.120
The paradox of skill actually
makes a very specific

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.470
prediction which
is, in realms where

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.750
there is no luck we should
see two things happening--

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.420
if my description is correct.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.895
One is an absolute improvement--
in this case grinding

00:11:19.895 --> 00:11:21.880
to some physiological limit.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.770
I'm using an athletic
endeavor here.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.630
And the second is
clustering because I'm

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:27.260
suggesting the right
tail is coming in.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.765
That means the performance is
getting clustered of people.

00:11:29.765 --> 00:11:31.140
So there are many
ways I can show

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.400
this is actually occurring.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.830
One convenient example is
Olympic men's marathon time.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:37.940
So the white line
there is the time

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.500
of the guy who won
the gold medal.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.570
And you can see that
guy ran-- in 2012--

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:45.625
about 23 and a half minutes
faster than the guy who

00:11:45.625 --> 00:11:47.790
won the gold medal in 1932.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.230
So not a huge surprise.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:52.160
But if you're a runner, it's
about a minute a mile pace

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.280
pick up over 80 years.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.030
The more interesting
line is the blue one,

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:57.821
which is the difference
between the guy who

00:11:57.821 --> 00:11:59.977
won the gold medal and
the guy who came in 20th.

00:11:59.977 --> 00:12:02.560
Now mind you, this is supposed
to be some of the best, fastest

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.170
runners in the world
competing on the same stage.

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:10.660
That difference was
39 minutes in 1932.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.190
Now just take that
in for a second.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.570
This is the Olympic marathon.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:17.694
The guy has won the gold
medal, has taken a shower,

00:12:17.694 --> 00:12:19.360
is eating a sandwich,
and this other guy

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.590
is still on the
course finishing up.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.134
That time is down to about five
minutes, seven minutes today.

00:12:26.134 --> 00:12:27.550
And I think we can
confidently say

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.810
if we meet in the
future, that will

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:32.260
be an even shorter
amount of time.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:36.770
So we see in swimming,
rowing, running,

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.530
this convergence of times.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.300
And as you know, we need now
incredibly sensitive devices

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.170
just to figure out
when the players leave

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.490
and when they finish in
order to measure truly

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:50.550
which one is the fastest
in that particular event.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:53.515
Let me shift gears a bit and
now talk about skill/luck.

00:12:53.515 --> 00:12:55.890
I've been depicting them with
these normal distributions,

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:57.819
but of course,
that's not the case.

00:12:57.819 --> 00:12:59.110
Skill-- let me start with that.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.010
It's actually quite
easy to describe.

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:02.930
Skill tends to follow an arc.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:05.254
So we call this
the arc of skill.

00:13:05.254 --> 00:13:07.170
Again, let me start with
a physical endeavour.

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.355
This is sports.

00:13:08.355 --> 00:13:10.230
So for example, if you've
ever played a sport

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.771
when you start off
when you're young,

00:13:11.771 --> 00:13:13.450
you don't have a
lot of proficiency.

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:15.950
But as you practice, you get
better, and better, and better.

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:18.566
At some point you get
to peak performance

00:13:18.566 --> 00:13:19.690
as you're getting stronger.

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:21.273
And then you come
down the other side.

00:13:21.273 --> 00:13:22.980
So there's this
very definable arc.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.160
By the way, for sports the
best way to predict this

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.760
is slow twitch versus
fast twitch muscles.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.090
It turns out that in sports with
a lot of fast twitch muscles,

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:32.160
players peak young.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.480
So sprinters-- 22, 23.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.640
Basketball players--
their mid-20s.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.450
And then if there's
more slow twitch,

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:40.660
you peak in your
late 20s, typically.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.720
So baseball players-- late 20s.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.095
Some football players--
late 20s, as well.

00:13:46.095 --> 00:13:48.720
By the way, if you're a golfer,
there's some good news for you.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.770
Golf tends to plateau
from roughly 30 to 35,

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:54.625
and then it rolls
over after age 35.

00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:57.172
So here's Tiger
Woods, who is now 38.

00:13:57.172 --> 00:13:59.380
So no matter what other
issues he's dealing with now,

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.410
Father Time is also
knocking on his door.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:05.800
Here's the actual arc
of skill for tennis.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.380
This is quite interesting data.

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:11.980
This is the winner of Men's
Grand Slam tournaments

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:12.750
in the Open era.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.450
So 1968 through 2013.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.840
So on top you can
see the distribution.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.180
And it turns out, the
mode is 24 years old.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.850
And it turns out in
the last 40 years

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:25.280
or so, the mean is
actually 24 years old.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.280
So 24 years old is
basically the sweet spot

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.402
for winning men's
tennis tournaments.

00:14:30.402 --> 00:14:32.110
Now the bottom panel--
it's a little hard

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:33.430
to see from where you
are-- but the bottom

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.990
is actually the age of every
winner of every tournament

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:39.870
since that time, with
a line at age 30.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:46.580
And what we know is in the
last 40 years-- so 160 events--

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:49.880
only four players have
been over 30 years

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.190
old who've won a Grand Slam.

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:53.140
Only four players.

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.092
By the way, we had a
little bit of excitement

00:14:55.092 --> 00:14:57.300
about this just a couple
weeks ago with Roger Federer

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.370
trying to win Wimbledon.

00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:59.720
He's 32 years old.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.330
He'll be 33 in the fall.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:06.470
It's simply no one has won
Wimbledon over the age of 30

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.940
since Arthur Ash did it in 1975.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:12.490
So it was really-- it just shows
you how amazing Federer is.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:15.570
But at his age, with
17 Slams, what happens

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:18.149
is you physically slow
down just a tiny bit.

00:15:18.149 --> 00:15:19.690
And that difference
is the difference

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:21.360
between you and a
younger generation.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.050
So we'll see if in men's tennis
this new, young generation

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:26.380
starts to take over.

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.460
This is a very, very
pronounced pattern

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:34.120
that we see in every sport
and you know, bankable.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.699
Now your reaction to that is
probably something like, oh,

00:15:36.699 --> 00:15:37.490
that's interesting.

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:39.370
Maybe it helps you in your
fantasy sports league,

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:39.911
or something.

00:15:39.911 --> 00:15:42.600
But what you care about is
cognitive performance, right?

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.350
Psychologists study
cognitive performance.

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:46.300
And it follows the
same arc, incidentally.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.720
And it turns out
psychologists often

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.270
agree that cognitive
performance is

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:52.050
a function of two
types of intelligence--

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:54.759
so-called crystallized
and fluid intelligence.

00:15:54.759 --> 00:15:56.300
And you can see from
the picture this

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.339
is sort of a bad news,
good news situation.

00:15:59.339 --> 00:16:01.880
Let's start with the bad news,
and that's fluid intelligence.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.300
So fluid intelligence
is effectively

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.740
your ability to
deal with novelty.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:06.470
So if I present you with
a series you've never

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:08.470
seen before, how good
are you at figuring out

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:10.760
what's going to happen next?

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.280
Turns out we have
a couple people

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.840
who are probably right at
their peaks in the room.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.997
Fluid intelligence tends
to peak in your early 20s

00:16:16.997 --> 00:16:19.330
and then pretty much goes
downhill throughout your life.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.182
So if you're out of
college, basically, you're

00:16:22.182 --> 00:16:23.640
probably on the
down swing in terms

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.185
of your fluid intelligence.

00:16:25.185 --> 00:16:26.560
Crystallized
intelligence-- which

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.150
is the good news, of
course-- is something

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:30.680
that is exactly
what it sounds like.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:31.680
It's your cumulative knowledge.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.960
It's your wisdom, understanding
of facts, and so forth.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.920
That pretty much-- barring
cognitive impairment--

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.350
pretty much grows
throughout life.

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:38.290
So you can see that.

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:41.700
And it's the combination that
defines this overall arc.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.514
So here are the
basic trade offs.

00:16:43.514 --> 00:16:45.430
Now I just want to
mentioned a couple numbers,

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.221
and maybe I'll ask you
guys to participate.

00:16:47.221 --> 00:16:50.390
I'm going to ask you a
couple numbers about peak age

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:52.380
performance for certain tasks.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.470
So the first one
I'll throw out there

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:57.380
is there was a study done of
institutional money managers.

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.009
So these are portfolio managers.

00:16:59.009 --> 00:17:01.050
And the question I'll post
to you is, at what age

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:04.589
do you believe institutional
money managers deliver the best

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:05.920
excess returns?

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.109
So what age do
institutional money managers

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:09.722
deliver the best excess returns?

00:17:09.722 --> 00:17:10.680
Throw out some numbers.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.346
What do we hear?

00:17:11.346 --> 00:17:12.369
AUDIENCE: 72.

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:14.005
MICHAEL MAUBOUSSIN: 70?

00:17:14.005 --> 00:17:15.640
God, I love that
answer, by the way.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.856
I'm holding on to that one.

00:17:16.856 --> 00:17:17.398
AUDIENCE: 55.

00:17:17.398 --> 00:17:18.356
MICHAEL MAUBOUSSIN: 55.

00:17:18.356 --> 00:17:19.183
AUDIENCE: 45.

00:17:19.183 --> 00:17:20.089
AUDIENCE: 40.

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:21.047
MICHAEL MAUBOUSSIN: 40.

00:17:21.047 --> 00:17:22.170
40 40.

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:23.617
45.

00:17:23.617 --> 00:17:24.200
Very specific.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:24.700
OK.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.230
So the answer-- well,
the actual, exact answer

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:28.880
is the range of 40 to 44.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.350
But let's call it
42 as an average.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.380
So you guys, you know, some of
those guesses are really good.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:33.755
Let's hold on to
that 70, though.

00:17:33.755 --> 00:17:35.060
I may modify that one.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:38.910
So institutional money
managers-- early 40s.

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:41.620
The other one that was even
more interesting for me-- this

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.704
was a paper done by David
Laibson and some colleagues

00:17:44.704 --> 00:17:45.620
at Harvard University.

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.310
And this is where they used
massive data sets for this.

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.810
They went out and studied-- now
this is not people like you,

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:52.720
but people in the
real world, out there.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.300
At what age do people make
the best household finance

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.351
decisions?

00:17:56.351 --> 00:17:57.850
So this is at what
age do people get

00:17:57.850 --> 00:17:59.500
the best terms on
their auto loans?

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.020
At what age do people
get the best interest

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:01.820
rates on their mortgages?

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:02.540
That type of stuff.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.720
So there were about a dozen
categories, tens of thousands

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.700
of people participating.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.910
At what age do people make
the best household finance

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:08.770
decisions?

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:11.700
What number, what age
do you think that is?

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.020
AUDIENCE: 30 to 35.

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.180
MICHAEL MAUBOUSSIN: 30 to 35.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.104
AUDIENCE: 55 to 60.

00:18:16.104 --> 00:18:17.520
MICHAEL MAUBOUSSIN:
What was that?

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.240
AUDIENCE: 55 to 60.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.614
MICHAEL MAUBOUSSIN: That's good.

00:18:19.614 --> 00:18:20.280
I like that one.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.194
That's good.

00:18:21.194 --> 00:18:21.860
So anybody else?

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:22.360
Yeah?

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.180
AUDIENCE: 40 to 45.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.670
MICHAEL MAUBOUSSIN: So 40 to 45.

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:28.110
This is one where I'm thinking
the older-- my thought was

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:30.684
older is better, in part
because older people tend

00:18:30.684 --> 00:18:32.350
to have more assets
than younger people,

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:34.570
on average, which is true.

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:36.850
And really, there's no
cognitive impairment issues

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:39.500
even when you get into your
60s, typically, for most people.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.850
Turns out the age was 53.

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:43.175
53.

00:18:43.175 --> 00:18:45.050
And there's a standard
deviation around that.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:46.966
But almost everyone in
the categories the mean

00:18:46.966 --> 00:18:49.130
tended to converge on age 53.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:51.880
So the question I was asking
myself is, why is it not 60,

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.280
for instance.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.070
And it turns out
the cartoon version

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:57.770
of that is that just
as when we get older

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:00.490
it becomes more difficult for us
to react to things physically,

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:03.865
as we get older we tend to get
cognitively lazier, as well.

00:19:03.865 --> 00:19:05.564
We tend to get
cognitively lazier.

00:19:05.564 --> 00:19:07.730
So I'm going to ask you
just to participate in this.

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:09.370
Please don't shout
out the answer.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.350
You guys just answer
it in your head

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:13.080
or write it down
if you're inclined.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:17.196
Here's a very simple question
to try to illustrate this point.

00:19:17.196 --> 00:19:18.070
So here's the set up.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.601
Jack is looking at Anne.

00:19:20.601 --> 00:19:23.060
Anne is looking at George.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.480
Jack is married.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.869
George is unmarried.

00:19:27.869 --> 00:19:29.660
Here's the question
I'd like you to answer.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:34.990
Is a married person looking
at an unmarried person.

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:35.490
All right?

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:36.370
So Jack is married.

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:37.590
He's looking at Anne.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:38.750
Anne is looking at George.

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:39.620
He's unmarried.

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.290
The question is,
is a married person

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:43.651
looking at an unmarried person?

00:19:43.651 --> 00:19:45.150
So there are three
possible answers.

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:46.370
A, yes.

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:47.570
B, no.

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:50.265
C, cannot be determined based
on the information you provided

00:19:50.265 --> 00:19:52.220
me.

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:53.520
So let me ask this question.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.130
What is the first answer
that comes to your mind?

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:56.870
AUDIENCE: C.

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.470
MICHAEL MAUBOUSSIN: C, right?

00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:59.890
So by the way, how
many people C--

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:01.514
first answer comes
to your mind, right?

00:20:01.514 --> 00:20:03.350
So of course, that's
the wrong answer.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:05.766
But it is the first answer
that comes to your mind, right?

00:20:05.766 --> 00:20:09.180
Now let me see if I can
replicate the C mindset.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.610
See I have two
pairs to work with.

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:11.140
There are no tricks.

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.480
I have two pairs to work with.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.210
Jack and Anne-- I know
Jack's marital state.

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:18.170
Right there, the light
bulb just went on.

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:19.420
You know Jack's marital state.

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:20.270
You don't know
Anne's marital state.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:22.040
So I can't tell
based on that pair.

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.490
My second pair is
Anne and George.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:24.970
I know George's marital
state, but I still

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:25.890
don't know Anne's marital state.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:26.647
So I can't tell.

00:20:26.647 --> 00:20:27.480
I'm basically stuck.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.890
Now the answer is A, yes.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:33.560
And the reason is Anne has only
two possible marital statuses.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.770
She's either married
or she's unmarried.

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:38.180
And of course that's exhaustive.

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.510
So let's assume for a
moment she's unmarried.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:42.660
Jack is looking at Anne.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.243
Is a married person looking at--
then the answer would be yes.

00:20:45.243 --> 00:20:47.507
And now flip her status
and say she's married.

00:20:47.507 --> 00:20:48.590
Anne is looking at George.

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:50.714
Is a married person looking
at an unmarried person?

00:20:50.714 --> 00:20:51.820
The answer would be yes.

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:52.320
Right.

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.486
So no matter what I assume
about her marital status,

00:20:54.486 --> 00:20:57.520
the answer must be affirmative
for one of my pairs.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.320
Now what happens--
by the way, I rushed

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.260
through that purposefully.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:04.811
Everyone answers C at first.

00:21:04.811 --> 00:21:06.560
And the only way to
get the correct answer

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.570
is to check your work.

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:09.570
Now if I had given
you all time, I

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:12.119
assure you all would have
gotten that answer correct.

00:21:12.119 --> 00:21:13.660
But what happens
is, as you get older

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:16.230
you're less likely to check
your work-- quite literally less

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.890
likely to check your work.

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:18.639
The first answer that
comes to your mind--

00:21:18.639 --> 00:21:21.816
And if you want to use
[INAUDIBLE] language,

00:21:21.816 --> 00:21:23.940
that question is meant to
evoke your system-- one--

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:24.635
rapid response.

00:21:24.635 --> 00:21:26.530
And unless you recruited
your system-- two--

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:28.072
to answer that
question properly,

00:21:28.072 --> 00:21:29.780
you're going to come
to the wrong answer.

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:30.490
That's what happens.

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.948
That's the cartoon version of
what happens as we get older.

00:21:32.948 --> 00:21:35.199
We go with rules of
thumb and heuristics.

00:21:35.199 --> 00:21:37.490
Now let me turn to the topic
of luck, which is actually

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:39.752
quite a bit richer than
the topic of skill, even.

00:21:39.752 --> 00:21:41.210
And when we talk
about luck there's

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:43.275
a very bright dividing
line between activities

00:21:43.275 --> 00:21:45.850
that are largely independent
activities and then

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:47.910
path dependent activities--
where what happened

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:49.312
before affects
what happens next.

00:21:49.312 --> 00:21:51.020
And what I'm going to
argue in these path

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:53.190
dependent processes is
there is an inherent lack

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:57.159
of predictability and
an inherent inequality.

00:21:57.159 --> 00:21:58.950
But let me start first
with a simpler case,

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:03.450
and that is these
independent outcomes in luck.

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:05.640
In the book we actually
used a baseball player

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.365
named Adam Jones.

00:22:06.365 --> 00:22:09.030
His batting average in
2011-- he's an All Star now,

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:11.430
by the way-- his batting
average was .280.

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:14.010
So we create a spinner
model-- 28% of the time, hit.

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:15.990
72% of the time, out.

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:17.970
We simulate 10,000 seasons.

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:20.140
We compare it to the actual
Adam Jones statistics.

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:22.394
And hitting is not
perfectly independent,

00:22:22.394 --> 00:22:24.810
but it's close enough for all
intents and purposes, right?

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:29.260
So that's basically a close
to independent process--

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.570
not perfect, but close enough.

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:31.720
And there are other
things in business

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.428
that we can model on
other things in life

00:22:33.428 --> 00:22:36.180
where that element
of luck is going

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:39.560
to be pretty easy to
model and almost never

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.940
perfect, but
typically pretty good.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:47.650
The more interesting case is
the case of path dependence.

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:49.937
So this is my second quiz
question of the day and one

00:22:49.937 --> 00:22:51.520
that's much easier
than the first one.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:56.014
Which is, what is the most
famous painting in the world?

00:22:56.014 --> 00:22:56.930
AUDIENCE: "Mona Lisa."

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:57.830
MICHAEL MAUBOUSSIN:
"Mona Lisa", right?

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:00.310
That's a hint as everybody here
is looking at the painting.

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:01.960
So there's the "Mona Lisa."

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:02.830
By the way, how many
people have actually

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:04.350
seen the "Mona
Lisa" in real life?

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:04.850
Yes?

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:07.154
And so what was your
impression of the "Mona Lisa"?

00:23:07.154 --> 00:23:07.820
AUDIENCE: Small.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:09.380
MICHAEL MAUBOUSSIN: Small.

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:10.730
Anything else besides small?

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:13.130
Any other descriptors?

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:13.950
Inspiring?

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:14.630
No, small.

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:15.960
That's usually what people say.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.520
Well, I have to say, my wife,
Michelle, is here today.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.750
And we last summer
took our whole family--

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:22.800
we have five kids--
and mother-in-law.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.730
So all eight of
us went to Paris.

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:27.000
And we, of course,
went to the Louvre.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.470
We got a guide
and we spent a day

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:31.270
there so that our kids
could be disappointed

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:32.770
as we were a generation before.

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:35.510
So we've perpetuated
that tradition.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.760
Now you all know the basic
history of the "Mona Lisa."

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.718
It was painted by Leonardo
da Vinci, of course,

00:23:39.718 --> 00:23:41.170
in the early 1500s.

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.640
It was in Italy for a number
of years in the early 1500s,

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.070
but it's been in France
continuously since about 1517.

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:50.387
So let's round it and say 500
years, basically, in France.

00:23:50.387 --> 00:23:51.970
Now the question is
an interesting one

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:54.690
to pose is, why is the
"Mona Lisa"-- by the way,

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:56.730
"Mona Lisa" gets
85% market share

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:59.220
when you ask that
question around the globe.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:02.210
85% of people say-- unprompted--
say the "Mona Lisa."

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:03.710
By the way, I was
curious about this

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:05.505
because I was in
Singapore in Hong Kong,

00:24:05.505 --> 00:24:07.130
and I was giving a
version of the talk.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:09.620
And I asked people there--
just as I asked you--

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:12.360
and the answer spilled out
just as rapidly and just as

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:12.910
decisively.

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:15.300
So that the truly
seems to be the case.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.267
So the question is,
why is the "Mona Lisa"

00:24:17.267 --> 00:24:18.850
the most famous
painting in the world?

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:21.480
And if you were an art critic
you might say something like,

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:25.070
well, there were only like 11
or 12 da Vincis in the world.

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:27.560
But he depicted movement in
the background beautifully.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.700
He used oil paints.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.371
And you can always fall back on
the enigmatic smile of the Mona

00:24:32.371 --> 00:24:32.870
Lisa.

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:34.369
But notice that
none of those things

00:24:34.369 --> 00:24:37.490
are truly unique to the
painting and many of them

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:40.210
are actually quite
self-referential.

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:43.190
So now what if I told you
that for most of "Mona Lisa's"

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:46.340
existence, it was not the most
famous painting in the world.

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.610
And I want to give you two
bits of evidence on that.

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:50.610
The first is in 1750.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:53.200
The painting was in Versailles--
about 20 kilometers away

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.660
from Paris-- at
the Royal Palace.

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.700
And they said, we're
going to take the top 110

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.790
pieces from Versailles
and bring them

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:01.200
to Paris for an exhibition.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.260
So the top 100 pieces.

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.460
"Mona Lisa" doesn't
make the cut.

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.090
This is 1750, so it's about
a 250-year-old painting.

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.550
It doesn't make the cut.

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:14.440
In 1797, it goes to the Louvre--
when it opened as a museum--

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.300
where it remains
today, of course.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:19.390
And right around
1850-- it's 1849,

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:21.080
specifically--
we'll call it 1850.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.580
The curators of
the Louvre brought

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:25.330
in experts to value
each of the paintings,

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:27.700
in part for insurance purposes.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.110
And what you see is the "Mona
Lisa" was not even deemed

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:33.090
to be the most valuable
da Vinci painting.

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:35.230
And its value was
truly deemed to be

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:39.890
a fraction of the most
famous Raphaels of the day.

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:44.510
So what happened
between 1850 and 2014

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:46.316
where everybody says,
the "Mona Lisa" is

00:25:46.316 --> 00:25:48.591
the most famous
painting in the world?

00:25:48.591 --> 00:25:50.340
Now some of you may
have heard this story,

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.760
but it's a wonderful one.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:55.940
In the summer of 1911, an
Italian painter-- patriotic,

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:58.520
apparently-- decides
that the "Mona Lisa"

00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.920
should be returned
back to Italy.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.290
So he sneaks into the
Louvre on a Sunday night--

00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:06.700
it was closed on Mondays at the
time-- slept, woke up, and on

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:09.990
Monday morning came in and
took the painting off its peg,

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:12.320
put it in his jacket,
and walked out the door.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.695
Now when I asked you-- for
those of you who saw the "Mona

00:26:14.695 --> 00:26:16.610
Lisa"-- I said, what
was your description,

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:17.568
what was your reaction?

00:26:17.568 --> 00:26:18.880
Most of you said small.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.930
And that was a huge asset
because it's only 22 by 30.

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:23.480
So it's a fairly small painting.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.600
And that fit nicely
inside this guy's coat

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.550
as he sneaked out
with the painting.

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:30.352
Now this guy-- a lot of
theories about this guy.

00:26:30.352 --> 00:26:31.810
He was a little
bit of a crazy guy.

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:33.643
But he basically went
back to his apartment,

00:26:33.643 --> 00:26:36.184
put it in a trunk, and
just slid it under his bed,

00:26:36.184 --> 00:26:37.350
and basically left it there.

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:38.390
And no one heard anything of it.

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:39.990
Now immediately--
by the way, this

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:42.140
is a time when the Parisian
press was taking off,

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.220
four million newspapers
in circulation--

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.680
where's our beloved "Mona
Lisa" becomes a national story

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.060
in France and then ultimately
an international story.

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:53.940
So this great da Vinci
painting is missing.

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:57.256
Well, two years later, this
guy says, well, the gig's up,

00:26:57.256 --> 00:26:58.880
decides to get rid
of this "Mona Lisa."

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.150
So he writes a letter to a
Florentine antique dealer.

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:04.570
And he says, hey, my name--
I got the "Mona Lisa."

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:06.390
I want to bring
it back to Italy.

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:07.540
Will you buy it off me?

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:09.930
And the guy says, hey, if
it's true, validate it,

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:11.020
authenticate it, sure.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:12.570
So the guy goes
down to Florence.

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:15.130
Sure enough, they
meet at a hotel,

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:16.820
they authenticate
the "Mona Lisa."

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.570
They arrest the guy--
apparently shocked--

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:21.170
as he's dragged
off by the police.

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:23.175
And they negotiate with
the French government.

00:27:23.175 --> 00:27:24.550
And then within
a couple of weeks

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:28.010
it comes back to France
in early 1914-- so

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:30.980
100 years almost,
exactly-- to great fanfare.

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:34.430
It gets its own room,
and 100,000 people

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:35.190
come to see this.

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:39.020
So it sort of kick starts the
popularity of this painting.

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.750
And from there, of course, it
becomes part of pop culture.

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:45.050
So on the left, you see the very
famous Marcel Duchamp parody

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:47.450
where it's got a little
mustache and a beard.

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:50.050
And if you can read French,
read those letters quickly,

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:52.560
it's a bit of a scandalous
phrase about the "Mona Lisa."

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.160
And on the right, it comes
over to the US shores

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.960
with Nat King Cole's number
one song in the 1950s called

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.322
"Mona Lisa," wins an
Academy Award, and so forth.

00:28:02.322 --> 00:28:04.905
By the way, no one really knows
what the "Mona Lisa" is worth.

00:28:04.905 --> 00:28:06.655
The last time it came
to the United States

00:28:06.655 --> 00:28:07.960
was the early 1960s.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.700
It was brought over
by Jacqueline Kennedy.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:14.387
It was then put out for
appraisal for insurance.

00:28:14.387 --> 00:28:15.720
So there's an interesting thing.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.053
There's something called "The
Financial Analyst Journal"

00:28:18.053 --> 00:28:20.230
which writes about
different financial topics.

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:22.230
And one of the things
they had in a recent issue

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:26.390
was the art chain-- so the art
prices over the last 100 years.

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:29.990
So just for fun, I took
that number from 1962

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:31.510
and attached it
to the art chain.

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:33.190
And you have to inflation
adjust and so forth.

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:34.490
But if you work
out the math, sort

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:35.864
of back of the
envelope, the best

00:28:35.864 --> 00:28:38.390
estimate for the value of the
"Mona Lisa" in 2014 dollars

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:40.924
is 2.5 billion dollars.

00:28:40.924 --> 00:28:42.340
And that would be
roughly 10 times

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:43.330
what's paid for any painting.

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:44.280
Now of course, it's invaluable.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.086
Who knows what it's worth
and certainly whether it

00:28:46.086 --> 00:28:47.544
would fetch that
in the real world.

00:28:47.544 --> 00:28:48.380
I have no idea.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.600
But just to give you
some sort of a sense

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.432
of that exercise for fun.

00:28:52.432 --> 00:28:54.640
Now the problem with my
"Mona Lisa" story-- hopefully

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.229
it's entertaining-- but there's
no way to prove it right

00:28:57.229 --> 00:28:58.770
and there's no way
to prove it wrong.

00:28:58.770 --> 00:28:59.270
Right?

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:02.950
What I've done is I've attached
a number of facts to a story--

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:07.667
to a claim-- that's made
this painting so famous.

00:29:07.667 --> 00:29:10.250
But I want to share with you the
outcome of an experiment that

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:14.930
lends credence to how
unpredictable hits really are.

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:17.660
This is an experiment done by
three sociologists at Columbia

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:20.150
University called Music Lab.

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:22.910
The main researcher on this
is a guy named Duncan Watts.

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:26.600
And what they did is ostensibly
about musical tastes.

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.377
About 14,000 people
participated.

00:29:28.377 --> 00:29:29.460
So here's the basic drill.

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:31.330
You're a college kids sitting
in your dorm, you get an email

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:33.870
and it says, hey, we care about
what you think about music.

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:34.700
Come into our site.

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:37.335
You see 48 songs
by unknown bands.

00:29:37.335 --> 00:29:38.890
So they validate--
they made sure

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:41.420
that no one had heard of
these songs or these bands.

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.579
And they say, cruise
around, and listen to songs,

00:29:43.579 --> 00:29:44.370
and then rate them.

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:45.360
Five stars, I love it.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:46.539
One star, I hate it.

00:29:46.539 --> 00:29:49.080
And if you really like it, you
can download it for your iPod.

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.844
So that's the basic set up--
love it, hate it, download it.

00:29:51.844 --> 00:29:53.260
Now unbeknownst
to the subjects is

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:54.720
they came in--
20% came into what

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.930
they call the
independent condition.

00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:59.267
The order of the
songs is randomized.

00:29:59.267 --> 00:30:00.850
Love it, hate it,
download it, but you

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:02.620
can see what no one
else did before you.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.531
So effectively you're in the
record store by yourself.

00:30:05.531 --> 00:30:07.780
The other 80%-- of course,
you see that's the control.

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:11.820
The other 80% went into 10%
each into eight social worlds.

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:13.570
You could think of
these, quite literally,

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:16.050
as parallel universes.

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:18.989
Identical initial set
up to the control,

00:30:18.989 --> 00:30:21.280
but now you could see what
other people did before you.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.730
You could see what
songs they downloaded

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:24.520
and you could see what
songs they said they liked.

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.214
In one extreme version
of the experiment

00:30:26.214 --> 00:30:28.380
they had a leader board--
so the most popular songs,

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:30.400
the most downloaded
songs at the top.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.540
So the question is,
does the pattern

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:36.786
of what people do before you
influence what you say you like

00:30:36.786 --> 00:30:37.910
and what you ultimately do?

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:41.041
And the answer is fairly
unequivocally yes.

00:30:41.041 --> 00:30:42.290
Now I want to be really clear.

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:44.410
The best songs in the
independent condition

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:47.870
had a much better chance of
success in the social worlds.

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:49.310
And the bad songs
really did well.

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:50.150
So quality mattered.

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:52.530
I want to be really
clear about that.

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:55.210
But if you're in the top
third, probably top half

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:58.980
of the control independent
condition, pretty much anything

00:30:58.980 --> 00:30:59.519
can happen.

00:30:59.519 --> 00:31:01.060
Now there was one
song that I thought

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:02.560
captured the
experiment brilliantly.

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:06.370
It's a song called "Lockdown"
by a band named 52metro.

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:10.000
And it was number 26 in
the independent condition.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.430
So this is one out of 48.

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:13.130
It's number 26.

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:15.255
It's basically the
definition of average.

00:31:15.255 --> 00:31:16.760
Right in the middle.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.620
In one of the social worlds,
it was the number one hit.

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:24.960
And in another one of the
social worlds, it was number 40.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:29.230
So the point is, if we roll
back time and replay time again,

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:31.720
would we likely have the
same-- would "Harry Potter" be

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:32.380
"Harry Potter"?

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:34.460
Would "Star Wars"
be "Star Wars"?

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:35.810
Would YouTube be YouTube?

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:38.330
The answer is highly
unlikely that the same things

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:40.555
would succeed to the
same order of magnitude

00:31:40.555 --> 00:31:41.590
that they did succeed.

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:45.930
It's inherently very
difficult to predict winners.

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:47.610
By the way, as a
side note-- I'll

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:50.380
mention that I teach a course
at Columbia Business School.

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:52.180
And this year-- we always
bring in an executive guest.

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:53.180
And this year we
brought in a guy

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.050
who was an executive
at Time Warner.

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:56.839
Now he runs Turner Broadcasting.

00:31:56.839 --> 00:31:58.380
And he must have
said to the students

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.180
a half dozen times
in his session,

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:03.411
we have no idea what's
going to be a hit.

00:32:03.411 --> 00:32:05.410
You know, we obviously
work really hard at this.

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:07.010
We try to think about formulas.

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:08.900
We really have no idea
what's going to work.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:11.279
So they've got a huge TV
studio, a huge film studio.

00:32:11.279 --> 00:32:13.070
They're very incentivized
to figure it out,

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:16.050
but it's very difficult to do.

00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:19.900
Now the other thing I mentioned
is this inherent inequality.

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:22.490
Economists call this
convexity, which

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:24.700
says for a small
change in quality,

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:28.440
there's a huge change in payoff.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.296
The example-- the
product-- I want

00:32:30.296 --> 00:32:31.670
to use for this--
and by the way,

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:33.060
you might think-- there
are a lot of examples.

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:34.684
So the x-axis here,
by the way, is just

00:32:34.684 --> 00:32:37.164
going to be skill, or quality,
whatever you want to say.

00:32:37.164 --> 00:32:39.580
The y-axis is some sort of
payoff-- could be market share,

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:41.090
could be profits,
whatever it is.

00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:44.220
One example-- a trivial one--
is if you win the US Open tennis

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:46.570
tournament, you make
twice as much money

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:48.190
as the guy who
comes in second even

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:50.200
though on any objective
scale of skill

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.825
you're sitting right
next to each other

00:32:51.825 --> 00:32:54.140
and vastly better than
the broader population.

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:56.910
Now the product I want to
mention in this context

00:32:56.910 --> 00:32:58.987
is a product called
Stephen King.

00:32:58.987 --> 00:33:00.570
And you all know his
name, obviously--

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:03.410
a remarkably successful
novelist for many, many years.

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:05.780
His first very commercially
successful novel

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:08.360
came out in 1973,
called "Carrie."

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:10.420
And from that point on,
he was off and running.

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:14.861
He published about a book a year
with great commercial acclaim.

00:33:14.861 --> 00:33:16.610
But it turns out Stephen
King was actually

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:18.270
writing more than
one novel a year.

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:21.280
So he's got these extra novels
stacking up on the side.

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.030
So he turns to his
publishers and he says,

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:24.490
hey, we're doing great.

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:26.510
How about we publish more
than one book a year?

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:27.968
And the guy says,
Stephen, Stephen.

00:33:27.968 --> 00:33:29.420
One book per author per year.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.660
That's how we do it in
the publishing world.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:32.950
So he says, you know what?

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:35.310
I'm going to publish
anyway under a pseudonym.

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:38.050
And the pseudonym
was Richard Bachman.

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:40.710
Richard because there was a
Richard Stark novel sitting

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:43.090
on his desk at that
time, and Bachman

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:46.650
because Bachman-Turner Overdrive
was playing on the radio.

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:49.282
Some of the older people
know that band and that song,

00:33:49.282 --> 00:33:50.490
"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet."

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:53.640
So Richard Bachman starts going
to the publishing businesses.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.990
And here's what happens for
the next half dozen years.

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:58.090
Stephen King-- great
commercial success.

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:00.500
Richard Bachman--
commercial flop.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.710
Stephen King-- great
commercial success.

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:04.480
Richard Bachman--
commercial flop.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.760
And this is going
on book after book.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:09.630
The last Richard Bachman book
came out in the early 1980s

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:11.365
and it was called "Thinner."

00:34:11.365 --> 00:34:13.240
There was a guy in a
Washington, DC bookstore

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:14.199
who was reading this book.

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:16.110
And he was like, this
guy Richard Bachman--

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:17.949
he writes a lot
like Stephen King.

00:34:17.949 --> 00:34:20.310
He develops his characters
like Stephen King.

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:22.802
You know, I think this
actually might be Stephen King.

00:34:22.802 --> 00:34:25.260
He so believes this he goes
down to the Library of Congress

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:28.440
and looks up who's got the
copyright to Richard Bachman.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.810
And it turns out-- Stephen King.

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:32.179
So he figures this out.

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:33.330
And he calls him up
and says, Mr. King,

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:35.090
I've realized that
you're Richard Bachman.

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:36.409
King comes clean
immediately, by the way,

00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:37.729
and says, hey, congratulations.

00:34:37.729 --> 00:34:38.520
You figured it out.

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.520
I'll give you the first
interview, and so forth.

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:41.699
So the whole thing is over.

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:43.330
Now what's remarkable
and important

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:45.010
for the context of the story
is that from the moment

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:47.385
it was revealed that that book
was written not by Richard

00:34:47.385 --> 00:34:51.980
Bachman, but rather by Stephen
King, sales went up 10x.

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:53.440
Same book.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.199
And by the way,
for those of you--

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:57.082
this may have a
familiar ring to it.

00:34:57.082 --> 00:34:58.540
This actually
happened last summer.

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:01.070
Anybody follow this whole
thing with JK Rowling?

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:04.400
JK Rowling wrote a book under
the pseudonym Robert Galbraith.

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.070
We actually have
the Amazon rankings.

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:06.746
We kept track of them.

00:35:06.746 --> 00:35:07.870
It was actually very cool.

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:08.600
So it's puttering along.

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:09.350
It's doing fine.

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:12.360
It's puttering along but not
certainly at best seller.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.840
And then, this book is
actually written by JK Rowling,

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:16.635
and it shoots to number one.

00:35:16.635 --> 00:35:18.135
So I can imagine
as a publisher that

00:35:18.135 --> 00:35:20.259
would be very hard to hold
back on that information

00:35:20.259 --> 00:35:24.550
because eventually you can
have a hit song, hit book.

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:26.490
Now the last section I
want to finish up with

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:28.660
and then we can have
a broader discussion

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:32.190
is why we struggle
with understanding luck

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:34.230
and then ultimately
what to do about that.

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:36.230
Now if I tell you the
future has skill and luck,

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:37.271
everybody here gets that.

00:35:37.271 --> 00:35:39.220
There's no concern.

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.870
You completely
understand that concept.

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:43.046
But once an event
occurs, something

00:35:43.046 --> 00:35:44.670
that happens in all
of us-- by the way,

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:46.520
it happens effortlessly
and rapidly--

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:48.390
which is your mind
creates a narrative

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:51.080
to explain that
outcome and then you

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:54.220
file that narrative
in your mind.

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:55.840
And as you do that,
two things happen.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.547
One is called
hindsight bias, which

00:35:57.547 --> 00:36:00.130
is you start to believe that you
knew what was going to happen

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:03.340
with a greater probability
than you actually did.

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.250
And the second concept--
which is related--

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:06.792
is called creeping
determinism, which

00:36:06.792 --> 00:36:08.541
is you start to believe
that what happened

00:36:08.541 --> 00:36:10.770
was the only thing that
could have happened.

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:12.150
By the way, it's very
natural because now you

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:13.930
have the outcome and you have
all the facts that surround it.

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:15.290
And your mind says, aha!

00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:17.200
Yes, it had to be that way.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.071
How could I have entertained
any other alternatives?

00:36:20.071 --> 00:36:22.320
Now you might say, why do
you have this weird picture?

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.070
This guy on the left
is Michael Gazzaniga,

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:25.730
who is a well-known
neuroscientist.

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:28.520
He studied under Roger Sperry
and won the Nobel Prize.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.780
And he's probably best known
for his work on so-called

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:32.484
"split-brain patients."

00:36:32.484 --> 00:36:34.650
Now these are people who
have debilitating epilepsy.

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:35.900
They have failed all
their treatments.

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:37.230
And as a last ditch
effort, they go in

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:38.780
and they sever the
corpus callosum,

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:41.790
the bundle of nerves between the
two hemispheres of the brain.

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:43.370
By the way, the first thing
I should tell you is this

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:45.100
is actually a very
beneficial surgery.

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:47.120
People feel much
better after this.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:48.840
But the second
thing is, it sets up

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.819
an incredibly interesting
experimental condition where

00:36:51.819 --> 00:36:53.235
experimenters can
feed information

00:36:53.235 --> 00:36:55.354
into the right
hemisphere and then ask

00:36:55.354 --> 00:36:56.520
the patient what's going on.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:59.310
So the right hemisphere
has very little language.

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:02.090
So for instance, they
might show a key to a door

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:03.965
through the left eye to
the right hemisphere.

00:37:03.965 --> 00:37:05.339
And then they say
to the patient,

00:37:05.339 --> 00:37:07.360
point at the picture that
makes the most sense.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:10.530
And they point at the door,
no problem-- easy to do.

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:13.240
Then they ask them, why
are you pointing at a door?

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:15.380
Now note, your left
hemisphere has got a problem

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:19.156
because it can talk,
knows nothing of the key

00:37:19.156 --> 00:37:20.780
because it can't
access the information

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:21.780
in the right hemisphere.

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:25.060
But it can see that
they're pointing at a door.

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:27.630
So what the left
hemisphere does-- again,

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:30.470
effortlessly and rapidly--
is it creates a gibberish

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:32.687
story to explain what
you the person's doing.

00:37:32.687 --> 00:37:35.270
And by the way, if you read this
split-brain patient research,

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:36.978
it's absolutely-- it's
all quite humorous

00:37:36.978 --> 00:37:39.550
because these people
basically go to no ends

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:42.080
to explain what they're doing.

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:45.580
So pronounced is this
capability that neuroscientists

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:46.990
call this the interpreter.

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:49.169
The interpreter is part
of all of our brains,

00:37:49.169 --> 00:37:50.460
resides in our left hemisphere.

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:53.260
If I give you an effect, you
will come up with a cause.

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:55.230
And by the way,
it's like an itch

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:56.830
that demands to be scratched.

00:37:56.830 --> 00:38:00.090
I throw an effect at you,
you come up with a cause.

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:03.210
Now here is the punchline
for our discussion.

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:07.920
The interpreter knows nothing
of luck-- never got the memo.

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.400
So if it sees a
positive outcome,

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.910
it assumes something
good has happened.

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:13.500
If it sees a
negative outcome, it

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.420
assumes something
bad has happened.

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:16.887
And even check yourself.

00:38:16.887 --> 00:38:17.720
Even check yourself.

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.250
If you're looking at a
situation that's probabilistic--

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:23.460
and you know ahead of time the
range of possible outcomes--

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:25.392
note that once the
outcome has been resolved,

00:38:25.392 --> 00:38:27.850
you automatically create a
story to explain why it happened

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:31.840
and you somehow dismiss all
those other possibilities.

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:33.370
So here's the
thing I think is so

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:35.920
fascinating about this
broader discussion is

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:39.250
if the paradox of skill is
true-- absolute skill never

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:41.690
higher, relative
skill never narrower--

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:45.180
means luck is determining
more outcomes.

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:48.060
That's colliding with a
mind that really struggles

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:50.070
to understand the role of luck.

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:52.660
So that's one that hopefully is
something that can be helpful

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:55.510
as you think through
these basic issues.

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:57.782
Now what's related to that
is our love of stories.

00:38:57.782 --> 00:38:59.990
There's an interesting book
written a couple of years

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:02.114
ago by Jonathan Gottschall
called "The Storytelling

00:39:02.114 --> 00:39:04.830
Animal."

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:05.940
One quote from this.

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:10.110
It says, "A storytelling mind
is allergic to uncertainty,

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:11.600
randomness, and coincidence.

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.417
it is addicted to meaning.

00:39:13.417 --> 00:39:15.750
If the storytelling mind
cannot find meaningful patterns

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:17.640
in the world, it will
try to impose them."

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.681
Now here's the last line
that I think is the key.

00:39:19.681 --> 00:39:23.090
"In short, the storytelling mind
is a factory that churns out

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:28.090
true stories when it can, but
will manufacture lies when it

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:29.860
can't."

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:32.010
And that, I think, is
the key concept for us.

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:34.290
If we see outcomes that
are generated by luck,

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:37.000
we will try to impose our own
stories to try to make sense,

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.640
just as the split-brain
patients did before.

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.140
Now you might say, well,
is that such a big deal?

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:46.880
Let me give you one example from
the world of business that's

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.790
fascinating in this regard.

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:51.900
There was a piece of research
done by some academics

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:55.041
on all the books about
how to be a great company.

00:39:55.041 --> 00:39:57.540
"Good to Great," "In Search of
Excellence," "Built to Last."

00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:58.456
You've heard of these.

00:39:58.456 --> 00:40:02.450
You may have a couple of
them on your bookshelf.

00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:05.300
In these books they tally
up about 700 companies

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:06.830
that are mentioned
in these books.

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:08.740
And the question these
researchers asked

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:13.170
was, how many companies are
in these books by dint of luck

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:15.884
and how many are there because
they're truly skillful.

00:40:15.884 --> 00:40:17.300
So I'll spare you
all the details.

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:20.222
But what they basically do is
they have 50 years of data,

00:40:20.222 --> 00:40:23.470
they create a transition
matrix for return on capital,

00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:25.137
then they simulate
thousands of times.

00:40:25.137 --> 00:40:26.720
So it allows them
to create a template

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.640
to sort so-called common cause
versus special cause variation.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:32.300
Basically, what does written
system tell me should happen?

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:33.800
What's special from the system?

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.800
By the way, what they
found when they applied it

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.400
to these companies is that
indeed, some companies truly do

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:42.311
demonstrate skill, just
like in money management.

00:40:42.311 --> 00:40:43.810
Most of money
management performance

00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:45.730
can be explained by luck.

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:47.280
But truly there
are some-- you need

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.470
differential skill to
explain actual outcomes.

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:50.522
Same thing.

00:40:50.522 --> 00:40:51.980
But when they
applied this template

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:54.563
to the 700 companies mentioned
in these books, what they found

00:40:54.563 --> 00:40:57.060
was that only 12%
of the companies

00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:59.760
could be confidently
coded as skillful.

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:03.690
The other 80% they thought were
probably there because of luck.

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:05.190
Now remember a while
ago I mentioned

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:06.981
that when there's a
lot of luck in activity

00:41:06.981 --> 00:41:09.850
you expect rapid
reversion to the mean?

00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:13.197
Go pick up your copy
of "Good to Great"

00:41:13.197 --> 00:41:15.280
and look at the Table of
Contents at the company's

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:15.946
mentioned there.

00:41:15.946 --> 00:41:18.810
And you'll see that almost
from the moment the ink dried,

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:20.560
the performance of
many of those companies

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:25.090
rolled right over, just as
lots of luck would predict.

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:29.970
So here's an example of guys
selling tens of millions

00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:34.750
of copies of books purporting
to offer you an equation,

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:38.260
or sets of rules, or attributes
that will allow you to succeed,

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:39.840
when the foundation
of their research

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:43.920
basically rests on
luck, for the most part.

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.060
Now let me wrap up with
two final thoughts.

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:47.146
How do we get better?

00:41:47.146 --> 00:41:48.020
How do we get better?

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.780
So first let me talk
about the role of skill.

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:53.110
If you're on the far right
hand side of the continuum--

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:55.530
the culture and skill side-- the
answer is deliberate practice.

00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:56.880
By the way, I don't know if
anybody saw the "New York

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:59.460
Times" today-- the science
section of the "New York

00:41:59.460 --> 00:41:59.960
Times."

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.280
There was an interesting
article by Benedict Carey

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.980
about Zach Hambrick's work
at Michigan State University

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:13.650
on how much of true performance
is talent and how much of it

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:16.214
is hard work and
deliberate practice.

00:42:16.214 --> 00:42:18.130
And by the way, I wrote
about this in my book.

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:19.713
I thought the world
had tilted way too

00:42:19.713 --> 00:42:21.680
much toward this
Malcolm Gladwell cartoon

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.070
version-- 10,000 hours you
get great at anything--

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:26.590
and too far away from
underlying talent.

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:27.800
So I wrote a bit about this.

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.300
But that's the point
of the article.

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:30.880
Hambrick's work
shows quite clearly

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:33.090
that there is clearly
differential talent

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:35.210
and that talent plays a
major role in success.

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:38.130
That said, if it's a mostly
skill-based activity,

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:42.360
deliberate practice is truly a
very key component to success.

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.640
So this is 10,000 hours
right outside your ability

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.140
where you're getting
great feedback.

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:47.350
Now here's the key.

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:52.330
In these types of activities,
the output of that participant

00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:54.542
is a very clear indicator
of his or her skill.

00:42:54.542 --> 00:42:56.250
If I want to know if
you're a good tennis

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:59.060
player or a good piano player--
and I know what I'm doing--

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:00.780
I can listen to
you or watch you.

00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:02.340
And I can tell if
you're good at it.

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:05.450
And then I can give you
feedback to improve.

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:08.010
As you slide over to the
luck side of the continuum,

00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:09.760
as you can imagine--
by the way, investing

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:13.340
is a good example of this--
that connection between outcome

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:17.952
and skill becomes broken, or
at least breaks down some.

00:43:17.952 --> 00:43:19.660
So for example, you
might go to Las Vegas

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:22.250
and play blackjack and
play your cards foolishly

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:24.760
and win for awhile or play
them intelligently and lose.

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:27.260
Over the long haul that won't
be true, but in the short run.

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:28.850
So there's no connection
between the quality

00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:30.680
of your playing and
your actual outcomes.

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:32.730
As a consequence, as
you have more luck,

00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:34.545
you need to focus
more on process.

00:43:34.545 --> 00:43:36.170
And I won't go on a
great deal on this.

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:37.610
But the process--
I argue-- should

00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:39.151
have three essential
components-- one

00:43:39.151 --> 00:43:41.412
I'm going to call analytical,
which is finding edge.

00:43:41.412 --> 00:43:43.120
And then once you have
edge, figuring out

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.777
how much to bet on that edge.

00:43:44.777 --> 00:43:46.360
Second I'm going to
called behavioral,

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:48.830
which is understanding the
common biases that we all

00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:52.330
tend to fall for and trying to
weave into your process methods

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:54.070
to manage or mitigate those.

00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:56.410
And the third I'm going
to call organizational.

00:43:56.410 --> 00:43:58.550
This most famously
goes as agency costs

00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:01.730
where agents and principles
might have different interests.

00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:04.150
But all of us work in
organizations, none of which

00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:04.900
are perfect.

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:06.980
The question is,
is my organization

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:09.770
helping or impeding the
quality of my decisions.

00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:12.380
So how you improve your skill--
I think-- to some degree

00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:15.050
is a function of where you lie
on that luck/skill continuum

00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:17.690
and that dictates how
you think about that.

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:20.017
Now whenever I tell
people I wrote a book

00:44:20.017 --> 00:44:21.850
about skill and luck
they go, oh, yeah luck.

00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:22.766
I know all about this.

00:44:22.766 --> 00:44:25.270
Yeah, luck is where
preparation meets opportunity.

00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:27.540
Or the harder I work,
the luckier I get.

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:28.930
Yeah, see you guys said that.

00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:30.275
Hey, we don't have
to go to this guy.

00:44:30.275 --> 00:44:31.566
I already know the whole story.

00:44:31.566 --> 00:44:33.714
It's luck meets preparation.

00:44:33.714 --> 00:44:35.630
Now if you accept my
definition at the outset,

00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:37.470
none of those things
are actually luck.

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:38.603
In other words, you
might think about it

00:44:38.603 --> 00:44:40.350
in a different way, which
is what is in your control

00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:42.010
and what is not in your control?

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:43.600
If it's in your
control, it's going

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.210
to be skill to some degree.

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:47.370
Only if it's out of your
control can it be luck.

00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:50.000
In some ways you can't
improve your luck.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.400
All you can possibly do is
try to manage your luck.

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:55.090
So let me give you two
very simple examples.

00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:57.100
On the left-- it'd
be a simple case

00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:00.060
where if you're in a
competitive interaction--

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:01.830
let's say a sports
match, for instance--

00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:03.170
and you're the
stronger player, what

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:04.711
you want to do if
you're the stronger

00:45:04.711 --> 00:45:05.924
player is simplify the game.

00:45:05.924 --> 00:45:08.340
And by simplifying the game--
the dimensions of the game--

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:10.440
that means your skill
almost assuredly

00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.690
will overwhelm that
of your competitor.

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:15.280
If you are the underdog or
you're the weaker player, what

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:18.422
you want to do is complicate
the game, adding battlefields.

00:45:18.422 --> 00:45:20.130
Again, you'll still
be the weaker player.

00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:23.260
But it dilutes the strength
of the stronger player.

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:26.160
So some examples- well,
warfare is clear, right?

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:28.500
If you're the
weaker military, you

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:30.130
don't want to go toe to toe.

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:31.737
You want to use
guerrilla tactics.

00:45:31.737 --> 00:45:33.195
In the world of
business, you don't

00:45:33.195 --> 00:45:35.153
want to compete head to
head with an incumbent.

00:45:35.153 --> 00:45:38.320
You want to use disruptive
innovation-- the Christensen

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:38.957
type of stuff.

00:45:38.957 --> 00:45:41.040
In the world of sports,
you don't want to-- again,

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.373
you use trick plays, and so
forth, different strategies.

00:45:43.373 --> 00:45:46.655
So those are the ways to try
to tilt the odds a little bit,

00:45:46.655 --> 00:45:48.280
especially if you're
the weaker player,

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:51.490
or tilt them in your favor if
you're the stronger player.

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:53.244
On the right is this
idea of little bets.

00:45:53.244 --> 00:45:55.160
This is something you
guys do a lot, probably,

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:56.890
as an organization.

00:45:56.890 --> 00:45:58.530
Many years ago I
was an analyst that

00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:00.495
followed the food
companies-- big packaged food

00:46:00.495 --> 00:46:01.870
companies-- in
the United States.

00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:04.370
And they used to always
lament, we spent a lot of money

00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:05.860
on advertising and marketing.

00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:07.500
And we know that
half of it's wasted,

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:09.090
we just don't know
which half it is.

00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:10.770
So we can't stop doing it.

00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:12.190
And so what's
happened, of course,

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:15.624
is this concept of A/B testing.

00:46:15.624 --> 00:46:17.790
So now we can go along and
test two different things

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:20.060
and figure out-- for
example, an internet retailer

00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:22.930
might say here are two different
websites that people land on.

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:24.430
Which one will sell more stuff?

00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:27.470
And so we constantly
test and improve.

00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:29.270
In a sense you're not
really managing luck.

00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:31.670
What you're doing is clearing
the clouds of uncertainty

00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:34.120
and focusing on causality
much more effectively.

00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:35.620
But I sort of threw
that in that bin

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:39.830
as just dismissing
luck to some degree.

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:41.550
With that I'll stop.

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:43.115
There are three
things I mime hope

00:46:43.115 --> 00:46:44.270
you'll take away from this.

00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:47.780
The first is defining skill and
luck as being quite important.

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:49.587
So just those definitions
are essential.

00:46:49.587 --> 00:46:51.420
But in the first section,
a particular thing

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:52.625
I want you to walk
away with is this idea

00:46:52.625 --> 00:46:53.940
of the paradox of skill.

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:56.070
That even as skill
improves absolutely,

00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:58.470
it's often in many domains
getting narrower relatively,

00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:00.685
which is leaving more to luck.

00:47:00.685 --> 00:47:03.310
The second thing I want to leave
you with is the shape of luck,

00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:05.420
and especially these
path dependent processes.

00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:07.540
And in particular,
you really have

00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:09.130
to be very circumspect
about trying

00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:12.360
to predict the outcome of
these path dependent processes.

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:15.100
And again-- as you know--
also technology based.

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:17.660
A lot of things do depend on
things like network facts,

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:18.610
and so forth.

00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:22.600
And those are inherently
very difficult areas

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:23.980
to predict winners.

00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:26.520
And then the third area
is what to do about this.

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:27.790
And the main thing I
want to leave you with

00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:29.373
is this idea of the
interpreter, which

00:47:29.373 --> 00:47:32.280
is we have a part of our brain
that is constantly seeking

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:34.360
causes for every
effect that it sees,

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.940
and for you to be very
mindful and keep that in check

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:40.226
as you're considering
the outcomes around you.

00:47:40.226 --> 00:47:41.600
So with that let
me stop, and I'd

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:44.094
be very happy to
entertain-- [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:44.094 --> 00:47:45.510
is coming with a
white microphone.

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:48.774
I'd be happy to entertain
any questions or comments.

00:47:48.774 --> 00:47:49.690
We have a few minutes?

00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:50.890
Yeah, we have a
few minutes, right?

00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:52.973
MALE SPEAKER: Yes, we'll
open it up for questions.

00:47:52.973 --> 00:47:54.240
And thanks for the talk.

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:54.640
MICHAEL MAUBOUSSIN: My pleasure.

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:55.634
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:55.634 --> 00:47:56.628
Oh, thank you.

00:47:56.628 --> 00:48:01.600
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:05.110
AUDIENCE: So just looking at
the financial community as kind

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:09.890
of average Americans,
we don't see

00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:13.070
a lot of certainty
or predictability.

00:48:13.070 --> 00:48:15.140
It looks to us like
there's a lot of luck.

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:17.380
So is there a lack
of skill there?

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:18.584
Is the skill not growing?

00:48:18.584 --> 00:48:19.250
What's going on?

00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:21.208
MICHAEL MAUBOUSSIN: Super
interesting question.

00:48:21.208 --> 00:48:24.110
I think the answer is the notion
that it's all a huge amount

00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:26.070
luck-- if I put it
back on the continuum,

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:29.196
I would put investing way
over on the luck side.

00:48:29.196 --> 00:48:31.070
But again, I don't think
it's accurate to say

00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:31.970
it's because of luck.

00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:34.070
So let's go back to
the paradox of skill.

00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:35.770
I think that the
way to say this is

00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:39.130
that most professional
institutional investors are

00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:40.190
very skillful.

00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:42.140
They've gone to great schools.

00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:44.410
They've got incredible
information, and computing

00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:46.760
power, and information
access, and so forth.

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.980
But the problem is they're
all doing the same thing.

00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:50.630
So their skill is
extremely uniform.

00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:52.710
So I think that's
a classic example

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:55.670
of the paradox of skill.

00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:58.600
If I put you back in the 1960s
with the technology you have

00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:01.930
access to as a
financial money manager,

00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:03.775
you would run circles
around everybody.

00:49:03.775 --> 00:49:05.400
But now everybody's
got the same thing.

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:07.210
So I think it leaves
much more to luck.

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:09.020
So that's why it
appears to be luck--

00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:10.540
I think-- for the most part.

00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:11.490
So that's it.

00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:13.690
Now I will mention one
thing as a measure of that.

00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:16.222
I showed you the
marathon runners

00:49:16.222 --> 00:49:18.430
and how the difference
between the first and 20th guy

00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:20.490
has been declining over time.

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:22.840
We actually did a very similar
thing for money managers.

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:24.470
So what we do is we
take the standard--

00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:26.380
it's basically the standard
deviation of excess returns--

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:28.296
so it's what does the
bell-shaped distribution

00:49:28.296 --> 00:49:29.460
of returns look like.

00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:31.320
And what's happened
over the last 50 years

00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:32.520
is that it's got skinnier.

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:34.070
So the difference between
the very best and the average

00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:36.670
is less today than it was
a generation or two ago.

00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:39.221
So again, it is very
random, but it's not

00:49:39.221 --> 00:49:40.720
because there is
not a lot of skill.

00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:41.860
It's actually the opposite.

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:43.585
The skill is very
high but very uniform,

00:49:43.585 --> 00:49:44.920
is the way to think about that.

00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:48.500
And by the way, that's true
for athletics, too-- sports.

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:51.459
You might say that even the
World Cup-- these matches are--

00:49:51.459 --> 00:49:53.000
you can see the
probabilities are not

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.569
that high one way or the other.

00:49:54.569 --> 00:49:56.110
That certainly would
be no reflection

00:49:56.110 --> 00:49:57.700
of the skill of the players,
which is extraordinary.

00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:59.390
And certainly put any
one of those teams

00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:01.200
on the pitch versus
teams 20 years ago,

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:03.010
and they'd run
circles around them.

00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:04.970
It's that the skills
are evenly matched.

00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:07.106
And as a consequence, luck
determines the outcomes.

00:50:07.106 --> 00:50:07.730
Great question.

00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:09.794
Very important one.

00:50:09.794 --> 00:50:11.710
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
about the relationship

00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:16.945
between age and
cognitive ability.

00:50:16.945 --> 00:50:20.250
And you said that you picked
around 40, or 50, or something

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:21.550
like that.

00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:23.120
Warren Buffett is over 80.

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:26.850
Do you think he's not
as good as he was?

00:50:26.850 --> 00:50:28.840
This is the first question.

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.490
That is a fun question.

00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:32.970
The second one--
as you said, it's

00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:35.540
more and more
difficult to find out

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:37.280
who is a good value investor.

00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:44.834
But if you had to find one,
what would be a way to do it?

00:50:44.834 --> 00:50:46.000
MICHAEL MAUBOUSSIN: Awesome.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.020
Two excellent questions.

00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:48.520
Warren Buffett is,
I think-- look,

00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:51.830
I think that he's been pretty
much extraordinary at every age

00:50:51.830 --> 00:50:52.530
that he's been.

00:50:52.530 --> 00:50:54.070
So that's one thing.

00:50:54.070 --> 00:50:57.430
I think he's doing less
traditional money management--

00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:59.760
as we would say in running
a portfolio of stocks.

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:01.510
He's obviously now
much more capital

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:03.440
allocating for
Berkshire Hathaway.

00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:06.310
So I think that the game
has changed a little bit.

00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:08.710
But I do suspect--
I hate to say this--

00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:13.460
but I do suspect that he
might struggle competing

00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:17.488
with a 40-year-old version
of himself, I would guess.

00:51:17.488 --> 00:51:19.440
AUDIENCE: He also
has much more money.

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:20.670
MICHAEL MAUBOUSSIN: And he
has much more money to deploy.

00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:21.690
Yeah, that's right.

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:24.440
That also impedes
his performance.

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:26.312
The second part-- your
second question was?

00:51:26.312 --> 00:51:27.270
AUDIENCE: How to find--

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.550
MICHAEL MAUBOUSSIN: Oh, yeah.

00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:28.670
Value investors.

00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:31.920
So look, I think-- I'll mention
a couple things on this.

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:34.040
First of all, I think
that the characteristic

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:37.740
of many great value investors--
let me say it this way.

00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:40.600
There's a quote which
I love by a guy named

00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:43.500
Seth Klarman at Baupost, who
is one of the great value

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:44.450
investors.

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:47.940
And he says, value
investing is at its core

00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:50.480
the marriage between
a contrarian streak

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:52.615
and a calculator.

00:51:52.615 --> 00:51:53.490
So what does he mean?

00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:55.730
The contrarian streak, I
think, is the first element,

00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:59.790
which is the ability to go
against what everybody else is

00:51:59.790 --> 00:52:00.290
doing.

00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:01.665
So Buffett's got
this great line.

00:52:01.665 --> 00:52:04.220
It is, be fearful when others
are greedy and greedy when

00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:06.184
others are fearful.

00:52:06.184 --> 00:52:08.100
Let me just say this--
investing is inherently

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:10.290
a very social exercise.

00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:11.850
Very social.

00:52:11.850 --> 00:52:14.134
And it takes a
very unusual person

00:52:14.134 --> 00:52:15.800
who's willing to do
the opposite of what

00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:16.920
everybody else is doing.

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:18.690
So that's the first element.

00:52:18.690 --> 00:52:20.070
The problem is
being a contrarian

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:21.430
for the sake of being
a contrarian is not

00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:23.720
a very good idea because
sometimes the consensus is

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:24.502
right.

00:52:24.502 --> 00:52:26.960
In other words, if the movie
house is on fire, by all means

00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:27.860
run out the door.

00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:29.840
Don't--

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:32.090
So the calculator is
the second component,

00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:36.710
which says as a consequence of
everybody taking one view, that

00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:40.480
means a gap between
price and value opens up.

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:43.150
And so that becomes an
opportunity to invest.

00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:44.652
So the great value
investors I think

00:52:44.652 --> 00:52:46.860
are people with certain
characteristics-- personality

00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:47.850
characteristics.

00:52:47.850 --> 00:52:49.532
In part, they are
people who tend

00:52:49.532 --> 00:52:51.240
not to care about what
other people think

00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:52.800
about what they think.

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:55.397
And that's very rare in
the regular population.

00:52:55.397 --> 00:52:56.980
Most people are very
sensitive to what

00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:58.380
other people think about them.

00:52:58.380 --> 00:52:59.970
And then often
the organization--

00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:02.040
this question about Buffett
is a great question.

00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:04.290
Berkshire Hathaway is set
up as an organization that's

00:53:04.290 --> 00:53:06.600
very conducive to
quality decision making.

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:08.930
He's not influenced by a
lot of other pressures.

00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:11.100
Day-to-day business
pressures, for instance.

00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:14.179
So those would be
things I would look for.

00:53:14.179 --> 00:53:16.220
The main thing is this
ability to sort of operate

00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:19.545
independently of what
other people think.

00:53:19.545 --> 00:53:21.650
AUDIENCE: On the
[INAUDIBLE] a lot of people

00:53:21.650 --> 00:53:25.410
get the similar or the same
and they get a similar view.

00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:29.140
Instead of from one person
[INAUDIBLE] of luck.

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:33.360
Or if we look from outside and
see this is a collective view.

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:35.870
So would that actually the
collective view will actually

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:38.040
be determining this
instead of luck?

00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:39.886
MICHAEL MAUBOUSSIN:
Yeah, exactly.

00:53:39.886 --> 00:53:41.010
Super interesting question.

00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:44.450
So let me make sure that
I'm on the same page as you.

00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:45.932
But I would just
say that we talk

00:53:45.932 --> 00:53:48.140
a lot about this in the
context of market efficiency.

00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:49.598
And it relates even
to this comment

00:53:49.598 --> 00:53:52.372
about being a contrarian.

00:53:52.372 --> 00:53:54.830
Well, we can use more formal
language like complex systems.

00:53:54.830 --> 00:53:56.130
But let's just use a
more simple language

00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:57.296
like "The Wisdom of Crowds."

00:53:57.296 --> 00:54:00.764
So when are crowds wise
and when are crowds mad?

00:54:00.764 --> 00:54:02.180
Crowds tend to be
[INAUDIBLE] when

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:03.260
three conditions are in place.

00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:04.890
And Surowiecki wrote
about this in his book.

00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:06.750
One is diversity of
the underlying agents.

00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:08.940
So we need diversity
of points of view.

00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:12.270
The second is a properly
functioning aggregation

00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:12.770
mechanism.

00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:14.320
So you all have information
but I can bring it together

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:15.112
in one place.

00:54:15.112 --> 00:54:17.070
And the third is incentives,
which is basically

00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:19.460
rewards for being right and
penalties for being wrong.

00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:21.170
So when those three
things are in place,

00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:22.460
I can demonstrate
that I get actually

00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:24.700
very efficient economic
results and similar to what

00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:25.617
the textbooks predict.

00:54:25.617 --> 00:54:27.950
But what happens is when one
or more of those conditions

00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:30.150
are violated, then I get
these inefficiencies.

00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:31.100
And I think that's
why I mentioned

00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:32.200
those contrarian streaks.

00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:35.840
So when we all believe the
same thing, we lose diversity

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:38.090
and we get the
[INAUDIBLE] of crowds

00:54:38.090 --> 00:54:41.300
flips over to the
madness of crowds.

00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:42.530
You can read the annals.

00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:45.360
I mean, there are famous-- South
Sea Bubble, and Tulip Mania,

00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:48.340
I mean there are famous-- the
internet now, maybe housing.

00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:50.949
I mean there are some-- this
doesn't happen all that much.

00:54:50.949 --> 00:54:53.490
But it does happen and it can
be very epic in its proportion.

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:56.614
So that is a thing I
would say is, can we

00:54:56.614 --> 00:54:58.530
look for these so-called
diversity breakdowns.

00:54:58.530 --> 00:54:59.920
And for whatever
reason, everyone's

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:01.720
taking one side of the
trade over another.

00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:04.050
It could be mostly
psychological factors.

00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:06.342
But it could also be
technical factors.

00:55:06.342 --> 00:55:08.494
I own a portfolio that
has leverage against it.

00:55:08.494 --> 00:55:09.910
And now I'm getting
a margin call.

00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:11.701
So I have to sell things
because I have to.

00:55:11.701 --> 00:55:13.744
So it's not because I
want to, but I have to.

00:55:13.744 --> 00:55:15.410
So those things can
contribute, as well.

00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:16.909
So that's a very
excellent question.

00:55:16.909 --> 00:55:18.540
It's a very rich question.

00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:19.482
But that's the idea.

00:55:19.482 --> 00:55:21.940
So then you say, well, how do
skill and luck fit into that?

00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:22.606
I'm not so sure.

00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:27.610
That's where the great
investors take advantage.

00:55:27.610 --> 00:55:28.500
And that's where
it's the contrarian

00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:30.035
streak plus the calculators
taking advantage

00:55:30.035 --> 00:55:31.701
of these diversity
breakdowns in effect.

00:55:34.325 --> 00:55:35.450
AUDIENCE: My name is Bruno.

00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:37.840
And my question is, I
think it's safe to say

00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:42.040
that most of us in this room
are very-- try to be outliers,

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.160
try to be the best.

00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:47.060
And in that sense, it seems to
me that the take away from this

00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:50.240
is that I should try to be in
the group of the people who

00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:51.230
are the best.

00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:53.720
But like you said, that group
is getting bigger and bigger,

00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:56.136
and the standard deviation is
getting smaller and smaller.

00:55:56.136 --> 00:55:59.180
And after that I kind of
just have to hope for luck.

00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:02.940
And if that's the case, how do
you deal with this powerless

00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:07.446
feeling of I did my best, but
it's still not in my control?

00:56:07.446 --> 00:56:08.904
MICHAEL MAUBOUSSIN:
I mean, I don't

00:56:08.904 --> 00:56:09.830
know if you'd say
it's powerless.

00:56:09.830 --> 00:56:11.810
I think in some ways
it's liberating.

00:56:11.810 --> 00:56:13.320
You do the best you can.

00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:14.830
So I would say it this way.

00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:16.610
I would go backwards
and say, if you

00:56:16.610 --> 00:56:19.420
look at the most successful
people in the world--

00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:21.510
however you want to measure
that-- I think almost

00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:24.500
without fail you'd find
that they were incredibly

00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:25.359
lucky at some point.

00:56:25.359 --> 00:56:27.150
And by the way, in
chapter one of the book,

00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:29.260
I start with a story of--
you guys all know this.

00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:31.780
It's a famous
story in technology

00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:33.400
of Bill Gates and Gary Kildall.

00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:34.890
Do you guys know the
story about Gary Kildall?

00:56:34.890 --> 00:56:35.931
Does everybody know this?

00:56:35.931 --> 00:56:37.815
You don't know
the story of Gary.

00:56:37.815 --> 00:56:39.148
You know it, in the back, right?

00:56:39.148 --> 00:56:42.590
So if I get it wrong,
straighten me out on this.

00:56:42.590 --> 00:56:45.380
IBM launches a PC in
1980-- started the project

00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:46.830
in 1980, '81.

00:56:46.830 --> 00:56:48.870
And they need an
operating system.

00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:51.260
So it turns out
the chairman of IBM

00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:54.210
and Bill Gates' mother are
on the same United Way board.

00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:55.380
So that's a first start.

00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:56.310
She says, oh, my little Bill.

00:56:56.310 --> 00:56:58.110
He knows something
about those computers.

00:56:58.110 --> 00:56:59.680
You should go see him.

00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:02.960
The IBM teams flies to Microsoft
in Seattle to see Bill Gates.

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:05.440
By the way, they were
building cards for Apple IIs.

00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:07.362
It had nothing to do
with operating systems.

00:57:07.362 --> 00:57:09.820
And Bill Gates-- they say, do
you have an operating system?

00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:10.610
We're building this PC.

00:57:10.610 --> 00:57:11.270
It's all secret.

00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.980
Sign all these papers.

00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:13.590
And Bill Gates says,
no, I don't do that.

00:57:13.590 --> 00:57:15.340
This guy Gary Kildall
down at California--

00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:16.960
he's the guy that does this.

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:21.125
Gary Kildall's company had
80% market share for software

00:57:21.125 --> 00:57:22.210
for Intel chips.

00:57:22.210 --> 00:57:23.881
80% market share in 1980.

00:57:23.881 --> 00:57:24.380
Dominant.

00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:26.730
And he's considered the greatest
programmer of the 1970s.

00:57:26.730 --> 00:57:27.730
So they go down to Gary.

00:57:27.730 --> 00:57:29.590
This part of the story, no one
really knows what happened.

00:57:29.590 --> 00:57:31.270
But basically he
sort of blew off IBM.

00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:33.770
Like he either didn't show up
or didn't take them seriously.

00:57:37.382 --> 00:57:39.340
They kind of came to a
deal, but didn't really.

00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:41.550
Anyway, the IBM guys
were very dissatisfied.

00:57:41.550 --> 00:57:43.252
And he refused to
sign all their papers.

00:57:43.252 --> 00:57:44.585
So they go back up to Microsoft.

00:57:44.585 --> 00:57:47.270
And they go, Bill, this
guy didn't really help us.

00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:48.790
And Bill goes, I'll hook you up.

00:57:48.790 --> 00:57:52.860
So he goes across town and
he buys basically a knockoff

00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:55.000
of Kildall's product.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.260
Knock off for $50,000.

00:57:57.260 --> 00:58:00.555
And he called it MS
DOS, and he said,

00:58:00.555 --> 00:58:01.930
I'm going to sell
it to you, IBM.

00:58:01.930 --> 00:58:03.780
But I'm not going to sell it--
I'm going to license it to you.

00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:05.030
That was a genius.

00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:06.780
And from there-- right now.

00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:09.030
So the PC is now
getting ready to launch.

00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:10.760
When you bought
PCs back in 1981,

00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:12.790
you actually bought
the IBM machine

00:58:12.790 --> 00:58:14.670
and then you bought
the OS separately.

00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:16.420
It wasn't loaded on.

00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:19.390
So it turns out-- so Kildall
gets wind of this-- little Bill

00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:21.917
Gates is going to be selling
some operating system.

00:58:21.917 --> 00:58:24.250
So he calls up IBM and he
says, I thought we had a deal.

00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:25.916
They go, yeah, yeah,
OK, we have a deal.

00:58:25.916 --> 00:58:27.760
But it turns out, IBM
retained the rights

00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:30.320
to price the products.

00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:37.040
So when the first PC went
up for sale, MS DOS was $60.

00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:40.830
And Gary Kildall's
product was $240.

00:58:40.830 --> 00:58:42.420
So which one do you
think they bought?

00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:43.753
And that's the end of the story.

00:58:43.753 --> 00:58:46.150
So Gary Kildall ended
up-- and the story, it's

00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:47.500
an amazing story.

00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:49.854
By the way, Gary Kildall
was from Seattle.

00:58:49.854 --> 00:58:52.270
And it turns out, the story
ends that he went into a bar--

00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:54.604
a biker bar-- in
Monterey, California.

00:58:54.604 --> 00:58:56.020
No one really knows
what happened.

00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:58.070
But he got drunk, got
into either a fight

00:58:58.070 --> 00:59:03.060
or just fell down, hit his head
on the bar, and died at age 53.

00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:06.580
And so it's very--
you could say,

00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:08.910
could I have twisted that
story just a little bit

00:59:08.910 --> 00:59:10.912
and Gary Kildall
would be Bill Gates?

00:59:10.912 --> 00:59:13.120
Bill Gates would be still
super successful, I'm sure.

00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.820
But he wouldn't be
Bill Gates, right?

00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:15.903
So those are the examples.

00:59:15.903 --> 00:59:18.020
That's why I say, is
that liberating or not?

00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:19.110
I don't know if
that is or isn't.

00:59:19.110 --> 00:59:20.776
But my point is you
should do everything

00:59:20.776 --> 00:59:22.670
in your effort to succeed.

00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:25.170
But there's no one that
is a massive outlier that

00:59:25.170 --> 00:59:26.490
isn't lucky.

00:59:26.490 --> 00:59:28.250
It's almost, by
definition, can't be.

00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:29.340
If there's luck in
what you're doing,

00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:31.250
it's almost-- now
probably not so much true

00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:34.330
in things like athletics,
or music, or what have you,

00:59:34.330 --> 00:59:36.160
or if there's any
quantifiable way

00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:37.760
to measure people's performance.

00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:38.330
Less true.

00:59:38.330 --> 00:59:41.760
But when there are these
social processes kicking in.

00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:43.639
You know, JK Rowling.

00:59:43.639 --> 00:59:44.680
You guys know this story.

00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:46.990
Harry Potter was turned down
by nine or 10 publishers

00:59:46.990 --> 00:59:49.630
before someone grudgingly
willing to publish it.

00:59:49.630 --> 00:59:53.650
It's the greatest selling
novels of all time, right?

00:59:53.650 --> 00:59:55.310
I feel liberated
by it, actually.

00:59:55.310 --> 00:59:56.110
I think it's the other way.

00:59:56.110 --> 00:59:57.760
I feel the opposite,
which is if I do--

00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:59.070
and this is what I say
to my kids all the time.

00:59:59.070 --> 01:00:00.480
If you work as hard as
you can, the outcome

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:01.500
doesn't really matter.

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:04.121
You've done all you can do.

01:00:04.121 --> 01:00:04.620
The fates.

01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:05.536
The fates of the gods.

01:00:07.639 --> 01:00:09.930
AUDIENCE: My name is Timmy,
and I had a quick question.

01:00:09.930 --> 01:00:11.450
We talked about
business and sports,

01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:13.699
but I just want to talk a
little bit about leadership.

01:00:13.699 --> 01:00:16.650
And as someone who's high up in
a company like Credit Suisse,

01:00:16.650 --> 01:00:19.880
I'm sure when you guys
recruit talent and things like

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.900
that you're looking at
people who maybe have been

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:26.204
successful at leadership
maybe through their own skill.

01:00:26.204 --> 01:00:27.620
But are there
times-- where you're

01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.090
talking about the
interpreter-- that we always

01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:30.960
want to say it's
skill, that you're

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.210
seeing something that
maybe isn't pure skill

01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:34.000
and maybe is luck?

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.989
And how do you go about
hiring them or thinking

01:00:36.989 --> 01:00:38.030
about are they going to--

01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:39.004
MICHAEL MAUBOUSSIN:
Well, I don't

01:00:39.004 --> 01:00:40.120
think you want to hire
people who have been lucky,

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:42.550
but I think that that's
actually a huge business.

01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:44.050
This is a really
difficult question.

01:00:44.050 --> 01:00:46.190
And I have some thoughts
on leadership a little bit

01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:46.520
separate.

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.145
But let me just
mention a couple things

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:49.459
on being careful about this.

01:00:49.459 --> 01:00:51.750
There's a guy at Harvard
Business named Boris Groysberg

01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:54.570
who wrote a book
called "Chasing Stars."

01:00:54.570 --> 01:00:56.640
And what he actually
studied was this idea

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.610
of hiring stars from
other organizations

01:00:58.610 --> 01:00:59.751
to join your organization.

01:00:59.751 --> 01:01:01.250
And it turns out
that this turns out

01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:04.440
to be a very poor,
poor practice.

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:07.260
Most people don't-- their
skills don't translate from one

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:10.130
organization to another
very effectively.

01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:12.620
It's true less in athletics,
but even true in athletic.

01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:14.850
It's certainly true in
the world of business.

01:01:14.850 --> 01:01:19.020
So for example, they
followed 22 GE executives,

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:21.834
who are obviously trained to
be the top in great leadership.

01:01:21.834 --> 01:01:23.250
And they found
that when they went

01:01:23.250 --> 01:01:24.900
to other organizations that
were very similar to GE,

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:25.740
they tended to do well.

01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:27.948
But if they went to other
organizations that were not

01:01:27.948 --> 01:01:30.240
the same as GE, they tended
to flounder quite a bit.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:35.900
So we see this a lot in
the world of business.

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:38.137
It's hard for me--
what is leadership?

01:01:38.137 --> 01:01:40.470
To me the kinds of things
that are important in a leader

01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:42.939
is someone who-- and there
are different ways to lead.

01:01:42.939 --> 01:01:45.480
But a lot of it is I do think
is actually quite intellectual.

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:48.880
I think for me it's thinking
about things strategically.

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:52.150
It's being fact-based,
data-based,

01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:57.450
and setting a tone or
direction for an organization

01:01:57.450 --> 01:02:01.925
that people are
enthusiastic to follow.

01:02:01.925 --> 01:02:03.300
So those are the
kinds of things.

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:04.310
But it's very hard.

01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:05.685
I think it's very
hard to pin it.

01:02:05.685 --> 01:02:07.726
And the last thing I'll
say is-- and it goes back

01:02:07.726 --> 01:02:09.970
to the interpreter, which
you correctly drew out--

01:02:09.970 --> 01:02:11.240
By the way, there's
a great book which

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.031
I'd recommend to
everybody called "The Halo

01:02:13.031 --> 01:02:15.480
Effect" by a guy
named Phil Rosenzweig.

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:17.430
It's a very short
book-- 175 pages.

01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:20.670
But an incredibly
important set of lessons.

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:23.470
And what he says is basically,
when things are going well,

01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:25.010
the CEO walks on water.

01:02:25.010 --> 01:02:27.420
And when things are going
badly-- the same CEO,

01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:30.590
by the way-- may have no
idea what they're doing.

01:02:30.590 --> 01:02:35.380
I think we spin stories
to fit the narrative,

01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:39.559
or to fit the facts, that
are not always well-placed.

01:02:39.559 --> 01:02:41.100
AUDIENCE: I found
it very interesting

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.960
when you mentioned
that the talent

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:46.440
gap between the person who is
the first and the person who

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:49.255
is at 20th is narrowing.

01:02:49.255 --> 01:02:53.530
And in my head I was thinking,
what about the payoff

01:02:53.530 --> 01:02:55.610
gap between the two.

01:02:55.610 --> 01:02:59.940
If you compared the top guy
and the 20th guy 50 years ago

01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:03.860
versus now, now the gap is
huge, although the talent gap

01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:04.800
has narrowed down.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:06.370
It's sort of a paradox.

01:03:06.370 --> 01:03:08.390
And if seemed frustrating.

01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:08.660
MICHAEL MAUBOUSSIN:
I've actually

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:09.770
thought about
writing about this.

01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:11.700
I think it's an absolutely
fascinating thing.

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.324
And I think it's very
true, by the way.

01:03:13.324 --> 01:03:16.490
So I think that there is a huge,
huge payoff-- an increasing

01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:18.290
payoff-- to cognitive surplus.

01:03:18.290 --> 01:03:20.090
And I think technology
has accelerated that

01:03:20.090 --> 01:03:21.250
to a large degree.

01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:24.660
So in the book I mention this.

01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:28.050
There's a very famous paper that
was written more than 30 years

01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:31.540
ago by Sherwin Rosen called
"The Economics of Superstars."

01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:33.190
And what he argued
in that paper was

01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:35.690
that increasingly people who
are just a little bit better

01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:37.932
than others are getting
disproportionate payoffs.

01:03:37.932 --> 01:03:39.640
And it's more like
the tennis tournament.

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:42.270
You're getting
twice as much money.

01:03:42.270 --> 01:03:44.300
You guys all know
these data, right?

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:46.450
If you look at people with
very advanced degrees--

01:03:46.450 --> 01:03:49.000
master's versus college
degrees versus people

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.830
with no degrees-- the payoffs.

01:03:51.830 --> 01:03:54.584
But it's even within
those subsectors

01:03:54.584 --> 01:03:56.750
there are still very, very
substantial differentials

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:57.250
in pay.

01:03:59.417 --> 01:04:01.500
I think there's just going
to be-- and by the way,

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.350
I don't know how we stop this.

01:04:03.350 --> 01:04:06.500
I've been very influenced
by these books recently.

01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.910
"Average Is Over," and
"The Second Machine Age"

01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:11.340
by a couple of-- I
think they came here,

01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:13.800
actually-- MIT economists.

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:17.675
And those stories are-- there
are positives that technology

01:04:17.675 --> 01:04:19.350
is helping everybody's lives.

01:04:19.350 --> 01:04:21.000
I think in some ways
it's really great.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.030
So we all have access to
education and entertainment

01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:27.100
we may not have had cost
effectively in times past.

01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:29.470
But it does feel like the
payoff to cognitive abilities

01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:31.030
is really getting very skewed.

01:04:31.030 --> 01:04:33.230
I don't know what
stops or how it stops.

01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:35.230
Well, with that, thank
you so much for your time

01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:35.630
and attention.

01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:36.530
And have a great day.

01:04:36.530 --> 01:04:37.113
Appreciate it.

01:04:37.113 --> 01:04:39.576
