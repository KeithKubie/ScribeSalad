00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.140
ALBERT R. MEYER: Let's take
a quick look at some blunders

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.190
that people regularly
make in dealing

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.820
with asymptotic notation,
in particular with big O

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.670
notation, which tends
to confuse people.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.580
So the most important
thing to remember

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.540
is that this notation,
something equals O of something

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.680
else-- 1/x equals O of
1, say-- is actually

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.920
to be understood as just a
not such attractive notation,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.254
misleading notation for a binary
relation between two functions.

00:00:33.254 --> 00:00:34.920
This is supposed to
be a function there,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.753
and this is supposed
to be a function there.

00:00:36.753 --> 00:00:40.010
And this is saying that there's
a relation between the growth

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.850
rates of these two functions.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.860
O of f is not quantity.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.674
And you mustn't
treat it as such.

00:00:47.674 --> 00:00:49.590
So, for example-- and
the equality, of course,

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.890
is not an inequality.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.420
Once upon a time, we tried
to get the equality replaced

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.930
by an epsilon, which
makes much better sense--

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.960
that is, a membership symbol.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.970
But there was a sense that this
notation was so deeply embedded

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.459
in the mathematical culture--
multiple mathematical

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:09.290
communities-- that there was no
way we were going to change it.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.010
In particular, a confusion where
you think that that equality

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.210
sign means some
kind of an equality

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.860
is to write instead
of f equals O of g,

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.440
well, if f equals O of
g by symmetry, O of g

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.130
ought to equal f.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.240
Don't write that.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.910
The reason is that it's
a recipe for confusion,

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.380
because look at this.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.820
I know that x is
O of x trivially,

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.670
which would suggest
that O of x is

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.350
equal to x, if you
believe in symmetry

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.570
and you think of O of
x as being quantity.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.210
Well, remember,
though, that 2x is also

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.500
equal to O of x by
definition of O.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.490
So what we wind up with
is combining 2x equals

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.370
O of x with O of x equals x is
I get 2x is equal to this thing,

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.380
is equal to x.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.810
I conclude that 2x is equal
to x, which is absurd.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.180
So that's nonsense.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.370
It's the kind of
trouble that you

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.190
can get into if you start
thinking of this equality

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.760
as meaning equality
between two quantities,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.699
as opposed to just being a
part of the name of a relation.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.220
Another mistake that
people make is less serious

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.370
but it's sloppy, is
to think that big O

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.020
corresponds to a lower bound,
so that people will say things

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.410
like f is at least
O of n squared.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.330
Well, again, at
least O of n squared

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.170
is starting to treat O of
n squared like a quantity.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.370
You could say that f is
equal to O of n square,

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.720
but that means that n
squared is an upper bound

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.240
on f to within a constant
factor after a certain point.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.610
If you want to say intuitively
that n squared is a lower

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.980
bound on f, then
all you have to do

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.490
is say that n squared is O of f.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.250
And that is a proper use of
O of f of getting a lower

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.970
bound on a function, by
saying that the lower bound is

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:55.990
O of the function.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.360
Another example of
the kind of nonsense

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.270
that you see-- this is
a stretch, but let's

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.840
look at it as a reminder
of things not to do.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.110
I'm going to prove to you that
the sum from i equals 1 to n

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.390
of i-- that is that 1 plus 2
plus 3 up to n-- is O of n.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.640
Now, of course, it's not.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.530
We know that the
sum of the first n

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.470
integers n times
n plus 1 over 2,

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.850
which is O of n squared--
theta of n squared actually.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.660
So I'm going to prove
something false.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.690
Watch carefully how I do it.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.030
Here's the false proof.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.380
Let's, first of all, notice
that any constant is O of 1.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.810
So 0 is O of 1, 1 is O of
1, 2 is O of 1, and so on.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.460
Any constant function is O
of the constant function 1.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.720
OK, that's true.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.750
So that means that each i
in this sum, i is a number,

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.790
so that means it might be 1,
it might be 2, it might be 3,

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:56.640
it might be 50.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.080
Whatever it is, it's O of 1.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.255
And that means that I could
think of this sum from i

00:04:02.255 --> 00:04:06.940
equals 1 to n as O of 1
plus O of 1 plus O of 1.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.200
And that's, of course, n
times O of 1, which is O of n.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.190
Now, there's all kinds
of weird arithmetic

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.430
rules of things being used here,
none of which are justified.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.120
But it's just a heads up.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.829
You do see stuff like this
from inexperienced students.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.310
And I hope that you
won't fall into this kind

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.900
of a sloppy trap.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.840
O of something is
not a quantity.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.770
It's part of the
name of a relation.
