00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.004
( intro music )

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:10.176
( upbeat music )

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:14.714
Asher Jay:<i> For me it's about
 how can I get people</i>

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:18.218
<i> to feel that effortless
 connection to nature.</i>

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:20.386
<i> Technically speaking
 this is all part of our</i>

00:00:20.386 --> 00:00:22.021
<i> biological and evolutionary
 development.</i>

00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:23.623
<i> This is our story.</i>

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:27.860
<i> No matter
 what we do to the world</i>

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.064
<i> life still finds a way to
 express itself.</i>

00:00:32.064 --> 00:00:33.432
<i> That is pure magic to me.</i>

00:00:33.432 --> 00:00:35.635
<i> That is nature
 finding expression</i>

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:38.671
<i> against all the odds
 that we impress upon it.</i>

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:39.973
<i> That, to me, is hope.</i>

00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:46.413 line:0%
( applause )

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:49.381
People often ask me

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:51.918
if I find it to be a
bit of a contradiction,

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:54.020
being such an
impassioned advocate

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.490
for wilderness and wildlife,
yet choosing to reside

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.194
in the most curated habitat
for man, New York City.

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:04.296 line:0%
And I often reply to them,
'Not particularly so'

00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:07.166 line:0%
because, while I can understand
that living in a city

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.535 line:0%
easily allows people
to disengage themselves

00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:11.838
from the realities
of the world around them,

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:13.506
I think
it is the very same city

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:16.041
that has helped me find
this intrinsic connection,

00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:20.413
no matter how far removed I am
from nature, to nature.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:24.083
So when I walk home
from the gym

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:27.520
on a fine Friday evening
through Madison Square Park,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.156
the smallest patch of green
in New York,

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:34.794
and I encounter fireflies
flitting about at dusk,

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:36.162
that is pure magic to me.

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:38.364
That is nature,
finding expression

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:41.467
against all the odds
that we impress upon it.

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:42.902
That to me is hope.

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:45.738
And that shows me
that life is resilient

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:48.574
which inspires me
to do what I do.

00:01:48.574 --> 00:01:50.476
<i> So, when the
 BP oil-spill happened,</i>

00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:52.378
<i> I felt compelled
 to participate,</i>

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:54.413
<i> to take the dialogue
 a step further</i>

00:01:54.413 --> 00:01:57.150
<i> than just feeling
 like this passive voice</i>

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.818
<i> in a much larger system.</i>

00:01:58.818 --> 00:02:01.020
Because an individual does
have impact,

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.888
granted that it is...

00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:04.490
you know,
a small drop in the ocean

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.425
but every drop counts,
and I think together

00:02:06.425 --> 00:02:09.161
we build up
a much larger momentum.

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:11.430
And when the BP oil-spill
happened,

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.167
at that point I was at the
peak of my fashion career.

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:16.035
So, I had just launched
a label,

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:18.437
I wanted to take that
the next step forward,

00:02:18.737 --> 00:02:20.340
but then when this unfolded

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.974
I was just
completely debilitated.

00:02:21.974 --> 00:02:23.976
I was in my bed sobbing
for about a month

00:02:23.976 --> 00:02:27.113
and I realized that I couldn't
just go on with my life

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:29.115
turning a blind eye to
what was happening

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:32.551
in my immediate reality
and just being a victim

00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:35.087
to what seemed at that time
a failing system.

00:02:35.087 --> 00:02:36.989
Don't get me wrong, I still
think it's a failing system

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.725
but I feel like I have a
much larger voice and stake

00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:41.193
in what is happening around me

00:02:41.193 --> 00:02:43.596
simply on account of
taking responsibility.

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:44.964 line:0%
<i> And this particular work,</i>

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:46.999 line:0%
<i> along with six others
 that I created,</i>

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.535 line:0%
<i> cast light on
 how we fuel life with death.</i>

00:02:49.935 --> 00:02:52.037 line:0%
<i> And it was a way for me to
 condense information</i>

00:02:52.037 --> 00:02:54.574 line:0%
<i> and package it into
 the simplest format possible.</i>

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:56.276 line:0%
<i> Something that is
 two dimensional,</i>

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:58.410 line:0%
<i> contrast positive space
 with negative space,</i>

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.747 line:0%
<i> which is to say, you know,
 what remains,</i>

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:03.816 line:0%
<i> what's worth protecting and
 what has been lost forever.</i>

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:04.951 line:0%
Because unless you show people

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:06.786
what is there against
what isn't,

00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:07.886
there is no contrast,

00:03:07.886 --> 00:03:10.022
there's no understanding
of the baseline

00:03:10.022 --> 00:03:11.457
that has shifted,

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:12.892
which seems
the constant problem

00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:14.861
with the generation today.
They just don't know

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.129
that we have lost so much
in the last 10 years,

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.764
in the last 20 years.

00:03:18.764 --> 00:03:20.332
And when I created these works

00:03:20.332 --> 00:03:22.935
I decided to take that
leap of faith,

00:03:22.935 --> 00:03:25.037
which led me to Africa,

00:03:25.037 --> 00:03:27.540
and I spent the entire
two months that we were there

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.808
basically on a
one-woman crusade

00:03:29.808 --> 00:03:31.711
picking up garbage
everywhere I went.

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:33.245
And I would drop it off

00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:35.347
at different ranger posts
every evening.

00:03:35.347 --> 00:03:37.683
You do this for a week
and word travels,

00:03:37.683 --> 00:03:39.052
because the next thing I knew

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:41.019
when I was shifting
from one resort to the next,

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.988
people would call ahead
and tell them, like,

00:03:42.988 --> 00:03:45.024
'She is going to come and
inspect your sewage plan,

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:46.159
how you dispose of
your waste.

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.660
And she is going to take issue
with everything,

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.361
so be prepared,
she's coming over.'

00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:52.231
And so they would welcome me
and show me...

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:53.633
And they'd be, like,
'This is what you need to see'

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:54.968
and I'm like, 'No, I'm going to
do it on my terms

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:56.135
and I will see
what I want to see

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:57.203
when I want to see it.'

00:03:57.303 --> 00:04:00.272
But it is just the idea of
one person having that voice

00:04:00.272 --> 00:04:02.107
and that travelling within
two months

00:04:02.107 --> 00:04:04.310
across the board
in Tanzania and Kenya.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.846
So much so, people thought
I was the part of UN by then,

00:04:06.846 --> 00:04:08.047
that I was with--
affiliated with

00:04:08.047 --> 00:04:09.748
numerous other organizations,
that I was in

00:04:09.748 --> 00:04:12.084
on this, like,
insider conspiracy bust,

00:04:12.084 --> 00:04:15.087
and what that culminated in
was me coming back to New York

00:04:15.087 --> 00:04:16.488
with a whole lot of garbage,

00:04:16.488 --> 00:04:19.258
which was a really interesting
conversation with TSA.

00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:21.560
And I wound up,
you know,

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.130
clearing immigration somehow
and wound up in New York

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.431
and I used all this garbage
to create a line of artwork

00:04:26.431 --> 00:04:28.034
<i> called 'Shadowed Heirlooms'.</i>

00:04:28.034 --> 00:04:30.202
<i> And the entire series
 focused on</i>

00:04:30.202 --> 00:04:32.204
<i> how infrastructure growth
 and population growth</i>

00:04:32.204 --> 00:04:34.273
<i> was infringing upon
 wild habitat,</i>

00:04:34.273 --> 00:04:36.175
<i> and how all of the trees
 that I saw,</i>

00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:38.077
<i> the open grasslands
 that we think of</i>

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:39.512
<i> when we think of
 the dark continent</i>

00:04:39.512 --> 00:04:41.980
<i> and the lost wilderness
 of Africa,</i>

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.849
<i> is completely bestrewn
 and bejeweled</i>

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:47.052
<i> with plastic bags and
 consumers brand packaging</i>

00:04:47.052 --> 00:04:48.754
<i> from European and
 American markets.</i>

00:04:48.754 --> 00:04:50.589
So I would see L'Oreal,
I'd see Tampax,

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:53.526
I'd see diaper bags,
cosmetic companies...

00:04:53.893 --> 00:04:55.628
Things that you would
recognize from here

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.629
in Africa,
in the open grassland.

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:00.233
And zebras and giraffes
chewing on this.

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:01.434
And that's not
what you think of

00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:03.302
when you think of Africa
and that was such a shame

00:05:03.302 --> 00:05:05.171
and it really broke my heart.

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:06.739
And so I created this
line of work

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:08.474
which led me to meet
Louie Psihoyos

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:09.975
and Ric O'Barry
shortly after,

00:05:09.975 --> 00:05:12.078
like I said,
the path of least resistance,

00:05:12.078 --> 00:05:14.714
and that opened up
a whole different dialogue

00:05:14.714 --> 00:05:16.515
which was all about oceans
and what was happening

00:05:16.515 --> 00:05:20.419
to cetaceans being exploited
for a spectacle,

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.489
so this whole idea of
not just capturing dolphins

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:27.493
and orcas to show them
in these confined spaces

00:05:27.493 --> 00:05:30.162
where they are held for
long periods of time,

00:05:30.162 --> 00:05:32.798
completely abused
and out of context

00:05:32.798 --> 00:05:34.567
because they have
a large social context,

00:05:34.567 --> 00:05:36.201
these are highly sentient
beings,

00:05:36.201 --> 00:05:38.070
they know
how to relate on a,

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.173
like, a deep emotional level
and they live in a culture,

00:05:41.173 --> 00:05:43.041
sort of as how humans do.

00:05:43.041 --> 00:05:45.511
And to pull them out
of that whole context

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:47.646
and show them as
one off is not--

00:05:47.646 --> 00:05:49.815
is to take away
the very essence and spirit

00:05:49.815 --> 00:05:52.151
of that animal,
is to break that spirit.

00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:54.687
And so they're just shadows
of what cetaceans would be

00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:56.355
in the wild in captivity.

00:05:56.355 --> 00:05:58.824
So when you go to SeaWorld
and you support that show,

00:05:58.824 --> 00:06:00.493
you are not getting
any kind of education.

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:03.563
All you are seeing is an orca
that is not an orca any more,

00:06:03.563 --> 00:06:04.930
that has been
completely broken

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.467
in every form that's possible,
psychologically traumatized.

00:06:08.467 --> 00:06:11.103
And you are paying
a dollar for that

00:06:11.103 --> 00:06:12.471
and that's not okay.

00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:13.939
And if we don't
condone slavery,

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:16.142
and we don't condone this
sort of abuse in human beings,

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:18.677
we shouldn't being doing that
for other species.

00:06:18.677 --> 00:06:20.545
<i> So I decided to get involved
 with this whole campaign</i>

00:06:20.545 --> 00:06:22.014
<i> and created a series of works</i>

00:06:22.014 --> 00:06:23.749
<i> and once again trying
 to condense</i>

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:26.585
<i> and fold information into
 two-dimensional layouts</i>

00:06:26.585 --> 00:06:28.287
<i> that will
 immediately translate</i>

00:06:28.287 --> 00:06:30.756
<i> in a glimpse to
 largest audience possible.</i>

00:06:30.756 --> 00:06:32.424
<i> So this was as simple
 as interpreting</i>

00:06:32.424 --> 00:06:34.360
<i> what the Japanese flag
 would look like</i>

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.929
<i> by placing
 sort of a bloody spot</i>

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:39.432
<i> that's bleeding out
 in the center of the flag.</i>

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:41.934
<i> And that also spells the word
 'The Cove'.</i>

00:06:41.934 --> 00:06:44.971
And not only did I see
garbage unfolding in Africa

00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:47.473
but every time I went
scuba diving or snorkeling

00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:50.376
in any ecosystem,
all I encountered was plastic.

00:06:50.376 --> 00:06:52.911
So I started creating
these simple animations,

00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:54.614
this is the other aspect
of my career,

00:06:54.614 --> 00:06:55.848
that I haven't told
very many people,

00:06:55.848 --> 00:06:58.216
is that I don't know how to do
half of the things I do.

00:06:58.216 --> 00:07:00.585
And so when I wake up,
thank God for Google

00:07:00.585 --> 00:07:02.721
and thank God for, like,
'How To For Dummies'

00:07:02.721 --> 00:07:04.923
because if I didn't, like,
look up these, like,

00:07:04.923 --> 00:07:07.259
simple tutorials
there would be no way

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:08.894
in which I even knew
how to animate.

00:07:08.894 --> 00:07:11.597
So this particular animation
is one of my early animations,

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:13.632
just to connect
consumer choices

00:07:13.632 --> 00:07:15.467
and a simple thing such as

00:07:15.467 --> 00:07:16.835
acquiring a plastic bag
in your life

00:07:16.835 --> 00:07:19.338
and how that translates
into affecting

00:07:19.338 --> 00:07:22.008
a larger ecosystem
in our world.

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:25.878
( piano music)

00:08:22.368 --> 00:08:25.170
And so
as I was saying earlier with

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.205
life being resilient, I mean--

00:08:27.205 --> 00:08:28.574
And this is the other thing
I have to say

00:08:28.574 --> 00:08:31.444
about my life is that most of
the mail I get is just garbage

00:08:31.444 --> 00:08:33.379
and the one thing
that I got recently

00:08:33.379 --> 00:08:35.747
is a plastic bottle from
Long Island

00:08:35.747 --> 00:08:37.382
that was covered in barnacles.

00:08:37.382 --> 00:08:40.052
So this is once again
a sign of life being resilient.

00:08:40.052 --> 00:08:42.421
So, no matter what
we do to the world,

00:08:42.421 --> 00:08:46.092
life still finds a way to
express itself.

00:08:46.092 --> 00:08:48.293
All we need to do is
give it a chance.

00:08:48.293 --> 00:08:50.930
So, for me it's about
how can I get people

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.966
to feel that effortless
connection to nature.

00:08:53.966 --> 00:08:57.069
<i> And one of the things
 that I did is starting to</i>

00:08:57.069 --> 00:08:59.772
<i> embed data
 that is otherwise hard</i>

00:08:59.772 --> 00:09:03.142
<i> for a layperson to feel
 a visceral connection with,</i>

00:09:03.142 --> 00:09:04.843
<i> through what I can create.</i>

00:09:04.843 --> 00:09:07.480
<i> And this particular image
 is a time-face</i>

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.248
<i> because it shows you
 a boat at every hour,</i>

00:09:10.248 --> 00:09:11.583
<i> which shows you that
 exploitation</i>

00:09:11.583 --> 00:09:13.952
<i> occurs around the clock,
 day and night.</i>

00:09:13.952 --> 00:09:16.222
<i> But also the fact that
 there is pie chart</i>

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:18.724
<i> embedded within it
 through dotted black lines</i>

00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:21.360
<i> and only three percent of
 global fisheries</i>

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.062
<i> is in recovery.</i>

00:09:23.062 --> 00:09:26.365
<i> The rest of it is either
 moderately exploited,</i>

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:28.867
<i> heavily exploited or
 just going extinct,</i>

00:09:28.867 --> 00:09:30.536
<i> on the brink of extinction.</i>

00:09:30.536 --> 00:09:32.438
<i> That is not okay,
 especially when</i>

00:09:32.438 --> 00:09:34.439
<i> over one billion people
 in the world</i>

00:09:34.439 --> 00:09:36.808
<i> rely on fish
 as a protein source.</i>

00:09:36.808 --> 00:09:38.477
<i> And this particular image
 just shows you</i>

00:09:38.477 --> 00:09:39.778
<i> what's wrong with
 this picture.</i>

00:09:39.778 --> 00:09:41.747
<i> All of the life that is
 in the ocean</i>

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:43.248
<i> is actually on land.</i>

00:09:43.248 --> 00:09:45.651 line:0%
<i> Taking it a step further,
 getting people to connect</i>

00:09:45.651 --> 00:09:47.053 line:0%
<i> with the idea of barcodes.</i>

00:09:47.053 --> 00:09:48.921 line:0%
<i> You know, the fact that
 we slap on a barcode</i>

00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:52.024 line:0%
<i> onto any living creature
 and then selling it.</i>

00:09:52.024 --> 00:09:55.160 line:0%
<i> We sell everything
 we can get our hands on.</i>

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.328
And we say that--

00:09:56.328 --> 00:09:58.230
We somehow single out China
and say that

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.166
China is the one
who is doing this.

00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:02.234
It's not one nation,
it's not one type of people,

00:10:02.234 --> 00:10:03.635
we all do it.

00:10:03.635 --> 00:10:06.037
So, the other work
that I started creating,

00:10:06.037 --> 00:10:07.406
the other line of work
I started creating,

00:10:07.406 --> 00:10:08.907 line:0%
<i> is along the lines of
 climate change.</i>

00:10:08.907 --> 00:10:10.342 line:0%
<i> Because habitat loss</i>

00:10:10.342 --> 00:10:13.612 line:0%
<i> and the fact that weather
 patterns are shifting locally</i>

00:10:13.612 --> 00:10:16.848 line:0%
<i> is resulting in species
 migrating early</i>

00:10:16.848 --> 00:10:18.951 line:0%
<i> and not having the food supply
 they need</i>

00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:21.453 line:0%
<i> to nourish themselves so
 they can go to the next stop.</i>

00:10:21.453 --> 00:10:24.890 line:0%
<i> So it's like, along the way,
 the entire chain gets broken.</i>

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:26.291 line:0%
<i> And this particular work
 is about</i>

00:10:26.291 --> 00:10:28.627 line:0%
<i> how climate can march for
 itself, if it could,</i>

00:10:28.627 --> 00:10:31.630 line:0%
<i> but since it can't,
we need to take a stand for it.</i>

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:34.566
And, Climate March is not
just about climate.

00:10:34.566 --> 00:10:36.201
It's about biodiversity loss

00:10:36.201 --> 00:10:37.970
and decline of wildlife

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.005
in wilderness areas
around the world.

00:10:40.005 --> 00:10:42.574
And so rising sea levels
is not just a threat to us,

00:10:42.574 --> 00:10:45.377
it's the threat to
every type of organism,

00:10:45.377 --> 00:10:47.712
things that we have not even
discovered yet.

00:10:47.712 --> 00:10:50.282
<i> There are five species up
 top in the exclamation marks</i>

00:10:50.282 --> 00:10:51.751
<i> because they are
 recent discoveries.</i>

00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:53.953
<i> And beneath that is all
 the species we have known</i>

00:10:53.953 --> 00:10:55.688
<i> of that are in question,</i>

00:10:55.688 --> 00:10:57.489
<i> heading towards
 the brink of extinction.</i>

00:10:57.489 --> 00:10:58.557
<i> And in the last row you have</i>

00:10:58.557 --> 00:11:00.025
<i> species that have been
 driven to extinction</i>

00:11:00.025 --> 00:11:01.593
<i> in the last five years,</i>

00:11:01.593 --> 00:11:03.395
<i> including the Western
 Black Rhinoceros</i>

00:11:03.395 --> 00:11:05.297
<i> and the Javan Tiger.</i>

00:11:05.297 --> 00:11:06.865
<i> And this is the
 same fate that faces</i>

00:11:06.865 --> 00:11:09.034
<i> all the other megafauna
 in question.</i>

00:11:09.034 --> 00:11:11.103
<i> So then I decided
 to take the opportunity</i>

00:11:11.103 --> 00:11:13.072
<i> that was given to me
 to create a Fabergé egg,</i>

00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:16.675
<i> for the Big Egg Hunt
 to speak to these issues.</i>

00:11:16.675 --> 00:11:18.644
<i> and I created
 this particular image</i>

00:11:18.644 --> 00:11:20.880
<i> called the 'iStorm Egg',
 which shows you</i>

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.448
<i> a Sandy hurricane
 satellite image.</i>

00:11:23.448 --> 00:11:24.883
<i> It's the eye of the storm.</i>

00:11:24.883 --> 00:11:28.153
<i> And on top of that
 I've overlaid biodiversity,</i>

00:11:28.153 --> 00:11:29.955
<i> eyes of biodiversity
 from around the world,</i>

00:11:29.955 --> 00:11:31.557
<i> including human beings.</i>

00:11:31.557 --> 00:11:33.925
<i> So you see all these eyes
 staring back at you,</i>

00:11:33.925 --> 00:11:35.393
<i> they are silent witnesses</i>

00:11:35.393 --> 00:11:36.995
<i> to what's happening
 to their habitat,</i>

00:11:36.995 --> 00:11:38.397
<i> to the world around them.</i>

00:11:38.397 --> 00:11:39.698
<i> And this particular egg,</i>

00:11:39.698 --> 00:11:41.300
<i> I'm actually going to
 build on it further.</i>

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:42.934
Because one of the things
I think that's lacking

00:11:42.934 --> 00:11:45.237
is that we think
'It's going to be okay.'

00:11:45.237 --> 00:11:46.605
That somehow we are
going to get through this,

00:11:46.605 --> 00:11:48.374
technology will come up
with an answer.

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:50.242
There's some shortcut
that we are going to hit.

00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:51.409
There isn't going to be any.

00:11:51.409 --> 00:11:52.678
And unless we understand that

00:11:52.678 --> 00:11:55.881
this distant cataclysmic
future is a closer reality,

00:11:55.881 --> 00:11:57.983
something that's palpable
in the immediate future,

00:11:57.983 --> 00:11:59.051
we are never going to
really get down

00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:00.218
to doing something about it.

00:12:00.218 --> 00:12:02.454
So, one of the ideas
we're bouncing around

00:12:02.454 --> 00:12:04.223
with a whole bunch of people

00:12:04.223 --> 00:12:06.891
is this idea of creating
a black box,

00:12:06.891 --> 00:12:08.627
a sensory depravation chamber.

00:12:08.627 --> 00:12:10.696
And within the black box
I'm going to place this egg

00:12:10.696 --> 00:12:12.564
and have an immersive
soundtrack

00:12:12.564 --> 00:12:14.099
that is going to
basically be

00:12:14.099 --> 00:12:16.201
different audio channels
of wild calls.

00:12:16.201 --> 00:12:18.637
And the closer
a person gets to the egg,

00:12:18.637 --> 00:12:21.907
the more those wild calls
will start diminishing.

00:12:21.907 --> 00:12:23.875
And then you'll have
that being replaced

00:12:23.875 --> 00:12:25.745
by anthropogenic noise.

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.646
And there's going to be
a tipping point in place,

00:12:27.646 --> 00:12:29.481
so when there's enough
anthropogenic noise

00:12:29.481 --> 00:12:31.817
replacing the audio channels
of wild calls,

00:12:31.817 --> 00:12:34.319
it's going to trigger
a hurricane.

00:12:34.319 --> 00:12:36.122
So you realize that
it's your interaction

00:12:36.122 --> 00:12:38.390
with that egg that's resulting
in that hurricane.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.659
And the other aspect of this
is also going to be that

00:12:40.659 --> 00:12:42.594
there's going to be a video
installation along the walls.

00:12:42.594 --> 00:12:44.630
So I'm going to place
an entire track

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:47.099
of eyes opening and closing
from around the world.

00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:49.368
And those too will go...

00:12:49.368 --> 00:12:51.536
dark as we get
closer to the egg

00:12:51.536 --> 00:12:53.172
and as you're triggering
the hurricane.

00:12:53.172 --> 00:12:55.374
Ultimately resulting in a
completely black chamber

00:12:55.374 --> 00:12:57.342
devoid of sound,
devoid of life.

00:12:57.342 --> 00:12:58.910
And that's what
we are resulting in.

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:00.345
So, I think if you are
in that space,

00:13:00.345 --> 00:13:01.479
for even a moment,

00:13:01.479 --> 00:13:03.115
you are going to realize
that that dead-zone

00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:04.216
was created by you,

00:13:04.216 --> 00:13:05.250
and that's the kind of
dead-zone

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.119
you are perpetuating
in the world around you.

00:13:07.586 --> 00:13:09.320
So, that has led me because--

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.156
since I don't say no
to any of the issues,

00:13:11.156 --> 00:13:13.525
it keeps leading me
further down the rabbit hole.

00:13:13.525 --> 00:13:15.294
And this stumble has led me to

00:13:15.294 --> 00:13:16.762
the Denver Ivory Crush,

00:13:16.762 --> 00:13:18.630
which the whole intent
behind it

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.766
was to 'destroy'
the stockpile.

00:13:20.766 --> 00:13:21.834
And I put that within quotes

00:13:21.834 --> 00:13:24.035
because that's not
what has happened, eventually.

00:13:24.035 --> 00:13:26.872
They recently announced
a design challenge,

00:13:26.872 --> 00:13:28.807
a call to artists
and designers

00:13:28.807 --> 00:13:32.110
to create something
out of this crushed ivory.

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:35.681
And many people, including me,
back when I went to it,

00:13:35.681 --> 00:13:37.583
I thought when they were
going to crush the ivory,

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:39.551
that it was going to be
completely powdered, like--

00:13:39.551 --> 00:13:41.186
like utterly destroyed.

00:13:41.186 --> 00:13:42.387
And that's not what happened.

00:13:42.387 --> 00:13:43.688
You have giant shards of ivory

00:13:43.688 --> 00:13:45.256
that can still be used
for something.

00:13:45.256 --> 00:13:47.226
So anything that's cast
out of this material

00:13:47.226 --> 00:13:48.393
is still going to look
beautiful,

00:13:48.393 --> 00:13:50.128
even though they say it's
'educational',

00:13:50.128 --> 00:13:51.296
which by the way
is going to be

00:13:51.296 --> 00:13:52.297
the next big loophole

00:13:52.297 --> 00:13:54.566
that Asian markets
are going to exploit.

00:13:54.566 --> 00:13:56.067
'Educational use of ivory.'

00:13:56.067 --> 00:13:58.103
I mean, how are you going to
define that in other markets?

00:13:58.103 --> 00:14:01.239
It's hard enough to regulate
this illicit trade,

00:14:01.239 --> 00:14:03.342
a trade that basically allows

00:14:03.342 --> 00:14:05.310
for death to perpetrate
en masse.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.712
50,000 elephants culled a year

00:14:07.712 --> 00:14:10.949
for this particular product
that is not even really needed

00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:13.118
in any capacity
by human beings.

00:14:13.118 --> 00:14:15.387
It doesn't-- It's not integral
to our survival.

00:14:15.387 --> 00:14:18.256
And the other thing with that
is the ban and the moratorium.

00:14:18.256 --> 00:14:19.724
When you have a moratorium
in place,

00:14:19.724 --> 00:14:21.593
all it says is the market is
closed for now

00:14:21.593 --> 00:14:22.961
and the doors will open
eventually.

00:14:22.961 --> 00:14:24.930
So, the prices will
build in the meanwhile.

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:26.698
And you can just hold on
to your stockpile

00:14:26.698 --> 00:14:29.000
and release it
when the time is right.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.903
And with a ban, it says,

00:14:30.903 --> 00:14:33.205
'You made a ( bleep )
investment, this is over.

00:14:33.205 --> 00:14:34.973
Get over yourself'
And it's done.

00:14:34.973 --> 00:14:36.375
You know, we are not going to
kill any more elephants

00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:37.809
for this ridiculous trade.

00:14:37.809 --> 00:14:39.444
Right now, the trade,
what it's doing

00:14:39.444 --> 00:14:41.513
is infringing upon
not only their habitat

00:14:41.513 --> 00:14:44.883
but also killing
the individuals that are part--

00:14:44.883 --> 00:14:46.317
An integral part of

00:14:46.317 --> 00:14:48.586
a functioning society
of elephants.

00:14:48.586 --> 00:14:51.290
So, that results
in a loss of information

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.692
being handed down from
generation to generation.

00:14:53.692 --> 00:14:55.360
So all you are looking at
when you look at a herd

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:59.097
when you go on safari now
is sub-adults and their calves.

00:14:59.097 --> 00:15:00.632
It's like looking at
teenage mothers

00:15:00.632 --> 00:15:02.634
with kids and they don't know
what to do with them.

00:15:02.634 --> 00:15:04.202
And that's not
an 'elephant' society,

00:15:04.202 --> 00:15:05.337
that's not an elephant herd

00:15:05.337 --> 00:15:08.006
as it used to be 50 years ago
or 100 years ago.

00:15:08.006 --> 00:15:09.407
<i> So when people come up
 to me and say,</i>

00:15:09.407 --> 00:15:10.776
<i> you know, 'What do I do
 with the piece of ivory</i>

00:15:10.776 --> 00:15:11.777
<i> that I have in my house?</i>

00:15:11.777 --> 00:15:13.745
<i> A belt-buckle or a statue,
 you know,</i>

00:15:13.745 --> 00:15:15.347
<i> it's like the entire
 fur argument.</i>

00:15:15.347 --> 00:15:16.681
<i> If you don't destroy it,</i>

00:15:16.681 --> 00:15:18.283
<i> you have it in your house
 in any capacity,</i>

00:15:18.283 --> 00:15:20.352
<i> whether it's pre-moratorium
 or post-moratorium,</i>

00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:21.453
<i> it doesn't matter.</i>

00:15:21.453 --> 00:15:23.122
<i> Because ultimately
 what you're doing</i>

00:15:23.122 --> 00:15:25.957
<i> is saying that it's okay
 to have ivory in some way.</i>

00:15:25.957 --> 00:15:27.493
That it's okay to encourage

00:15:27.493 --> 00:15:29.361
the death of an elephant
for this.

00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:31.029
And that's not okay.

00:15:31.029 --> 00:15:33.465
Because when you wear
fur from the past,

00:15:33.465 --> 00:15:35.334
you are saying it's okay
to scale up demand

00:15:35.334 --> 00:15:36.902
in the present
for that product.

00:15:36.902 --> 00:15:40.238
A product that is not
integral to our survival.

00:15:40.238 --> 00:15:41.673
And so with the
Ivory Crush now

00:15:41.673 --> 00:15:44.342
I'm trying to suggest
that we cremate

00:15:44.342 --> 00:15:46.744
the crushed raw material

00:15:46.744 --> 00:15:48.847
and use the cremated material

00:15:48.847 --> 00:15:50.348
to cast a memorial

00:15:50.348 --> 00:15:52.784
instead of creating
a sculpture of any sort.

00:15:52.784 --> 00:15:53.952
Because with a memorial

00:15:53.952 --> 00:15:55.954
at least you have a space
where people could come to,

00:15:55.954 --> 00:15:57.222
to mourn loss

00:15:57.222 --> 00:15:59.491
as opposed to just looking at
something that's beautiful

00:15:59.491 --> 00:16:01.560
and supposedly educational.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.929
And, it's like how do you use
the right vocabulary

00:16:03.929 --> 00:16:05.230
to reach a new demographic,

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:06.765
because there's no
point preaching to the choir.

00:16:06.765 --> 00:16:08.200
And for that you need to
figure out

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.001
how you package
your information

00:16:10.001 --> 00:16:11.403
and what you're trying to
say through it.

00:16:11.403 --> 00:16:12.904
So, this particular work...

00:16:12.904 --> 00:16:15.074
it's a peek-preview,
it's not released yet.

00:16:15.074 --> 00:16:17.709
And I started working with
Dereck and Beverly Joubert,

00:16:17.709 --> 00:16:19.645
who are
Explorers-in-Residence here,

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:21.913
to cast a light
on what's happening to rhinos

00:16:21.913 --> 00:16:23.114
in Kruger National Park,

00:16:23.114 --> 00:16:25.750
which is a high
poaching incidence area.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.220
And we are trying to currently
translocate 100 Rhinos

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.889
from Kruger to Botswana.

00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:33.892
And so this particular
animation

00:16:33.892 --> 00:16:37.162
is going to cast a light on
how we can go about,

00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:40.666
you know, funding and helping
their efforts on the fields.

00:16:44.002 --> 00:16:47.506 line:0%
( rhinoceros sounds )

00:16:50.042 --> 00:16:51.776 line:0%
( gun shots )

00:16:51.776 --> 00:16:54.747 line:0%
( rhinoceros whining )

00:16:59.551 --> 00:17:01.387 line:0%
( gun shot )

00:17:05.991 --> 00:17:09.928
( rhinoceros sounds )

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:15.400
So reinterpreting
the rhino out of the I/O icon

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.701
reaches engineers.

00:17:16.701 --> 00:17:19.337
Like my roommate's boyfriend
who came into the room,

00:17:19.337 --> 00:17:22.274
for the first time in his life
was suddenly awakened

00:17:22.274 --> 00:17:24.943
and, like, was actively
engaged by

00:17:24.943 --> 00:17:26.345
what was happening to rhinos
for the first time.

00:17:26.345 --> 00:17:27.646
He's asking me
information about

00:17:27.646 --> 00:17:30.015
what was happening to rhinos
in Kruger National Park.

00:17:30.015 --> 00:17:32.684
<i> With this particular image
 I tried to get the cat</i>

00:17:32.684 --> 00:17:35.120
<i> to stare back, to connect
 to the audience member,</i>

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.754
<i> to the viewer.</i>

00:17:36.754 --> 00:17:39.891
<i> It's about extending
 what the cat can do for itself</i>

00:17:39.891 --> 00:17:41.927
<i> because its voice--
 It has a voice.</i>

00:17:41.927 --> 00:17:43.061
<i> They're not voiceless,</i>

00:17:43.061 --> 00:17:44.762
<i> it's just that
 we're not listening.</i>

00:17:44.762 --> 00:17:46.765
And with big cats in specific,

00:17:46.765 --> 00:17:48.400
it has become a
recent passion of mine simply

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.169
because of the way
in which we have allowed

00:17:50.169 --> 00:17:52.203
for lot things to happen
with them.

00:17:52.203 --> 00:17:54.973
<i> And now this model
 is being suggested</i>

00:17:54.973 --> 00:17:58.609
<i> as a replicable model for
 rhinos and other species.</i>

00:17:58.609 --> 00:18:00.678
<i> To farm tigers is not okay.</i>

00:18:00.678 --> 00:18:03.048
<i> To farm any wildlife
 is not okay.</i>

00:18:03.048 --> 00:18:05.617
And we are just standing by,
as China continues to have

00:18:05.617 --> 00:18:09.555
tiger farms upon tiger farms.
Thailand. Vietnam.

00:18:09.555 --> 00:18:13.257
And they have 5,000 tigers
in captivity right now.

00:18:13.257 --> 00:18:15.594
And they are kept in
appalling conditions.

00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:17.262
Like sardines in a can.

00:18:17.262 --> 00:18:18.530
So, this particular trade

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.699
for tiger bone wine
and tiger bone cake

00:18:20.699 --> 00:18:22.801
has become a recent
focus of mine.

00:18:22.801 --> 00:18:24.369
Simply because it's not
just about tigers,

00:18:24.369 --> 00:18:27.306
they're also harvesting
lions in Africa

00:18:27.306 --> 00:18:28.774
for the bone trade.

00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:31.009
And neither of these things
have any medicinal value,

00:18:31.009 --> 00:18:33.044
has any kind of value
for the human being.

00:18:33.044 --> 00:18:34.546
And, honestly speaking,

00:18:34.546 --> 00:18:36.514
every single thing
that we create

00:18:36.514 --> 00:18:40.184
can have a synthetic version,
that is generated in a lab,

00:18:40.184 --> 00:18:41.652
because we're capable
of innovation

00:18:41.652 --> 00:18:43.055
so it's really discrediting us

00:18:43.055 --> 00:18:45.156
and our ability to be
the 'intelligent' species.

00:18:45.156 --> 00:18:46.891
We're not being
intelligent at all.

00:18:46.891 --> 00:18:48.960
And every tiger is perfect.
It has to be.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.996
Because it's the only way that
it's going to function

00:18:50.996 --> 00:18:53.097
in the ecosystem
it was born for.

00:18:53.097 --> 00:18:55.367
To predate and do
what a tiger can,

00:18:55.367 --> 00:18:56.902
only a tiger can do.

00:18:56.902 --> 00:18:59.638
And so to take that
away from a tiger,

00:18:59.638 --> 00:19:02.340
by replacing the stripes
with bars

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.142
<i> and placing it
 behind those bars</i>

00:19:04.142 --> 00:19:06.144
<i> is to break
 the very essence of a tiger</i>

00:19:06.144 --> 00:19:07.979
<i> just as we broke
 the essence of an orca</i>

00:19:07.979 --> 00:19:09.981
<i> by placing it within a tank.</i>

00:19:09.981 --> 00:19:12.016
And to take that
a step further,

00:19:12.016 --> 00:19:14.285
talking about how species
connect to the land

00:19:14.285 --> 00:19:17.689
and how they sculpt and change
the fabric of that land.

00:19:17.689 --> 00:19:19.558
And how that land
ties back into

00:19:19.558 --> 00:19:21.560
the essence and
core of a tiger.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.061
It's back and forth.

00:19:23.061 --> 00:19:24.696
There is a give and take
in that relationship,

00:19:24.696 --> 00:19:26.164
which we don't
understand at all.

00:19:26.164 --> 00:19:28.032
So we think we can play,

00:19:28.032 --> 00:19:30.401
sort of, God
for the entire context, right?

00:19:30.401 --> 00:19:32.137
We can pull things out,
put things in,

00:19:32.137 --> 00:19:34.172
shoot things down.
It's all good,

00:19:34.172 --> 00:19:35.707
it will recover,
it will figure itself out

00:19:35.707 --> 00:19:37.876
because we know best.
But we don't know anything.

00:19:37.876 --> 00:19:40.278
And we don't have the humility
to acknowledge that.

00:19:40.278 --> 00:19:42.280
<i> So this particular work
 once again cast a light</i>

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.116
<i>on, sort of, how the ecosystem,
 the Savannah,</i>

00:19:45.116 --> 00:19:48.286
<i> the grassland is an implicit
 part of a lion's soul.</i>

00:19:48.286 --> 00:19:49.954
<i> Soul is a very tricky term
 to use</i>

00:19:49.954 --> 00:19:51.322
<i> because it has
 religious connotations</i>

00:19:51.322 --> 00:19:53.759
<i> but like there is a
 larger sense of self and being</i>

00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:56.628
<i> within an animal that
 should be acknowledged.</i>

00:19:56.628 --> 00:20:00.365
<i> And tying that back
 into the idea of, you know,</i>

00:20:00.365 --> 00:20:03.534
<i> are we willing to be
 clear in our communication</i>

00:20:03.534 --> 00:20:06.037
<i> about how we
 grant certain rights</i>

00:20:06.037 --> 00:20:08.440
<i> and personhood to ourselves,
 even to our corporations,</i>

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.842
<i> but not willing to extend that
 towards animals.</i>

00:20:10.842 --> 00:20:14.178
<i> We keep them in vertical bars,
 in vertical stripes,</i>

00:20:14.178 --> 00:20:17.115
<i> but we keep horizontal stripes
 and freedom for ourselves.</i>

00:20:17.115 --> 00:20:18.683
And why is that?

00:20:18.683 --> 00:20:20.718
Why do we have this
bifurcated view

00:20:20.718 --> 00:20:23.955
of how we associate
with our own selves?

00:20:23.955 --> 00:20:25.724
Because, technically speaking,

00:20:25.724 --> 00:20:27.059
this is all part of
our biological

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:29.360
and evolutionary development,
this is our story.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.062
And we're just fragmenting
parts of our selves

00:20:31.062 --> 00:20:32.630
and saying that we can't
afford those rights

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:34.532
and extend those rights
to other beings.

00:20:34.532 --> 00:20:36.301
And that's just incomplete
as a picture.

00:20:36.868 --> 00:20:38.069
<i> So these images again
 show that</i>

00:20:38.069 --> 00:20:40.105
<i> we've taken the voice away
 from wildlife</i>

00:20:40.105 --> 00:20:42.006
<i> but we managed to take a stand
 for ourselves.</i>

00:20:42.006 --> 00:20:44.442
<i> So everything happens
 in relation to us.</i>

00:20:44.442 --> 00:20:46.310
<i> And currently
 there is a court case going on</i>

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:48.379
<i> to basically cast a light
 on the need</i>

00:20:48.379 --> 00:20:50.315
<i> to impart rights to animals.</i>

00:20:50.315 --> 00:20:52.417
<i> At least to certain animals
 that have been proved</i>

00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:54.019
<i> to have higher
 cognitive function.</i>

00:20:54.019 --> 00:20:56.654
<i> So, cetaceans, elephants
 and great apes.</i>

00:20:56.654 --> 00:21:00.125
<i> So this is about giving
 equality to both man and ape.</i>

00:21:00.125 --> 00:21:01.726
<i> And the reason
 why I did it in blue and red</i>

00:21:01.726 --> 00:21:03.762
<i> is for the Republican
 and Democratic vote.</i>

00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:06.464
<i> And the image
 to the other side is called</i>

00:21:06.464 --> 00:21:08.767
<i> 'Deep Rooted Truths'.
 Because it connects us</i>

00:21:08.767 --> 00:21:12.137
<i> to the tree of life and
 also to the DNA,</i>

00:21:12.137 --> 00:21:14.939
<i> the helix,
 that shows our evolution</i>

00:21:14.939 --> 00:21:16.174
<i> and how we connect to nature</i>

00:21:16.174 --> 00:21:18.042
<i> on, sort of, an inherent
 cellular level.</i>

00:21:18.042 --> 00:21:20.478
<i> And that we are in balance
 with a much larger system,</i>

00:21:20.478 --> 00:21:22.314
<i> if we choose to be.</i>

00:21:22.314 --> 00:21:23.981
<i> And this particular image,
 I actually created</i>

00:21:23.981 --> 00:21:25.183
<i> as part of this same series.</i>

00:21:25.183 --> 00:21:26.718
<i> You will notice
 the same colors,</i>

00:21:26.718 --> 00:21:28.686
<i> you know, trickling through
 and trickling across.</i>

00:21:28.686 --> 00:21:30.222
<i> And the reason
 why I created this was</i>

00:21:30.222 --> 00:21:32.123
<i> because I went on a dive
 in Isla Mujeres</i>

00:21:32.123 --> 00:21:33.558
and I saw 'Silent Evolution',

00:21:33.558 --> 00:21:35.193
which is an artwork
of sculptures

00:21:35.193 --> 00:21:36.828
that have been dropped
into the ocean

00:21:36.828 --> 00:21:40.131
and the bio-rock allows for
corals to grow on it.

00:21:40.131 --> 00:21:42.868
And I love the way in which
life found expression again

00:21:42.868 --> 00:21:45.736
on a human form and
extended from the human form

00:21:45.736 --> 00:21:48.306
and reached back into
its ecosystem.

00:21:48.306 --> 00:21:50.174
And interacted with
other species.

00:21:50.174 --> 00:21:51.809
So I found this way of showing

00:21:51.809 --> 00:21:53.278
that we're all
made of the same stuff

00:21:53.278 --> 00:21:55.012
and that we all flow in and
out of one another,

00:21:55.012 --> 00:21:56.514
if only we were awake for it.

00:21:57.415 --> 00:21:59.317
And tying that further
into the cladogram,

00:21:59.317 --> 00:22:01.552
<i> so it's, sort of, our lineage
 and our larger story.</i>

00:22:01.552 --> 00:22:04.556
<i> So this is where we come from.
 This is who we are.</i>

00:22:04.556 --> 00:22:07.092
<i> And if it was a
 part of our past,</i>

00:22:07.092 --> 00:22:09.093
<i> it should be part of our
 present and future.</i>

00:22:09.093 --> 00:22:11.829
<i> And so by granting
 these rights to wild,</i>

00:22:11.829 --> 00:22:14.265
<i> what we're doing is
acknowledging who we really are.</i>

00:22:14.265 --> 00:22:17.569
<i> And granting those rights
 in its entirety to ourselves.</i>

00:22:17.569 --> 00:22:19.404
In the end I think
the reason why I do

00:22:19.404 --> 00:22:21.639
everything that I do
is because I want to

00:22:21.639 --> 00:22:24.676
influence the one thing
that I know will have impact

00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:27.379
on nature and the fate of
nature going forward.

00:22:27.379 --> 00:22:28.846
And that's you.

00:22:28.846 --> 00:22:31.015
So if you don't hold
yourselves accountable

00:22:31.015 --> 00:22:33.518
and you don't plug yourselves
into this dialogue,

00:22:33.518 --> 00:22:35.553
there is no hope.
You can have numerous people,

00:22:35.553 --> 00:22:37.755
coming up here and
giving these speeches,

00:22:37.755 --> 00:22:39.324
but that doesn't translate
into anything,

00:22:39.324 --> 00:22:41.326
unless you yourself
get involved.

00:22:41.326 --> 00:22:44.629
And stop part-timing
conservation.

00:22:44.629 --> 00:22:46.264
Thank you.

00:22:46.264 --> 00:22:48.867
( applause )

00:22:48.867 --> 00:22:52.404
( outro music )
