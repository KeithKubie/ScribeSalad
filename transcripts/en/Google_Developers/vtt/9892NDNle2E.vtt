FLORINA MUNTENESCU: Hello.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.720
I'm Florina Muntenescu
for The Developer Show.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.210
This is your weekly update
on the coolest developer

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.190
news from Google.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.790
A stable release of Android
Studio 3.3 is now available.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.700
And it's focused on
refinement and quality.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.870
Included in the release
are a Kotlin update,

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.714
a new project wizard update,
the navigation editor, and more.

00:00:21.714 --> 00:00:23.380
Check out the posting
in the description

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.510
below for the full
list of updates,

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.920
some screenshots, and
a link to download.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.940
64-bit CPUs deliver
faster, richer experiences

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.090
for your users.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.870
And we want to help
you get ready for them.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.630
So we recently provided
more detailed information

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.915
and timelines to make it as
easy as possible to transition

00:00:42.915 --> 00:00:44.710
in 2019.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.930
Take a look at the post
for all the details.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.980
GO-JEK and Google
Cloud have recently

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.100
announced the release of
Feast, an open-source feature

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.670
store that allows themes to
manage, store, and discover

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.690
features for use in
machine learning projects.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.180
A link to the GitHub
repo is on the post.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.450
Support for Go on Cloud
Functions is now even better.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.840
The runtime uses the
latest version, Go 1.11,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.400
which includes new
language features

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.400
like modules for integrating
third-party dependencies

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.870
into your code.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.010
Example code and the link to
the Quick Start are on the post.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.940
Nvidia's newest data
center GPU, the Telsa T4,

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.970
is now available publicly
in beta on the Google Cloud

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.280
Platform in Brazil, India,
Netherlands, Singapore,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.820
Tokyo, and the United States.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.030
Links to get started
are on the post.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.890
In collaboration
with UC Berkeley,

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.010
we recently released
Soft Actor-Critic,

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.890
a stable and efficient
deep reinforcement learning

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.040
algorithm suitable for
real-world robotics

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.180
skill learning.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.720
It's efficient enough to
solve real-world robot tasks

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.980
in only a handful of hours.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.060
And it also works on a
variety of environments

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.150
with a single set of
[INAUDIBLE] parameters.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.730
Take a look at the post for
the research behind Soft

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.530
Actor-Critic and also some
of our recent experiments.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.710
We are searching for open-source
projects and organizations

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.490
to participate in the 15th
annual Google Summer of Code,

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.950
a global program that
draws university student

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.960
developers from around the world
to contribute to open source.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.070
The deadline to apply is
February 6 at 8:00 PM UTC.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.530

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.740
I got the giggles.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.860
The Dev Show 142 take two.
