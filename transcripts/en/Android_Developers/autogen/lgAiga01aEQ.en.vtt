to notice that you know this is I guess

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010
to notice that you know this is I guess
 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.810
to notice that you know this is I guess
the first time madam that we've had a

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820
the first time madam that we've had a
 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.940
the first time madam that we've had a
such a such a high density tablet

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950
such a such a high density tablet
 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.580
such a such a high density tablet
display before you know almost all

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590
display before you know almost all
 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.580
display before you know almost all
tablet displays tender sub with space of

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590
tablet displays tender sub with space of
 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.979
tablet displays tender sub with space of
an mdpi I think any of them have been

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989
an mdpi I think any of them have been
 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.869
an mdpi I think any of them have been
anything other than in deeper yeah yeah

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879
anything other than in deeper yeah yeah
 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.000
anything other than in deeper yeah yeah
so these yeah they've all been roughly

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010
so these yeah they've all been roughly
 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.550
so these yeah they've all been roughly
I guess 1280 x 800 pixels and so this

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560
I guess 1280 x 800 pixels and so this
 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.679
I guess 1280 x 800 pixels and so this
doubles that so you now have a crazy

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:20.689
doubles that so you now have a crazy
 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:22.600
doubles that so you now have a crazy
number of pixels on the screen the good

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610
number of pixels on the screen the good
 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.280
number of pixels on the screen the good
thing is that the dip resolution hasn't

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290
thing is that the dip resolution hasn't
 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.410
thing is that the dip resolution hasn't
changed so you know your existing

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420
changed so you know your existing
 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.530
changed so you know your existing
layouts will just work the the

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540
layouts will just work the the
 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.850
layouts will just work the the
difference though is that the assets

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860
difference though is that the assets
 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.619
difference though is that the assets
that will be using those layouts you

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629
that will be using those layouts you
 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:33.789
that will be using those layouts you
know if you have buttons and things like

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799
know if you have buttons and things like
 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.039
know if you have buttons and things like
that they'll be you know twice the

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049
that they'll be you know twice the
 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.520
that they'll be you know twice the
density so so basically 320 dpi answers

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530
density so so basically 320 dpi answers
 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.280
density so so basically 320 dpi answers
any assets I get shared from your phone

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290
any assets I get shared from your phone

yeah also for a nexus 4 it's worth

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040
yeah also for a nexus 4 it's worth
 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.250
yeah also for a nexus 4 it's worth
mentioning that the width is slightly

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260
mentioning that the width is slightly
 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.270
mentioning that the width is slightly
larger than Galaxy Nexus it's 1280 by

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280
larger than Galaxy Nexus it's 1280 by
 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.030
larger than Galaxy Nexus it's 1280 by
768 as opposed to 1280 by 720 yeah and

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040
768 as opposed to 1280 by 720 yeah and
 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.479
768 as opposed to 1280 by 720 yeah and
that maps to about 24 extra dips

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489
that maps to about 24 extra dips
 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.240
that maps to about 24 extra dips
horizontal dips of resolution for for

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250
horizontal dips of resolution for for
 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.949

launcher icon because what the launcher

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489
launcher icon because what the launcher
 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:11.800
launcher icon because what the launcher
does and the launcher is that home

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810

physically larger icon so instead of
 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.120
physically larger icon so instead of
showing a 48 by 48 dip icon in the

showing a 48 by 48 dip icon in the
 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.170
showing a 48 by 48 dip icon in the
launcher it

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180
launcher it
 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.240

so to get a an icon of of that high
 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:37.960
so to get a an icon of of that high
resolution it basically uses a shortcut

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970
resolution it basically uses a shortcut
 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.260
resolution it basically uses a shortcut
it basically looks at the the asset was

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270
it basically looks at the the asset was
 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.390
it basically looks at the the asset was
the same asset at a higher density uses

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400
the same asset at a higher density uses

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.810
that the framework and the launcher will
be looking at xxhdpi it will be looking

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820
be looking at xxhdpi it will be looking

along the spectrum may be slightly
 

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:38.620
along the spectrum may be slightly
darker but i think that the big big

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:38.630
darker but i think that the big big
 

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.120
darker but i think that the big big
important point here is that you just

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:40.130

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:47.290
different mode so as long as it's fairly
different from the standard action bar

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:18.290
think for me the visuals are less
 

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:20.140
think for me the visuals are less
important and it's and what's more

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:20.150
important and it's and what's more
 

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:21.880
important and it's and what's more
important is the interactions right so

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:21.890
important is the interactions right so
 

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:24.040
important is the interactions right so
having the like the check box there

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:24.050
having the like the check box there
 

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:25.480
having the like the check box there
right having the done button there is

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:25.490
right having the done button there is
 

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:28.750
right having the done button there is
far more important than like the you

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:28.760
far more important than like the you
 

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.120
far more important than like the you
know the specific color of the action

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:31.130
know the specific color of the action
 

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.550
know the specific color of the action
bar like that is really up to you as a

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:33.560
bar like that is really up to you as a
 

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.050
bar like that is really up to you as a
designer to choose you know what looks

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:35.060
designer to choose you know what looks
 

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.750
designer to choose you know what looks
best to you but really the core things

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760
best to you but really the core things
 

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.790
best to you but really the core things
that you should you know be leaving are

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:39.800
that you should you know be leaving are
 

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.710
that you should you know be leaving are
the standard kind of expected

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:41.720
the standard kind of expected
 

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.840
the standard kind of expected
interactions like pressing the top left

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:43.850
interactions like pressing the top left
 

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:46.480
interactions like pressing the top left
area which would be a checkbox to you

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:46.490
area which would be a checkbox to you
 

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:49.630
area which would be a checkbox to you
know to close the action mode having the

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:49.640
know to close the action mode having the
 

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.160
know to close the action mode having the
action overflow there in case there are

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:51.170
action overflow there in case there are
 

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:52.660
action overflow there in case there are
additional action so you know it's

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:52.670
additional action so you know it's
 

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:54.340
additional action so you know it's
really for me more about the interaction

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:54.350
really for me more about the interaction
 

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:56.500
really for me more about the interaction
side of things now then the visual side

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:56.510
side of things now then the visual side
 

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.000
side of things now then the visual side
of things although the visuals are

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.010
of things although the visuals are
 

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.800
of things although the visuals are
important it's really just up to you to

00:12:59.800 --> 00:12:59.810
important it's really just up to you to
 

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:01.450
important it's really just up to you to
make them look it yeah and one more

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:01.460
make them look it yeah and one more
 

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:05.770
make them look it yeah and one more
question um if you were to like for the

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:05.780
question um if you were to like for the
 

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.840
question um if you were to like for the
check boxes here if you were to like if

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:07.850
check boxes here if you were to like if
 

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.640
check boxes here if you were to like if
someone was to click on it do you think

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:09.650
someone was to click on it do you think
 

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:13.600
someone was to click on it do you think
it's a good good for them to for the for

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:13.610
it's a good good for them to for the for
 

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.280
it's a good good for them to for the for
the entire list item to like go to the

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:15.290
the entire list item to like go to the
 

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:18.130
the entire list item to like go to the
bottom of the list or it's just a hot

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:18.140
bottom of the list or it's just a hot
 

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:19.840
bottom of the list or it's just a hot
day there the check box showing means

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:19.850
day there the check box showing means
 

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:21.700
day there the check box showing means
that it's kind of like a completed task

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:21.710
that it's kind of like a completed task
 

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:25.900
that it's kind of like a completed task
yeah um in general I'd say you know and

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:25.910
yeah um in general I'd say you know and
 

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.940
yeah um in general I'd say you know and
this is just a general rule you know do

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:27.950
this is just a general rule you know do
 

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:30.340
this is just a general rule you know do
what people would expect and in general

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:30.350
what people would expect and in general
 

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:33.010
what people would expect and in general
what users expect is what they're used

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:33.020
what users expect is what they're used
 

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.590
what users expect is what they're used
to what they're accustomed to and so if

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600
to what they're accustomed to and so if
 

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.180
to what they're accustomed to and so if
there is something on the system

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:37.190
there is something on the system
 

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.980
there is something on the system
especially if it comes with their device

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:38.990
especially if it comes with their device
 

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:41.260
especially if it comes with their device
if there's a gas system app or platform

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:41.270
if there's a gas system app or platform
 

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:44.770
if there's a gas system app or platform
app that that does this exact thing then

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:44.780
app that that does this exact thing then
 

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.240
app that that does this exact thing then
just mirror what that does because

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:46.250
just mirror what that does because
 

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:47.080
just mirror what that does because
that's just what they're going to be

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:47.090
that's just what they're going to be
 

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:49.060
that's just what they're going to be
accustomed to in this case I can't think

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:49.070
accustomed to in this case I can't think
 

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:51.490
accustomed to in this case I can't think
of anything that like anything where a

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:51.500
of anything that like anything where a
 

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.520
of anything that like anything where a
check box mark something is completed

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:54.530
check box mark something is completed
 

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:57.190
check box mark something is completed
that's built into the system so in this

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:57.200
that's built into the system so in this
 

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.750
that's built into the system so in this
case I mean you don't really have much

00:13:58.750 --> 00:13:58.760
case I mean you don't really have much
 

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.960
case I mean you don't really have much
of a default to rely on one thing you

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:01.970
of a default to rely on one thing you
 

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:03.310
of a default to rely on one thing you
could consider those you know when you

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:03.320
could consider those you know when you
 

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.310
could consider those you know when you
when you interact with something if it's

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320
when you interact with something if it's
 

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.410
when you interact with something if it's
jumping around it's going to be hard to

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:08.420
jumping around it's going to be hard to
 

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.690
jumping around it's going to be hard to
continually interact with it so let's

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:10.700
continually interact with it so let's
 

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.210
continually interact with it so let's
say you wanted to you know check it you

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:13.220
say you wanted to you know check it you
 

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.400
say you wanted to you know check it you
know market is completed and then do

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:15.410
know market is completed and then do
 

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.800
know market is completed and then do
something else to it if you market is

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:17.810
something else to it if you market is
 

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:19.990
something else to it if you market is
checked and then it jumps down you know

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000
checked and then it jumps down you know
 

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.990
checked and then it jumps down you know
your finger is no longer at the at the

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:23.000
your finger is no longer at the at the
 

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.390
your finger is no longer at the at the
relevant target right so you basically

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:25.400
relevant target right so you basically
 

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.790
relevant target right so you basically
have to jump around there that's that's

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:27.800
have to jump around there that's that's
 

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.290
have to jump around there that's that's
just another you know minor point i

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:29.300
just another you know minor point i
 

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.570
just another you know minor point i
think it's it's less important than

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:31.580
think it's it's less important than
 

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.030
think it's it's less important than
following conventions because again

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:34.040
following conventions because again
 

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.560
following conventions because again
that's just what people are going to

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:35.570
that's just what people are going to
 

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.900
that's just what people are going to
expect but i think in this case you know

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:37.910
expect but i think in this case you know
 

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:39.370
expect but i think in this case you know
having a jump around too much maybe a

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:39.380
having a jump around too much maybe a
 

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:42.060
having a jump around too much maybe a
negative thing all right comment on it

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:42.070
negative thing all right comment on it
 

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:45.730
negative thing all right comment on it
yeah i guess and he liked you if you do

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:45.740
yeah i guess and he liked you if you do
 

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.740
yeah i guess and he liked you if you do
printed evolve a list and the bottom of

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:47.750
printed evolve a list and the bottom of
 

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:48.940
printed evolve a list and the bottom of
the list is actually off the bottom of

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:48.950
the list is actually off the bottom of
 

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.010
the list is actually off the bottom of
the screen then you're probably gonna

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:51.020
the screen then you're probably gonna
 

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.890
the screen then you're probably gonna
struggle to find that moved item so

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:53.900
struggle to find that moved item so
 

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.350
struggle to find that moved item so
maybe and try and distinguish it a bit

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:56.360
maybe and try and distinguish it a bit
 

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.480
maybe and try and distinguish it a bit
more than just being checked i know a

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:58.490
more than just being checked i know a
 

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.750
more than just being checked i know a
lot of apps change to the color or maybe

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:01.760
lot of apps change to the color or maybe
 

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.520
lot of apps change to the color or maybe
some kind of strike through or something

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:03.530
some kind of strike through or something
 

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.380
some kind of strike through or something
it's at an item that's quite a common

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:05.390
it's at an item that's quite a common
 

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.750
it's at an item that's quite a common

favorite apps the tasks ab by team tasks
they do exactly that they just show an

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:12.890
they do exactly that they just show an
 

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:14.080
they do exactly that they just show an
additional strikethrough as an

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:14.090
additional strikethrough as an
 

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:15.610
additional strikethrough as an
additional visual indicator that

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:15.620
additional visual indicator that
 

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.610
additional visual indicator that
something is checked actually i would go

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:18.620
something is checked actually i would go
 

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.800
something is checked actually i would go
over there with a swipe to dismiss

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:20.810
over there with a swipe to dismiss

over there with a swipe to dismiss
instead of the checkbox definitely

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:24.080
instead of the checkbox definitely
 

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.750
instead of the checkbox definitely
another option absolutely none option we

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:25.760
another option absolutely none option we

much in favor that

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:34.920
much in favor that
 

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.129
much in favor that
yeah you can still get in a

00:15:37.129 --> 00:15:37.139
yeah you can still get in a
 

00:15:37.139 --> 00:15:39.230
yeah you can still get in a
task-management like any dude they're

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240
task-management like any dude they're
 

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:43.940
task-management like any dude they're
doing it and I can think of her other

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:43.950
doing it and I can think of her other
 

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:46.400
doing it and I can think of her other
apps but it's very natural to the user

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:46.410
apps but it's very natural to the user
 

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:51.290

to just get things out of his way I'm

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:51.300
to just get things out of his way I'm
 

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.819
to just get things out of his way I'm
curious on how you would go about

00:15:52.819 --> 00:15:52.829
curious on how you would go about
 

00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:54.800
curious on how you would go about
implementing the swipe to dismiss

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:54.810
implementing the swipe to dismiss
 

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:56.960
implementing the swipe to dismiss
actually I mean this maybe I may be

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:56.970
actually I mean this maybe I may be
 

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:58.670
actually I mean this maybe I may be
going over way over my time so I'm

00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:58.680
going over way over my time so I'm
 

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.519
going over way over my time so I'm
probably like done but actually that's

00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:01.529
probably like done but actually that's
 

00:16:01.529 --> 00:16:03.620
probably like done but actually that's
easy I think Roman it's it's your

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:03.630
easy I think Roman it's it's your
 

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:07.460
easy I think Roman it's it's your
library right yeah so um I don't have to

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:07.470
library right yeah so um I don't have to
 

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.259
library right yeah so um I don't have to
keep pressing around i got these

00:16:09.259 --> 00:16:09.269
keep pressing around i got these
 

00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:12.620

hangouts are very different so yeah i
 

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.560
hangouts are very different so yeah i
wrote a library all nighter library gist

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:15.570

on github that basically did such

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:17.970
on github that basically did such

the idea is if you want to provide an
 

00:21:13.179 --> 00:21:18.389
the idea is if you want to provide an
easy way to show graphics and look at

00:21:18.389 --> 00:21:18.399
easy way to show graphics and look at
 

00:21:18.399 --> 00:21:20.489
easy way to show graphics and look at
all of the graphics across your

00:21:20.489 --> 00:21:20.499
all of the graphics across your
 

00:21:20.499 --> 00:21:23.849
all of the graphics across your
different sized buckets on all the

different sized buckets on all the
 

00:21:23.859 --> 00:21:28.409
different sized buckets on all the
drawable variants so this does that and

00:21:28.409 --> 00:21:28.419
drawable variants so this does that and

you know showing you whether your sizes
 

00:21:34.149 --> 00:21:38.340
you know showing you whether your sizes
arrive whether you know whether you've

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:38.350
arrive whether you know whether you've
 

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:41.369
arrive whether you know whether you've
got like odd pixels or you know whether

00:21:41.369 --> 00:21:41.379
got like odd pixels or you know whether
 

00:21:41.379 --> 00:21:43.919

these bitch p is providing this is just

00:22:24.909 --> 00:22:24.919
these bitch p is providing this is just
 

00:22:24.919 --> 00:22:27.219
these bitch p is providing this is just
look at which wich assets you currently

00:22:27.219 --> 00:22:27.229
look at which wich assets you currently
 

00:22:27.229 --> 00:22:29.319
look at which wich assets you currently
have so if you have like some random

00:22:29.319 --> 00:22:29.329
have so if you have like some random
 

00:22:29.329 --> 00:22:34.569
have so if you have like some random
assets that's like 40 by 40 in mdpi it

00:22:34.569 --> 00:22:34.579
assets that's like 40 by 40 in mdpi it
 

00:22:34.579 --> 00:22:36.489
assets that's like 40 by 40 in mdpi it
will show you what the equivalent is an

00:22:36.489 --> 00:22:36.499
will show you what the equivalent is an
 

00:22:36.499 --> 00:22:39.309
will show you what the equivalent is an
xhdpi and like an empty slot if it's not

00:22:39.309 --> 00:22:39.319
xhdpi and like an empty slot if it's not
 

00:22:39.319 --> 00:22:42.129
xhdpi and like an empty slot if it's not
there yeah yeah that's exactly what it's

00:22:42.129 --> 00:22:42.139
there yeah yeah that's exactly what it's
 

00:22:42.139 --> 00:22:45.069
there yeah yeah that's exactly what it's
doing here right so it's all all of

00:22:45.069 --> 00:22:45.079
doing here right so it's all all of
 

00:22:45.079 --> 00:22:48.449
doing here right so it's all all of
these based off mdpi at the moment i

00:22:48.449 --> 00:22:48.459
these based off mdpi at the moment i
 

00:22:48.459 --> 00:22:51.689
these based off mdpi at the moment i
might add something to sort of look at

00:22:51.689 --> 00:22:51.699
might add something to sort of look at
 

00:22:51.699 --> 00:22:54.849
might add something to sort of look at
sizing based on other other pockets if

00:22:54.849 --> 00:22:54.859

48 it's suggesting that the xhdpi well

00:23:06.459 --> 00:23:06.469
48 it's suggesting that the xhdpi well
 

00:23:06.469 --> 00:23:07.929
48 it's suggesting that the xhdpi well
as saying that it's not there and it

00:23:07.929 --> 00:23:07.939
as saying that it's not there and it
 

00:23:07.939 --> 00:23:11.139
as saying that it's not there and it
should be 96 x 96 you can see here that

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.590
were gonna hire and it was really useful
and interesting I think that something

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:12.600
and interesting I think that something
 

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.260
and interesting I think that something
like that could be good to to do again I

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:15.270
like that could be good to to do again I
 

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:17.420
like that could be good to to do again I
think you do it with obviously lots of

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:17.430
think you do it with obviously lots of
 

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:18.920
think you do it with obviously lots of
different apps you guys sort of doing

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:18.930
different apps you guys sort of doing
 

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:21.980
different apps you guys sort of doing
that with your with you look at apps at

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:21.990
that with your with you look at apps at
 

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:24.560
that with your with you look at apps at
the minor in as well but I think having

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:24.570
the minor in as well but I think having
 

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:26.660
the minor in as well but I think having
a you know having the design tools out

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:26.670
a you know having the design tools out
 

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:28.430
a you know having the design tools out
there and showing how people enjoy it

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:28.440
there and showing how people enjoy it
 

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:32.810
there and showing how people enjoy it
quickly as well and also tackling like

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:32.820
quickly as well and also tackling like
 

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:36.230
quickly as well and also tackling like
that the big problem of you know making

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240
that the big problem of you know making
 

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:40.259
that the big problem of you know making
making an appt look good on on sir

00:28:40.259 --> 00:28:40.269
making an appt look good on on sir
 

00:28:40.269 --> 00:28:44.820
making an appt look good on on sir

00:28:52.799 --> 00:28:52.809
just going for a pure holo theme and
 

00:28:52.809 --> 00:28:54.989
just going for a pure holo theme and
trying to pull that all back like you

00:28:54.989 --> 00:28:54.999
trying to pull that all back like you
 

00:28:54.999 --> 00:28:57.060
trying to pull that all back like you
know this is the limiting problem I know

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:57.070
know this is the limiting problem I know
 

00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:58.589
know this is the limiting problem I know
you guys are trying to sort of pushing

00:28:58.589 --> 00:28:58.599
you guys are trying to sort of pushing
 

00:28:58.599 --> 00:29:00.629
you guys are trying to sort of pushing
for like that the newest style all the

00:29:00.629 --> 00:29:00.639
for like that the newest style all the
 

00:29:00.639 --> 00:29:04.349
for like that the newest style all the
time but the reality is that um you know

00:29:04.349 --> 00:29:04.359
time but the reality is that um you know
 

00:29:04.359 --> 00:29:06.570
time but the reality is that um you know
apps out there and it companies want to

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:06.580
apps out there and it companies want to
 

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:10.579
apps out there and it companies want to
get target as much much as they can and

00:29:10.579 --> 00:29:10.589
get target as much much as they can and
 

00:29:10.589 --> 00:29:13.319
get target as much much as they can and
stuff just doesn't look that great not

00:29:13.319 --> 00:29:13.329
stuff just doesn't look that great not
 

00:29:13.329 --> 00:29:15.479
stuff just doesn't look that great not
everything even hollow everywhere

00:29:15.479 --> 00:29:15.489
everything even hollow everywhere
 

00:29:15.489 --> 00:29:18.389
everything even hollow everywhere
doesn't bring everything back and so

00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:18.399
doesn't bring everything back and so
 

00:29:18.399 --> 00:29:21.359
doesn't bring everything back and so
yeah if there's any tricks or even

00:29:21.359 --> 00:29:21.369
yeah if there's any tricks or even
 

00:29:21.369 --> 00:29:22.949
yeah if there's any tricks or even
talking about some of the issues there

00:29:22.949 --> 00:29:22.959
talking about some of the issues there
 

00:29:22.959 --> 00:29:25.049
talking about some of the issues there
yeah so like maybe positionally an

00:29:25.049 --> 00:29:25.059
yeah so like maybe positionally an
 

00:29:25.059 --> 00:29:26.669
yeah so like maybe positionally an

that is a very kind of pragmatic view of

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:32.950
that is a very kind of pragmatic view of
 

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:34.619
that is a very kind of pragmatic view of
the current landscape as you know most

00:29:34.619 --> 00:29:34.629
the current landscape as you know most

so definitely we should look at okay and

00:29:40.109 --> 00:29:40.119
so definitely we should look at okay and
 

00:29:40.119 --> 00:29:43.199
so definitely we should look at okay and
Randy have any thoughts on what we

00:29:43.199 --> 00:29:43.209
Randy have any thoughts on what we
 

00:29:43.209 --> 00:29:46.379
Randy have any thoughts on what we
should include thoughts and and they

00:29:46.379 --> 00:29:46.389
should include thoughts and and they

we're not gonna know the idea is that it
 

00:30:13.779 --> 00:30:18.269
we're not gonna know the idea is that it
is it's a 7-inch tablet that is gonna be

by a driver or some or the passenger but
 

00:30:25.779 --> 00:30:28.379
by a driver or some or the passenger but
also by the driver so needs to be very

00:30:28.379 --> 00:30:28.389
also by the driver so needs to be very

obviously action bar cannot fit there

00:30:33.869 --> 00:30:33.879
obviously action bar cannot fit there
 

00:30:33.879 --> 00:30:37.589
obviously action bar cannot fit there
it's too small things like that so right

00:30:37.589 --> 00:30:37.599
it's too small things like that so right
 

00:30:37.599 --> 00:30:40.440
it's too small things like that so right
now we're banging our head against the

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:40.450
now we're banging our head against the

and you've got an amazing job with the

00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:03.060
and you've got an amazing job with the
 

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:06.050
and you've got an amazing job with the
design guide but it's all focused for

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:06.060
design guide but it's all focused for
 

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.540
design guide but it's all focused for
mobile phones and mobile usage and that

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:08.550
mobile phones and mobile usage and that
 

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:11.300
mobile phones and mobile usage and that
stuff and there's actually Android is

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:11.310
stuff and there's actually Android is
 

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:14.180
stuff and there's actually Android is
going to other areas and not just

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:14.190
going to other areas and not just
 

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:19.060
going to other areas and not just
handsets tablets but also all right

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:19.070
handsets tablets but also all right
 

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:21.920
handsets tablets but also all right
basically so basically exploring how to

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:21.930
basically so basically exploring how to
 

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:24.980
basically so basically exploring how to
design for kind of a alternative or

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:24.990
design for kind of a alternative or
 

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:27.560
design for kind of a alternative or
auxiliary use cases like so that's

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:27.570
auxiliary use cases like so that's
 

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:29.420
auxiliary use cases like so that's
outside of the standard kind of holding

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:29.430
outside of the standard kind of holding
 

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:31.160
outside of the standard kind of holding

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:31.170
a phone in your hand while holding a
 

00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:33.110
a phone in your hand while holding a
tablet in your two hands yeah definitely

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120
tablet in your two hands yeah definitely
 

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.150
tablet in your two hands yeah definitely
definitely we can look at we'd probably

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:35.160
definitely we can look at we'd probably
 

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.580
definitely we can look at we'd probably
need to see if you example devices right

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:37.590
need to see if you example devices right
 

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:39.800
need to see if you example devices right
a few example use cases but definitely

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:39.810
a few example use cases but definitely
 

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:41.570
a few example use cases but definitely
we can kind of imagine what is the the

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:41.580
we can kind of imagine what is the the
 

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.600
we can kind of imagine what is the the
next step you know designing for the the

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:44.610
next step you know designing for the the
 

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:47.000
next step you know designing for the the
next step or the evolution of Android

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:47.010
next step or the evolution of Android
 

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:49.370
next step or the evolution of Android
devices in different areas different use

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:49.380
devices in different areas different use
 

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:50.750
devices in different areas different use
case and there are some apps that need

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:50.760
case and there are some apps that need
 

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.340
case and there are some apps that need
to do something like that anyway like

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:52.350
to do something like that anyway like
 

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:54.440
to do something like that anyway like
navigation apps for example that or yeah

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:54.450
navigation apps for example that or yeah
 

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:58.000
navigation apps for example that or yeah
sort of you know cater to that use case

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:58.010
sort of you know cater to that use case
 

00:31:58.010 --> 00:32:00.890
sort of you know cater to that use case
