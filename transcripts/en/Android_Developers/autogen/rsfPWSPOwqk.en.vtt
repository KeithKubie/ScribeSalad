who is a mobile interaction designer
that works for good technology thanks

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380
that works for good technology thanks

for joining us Thanks
 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.509
for joining us Thanks
so Isabel I hear words UX design get

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519
so Isabel I hear words UX design get
 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.370
so Isabel I hear words UX design get
thrown around a lot and especially in

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380
thrown around a lot and especially in
 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.799
thrown around a lot and especially in
many different contexts people say if

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809
many different contexts people say if
 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.450
many different contexts people say if
you do this you will have a great

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460
you do this you will have a great
 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.160
you do this you will have a great
experience and your users will have a

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170
experience and your users will have a
 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.549
experience and your users will have a
bad time so what is UX well user

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559
bad time so what is UX well user
 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.200
bad time so what is UX well user
experience design is really an emergent

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210
experience design is really an emergent
 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.209
experience design is really an emergent
property of design that includes visual

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219
property of design that includes visual
 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.549
property of design that includes visual
design interaction design and

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559
design interaction design and
 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.540
design interaction design and
engineering so you can see in the slide

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550
engineering so you can see in the slide
 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.430
engineering so you can see in the slide
how all of these things really need to

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440
how all of these things really need to
 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.990
how all of these things really need to
come together and the whole must be

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000
come together and the whole must be
 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.479
come together and the whole must be
greater than the sum of its parts so if

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489
greater than the sum of its parts so if
 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.799
greater than the sum of its parts so if
any one of these things aren't great

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809
any one of these things aren't great
 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.270
any one of these things aren't great
they're going to let down the overall

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280
they're going to let down the overall
 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.670
they're going to let down the overall
user experience so user experience

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680
user experience so user experience
 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.170
user experience so user experience
really involves you focusing on all the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180
really involves you focusing on all the
 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.030
really involves you focusing on all the
details as well as being able to really

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040
details as well as being able to really
 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.859
details as well as being able to really
zoom out and make sure that what you're

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869
zoom out and make sure that what you're
 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.480
zoom out and make sure that what you're
delivering has an overall really great

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490
delivering has an overall really great
 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.929
delivering has an overall really great
user experience that makes sense so you

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939
user experience that makes sense so you
 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.870
user experience that makes sense so you
mentioned that the words visual design

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880
mentioned that the words visual design
 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.550
mentioned that the words visual design
and interaction designer can you

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560
and interaction designer can you
 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.260
and interaction designer can you
describe the differences between the two

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270
describe the differences between the two
 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.960
describe the differences between the two
so I'm an interaction designer so I'll

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970
so I'm an interaction designer so I'll
 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.580
so I'm an interaction designer so I'll
start with interaction design it really

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590
start with interaction design it really
 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.469
start with interaction design it really
involves designing a sequence of screens

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479
involves designing a sequence of screens
 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.539
involves designing a sequence of screens
or sequence of steps that the user has

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549
or sequence of steps that the user has
 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.010
or sequence of steps that the user has
to go through in your application which

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020
to go through in your application which
 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.170
to go through in your application which
is what we call a flow in order for your

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180
is what we call a flow in order for your
 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.270
is what we call a flow in order for your
user to accomplish certain tasks so

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280
user to accomplish certain tasks so
 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.679
user to accomplish certain tasks so
those tasks depend on whatever it is

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689
those tasks depend on whatever it is
 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.310
those tasks depend on whatever it is
that your application actually does so

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320
that your application actually does so
 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.780
that your application actually does so
interaction design takes into account

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790
interaction design takes into account
 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.030
interaction design takes into account
how user interacts with the data and the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040
how user interacts with the data and the
 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.740
how user interacts with the data and the
UI elements on each one of your screens

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750
UI elements on each one of your screens
 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.870
UI elements on each one of your screens
as well as how they interact with all of

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880
as well as how they interact with all of
 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.030
as well as how they interact with all of
the screens together so the data and the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040
the screens together so the data and the
 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.889
the screens together so the data and the
UI really has to be strung together in a

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899
UI really has to be strung together in a
 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.380
UI really has to be strung together in a
way that makes sense for the user so if

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390
way that makes sense for the user so if
 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.020
way that makes sense for the user so if
you look at the slide this is an example

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030
you look at the slide this is an example
 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.940
you look at the slide this is an example
of a flow that an interaction designer

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950
of a flow that an interaction designer
 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.690
of a flow that an interaction designer
might show our might give to a developer

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700
might show our might give to a developer
 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.999
might show our might give to a developer
so the next slide here is an annotated

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009
so the next slide here is an annotated
 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.679
so the next slide here is an annotated
wireframe so this is something else that

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689
wireframe so this is something else that
 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.300
wireframe so this is something else that
I would also give to a developer

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310
I would also give to a developer
 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.950
I would also give to a developer
so the different annotations show with

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960
so the different annotations show with
 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.020
so the different annotations show with
each one of those UI elements mean so

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030
each one of those UI elements mean so
 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.400
each one of those UI elements mean so
right here we're showing the action bar

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410
right here we're showing the action bar
 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.260
right here we're showing the action bar
so we have the app icon a spinner some

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270
so we have the app icon a spinner some
 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.990
so we have the app icon a spinner some
icons and an overflow so a visual

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000
icons and an overflow so a visual
 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.059
icons and an overflow so a visual
designer what they do is they really

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069
designer what they do is they really
 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.559
designer what they do is they really
specify the color palette the

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569
specify the color palette the
 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.199
specify the color palette the
iconography that typography and all the

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209
iconography that typography and all the
 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.120
iconography that typography and all the
visual personality of your application

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130
visual personality of your application
 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.759
visual personality of your application
so they would surpass specify the exact

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769
so they would surpass specify the exact
 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.890
so they would surpass specify the exact
spacing for all the layouts of every

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900
spacing for all the layouts of every
 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.050
spacing for all the layouts of every
single screen so if you look at the

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060
single screen so if you look at the
 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.550
single screen so if you look at the
slide here this is what we would call a

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560
slide here this is what we would call a
 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.900
slide here this is what we would call a
red line so you can see it's a very

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910
red line so you can see it's a very
 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.509
red line so you can see it's a very
detailed layout of that particular

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519
detailed layout of that particular
 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.030
detailed layout of that particular
screen so visual designers would provide

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040
screen so visual designers would provide
 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.039
screen so visual designers would provide
the engineers all the graphics assets

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049
the engineers all the graphics assets
 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.750
the engineers all the graphics assets
and the icons and make sure that each

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760
and the icons and make sure that each
 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.050
and the icons and make sure that each
screen is just perfect so there's one

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060
screen is just perfect so there's one
 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.449
screen is just perfect so there's one
other example of a visual design these

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459
other example of a visual design these
 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.740
other example of a visual design these
are some things that a visual designer

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750
are some things that a visual designer
 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.150
are some things that a visual designer
would actually deliver to an engineer

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160
would actually deliver to an engineer
 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160
would actually deliver to an engineer
these are like the different sizes for

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170
these are like the different sizes for
 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.930
these are like the different sizes for
your icons all the different font sizes

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940
your icons all the different font sizes
 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.000
your icons all the different font sizes
and all the difference the icon set for

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010
and all the difference the icon set for
 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.710
and all the difference the icon set for
your entire application so essentially

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720
your entire application so essentially
 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.300
your entire application so essentially
you're skinning the application you're

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310
you're skinning the application you're
 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.800
you're skinning the application you're
you're creating that that wonderful

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810
you're creating that that wonderful
 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.090
you're creating that that wonderful
experience I mean the visual aspect of

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100
experience I mean the visual aspect of
 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.830
experience I mean the visual aspect of
that experience that is going to

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840
that experience that is going to
 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.810
that experience that is going to
immediately be striking to someone yeah

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820
immediately be striking to someone yeah
 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:09.740
immediately be striking to someone yeah
that makes sense

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750
that makes sense
 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.030
that makes sense
so interaction design you can kind of

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040
so interaction design you can kind of
 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.410
so interaction design you can kind of
think of it that they would provide more

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420
think of it that they would provide more
 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.020
think of it that they would provide more
of a low res wireframe and then a visual

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030
of a low res wireframe and then a visual
 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.280
of a low res wireframe and then a visual
design would give you like a high-res

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290
design would give you like a high-res
 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.069
design would give you like a high-res
mock it was really subtle so I get it so

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079
mock it was really subtle so I get it so
 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.259
mock it was really subtle so I get it so
basically UX design has to take into

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269
basically UX design has to take into
 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.030
basically UX design has to take into
account interaction design visual design

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040
account interaction design visual design
 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.860
account interaction design visual design
and engineering and put them all

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870
and engineering and put them all
 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.150
and engineering and put them all
together in a way that delivers to light

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160
together in a way that delivers to light
 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.000
together in a way that delivers to light
at the end of the day right yeah so so

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010
at the end of the day right yeah so so
 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.250
at the end of the day right yeah so so
so from a developer's perspective the

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260
so from a developer's perspective the
 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.630
so from a developer's perspective the
way I'd like to think about it is that I

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640
way I'd like to think about it is that I
 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.090
way I'd like to think about it is that I
write code that might there's a visual

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100
write code that might there's a visual
 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.650
write code that might there's a visual
code I write a non visual code or I

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660
code I write a non visual code or I
 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.500
code I write a non visual code or I
write and both of those come together to

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510
write and both of those come together to
 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.690
write and both of those come together to
deliver the overall user experience but

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700
deliver the overall user experience but
 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.370
deliver the overall user experience but
the visual code specifically delivers

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380
the visual code specifically delivers
 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.900
the visual code specifically delivers
the UI is that a good way to think about

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910
the UI is that a good way to think about
 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.190
the UI is that a good way to think about
it as well yeah and I think that Google

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200
it as well yeah and I think that Google
 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.199
it as well yeah and I think that Google
now is a really great example of a

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209
now is a really great example of a
 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.610
now is a really great example of a
product that delivers a really great

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620
product that delivers a really great
 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.140
product that delivers a really great
user experience and it really embodies

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150
user experience and it really embodies
 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.789
user experience and it really embodies
awesomeness at every level the

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799
awesomeness at every level the
 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.500
awesomeness at every level the
interaction the visual and the

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510
interaction the visual and the
 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.240
interaction the visual and the
engineering right so I think it's

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250
engineering right so I think it's
 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.069
engineering right so I think it's
something that we can talk about a

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079
something that we can talk about a
 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.229
something that we can talk about a
little bit more do you have any examples

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239
little bit more do you have any examples
 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.289
little bit more do you have any examples
of how an application our experience

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299
of how an application our experience
 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:04.430
of how an application our experience
like Google now could hypothetically

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440
like Google now could hypothetically
 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.300
like Google now could hypothetically
have gone terribly definitely so we were

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310
have gone terribly definitely so we were
 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.830
have gone terribly definitely so we were
talking about visual design for quite a

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840
talking about visual design for quite a
 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.869
talking about visual design for quite a
bit so Google now is one of the most

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879
bit so Google now is one of the most
 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:12.660
bit so Google now is one of the most
striking

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670
striking
 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.309
striking
things about it is that the cards are

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319
things about it is that the cards are
 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.400
things about it is that the cards are
really really easy to easy to read the

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410
really really easy to easy to read the
 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.289
really really easy to easy to read the
typography is great it's very easy to

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299
typography is great it's very easy to
 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.580
typography is great it's very easy to
digest a lot of information without

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590
digest a lot of information without
 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.120
digest a lot of information without
thinking much at all so if Google now

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130
thinking much at all so if Google now
 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.350
thinking much at all so if Google now
delivered the same quality of

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360
delivered the same quality of
 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.450
delivered the same quality of
information it was accurate and relevant

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460
information it was accurate and relevant
 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.210
information it was accurate and relevant
but if it looked really bad like if the

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220
but if it looked really bad like if the
 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.129
but if it looked really bad like if the
margins were off and the padding was off

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139
margins were off and the padding was off
 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.530
margins were off and the padding was off
and the images are all ugly yeah then I

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540
and the images are all ugly yeah then I
 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.960
and the images are all ugly yeah then I
think you would make the user think that

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970
think you would make the user think that
 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.580
think you would make the user think that
it was a very unprofessional application

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590
it was a very unprofessional application
 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.830
it was a very unprofessional application
yeah I think that um things like

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840
yeah I think that um things like
 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.990
yeah I think that um things like
typography and spacing and that polish

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000
typography and spacing and that polish
 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.490
typography and spacing and that polish
that's in Google now is one of the

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500
that's in Google now is one of the
 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.710
that's in Google now is one of the
things that makes it so successful of

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720
things that makes it so successful of
 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.450
things that makes it so successful of
course the relevant data surfacing just

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460
course the relevant data surfacing just
 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.010
course the relevant data surfacing just
when you need it is crucially important

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020
when you need it is crucially important
 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.570
when you need it is crucially important
but what I really love about Google now

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580
but what I really love about Google now
 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.640
but what I really love about Google now
is how I can just glance at a card in

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650
is how I can just glance at a card in
 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.200
is how I can just glance at a card in
just a second I can get a lot of

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210
just a second I can get a lot of
 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.600
just a second I can get a lot of
information from it there's really no or

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610
information from it there's really no or
 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.670
information from it there's really no or
really low cognitive load to those cars

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680
really low cognitive load to those cars
 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.040
really low cognitive load to those cars
I can just glance at it and that's it no

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050
I can just glance at it and that's it no
 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.150
I can just glance at it and that's it no
that makes sense the visual design is

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160
that makes sense the visual design is
 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.890
that makes sense the visual design is
very important yeah so kind of switching

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900
very important yeah so kind of switching
 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.510
very important yeah so kind of switching
gears a little bit so let's say the

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520
gears a little bit so let's say the
 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.460
gears a little bit so let's say the
visuals for Google now since we are

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470
visuals for Google now since we are
 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.020
visuals for Google now since we are
talking hypothetically about how the UX

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030
talking hypothetically about how the UX
 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.030
talking hypothetically about how the UX
could could go horribly wrong so if

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040
could could go horribly wrong so if
 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.159
could could go horribly wrong so if
let's say Google now had just amazing

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169
let's say Google now had just amazing
 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:15.570
let's say Google now had just amazing
data was surfacing the content was

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580
data was surfacing the content was
 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.840
data was surfacing the content was
totally I'm sorry if the if the cards

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850
totally I'm sorry if the if the cards
 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.700
totally I'm sorry if the if the cards
looked really great as they do today but

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710
looked really great as they do today but
 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.560
looked really great as they do today but
let's say the data was lacking like it

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570
let's say the data was lacking like it
 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.760
let's say the data was lacking like it
didn't know your current location or

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770
didn't know your current location or
 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.040
didn't know your current location or
it's surfaced a card about some upcoming

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050
it's surfaced a card about some upcoming
 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.360
it's surfaced a card about some upcoming
flight that you have to be on and

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370
flight that you have to be on and
 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.460
flight that you have to be on and
details are wrong so in that situation

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470
details are wrong so in that situation
 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.469
details are wrong so in that situation
that would be a really bad user

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479
that would be a really bad user
 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:34.020
that would be a really bad user
experience right yes because um one

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030
experience right yes because um one
 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.640
experience right yes because um one
thing that I would feel at that point is

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650
thing that I would feel at that point is
 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.779
thing that I would feel at that point is
a user is that I can't trust the

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:36.789
a user is that I can't trust the
 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:37.920
a user is that I can't trust the
information that I'm getting even though

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930
information that I'm getting even though
 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.050
information that I'm getting even though
it looks visually striking yet Trust is

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060
it looks visually striking yet Trust is
 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.100
it looks visually striking yet Trust is
a really important part of user

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110
a really important part of user
 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.210
a really important part of user
experience I'm glad you brought that up

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220
experience I'm glad you brought that up
 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.279
experience I'm glad you brought that up
because I'm Trust is like one of those

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289
because I'm Trust is like one of those
 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:46.290
because I'm Trust is like one of those
emergent properties that has to do with

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300
emergent properties that has to do with
 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.360
emergent properties that has to do with
really great design and really great

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370
really great design and really great
 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.159
really great design and really great
engineering so I think it's something

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169
engineering so I think it's something
 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.409
engineering so I think it's something
Trust is something that as developers we

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419
Trust is something that as developers we
 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:54.990
Trust is something that as developers we
should all really focus on because when

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000
should all really focus on because when
 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.310
should all really focus on because when
someone trusts your application that's

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320
someone trusts your application that's
 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.480
someone trusts your application that's
what's going to get your users to give

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490
what's going to get your users to give
 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.890
what's going to get your users to give
you these five-star reviews in the App

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900
you these five-star reviews in the App
 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.510
you these five-star reviews in the App
Store and these reviews are what's going

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520
Store and these reviews are what's going
 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.730
Store and these reviews are what's going
to make you ultimately successful that's

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740
to make you ultimately successful that's
 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.740
to make you ultimately successful that's
true in there your application as well

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750
true in there your application as well
 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.029
true in there your application as well
and a social proof in what you're doing

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039
and a social proof in what you're doing
 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:08.310
and a social proof in what you're doing
and so on so absolutely Trust is is one

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320
and so on so absolutely Trust is is one
 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.690
and so on so absolutely Trust is is one
of those very very important to merchant

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:09.700
of those very very important to merchant
 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.400
of those very very important to merchant
the merchant properties that I think

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410
the merchant properties that I think
 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.469
the merchant properties that I think
that everybody should aspire to to

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:13.479
that everybody should aspire to to
 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:16.290
that everybody should aspire to to
accomplish so let's use a different

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300
accomplish so let's use a different
 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.629
accomplish so let's use a different
example than Google now so I think we've

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639
example than Google now so I think we've
 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:21.029
example than Google now so I think we've
highlighted how bad visual design could

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039
highlighted how bad visual design could
 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:23.370
highlighted how bad visual design could
wreck experience how bad engineering

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.380
wreck experience how bad engineering
 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:23.979
wreck experience how bad engineering
could

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:23.989
could
 

00:06:23.989 --> 00:06:25.749
could
so sorry about how that interaction

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759
so sorry about how that interaction
 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:27.939
so sorry about how that interaction
design could also wreck it so we've all

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:27.949
design could also wreck it so we've all
 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:30.070
design could also wreck it so we've all
used Android phones and if you think

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080
used Android phones and if you think
 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.749
used Android phones and if you think
back at the the first minute experience

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759
back at the the first minute experience
 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:33.909
back at the the first minute experience
you had with a new Android phone yeah

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919
you had with a new Android phone yeah
 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:35.259
you had with a new Android phone yeah
the first thing either it asks you to do

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:35.269
the first thing either it asks you to do
 

00:06:35.269 --> 00:06:37.359
the first thing either it asks you to do
is sign into your Gmail account once

00:06:37.359 --> 00:06:37.369
is sign into your Gmail account once
 

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:39.699
is sign into your Gmail account once
you've done that it basically

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:39.709
you've done that it basically
 

00:06:39.709 --> 00:06:41.409
you've done that it basically
automatically signs you into all the

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:41.419
automatically signs you into all the
 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:42.879
automatically signs you into all the
other google apps that you have like

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:42.889
other google apps that you have like
 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:46.479
other google apps that you have like
play maps and youtube so imagine an

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:46.489
play maps and youtube so imagine an
 

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:49.029
play maps and youtube so imagine an
alternate universe where instead of this

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:49.039
alternate universe where instead of this
 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:51.009
alternate universe where instead of this
wonderful flow we add a lot of friction

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:51.019
wonderful flow we add a lot of friction
 

00:06:51.019 --> 00:06:52.899
wonderful flow we add a lot of friction
where let's say you've initially signed

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:52.909
where let's say you've initially signed
 

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:55.299
where let's say you've initially signed
it with Gmail but then for every other

00:06:55.299 --> 00:06:55.309
it with Gmail but then for every other
 

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:56.979
it with Gmail but then for every other
Google application that you go to run

00:06:56.979 --> 00:06:56.989
Google application that you go to run
 

00:06:56.989 --> 00:06:58.659
Google application that you go to run
you not have to sign into it over and

00:06:58.659 --> 00:06:58.669
you not have to sign into it over and
 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:00.159
you not have to sign into it over and
over and over again like what would the

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:00.169
over and over again like what would the
 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:02.559
over and over again like what would the
user think in that situation like I I

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:02.569
user think in that situation like I I
 

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:04.269
user think in that situation like I I
would be almost discouraged from using

00:07:04.269 --> 00:07:04.279
would be almost discouraged from using
 

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:05.589
would be almost discouraged from using
my phone in the ways that I would want

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:05.599
my phone in the ways that I would want
 

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:06.969
my phone in the ways that I would want
to use it because of the tremendous

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:06.979
to use it because of the tremendous
 

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:08.949
to use it because of the tremendous
amount of friction that that had been

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:08.959
amount of friction that that had been
 

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:10.449
amount of friction that that had been
created in the interaction that I'm

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:10.459
created in the interaction that I'm
 

00:07:10.459 --> 00:07:12.429
created in the interaction that I'm
having with with these different

00:07:12.429 --> 00:07:12.439
having with with these different
 

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:14.589
having with with these different
applications so it's a it's a

00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:14.599
applications so it's a it's a
 

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:16.569
applications so it's a it's a
higher-level flow if you will of how a

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:16.579
higher-level flow if you will of how a
 

00:07:16.579 --> 00:07:19.029
higher-level flow if you will of how a
user interacts with with with with your

00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:19.039
user interacts with with with with your
 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:21.100
user interacts with with with with your
phone that's being impacted by

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:21.110
phone that's being impacted by
 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.419
phone that's being impacted by
individual decisions that are being made

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:22.429
individual decisions that are being made
 

00:07:22.429 --> 00:07:24.429
individual decisions that are being made
at the application level so that's one

00:07:24.429 --> 00:07:24.439
at the application level so that's one
 

00:07:24.439 --> 00:07:26.169
at the application level so that's one
of those aspects of you you know being

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:26.179
of those aspects of you you know being
 

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:27.369
of those aspects of you you know being
able to get the details right and then

00:07:27.369 --> 00:07:27.379
able to get the details right and then
 

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:28.659
able to get the details right and then
actually zooming out and looking at how

00:07:28.659 --> 00:07:28.669
actually zooming out and looking at how
 

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:30.609
actually zooming out and looking at how
all those details and in this case how

00:07:30.609 --> 00:07:30.619
all those details and in this case how
 

00:07:30.619 --> 00:07:32.859
all those details and in this case how
the first minute experience of using all

00:07:32.859 --> 00:07:32.869
the first minute experience of using all
 

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:34.540
the first minute experience of using all
these applications really affects the

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:34.550
these applications really affects the
 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.339
these applications really affects the
overall user experience which is the

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:36.349
overall user experience which is the
 

00:07:36.349 --> 00:07:38.739
overall user experience which is the
Android user experience a croissant

00:07:38.739 --> 00:07:38.749
Android user experience a croissant
 

00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:41.379
Android user experience a croissant
exactly so it's almost as if like um you

00:07:41.379 --> 00:07:41.389
exactly so it's almost as if like um you
 

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:43.389
exactly so it's almost as if like um you
have to be a good citizen as an

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:43.399
have to be a good citizen as an
 

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:44.619
have to be a good citizen as an
application developer your applications

00:07:44.619 --> 00:07:44.629
application developer your applications
 

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:46.299
application developer your applications
have to be good citizen on the device

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:46.309
have to be good citizen on the device
 

00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:48.219
have to be good citizen on the device
and not only deliver a good experience

00:07:48.219 --> 00:07:48.229
and not only deliver a good experience
 

00:07:48.229 --> 00:07:50.799
and not only deliver a good experience
inside of that application but also in

00:07:50.799 --> 00:07:50.809
inside of that application but also in
 

00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:52.359
inside of that application but also in
the context of the larger phone or

00:07:52.359 --> 00:07:52.369
the context of the larger phone or
 

00:07:52.369 --> 00:07:53.769
the context of the larger phone or
operating system that section exactly

00:07:53.769 --> 00:07:53.779
operating system that section exactly
 

00:07:53.779 --> 00:07:55.239
operating system that section exactly
that's actually living in that also

00:07:55.239 --> 00:07:55.249
that's actually living in that also
 

00:07:55.249 --> 00:07:57.189
that's actually living in that also
impacts things like battery life and yes

00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:57.199
impacts things like battery life and yes
 

00:07:57.199 --> 00:08:00.249
impacts things like battery life and yes
and so on okay so it's clear that many

00:08:00.249 --> 00:08:00.259
and so on okay so it's clear that many
 

00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:02.739
and so on okay so it's clear that many
things need to come together to make a

00:08:02.739 --> 00:08:02.749
things need to come together to make a
 

00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:04.869
things need to come together to make a
user experience truly great and and

00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:04.879
user experience truly great and and
 

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:06.339
user experience truly great and and
clearly that design is everyone's

00:08:06.339 --> 00:08:06.349
clearly that design is everyone's
 

00:08:06.349 --> 00:08:08.009
clearly that design is everyone's

exactly designers alone cannot create

00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879
exactly designers alone cannot create
 

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:12.489
exactly designers alone cannot create
great user experiences so I want to say

00:08:12.489 --> 00:08:12.499
great user experiences so I want to say
 

00:08:12.499 --> 00:08:14.109
great user experiences so I want to say
that one more time that designers alone

00:08:14.109 --> 00:08:14.119
that one more time that designers alone
 

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:16.209
that one more time that designers alone
cannot create a great user experience

00:08:16.209 --> 00:08:16.219
cannot create a great user experience
 

00:08:16.219 --> 00:08:17.799
cannot create a great user experience
and not and are not responsible alone

00:08:17.799 --> 00:08:17.809
and not and are not responsible alone

amazing designs but in the end of the

00:08:59.840 --> 00:08:59.850
amazing designs but in the end of the
 

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.190
amazing designs but in the end of the
day these designs still have to get

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.200
day these designs still have to get
 

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.010
day these designs still have to get
built by engineers so an example let's

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:04.020
built by engineers so an example let's
 

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.080
built by engineers so an example let's
say a designer creates a really amazing

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:06.090
say a designer creates a really amazing
 

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.270
say a designer creates a really amazing

application and they test it with users
it has really great feet user feedback

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:14.730
it has really great feet user feedback
 

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.820
it has really great feet user feedback
and they say okay this design is perfect

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:16.830
and they say okay this design is perfect
 

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.470
and they say okay this design is perfect
so they give it to the engineers but

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480
so they give it to the engineers but
 

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.090
so they give it to the engineers but
when the engineers build it they don't

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:20.100
when the engineers build it they don't
 

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.770
when the engineers build it they don't
put in prefetching caching and they

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:21.780
put in prefetching caching and they
 

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.330
put in prefetching caching and they
don't do efficient data transfers and

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:23.340
don't do efficient data transfers and
 

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.220
don't do efficient data transfers and
they drain the battery tells us we

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:25.230
they drain the battery tells us we
 

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.570
they drain the battery tells us we
should always get a second data transfer

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:26.580
should always get a second data transfer
 

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.400
should always get a second data transfer
always do efficient data transfers so

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:28.410
always do efficient data transfers so
 

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.080
always do efficient data transfers so
these amazing designs are never going to

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:30.090
these amazing designs are never going to
 

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.270
these amazing designs are never going to
be fully realized or appreciated due to

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:32.280
be fully realized or appreciated due to
 

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.710
be fully realized or appreciated due to
these bad engineering practices and this

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:33.720
these bad engineering practices and this
 

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.970
these bad engineering practices and this
is something that designers have no

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:34.980
is something that designers have no
 

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.380
is something that designers have no
control over they can't control if you

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:36.390
control over they can't control if you
 

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.930
control over they can't control if you
use prefetching caching and if you do

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:38.940
use prefetching caching and if you do
 

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.420
use prefetching caching and if you do
data transfers inefficiently so overall

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:41.430
data transfers inefficiently so overall
 

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:42.860
data transfers inefficiently so overall
this is going to result in a bad user

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:42.870
this is going to result in a bad user
 

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.570
this is going to result in a bad user
experience you're usually going to feel

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:44.580
experience you're usually going to feel
 

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.190
experience you're usually going to feel
impatient and frustrated and overall

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:46.200
impatient and frustrated and overall
 

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:46.790
impatient and frustrated and overall
have at that time

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800
have at that time
 

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.910
have at that time
definitely so UX design is really

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920
definitely so UX design is really
 

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.500
definitely so UX design is really
important it's everyone's responsibility

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:51.510
important it's everyone's responsibility
 

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.050
important it's everyone's responsibility
