better than these other concepts now I

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 align:start position:0%
can think about that and start to get on
 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
can think about that and start to get on

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 align:start position:0%
with it and so I think that third
