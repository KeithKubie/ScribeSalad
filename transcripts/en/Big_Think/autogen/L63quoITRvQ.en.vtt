yeah well human-made global warming is

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:11.810
yeah well human-made global warming is
 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.780
yeah well human-made global warming is
caused by changes in the atmosphere

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:13.790
caused by changes in the atmosphere
 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.020
caused by changes in the atmosphere
which are due to burning fossil fuels

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:17.030
which are due to burning fossil fuels
 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.470
which are due to burning fossil fuels
primarily as we burn oil gas and coal

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480
primarily as we burn oil gas and coal
 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.410
primarily as we burn oil gas and coal
this releases carbon dioxide to the

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420
this releases carbon dioxide to the
 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.710
this releases carbon dioxide to the
atmosphere and carbon dioxide absorbs

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720
atmosphere and carbon dioxide absorbs
 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.080
atmosphere and carbon dioxide absorbs
heat radiation from the earth and that

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090
heat radiation from the earth and that
 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.749
heat radiation from the earth and that
traps the heat radiation and makes the

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759
traps the heat radiation and makes the
 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.720
traps the heat radiation and makes the
planet a bit warmer so we notice that

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730
planet a bit warmer so we notice that
 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.760
planet a bit warmer so we notice that
the world has warmed up about one and a

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770
the world has warmed up about one and a
 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.010
the world has warmed up about one and a
half degrees Fahrenheit in the last

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020
half degrees Fahrenheit in the last
 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.470
half degrees Fahrenheit in the last
century with most of that warming in the

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480
century with most of that warming in the
 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.000
century with most of that warming in the
last 30 years

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010
 
 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.410
 
well there's now 387 parts per million

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420
well there's now 387 parts per million
 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.750
well there's now 387 parts per million
of co2 in the atmosphere 150 years ago

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760
of co2 in the atmosphere 150 years ago
 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.160
of co2 in the atmosphere 150 years ago
it was 280 so it's increased by 107 ppm

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170
it was 280 so it's increased by 107 ppm
 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.889
it was 280 so it's increased by 107 ppm
what we thought a few years ago was that

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899
what we thought a few years ago was that
 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.399
what we thought a few years ago was that
it would probably be safe to let Co to

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409
it would probably be safe to let Co to
 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.670
it would probably be safe to let Co to
go as high as 450 parts per million the

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680
go as high as 450 parts per million the
 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.249
go as high as 450 parts per million the
reason we thought that was that we know

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259
reason we thought that was that we know
 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.499
reason we thought that was that we know
that there were previous periods in the

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509
that there were previous periods in the
 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.930
that there were previous periods in the
Earth's history called interglacial

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940
Earth's history called interglacial
 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.660
Earth's history called interglacial
periods we're now in a warm interglacial

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670
periods we're now in a warm interglacial
 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.210
periods we're now in a warm interglacial
period which we have been in for about

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220
period which we have been in for about
 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.609
period which we have been in for about
twelve thousand years but there were

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619
twelve thousand years but there were
 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.399
twelve thousand years but there were
prior periods when the earth was warmer

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409
prior periods when the earth was warmer
 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.680
prior periods when the earth was warmer
than it is now and the planet was still

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690
than it is now and the planet was still
 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.960
than it is now and the planet was still
pretty much the way it is now and we

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970
pretty much the way it is now and we
 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.039
pretty much the way it is now and we
thought that it was then about a degree

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049
thought that it was then about a degree
 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.930
thought that it was then about a degree
or so Celsius which is about two degrees

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940
or so Celsius which is about two degrees
 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.960
or so Celsius which is about two degrees
Fahrenheit warmer than it is now and we

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970
Fahrenheit warmer than it is now and we
 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.600
Fahrenheit warmer than it is now and we
thought that might be okay to be that

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610
thought that might be okay to be that
 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.630
thought that might be okay to be that
warm and 450 parts per million would

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640
warm and 450 parts per million would
 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.490
warm and 450 parts per million would
probably take us to that sort of a

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500
probably take us to that sort of a
 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.119
probably take us to that sort of a
climate but what we now realize is that

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:58.129
climate but what we now realize is that
 

00:01:58.129 --> 00:02:01.419
climate but what we now realize is that
during those prior warm periods sea

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429
during those prior warm periods sea
 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.219
during those prior warm periods sea
level was about six or seven meters

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229
level was about six or seven meters
 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.460
level was about six or seven meters
higher than it is now and also we see

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470
higher than it is now and also we see
 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.070
higher than it is now and also we see
what's happening with the current 387

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080
what's happening with the current 387
 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.949
what's happening with the current 387
parts per million that's already enough

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959
parts per million that's already enough
 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.229
parts per million that's already enough
that the Arctic sea ice is melting

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239
that the Arctic sea ice is melting
 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.509
that the Arctic sea ice is melting
mountain glaciers all around the world

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519
mountain glaciers all around the world
 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.550
mountain glaciers all around the world
are melting which is going to affect the

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560
are melting which is going to affect the
 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.240
are melting which is going to affect the
freshwater supply for billions of people

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250
freshwater supply for billions of people
 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.270
freshwater supply for billions of people
the climate zones are shifting so the

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280
the climate zones are shifting so the
 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.280
the climate zones are shifting so the
Southwest United States and

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290
Southwest United States and
 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.259
Southwest United States and
Mediterranean region are becoming hotter

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269
Mediterranean region are becoming hotter
 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.170
Mediterranean region are becoming hotter
and drier likewise Australia so you see

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180
and drier likewise Australia so you see
 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.170
and drier likewise Australia so you see
increased forest fires and reduced water

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180
increased forest fires and reduced water
 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.259
increased forest fires and reduced water
supplies in those regions coral reefs

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269
supplies in those regions coral reefs
 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.290
supplies in those regions coral reefs
are already under stress they're going

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300
are already under stress they're going
 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.420
are already under stress they're going
to many of them are going to be lost if

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430
to many of them are going to be lost if
 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.490
to many of them are going to be lost if
we continue with increasing greenhouse

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500
we continue with increasing greenhouse
 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.330
we continue with increasing greenhouse
gases so we realize already the 387 is

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340
gases so we realize already the 387 is
 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.229
gases so we realize already the 387 is
actually too large about 350 parts per

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239
actually too large about 350 parts per
 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.989
actually too large about 350 parts per
million is a more realistic target and

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:55.999
million is a more realistic target and
 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:58.479
million is a more realistic target and
that means we're going to have to phase

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489
that means we're going to have to phase
 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:02:59.650
that means we're going to have to phase
out

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660
out
 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.660
out

use of coal over the next couple of
 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.670
use of coal over the next couple of
decades if we want to be able to get

decades if we want to be able to get
 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:11.680
decades if we want to be able to get
back to 350 parts per million

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690
 
 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.600
 
at the fossil fuels we see how much

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610
at the fossil fuels we see how much
 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.440
at the fossil fuels we see how much
carbon there is in oil gas and coal and

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450
carbon there is in oil gas and coal and
 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.410
carbon there is in oil gas and coal and
by far the largest is cold and we know

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420
by far the largest is cold and we know
 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.970
by far the largest is cold and we know
that we're going to use the oil and the

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980
that we're going to use the oil and the
 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.070
that we're going to use the oil and the
gas it's very they're very convenient

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080
gas it's very they're very convenient
 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.040
gas it's very they're very convenient
fuels the big pools are owned by Russia

fuels the big pools are owned by Russia
 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.110
fuels the big pools are owned by Russia
and Saudi Arabia they're certainly going

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120
and Saudi Arabia they're certainly going
 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.830
and Saudi Arabia they're certainly going
to sell that gas and oil if we want to

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840
to sell that gas and oil if we want to
 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.140
to sell that gas and oil if we want to
be able to get back to 350 parts per

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150
be able to get back to 350 parts per
 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.280
be able to get back to 350 parts per
million it's this huge coal reserves

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290
million it's this huge coal reserves
 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.650
million it's this huge coal reserves
that we're going to have to leave in the

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660
that we're going to have to leave in the
 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.080
that we're going to have to leave in the
ground or we could burn the coal and

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090
ground or we could burn the coal and
 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.970
ground or we could burn the coal and
capture the co2 and put it back in the

capture the co2 and put it back in the
 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.160
capture the co2 and put it back in the
ground but that's very difficult we're

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170
ground but that's very difficult we're
 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.990
ground but that's very difficult we're
going to have to move beyond fossil

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000
going to have to move beyond fossil
 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.630
going to have to move beyond fossil
