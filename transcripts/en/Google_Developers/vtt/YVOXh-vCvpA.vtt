00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:02.020
Hello, everyone.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:02.930
Welcome.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.290
My name is Craig Alleva,
a solutions architect

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.900
on the Google Cloud
Platform team.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.070
I'm here today to talk to you
about some great ways for you

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.180
to deliver massive quantities
of content to your end

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.710
users in the most efficient
performant way possible.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.720
Now imagine you've got
a killer application

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.870
running in the cloud
and millions of users

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.160
using your application.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.890
Maybe that application is
serving high definition videos

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.490
of cats, or perhaps the latest
audio for some cool new indie

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.570
bands, or very likely, a
boatload of HTML, JavaScript,

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.450
CSS, or other.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.530
You've got tons of content
to serve to your users.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.390
And those users are accustomed
to getting their content

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.530
fix in milliseconds.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.780
How are you going
to give your users

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.390
the experience they demand?

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.200
You're faced with a
number of challenges

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.750
when it comes to serving
large amounts of content

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.600
to your users.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.030
First, your users are
located all over the place.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.410
But the servers running
your application

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.110
may not be located
where your users are.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.040
How are you going to minimize
the latency for your end users?

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.820
How can you make sure that the
video you are serving to them

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.870
will actually start
playing in two seconds?

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.220
Second, content incurs
internet egress charges.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.050
These are fees that you have
to pay for transferring data

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.490
from the infrastructure running
your application to your end

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.960
users.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.570
When the amount of content
you serve increases

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.120
in terms of size, quantity, and
number of users consuming it,

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.720
these fees could really add up.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.300
Third, you want to make
sure that the performance

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.800
experienced by your end
users is unparalleled.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.390
You don't want them
to have to wait

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.050
while a page loads or constantly
have video buffer on them.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.230
Finally, you want to make
sure that your content is

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.430
served 24/7.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.830
You need to make sure
that when a user is using

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.120
your application, the content
is actually there and not being

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.170
hit with errors.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.370
Developers and
infrastructure folks

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.140
deal with these
challenges every day

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.870
and have leveraged
content delivery

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.580
networks to help overcome them.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.250
So what is a content
delivery network, or CDN?

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.470
CDN providers offer a means
to push and cache your content

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.570
as close to your
users as possible.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.940
By leveraging
relationships with ISPs,

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.390
a CDN provider often
has many points

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.970
of presence near your end users.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.260
This helps minimize
latency to content

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.730
and reduces the amount
of network egress traffic

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.580
from your origin servers
since the data is now

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.010
being served at the edge.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.340
With such a high number
of points of presence,

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.750
you also ensure high
availability and optimal

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.340
performance for your end users.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.660
So how can you leverage CDNs
with Google Cloud Platform

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.340
to get your content
to your users

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.150
as quickly and
reliably as possible?

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.710
One way to achieve this is to
leverage Google's global CDN

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.950
when storing content in
Google Cloud Storage.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.530
This is a fantastic way to get
content as close to your end

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.400
users as possible.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.830
Google has a vast network
of edge locations.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.390
Google Cloud Storage
essentially behaves like a CDN

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.730
without any work on your part
because publicly readable

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.760
objects are, by default, cached
in the Google Cloud Storage

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.080
network.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.260
You can leverage Google Cloud
Storage to serve content

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.430
like video, audio, pictures,
or your entire web application,

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.080
provided that your data
is publicly accessible.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.120
Another option would be to
leverage Fastly as your CDN.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.620
Fastly is a world
class CDN provider

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.710
that directly connects with
Google's backbone via Google

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.620
Cloud Interconnect.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.630
This means that Fastly
offers customers

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.900
phenomenal performance and
lower latency to content.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.880
The Fastly Cloud Accelerator
provides a direct connection

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.410
between their origin
shield points of presence

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.630
to Google's backbone,
allowing Fastly

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.670
to accelerate any content on
Google Cloud Storage, Google

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.250
Compute Engine, or Google
App Engine to the user.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.590
When a user first makes
a request for content,

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.760
the application attempts
to fetch the content

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.110
from the Fastly edge cache
at the edge of the network.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.470
If it's not there, it
then requests the content

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.920
from Fastly's origin
servers, which are directly

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.380
connected to Google's backbone.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.920
If the content is not
on the origin server,

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.770
the content is fetched from
the origin server sitting

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.050
on Google Cloud Platform.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.320
From there, the content is
then delivered to the end user

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.320
and cached on the origin server
and the edge cache server.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.880
When subsequent requests hit
the edge cache in the future,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.240
the content will
be there already.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.680
If content was requested
from an edge node that

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.840
doesn't have that
content in the cache,

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.130
it will fetch it from the
Fastly origin servers.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.030
Now another option for
disseminating your content

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.020
would be to leverage
services offered by Wix.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.920
Wix provides technology built
on top of Google Cloud Platform

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.220
for creating web
applications in the cloud.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.390
Wix also offers a set of
services under the Wix Media

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:15.200
Platform for storing, serving,
uploading, and managing

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.510
image, audio, and video files.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.750
These include services for
manipulating and storage

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.970
of images, transcoding,
conversion, and storage

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.270
of audio and video.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.600
These services are available
via an SDK with Google Cloud

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.330
Platform so you can leverage
the services directly

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.510
within your applications.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.180
In order to best serve your
content from Wix to your end

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.380
users, Wix offers the ability
to add a CDN for distributing

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.040
your content managed by Wix to
the edge for optimal latency,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.700
improved app performance,
and overall improved

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.660
experience for your end users.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.420
Whether you're running
a simple website

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.920
heavy on text and imagery or
you're serving video and audio

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.730
to your end customers,
leveraging a CDN

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.240
is a great option to consider.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.010
You will improve the
overall performance

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.020
of your application, thus
improving the experience

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.400
for your end users by
getting content to them

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.420
in a speedy and
consistent fashion.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.390
You'll often reduce
costs by reducing

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.410
the amount of outgoing traffic
from your origin servers

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.320
and offloading that
traffic to the CDN.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.550
And you'll provide added
redundancy and resiliency

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.790
in case of outages
or system failures.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.020
Now you know how to best deliver
your content on Google Cloud

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.670
Platform to your end customers.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.940
