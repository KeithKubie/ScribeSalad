00:00:00.486 --> 00:00:01.615
- So let's say that this house

00:00:01.615 --> 00:00:03.332
has been on the market
for a couple of weeks,

00:00:03.332 --> 00:00:07.403
and the asking price is $310,000.

00:00:07.403 --> 00:00:08.815
And you say, well, you
know this looks like

00:00:08.815 --> 00:00:10.070
the type of house, and
you're in the market

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.282
to buy a house, you say, "Hey this is

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:13.252
"a type of house that I could imagine

00:00:13.252 --> 00:00:14.648
"me and my family living in.

00:00:14.648 --> 00:00:16.116
"I would like to buy this house."

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:17.416
But you think, you know this price

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:19.115
has been on the market
for a couple of weeks.

00:00:19.115 --> 00:00:20.866
Maybe I think I could get
a better deal than this,

00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:23.665
so you decide to make an offer.

00:00:23.665 --> 00:00:26.866
You decide to make an offer for,

00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:31.332
let's say, a little
bit less, for $300,000.

00:00:31.332 --> 00:00:33.348
So the question is, how do you go,

00:00:33.348 --> 00:00:35.436
or how does your agent go about

00:00:35.436 --> 00:00:38.678
actually making an offer?

00:00:38.678 --> 00:00:40.031
Well, the way it goes is, you don't just

00:00:40.031 --> 00:00:42.998
walk up to the seller,
or the seller's agent,

00:00:42.998 --> 00:00:45.698
and say, "Okay, we're
gonna offer you $300,000,"

00:00:45.698 --> 00:00:48.303
because they don't know
whether you're serious.

00:00:48.303 --> 00:00:49.666
They don't know whether you actually

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:52.081
have the money to do it, whether you are

00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:54.148
in a position to do it,
or whether you're just

00:00:54.148 --> 00:00:57.616
kind of playing around, or
just wasting their time.

00:00:57.616 --> 00:00:59.597
And so, to prove that you're
not wasting their time,

00:00:59.597 --> 00:01:03.005
you create, or you fill out,

00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:05.561
an offer contract.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.097
So let's think about what should go,

00:01:08.097 --> 00:01:11.555
or what might go in an offer contract.

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:21.169
So, likely your agent,
if you're using an agent,

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:22.919
or even a real estate attorney,

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:25.567
or you could even find some
of these forms on the web,

00:01:25.567 --> 00:01:28.451
you would create a contract,

00:01:28.451 --> 00:01:31.233
and there's some basic
information that you would want.

00:01:31.233 --> 00:01:33.867
You would obviously want info,

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:36.412
info on the property,

00:01:36.412 --> 00:01:39.419
what's its address, the property,

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:42.523
who's buying, yourself,

00:01:42.523 --> 00:01:45.583
so the buyer and the seller,

00:01:45.583 --> 00:01:46.751
this is just to kind of know, hey,

00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:48.201
what is this contract about?

00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:49.300
It's about this property,

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.766
and who's getting into this contract,

00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:53.800
and then you'd want to put some

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.468
information about the actual offer,

00:01:56.468 --> 00:01:59.284
so, you would put your offer in.

00:01:59.284 --> 00:02:03.668
You'd say, "Okay, I'm
going to offer $300,000."

00:02:08.084 --> 00:02:09.368
And then you also want
to prove that, look,

00:02:09.368 --> 00:02:11.869
you're not just playing around with them,

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:13.251
that you're serious about this.

00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:17.229
This offer is made in
earnest, and so you will

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:20.315
give a deposit when you
make this offer contract,

00:02:20.315 --> 00:02:23.171
or it's typical to give a deposit,

00:02:23.986 --> 00:02:24.865
and it will vary.

00:02:24.865 --> 00:02:26.283
The higher the deposit, the better,

00:02:26.283 --> 00:02:28.514
because it shows the more earnest you are,

00:02:28.514 --> 00:02:30.617
the more serious that
you are about actually

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:32.664
going through with this offer contract.

00:02:32.664 --> 00:02:35.883
It's typical for these deposits
to be anywhere between,

00:02:35.883 --> 00:02:38.449
I've seen one percent, two
percent, three percent,

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:41.483
four percent, five percent
of the actual home price.

00:02:41.483 --> 00:02:43.831
Three percent is what
I'm most familiar with,

00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:45.083
but it doesn't have to be three percent.

00:02:45.083 --> 00:02:47.865
It's really, this is just
an indicator to the seller

00:02:47.865 --> 00:02:49.304
that you're serious about this.

00:02:49.304 --> 00:02:51.232
So you're gonna write a check right now,

00:02:51.232 --> 00:02:53.005
along with the offer contract,

00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:55.565
for let's just say three
percent of the offer price.

00:02:55.565 --> 00:02:58.209
So three percent of $300,000

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.182
is $9,000, that's a $9,000 check.

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:04.714
Some places, it's not a percentage,

00:03:04.714 --> 00:03:06.649
some people say, "Okay,
you just give $1,000,

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:09.049
"or give $2,000," whatever it is.

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.649
But this money, once
again, this is a check

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:13.664
that you're writing
with the offer contract.

00:03:13.664 --> 00:03:16.149
This shows that you
are serious about this,

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:17.900
that if for whatever reason you don't meet

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.098
your end of the contract, then the seller

00:03:21.098 --> 00:03:23.331
might be able to just keep this money,

00:03:23.331 --> 00:03:28.072
so this shows that you are serious.

00:03:28.533 --> 00:03:31.534
This shows that you
are serious right here,

00:03:31.534 --> 00:03:32.965
that they should take you seriously,

00:03:32.965 --> 00:03:35.116
and that they should
go through the process

00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:39.415
of trying to close on this property,

00:03:39.415 --> 00:03:42.670
and we'll talk in future videos
more about what closing is.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.865
Now, you're probably
thinking, "Okay, look,

00:03:43.865 --> 00:03:45.803
"I'm just not gonna buy this outright.

00:03:45.803 --> 00:03:47.566
"I've toured the home, I like it.

00:03:47.566 --> 00:03:49.065
"I like the neighborhood, it seems to be

00:03:49.065 --> 00:03:51.248
"in good condition, but
I don't know for a fact

00:03:51.248 --> 00:03:52.181
"that it's in good condition,

00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:54.381
"unless I have a chance to inspect it,

00:03:54.381 --> 00:03:56.900
"unless I have a chance to
get some experts in there

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.613
"and make sure that the
house is in good condition."

00:03:59.613 --> 00:04:02.232
And to make sure of that, it's typical

00:04:02.232 --> 00:04:06.845
to throw some contingencies
in your offer contract.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.767
Now, the most typical contingencies

00:04:12.767 --> 00:04:16.546
are things like inspections,
so you might want to

00:04:16.546 --> 00:04:20.537
inspect for termites, you want
to inspect the foundation,

00:04:20.537 --> 00:04:23.428
you want to inspect the
plumbing, the electrical,

00:04:23.428 --> 00:04:25.296
and make sure that it's
all on the up and up.

00:04:25.296 --> 00:04:27.579
If something comes up in the inspection

00:04:27.579 --> 00:04:30.326
that makes this house not
what you thought it was,

00:04:30.326 --> 00:04:33.124
it allows you to get out of this contract,

00:04:33.124 --> 00:04:35.834
and hopefully get your deposit back.

00:04:35.834 --> 00:04:36.955
Now, other things that you might want to

00:04:36.955 --> 00:04:39.325
put a contingency on, well you think that

00:04:39.325 --> 00:04:41.275
you're going to be able to get $300,000.

00:04:41.275 --> 00:04:43.859
Maybe you have saved enough for a deposit.

00:04:43.859 --> 00:04:45.424
You've saved, let's
say 20 percent of this,

00:04:45.424 --> 00:04:48.474
so you have saved say, $60,000,

00:04:48.474 --> 00:04:51.242
or maybe you've saved 70
or 80 thousand dollars,

00:04:51.242 --> 00:04:53.892
'cause you also need some
extra money for closing costs,

00:04:53.892 --> 00:04:55.441
and whatever else, and
we'll talk about that

00:04:55.441 --> 00:04:57.458
in future videos, and
maybe to buy furniture,

00:04:57.458 --> 00:05:00.491
whatever else, so you've saved
70 or 80 thousand dollars,

00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:03.058
but the remainder of it,
you're going to need to borrow.

00:05:03.058 --> 00:05:04.390
And you're going to need
to borrow it from a bank.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.808
The bank has written a
letter to you saying,

00:05:05.808 --> 00:05:08.259
"Hey, based on your income
and your credit score,

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:11.858
"we feel we have pre-approved your loan,

00:05:11.858 --> 00:05:13.775
"we think you're going to get the loan."

00:05:13.775 --> 00:05:16.441
But that's not the same thing
as actually getting the loan.

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:18.992
Something might happen,
the bank might realize

00:05:18.992 --> 00:05:20.540
that they didn't notice
something about you,

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.691
or the financing conditions might change

00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:24.741
in between the time that
you got your pre-approval

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:27.660
and the time that you
actually need your loan.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.540
So another typical contingency
that you might have

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.776
is a financing contingency saying,

00:05:31.776 --> 00:05:34.224
"Look, I really do want to buy this house,

00:05:34.224 --> 00:05:36.358
"but I'm clearly not
going to be able to buy it

00:05:36.358 --> 00:05:38.841
"unless I get some financing."

00:05:38.841 --> 00:05:40.575
And then other things that might be there

00:05:40.575 --> 00:05:43.077
are things like insurance.

00:05:43.077 --> 00:05:45.540
Why would you need a
contingency on insurance?

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.207
Now this one's less typical,

00:05:47.207 --> 00:05:48.742
so I'll put a little asterisk there.

00:05:48.742 --> 00:05:52.075
Well, there might be a place
that has a lot of floods,

00:05:52.075 --> 00:05:53.441
and the old owner had flood insurance

00:05:53.441 --> 00:05:54.608
just because they already owned it,

00:05:54.608 --> 00:05:57.041
but now the insurance
companies aren't issuing

00:05:57.041 --> 00:05:59.257
new insurance, because
it's so prone to flooding,

00:05:59.257 --> 00:06:00.325
or something like that,

00:06:00.325 --> 00:06:02.570
so flooding insurance might be there.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.992
There's a clear title,
is obviously something

00:06:05.992 --> 00:06:10.075
that you would need if you
wanted to buy this house,

00:06:10.075 --> 00:06:12.025
or that you probably should need,

00:06:12.025 --> 00:06:14.724
and once again there's
other videos on that.

00:06:14.724 --> 00:06:17.044
So these are all things that
if, for whatever reason,

00:06:17.044 --> 00:06:21.241
if these things fall through,
it allows you to unwind it.

00:06:21.241 --> 00:06:23.410
Now if you're in a really
hot real estate market,

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.441
where there's many, many people bidding

00:06:25.441 --> 00:06:27.908
on the same property, and
some of them are coming

00:06:27.908 --> 00:06:30.841
with really juicy offers,

00:06:30.841 --> 00:06:32.576
where maybe they're
offering to pay it in cash,

00:06:32.576 --> 00:06:33.874
or they're offering other things,

00:06:33.874 --> 00:06:38.425
then it's not atypical to
have fewer contingencies,

00:06:38.425 --> 00:06:40.441
because, remember, from
the seller's point of view,

00:06:40.441 --> 00:06:44.108
they want the most serious buyer,

00:06:44.108 --> 00:06:46.908
and if someone is willing to
waive their contingencies,

00:06:46.908 --> 00:06:48.707
they're like, "Hey, look,
I know this is crazy,

00:06:48.707 --> 00:06:51.103
"but I'm just willing to get the house

00:06:51.103 --> 00:06:53.026
"in whatever condition it is,"

00:06:53.026 --> 00:06:55.359
that's a lot more
attractive to the seller,

00:06:55.359 --> 00:06:58.110
because the seller feels
good that the transaction

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.741
won't fall through because
of one of these things.

00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:02.957
But that's in a very, very,
very hot real estate market.

00:07:02.957 --> 00:07:04.525
In a more typical real estate market,

00:07:04.525 --> 00:07:06.840
I suggest you talk to people, realtors,

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.475
other people in the industry,

00:07:07.475 --> 00:07:09.641
to figure out what's
going on in your market.

00:07:09.641 --> 00:07:11.858
It's more typical to have stuff like this,

00:07:11.858 --> 00:07:16.401
especially the inspections,
the financing, and the title.

00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:17.576
Now, the last part of it,

00:07:17.576 --> 00:07:19.525
and I'm glazing over a lot of details,

00:07:19.525 --> 00:07:20.992
in future videos, we
might actually look at

00:07:20.992 --> 00:07:22.641
an actual offer contract,

00:07:22.641 --> 00:07:25.567
you would want to throw
out the closing date.

00:07:28.675 --> 00:07:30.584
So it may be this offer contract,

00:07:30.584 --> 00:07:33.784
let's say it's made on

00:07:33.784 --> 00:07:38.664
October 15th of 2015,

00:07:38.664 --> 00:07:40.284
and let's say that you want to close,

00:07:40.284 --> 00:07:42.100
so that you want all of
this stuff to get done,

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.418
and you actually want to get the seller

00:07:44.418 --> 00:07:46.618
the whole amount of the money,

00:07:46.618 --> 00:07:48.784
and you want to get
the title to the house,

00:07:48.784 --> 00:07:50.901
let's say you want to
have it in two months,

00:07:50.901 --> 00:07:55.803
so 12/15/2015.

00:07:55.803 --> 00:07:58.784
And once again, from a
seller's point of view,

00:07:58.784 --> 00:08:01.517
the closer in this closing
date, the more that they

00:08:01.517 --> 00:08:04.683
feel good that this transaction
is actually going to happen.

00:08:04.683 --> 00:08:07.571
So if you wanted to make a very
tempting offer to a seller,

00:08:07.571 --> 00:08:10.668
you would have as few
contingencies as possible,

00:08:10.668 --> 00:08:13.217
and you would make this closing
date as soon as possible,

00:08:13.217 --> 00:08:15.967
but if it's not a super-hot
real estate market,

00:08:15.967 --> 00:08:18.133
you don't need to go
through all of that trouble,

00:08:18.133 --> 00:08:20.668
and it's fairly prudent
to get inspections,

00:08:20.668 --> 00:08:22.551
and have contingencies on all of these,

00:08:22.551 --> 00:08:25.001
or things like this, not
necessarily all of them,

00:08:25.001 --> 00:08:27.054
but things like this.
