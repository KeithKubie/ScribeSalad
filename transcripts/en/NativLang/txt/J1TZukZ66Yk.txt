Speaker 1:          00:00          Today to updates and to vote for you first. I suggested it in the last video, but I'm announcing it here. Yes, we're going on an animated journey through the history of writing. It'll be fun and honest to the concepts, but it may take its share of historical liberties to put you into the role of the main character. I'm hoping that the resulting videos will be watchable back to back as a single story. Tune in to see how it all pans out. Second, a conundrum for some of you. The very first time we met was an animated wonderment and then down the line maybe that suggested older videos with me lecturing at you. Other people came in the other way, looking for good information. Dumping then got puzzled at me wandering through a land of linguistic curiosities. This setting up of expectations in marketing gets called a brand promise.

Speaker 1:          00:47          What I'm worried about is that this disconnect leaves some of you disoriented. It's like a broken brand promise. I don't have a solution for this yet other than making you aware of this change over time and refreshing old thumbnails to make those old videos look more like a backup library of resources for us to draw on. So it's a very matchmaker that brings us together. Also stacks me up against other channels, partly based on how many of my videos you watch in a single sitting. This discontinuity in your viewing experience can hurt me too. Speaking of your viewing experience, which day of the week would you most like to see me? A blow new videos still Friday or Tuesday or a different day? Click to vote for your favorite day and stick around for language.
