scientific research I mean a lot of this

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:01.740
scientific research I mean a lot of this
 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.579
scientific research I mean a lot of this
research there's meta analyses that's

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589
research there's meta analyses that's
 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.109
research there's meta analyses that's
where you pull together lots of

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119
where you pull together lots of
 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.539
where you pull together lots of
different studies and you have a lot of

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549
different studies and you have a lot of
 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.959
different studies and you have a lot of
confidence that certain things are real

effects and I'll give you some examples
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.599
effects and I'll give you some examples
that may surprise people for example

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:17.609
that may surprise people for example
 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:20.810
that may surprise people for example
before you show somebody a photo array

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820
before you show somebody a photo array
 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.660
before you show somebody a photo array
or a live lineup you should tell the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670
or a live lineup you should tell the
 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.749
or a live lineup you should tell the
witness we're now going to show you some

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759
witness we're now going to show you some
 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.249
witness we're now going to show you some
pictures or people please keep in mind

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259
pictures or people please keep in mind
 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.380
pictures or people please keep in mind
that the real perpetrator may or may not

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390
that the real perpetrator may or may not
 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.719
that the real perpetrator may or may not
be in this photo array or a lineup and

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729
be in this photo array or a lineup and
 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.190
be in this photo array or a lineup and
if you don't make an identification

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200
if you don't make an identification
 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.499
if you don't make an identification
don't worry the investigation will

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509
don't worry the investigation will
 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.880
don't worry the investigation will
continue just giving that morning

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.410
continue just giving that morning
dramatically reduces incorrect

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420
dramatically reduces incorrect
 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.349
dramatically reduces incorrect
identification without really reducing

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359
identification without really reducing
 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:50.809
identification without really reducing
correct identifications and that's of

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819
correct identifications and that's of
 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:52.940
correct identifications and that's of
extraordinary importance obviously in

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950
extraordinary importance obviously in
 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.620
extraordinary importance obviously in
terms of being able to go out find the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630
terms of being able to go out find the
 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.179
terms of being able to go out find the
real perpetrator and not arrest the

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189
real perpetrator and not arrest the
 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.050
real perpetrator and not arrest the
wrong person there's lots of reasons we

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060
wrong person there's lots of reasons we
 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.039
wrong person there's lots of reasons we
think that this warning will reduce era

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049
think that this warning will reduce era
 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.510
think that this warning will reduce era
certainly it inhibits people from

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520
certainly it inhibits people from
 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.600
certainly it inhibits people from
guessing and there's kind of a natural

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610
guessing and there's kind of a natural
 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.070
guessing and there's kind of a natural
inclination to do that another reform

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080
inclination to do that another reform
 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.100
inclination to do that another reform
that's of really critical importance

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110
that's of really critical importance
 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.230
that's of really critical importance
is that the person that administers the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240
is that the person that administers the
 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.150
is that the person that administers the
lineup of the photo array should be

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160
lineup of the photo array should be
 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.040
lineup of the photo array should be
double blinded that is to say that the

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050
double blinded that is to say that the
 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.450
double blinded that is to say that the
person should not know who the suspect

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460
person should not know who the suspect
 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.380
person should not know who the suspect
is and that's important for many reasons

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390
is and that's important for many reasons
 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.040
is and that's important for many reasons
not the least of which is the

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050
not the least of which is the
 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:41.450
not the least of which is the
possibility of feedback confirming

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460
possibility of feedback confirming
 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.360
possibility of feedback confirming
feedback what again meta analyses have

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370
feedback what again meta analyses have
 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.160
feedback what again meta analyses have
shown is that if you say to somebody off

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170
shown is that if you say to somebody off
 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.530
shown is that if you say to somebody off
you picked that number to good or give

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540
you picked that number to good or give
 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.690
you picked that number to good or give
some kind of confirming feedback whether

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700
some kind of confirming feedback whether
 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.979
some kind of confirming feedback whether
you're a law enforcement person or

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989
you're a law enforcement person or
 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.830
you're a law enforcement person or
somebody else frankly what this does is

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840
somebody else frankly what this does is
 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.790
somebody else frankly what this does is
it can falsely inflate the person's

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800
it can falsely inflate the person's
 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.949
it can falsely inflate the person's
certainty that they made the correct

certainty that they made the correct
 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.620
certainty that they made the correct
identification the witnesses believed

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630
identification the witnesses believed
 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.180
identification the witnesses believed
that they had a good opportunity to

that they had a good opportunity to
 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.400
that they had a good opportunity to
observe the witness's belief that they

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410
observe the witness's belief that they
 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.190
observe the witness's belief that they
were paying attention when the crime was

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200
were paying attention when the crime was
 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.790

the courts used to be using for views
frankly in trying to weigh the

frankly in trying to weigh the
 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.490
frankly in trying to weigh the
reliability of identification when we

more than a year ago now the National
 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.890
more than a year ago now the National
Academy of Science came out with a

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900
Academy of Science came out with a
 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.420
Academy of Science came out with a
report about forensic science generally

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430
report about forensic science generally
 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.410
report about forensic science generally
extremely important report a landmark

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420
extremely important report a landmark
 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.690
extremely important report a landmark
report that anybody really interested in

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700
report that anybody really interested in
 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.510
report that anybody really interested in
this field should look at and this

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520
this field should look at and this
 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.250
this field should look at and this
report basically said look DNA testing

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260
report basically said look DNA testing
 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.800
report basically said look DNA testing
is the only validated forensic

is the only validated forensic
 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.050
is the only validated forensic
discipline we have and in particular

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060
discipline we have and in particular
 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.780
discipline we have and in particular
when you look at pattern evidence and by

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790
when you look at pattern evidence and by
 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:25.740
when you look at pattern evidence and by
this they were talking about

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750
this they were talking about
 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.100
this they were talking about
fingerprints and tire tracks and looking

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110
fingerprints and tire tracks and looking
 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.380
fingerprints and tire tracks and looking
at striations on bullets and trying to

coming into court and saying I'm looking
 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.960
coming into court and saying I'm looking
at the striations of this bullet that we

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970
at the striations of this bullet that we
 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.030
at the striations of this bullet that we
recovered from the crime scene and now I

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040
recovered from the crime scene and now I
 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.950
recovered from the crime scene and now I
found this defendants gun and I fired a

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960
found this defendants gun and I fired a
 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.300
found this defendants gun and I fired a
bullet from that and I'm looking at the

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310
bullet from that and I'm looking at the
 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.010
bullet from that and I'm looking at the
two of them under a microscope and I see

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020
two of them under a microscope and I see
 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.780
two of them under a microscope and I see
all these lines and I think there's

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790
all these lines and I think there's
 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.520
all these lines and I think there's
quote/unquote sufficient agreement and
