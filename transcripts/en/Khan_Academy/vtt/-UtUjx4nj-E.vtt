00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.350
Actually, before moving on to
the next problem, sometimes at

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.980
the end of a video I really rush
it, just because I have

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.330
that silly YouTube 10
minute deadline.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.270
And I want you to really
understand this point here, of

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.200
why I picked the negative
2 and the positive 3.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.670
Let me erase some of this and
kind of show you what my

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.805
thought process was.

00:00:21.805 --> 00:00:23.740
So I'm using the paintbrush
tool.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.460
Let me just blank it all out.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.830
So if I just blank that
out, and I could

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.730
actually blank this out.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.240
I'm just blanking
everything out.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.790
I could have just erased
everything, but anyway.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.860
So the possible terms again,
once again, were 0 plus or

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.550
minus 2, and 5 plus
or minus 3.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.790
And I want to show you why I
picked the lowest value here,

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.510
and the highest value here.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.160
So let me graph those points.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.710
That's my y-axis.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.020
This is my x-axis.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:23.140
And so, first I have
the point, 0 comma

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.410
plus 2 or minus 2.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:30.580
So this is 0, 2.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.830
This is 0, minus 2.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.670
And then we have 5.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.340
Let's say this is 5 out here.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.960
I'm going to say this
is 3 up here.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.310
This is 5, positive 3, and then
5, negative 3 will be

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.960
someplace around here,
just not scaled up.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.760
I have to squeeze at the bottom,
but you get the point.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.050
So there's a bunch of lines that
could connect this whole

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.880
set of points, right?

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.660
I'm going to do them in
different colors.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.380
You have this line.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.150
You have this line.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.010
You have this line.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.650
And then you have this line.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.070
Well, we want the highest
possible slope.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.290
And you could probably just
inspect it and say, well, the

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.540
highest possible slope is the
one that moves up the

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.310
steepest. So it'll
be this line.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.850
And this line and this line are
negative slopes, so that's

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:29.820
not a high slope.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.230
And the way I did it,
intuitively, I said, well, in

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.280
order to have a high slope,
I want as high a

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.690
change in y as possible.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:49.480
I want to maximize my change
in y, given my change in x.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.280
And that's why I picked the
lowest y and the highest y.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.330
If I wanted the lowest possible
slope, I would have

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.150
picked positive 2
and negative 3.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.350
Hopefully that makes a little
bit more sense.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:11.720
Let's see, let's do
problem number 18.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.930
Esther drove to work in the
morning at an average speed of

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.610
45 miles per hour.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.690
45 miles per hour is how
fast Esther drove.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.940
So this is to work.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.540
She returned home in the
evening, along the same route

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.370
at an average of 30
miles per hour.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.900
30 miles per hour-- maybe
there was more

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.980
traffic-- from work.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.460
If Esther spent a total of one
hour commuting to and from

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:54.710
work, so one hour total, how
many miles did Esther drive to

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.750
work in the morning?

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.620
So this is a simple distance
is equal to rate

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.890
times to time problem.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:06.635
But it's a little fancy.

00:04:06.635 --> 00:04:08.380
It gets a little confusing.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:15.020
So let's just say that d is
the distance to work.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.290
And then we'll just solve
for d, right?

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:24.190
So if d is the distance to work,
how far did she go in

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.180
the morning?

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.840
So in the morning we have the
distance she went in the

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.790
morning is going to be equal
to 45 miles per hour.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.750
That's the rate.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.290
45 miles per hour
times the time.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.880
So let's just call
that times t.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.510
That's what she did
in the morning.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.500
She went 45 miles an
hour times however

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.160
long it took her.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.300
Then in the afternoon, she's
going to go to the same

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.340
distance, right?

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.020
This time she went 30
miles per hour.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.540
Now, how long did it take her?

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.410
Well, this is the interesting
thing.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.090
It took her a total of one
hour to go to work

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.670
and back from work.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:18.110
If it took her t hours in the
morning, then it took her 1

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.370
minus t hours.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.320
Actually, let's do
it in minutes.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.230
Let's assume t is in minutes.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:32.740
So then one hour is 60,
60 minus t minutes.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:33.990
Actually, I have to stay within
hours, because these

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.280
are all miles per hour.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.010
So forgive me.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.620
1 minus t.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.220
Does that make sense?

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.570
This one, I think, will
make sense to you.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.540
45 miles per hour times however

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.480
many hours she traveled.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.390
It tells you how many
miles she went.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.260
This time you have her speed,
30 miles per hour, times the

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.530
time she traveled.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.350
Well, the time she traveled in
the afternoon is going to be

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.150
one hour minus whatever she
traveled in the morning.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.500
Because when you combine in the
morning and afternoon, she

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.490
traveled for a total
of one hour.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.485
For example, if she took 15
minutes to go in the morning,

00:06:11.485 --> 00:06:14.060
then that means it took
her 45 minutes to

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.980
come back in the afternoon.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.320
Hopefully that makes sense.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.510
But these are the
same d's, right?

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.550
So we could set them equal
to each other.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:31.500
So we could say 45 times t is
equal to 30 times 1 minus t.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.870
Let me see.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:38.290
45t is equal to 30 minus 30t.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:43.960
And then we can add 30t to both
sides and you get 75t is

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.550
equal to 30.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:51.000
Then we get t is equal
to 30/75 hours.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.905
And if we divide the top and
the bottom by 5, we get 6

00:06:56.905 --> 00:07:01.070
over-- 5 goes into this
how many times?

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.490
Actually, yeah, let
me divide it by 5.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.430
5 goes into 10, 15, right?

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.460
I could divide by a better
number than 5.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.815
Actually, I could divide the
top and the bottom by 15.

00:07:11.815 --> 00:07:17.110
And you get 2/5.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.600
Or just take this and divide
the top and bottom

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.420
by 3, you get 2/5.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.680
So time is equal to 2/5 hours.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.590
That's 24 minutes,
roughly, right?

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.600
So we go back to the distance.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.240
And remember, t is how long it
took her in the morning.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.460
In the afternoon, it's going to
be 1 minus this, so in the

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.920
afternoon it took her
1 minus this.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.420
This would be 3/5 hours.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.940
The question is, how
many miles did she

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.110
go to and from work?

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.390
So that's d.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.510
Well, d is 45 times t.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.950
t is 2/5.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:59.333
45 times 2/5 is d.

00:07:59.333 --> 00:08:03.720
It comes to 9, cancel that,
so it comes to 8.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.670
18, I mean.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.050
9 times 2 is 18.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:10.440
So d is equal to 18 miles.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.910
And we are done, our
second SAT section.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.530
I hope I didn't confuse
you too much.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.000
See you soon.
