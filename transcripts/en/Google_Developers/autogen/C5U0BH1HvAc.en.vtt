00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.720
 Zach Lieberman 

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:04.880
 &lt;i&gt;(New York)&lt;/i&gt; 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.000
 I try to bring happiness to everyone and make people laugh. 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.320
 I try to create an unusual moment for everyone. 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.360
 I am studying art. 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.920
 Learning oil painting and printmaking 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.760
 Animation is always my hobby 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.360
 Animation can make things alive, I like this concept 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.040
 And coding makes things come alive 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.440
 I am fascinated by this idea. 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.600
 Many of the projects I participated in involved motion and drawing 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.480
 "As long as you can draw it, you can make it." 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.320
 What is the significance of marking? 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.920
 Is it really important to draw a line on a piece of paper? 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.000
 It’s like saying “Go here” 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.360
 I often ask questions about "what if..." 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.600
 What would an automatic line expansion look like? 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.240
 You can only get the answer by coding. 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.120
 I think we need a poetic culture. 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.560
 I use "poetic calculations" to describe our work. 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.640
 For me, poetry is to arrange the right words in the proper order. 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.800
 The same is true for code 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.520
 The number of these words is extremely streamlined 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.280
 Are some very specific words that allow the computer to perform specific operations. 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.040
 What often happens now is 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.600
 We enter the museum in a curvilinear way through unconventional means 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.520
 The upcoming next generation museum curator 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.360
 Will gradually learn this treatment and these tools 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.480
 And become part of this community 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.120
 So as we grow together 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.120
 This art form will increasingly be recognized by the art world. 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.480
 A lot of my work is coding but I need to build things 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.200
 I will spend a lot of time looking for materials 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.720
 Such as used speakers and components 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.240
 And sometimes this is really useful for getting inspiration. 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.320
 Our surroundings are full of data 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.320
 One of the phenomena is when we enter the taxi 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.160
 I don't know what the radio will play. 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.400
 May be a radio talk show or a sports show, or a Senegalese music 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.360
 My DevArt proposal is called "Playing the World" 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.200
 This is a keyboard you just press a note 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.960
 The system will find this note in the audio stream that is played globally in real time. 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.720
 These projects always originate from a crazy idea 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.120
 One of my responsibilities is to trouble myself. 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.280
 Then try to free yourself from trouble. 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.520
 After being appointed 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.640
 You will be working side by side with Zach Lieberman of the Barbican Arts Centre in London. 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.800
 The art of code creation
