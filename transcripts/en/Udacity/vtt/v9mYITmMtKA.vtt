00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.589
Okay, hopefully you gathered that you share approximately 25%

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:06.830
genetic identity with any given grandparent. I mean think about

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.360
it. Half your chromosomes come from mom and half

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.280
come from dad, so you're 50% a parent and your

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.420
parent is 50% their parents. And because they're able

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.790
to mix and match, their parents genetic code, so that

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.648
they pass on to you, any given chromosome is

00:00:21.648 --> 00:00:25.620
a, should be a roughly equal mix of their parents,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:31.970
you are going to be half what your parents are, half of half or 50%

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.150
of 50% is 25% in this case and recombination is the main reason this is true
