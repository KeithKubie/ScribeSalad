00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:07.540
(birds chirping)

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.276
(deep breathing)

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:15.749
- Hey Martin.

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:19.753 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Hey, how did you
know it was me?

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:21.021
- I know every creak
in these floor boards,

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:23.023
I'm one with this house.

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.526
What could I do for you?

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.728
- I know I'm new here but my
parents are visiting later

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:31.865
and I was wondering if maybe
we could address the smell?

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.299
- What smell?

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:35.001 align:start size:97% position:3%
- The smell, it's like
rotten eggs in a locker room.

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:36.469 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I haven't left the
house in 16 days.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.104
- Maybe just stick your
head outside the window

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:39.205
for a second and then.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:40.106
- Okay.

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:41.941
(sniffs)

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:42.742
(vomiting)

00:00:42.742 --> 00:00:43.576
- Oh!

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:44.778
Oh yeah.

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:45.745 align:start size:84% position:16%
Yeah, there's
definitely a smell,

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:47.781
it's like a stir fry of dicks.

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:51.551
Okay, tell your parents
to take the long way.

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:54.888
We're gonna stink hunting.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:57.557
(intense music)

00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:04.931 line:0%
- Chug, chug, chug, go Nick!

00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:06.132
- Ha ha, Nick.

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:07.367
- Hey Cal.

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:08.201
- [Cal] Hey.

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:09.135
- Martin

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:10.470
- Hey man, you smell that smell?

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.938
Martin found it.

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:13.373 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Oh yeah, I actually
found it before Martin did

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:16.342
and I was gonna say
that, we should,

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:18.011
what, what do you
wanna do about it?

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:18.945
- Well let's go find it!

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:20.213
- Yes, mission!

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:22.582
Wooh!

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:24.084 line:0%
- What, what's that bong?

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:27.353 line:0%
Oh, you want me to take deep
long tokes of your dank buds?

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:29.689 line:0%
Alright bro, you asked for it!

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.692 align:start position:0%
- Cornell, Betsy, something
smells like (mumbling) underwear

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:33.893
and we have to find it.

00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:35.862
- Yeah, well I'm not
smelling for jill squat

00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:37.897
until I'm done with
my workout, alright?

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:39.232
(grunting)

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:41.134
This is your face Cal!

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:42.035
Yeah, yeah!

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:47.340
Ugh, alright, let's do this,

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.008
you're not the boss of me.

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:50.844
- Hey man, you know I'm down.

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:54.380
Just gonna stash the
munchies for later.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.649
(sniffing)

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:00.787 line:0%
- Hey, what's going on bros?

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:02.288 line:0%
Doing some sniffing?

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:04.457 align:start size:97% position:3%
I guess I could get the
old nose out of retirement.

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.459
Or we could watch a movie.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:07.861
I tried to rent, In the Bedroom

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:09.329
but I got, The Room.

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:10.497
That movie is good.

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:12.732
- Guys, I think I found it.

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:16.669
(vomiting)

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.139
What have you done to
our secondary bathroom?

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.640 align:start size:94% position:6%
- [Guy Roommate 1] That's
my secondary kitchen!

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.575
- [Girl Roommate 1]
My walk in hamper!

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:26.980 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Guys, we're gonna need
to clean this, today.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.116 align:start size:94% position:6%
Der, luckily we could
just spin the chore wheel.

00:02:30.116 --> 00:02:31.651
I figured out, it's right here.

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:34.120
Let's give it a little spin.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.388
Oh my god!

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:37.490
(screaming)

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.292 align:start size:84% position:16%
That was my grandma's
chore wheel.

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:40.727
- Okay, we have a back up plan.

00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:42.395 align:start size:97% position:3%
Remember, we put the apartment
chart on the Olf poster

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:43.863
and it says,

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:46.366 align:start size:97% position:3%
"he who cleaned last must
choose his or her successor".

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:49.335
- Okay, so who cleaned last?

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:53.306
- I did, you guys made
me clean when I moved in.

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:54.841
- Martin gets to choose.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:58.178
(dramatic music)

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:02.215 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Um, I guess I'll go inside
and see who made the mess

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:04.117
and then we'll go from there.

00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:06.019
- Yeah, good idea, great idea.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:06.853
- Great idea.
- Great idea.

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:07.687
- Good idea

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:08.521
- It's a wonderful idea.

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:09.789
- Good idea.

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:13.326
- Guys, I think I'm
gonna help him out.

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:16.162
Marty, let me lay down
the law for you here.

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:17.730
There's six people in this house

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.965
and the only way it all works

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:20.200
is with a clear
chain of command.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.135
If me, our leader appears weak,

00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:25.572
the whole system collapses,
do you get what I'm saying?

00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:27.640 align:start size:88% position:13%
- That you don't want
me to pick you to clean.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.409
- I didn't say that.

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:30.944
Did you fart?

00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:33.179
- Guys, Cal's been in there
for 45 seconds with Martin.

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:37.850
Something is happening, we
need to forge an alliance.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.352
- So, when they tell us to clean

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:40.920
we're like, no way?

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:43.923
That's so tight.

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:48.394
- Listen Cal, you're my
best friend of all time

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:49.929
that's why you need to know

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:51.598
that there's talk of
an alliance out there.

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:53.132
- Alliance?

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:56.102 align:start size:97% position:3%
They want an alliance,
they're gonna get one from us.

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:56.936
- Hey.

00:03:56.936 --> 00:03:57.904
- Yeah?

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:58.871
- Can it just be you and me?

00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:00.440
- No that's stupid.

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:07.413
- What the?

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:08.982
Cornell,

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:11.384
that backstabbing sack.

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:14.921 align:start size:94% position:6%
Alright, you and I, we
have got to become allies.

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:17.156
- Oh, we're not so
different you and I.

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:17.991
- No.

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:19.259
(laughing)

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.260
- Look man, I don't know
what you're going to say

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.428
but I plan on being fair.

00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:24.430
- Oh hey man, what's up?

00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:26.733
What's up!

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:30.270
(laughing)

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.671
- I don't know who
to trust anymore man,

00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:34.974 align:start size:84% position:16%
it's like everything
is falling apart.

00:04:34.974 --> 00:04:35.875
- Trust me.

00:04:37.677 --> 00:04:38.578
- Forever.

00:04:38.578 --> 00:04:39.846
- You want me as an ally

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:40.780
- Okay.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.948
- You want me as an ally.

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:42.782 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh I've always
wanted you as an ally

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:44.017
- I can protect you

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:45.852
- Would you like to
dance with the devil?

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:48.388
- I'll dance with you
until the day I die.

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:49.856
- What the hell was that about,

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:50.957
I thought we had an alliance?

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:52.125
- No, no, no listen baby.

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:53.393
- I wanna be with you.

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:55.028
- Prove it, let me eat
a tiny piece of you.

00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:56.429
- I have your son.

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:57.764
- Give him back.

00:04:58.665 --> 00:05:00.300
- He just said he has my son.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.234 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I don't care
who's got your son.

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:02.035
- I don't even have a son.

00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:03.269
- We had an alliance.

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:04.203
- I wanna raise
a child with you.

00:05:04.203 --> 00:05:08.308
(talking over each other)

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:09.309
- What's up!

00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:12.178
You guys remember that?

00:05:12.178 --> 00:05:14.247
(everyone agreeing)

00:05:14.247 --> 00:05:16.549 align:start size:88% position:13%
- That's a great one,
it's a great commercial.

00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:17.650
- What are you doing?

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.918
Get off of him!

00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:23.723
(screaming)

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.964
- Hey guys.

00:05:32.932 --> 00:05:34.300
Look, it's not that bad okay?

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.469
I'll just clean it myself.

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:38.171
- Oh
- Oh

00:05:40.673 --> 00:05:42.442
- That's convenient.

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:45.011
- What a hero.

00:05:46.813 --> 00:05:48.981
- I'll clean the bathroom now.

00:05:48.981 --> 00:05:51.150
- Who's the smart guy now?

00:05:56.956 --> 00:05:58.691
- [Cal] I got the
plunger, I win!

00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:00.860
(vomiting)
