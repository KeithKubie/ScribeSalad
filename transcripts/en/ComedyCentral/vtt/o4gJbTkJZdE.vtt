00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:03.102 align:start size:88% position:13%
And anything you could do in
here would be awesome.

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.538 align:start size:88% position:13%
I can't believe I can
afford an interior designer.

00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:07.573 align:start size:63% position:38%
This is all very new
for me.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.209 align:start position:0%
Well, the space
is fabulous.

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:10.510 align:start size:16% position:84% line:85%
Yeah?

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:10.510 align:start position:0%
Yeah.

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:11.711 align:start position:0%
In here, I'm thinking
we do

00:00:11.777 --> 00:00:14.881 align:start position:0%
a classic
hand-woven Belgian rug

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:19.118 align:start position:0%
and then rich fabrics,
sconces, tote linens.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:20.820 align:start size:34% position:66%
Sconces--
Oh, my God.

00:00:20.886 --> 00:00:22.288 align:start position:0%
Yeah, we could even
do a brushed

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:23.890 align:start position:0%
cotton twill
window treatment.

00:00:23.956 --> 00:00:25.358 align:start position:0%
Very elegant.

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:27.226 align:start size:75% position:25%
This place needs to feel
like your sanctuary.

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:28.194 align:start position:0%
Totally.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.529 align:start position:0%
This all sounds
great.

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:31.364 align:start size:59% position:41%
Okay-- So we've got
the entry,

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:32.999 align:start size:47% position:53%
the living room
and the bedroom

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.335 align:start size:75% position:25%
and what are we thinking
for the (bleep)?

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:40.006 align:start position:0% line:85%
Excuse me?

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:40.006 align:start size:75% position:25%
Because for the (bleep),

00:00:40.072 --> 00:00:42.542 align:start size:81% position:19%
we could continue the sort
of timeless ambience

00:00:42.608 --> 00:00:45.044 align:start size:66% position:34%
of the living room
or try something new.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.847 align:start size:78% position:22%
Maybe go for a more regal
feel in the (bleep).

00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:51.017 align:start position:0%
The bathroom
is fine as is.

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:53.987 align:start size:44% position:56%
The (bleep) is
fine?

00:00:54.053 --> 00:00:55.355 align:start position:0%
That room's all set.

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:57.056 align:start size:81% position:19%
I'm sorry,
I missed that-- That room?

00:00:57.123 --> 00:01:00.259 align:start size:84% position:16%
Are we talking living room,
bedroom or (bleep)?

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:02.561 align:start position:0%
The last one-- Let's
move on.

00:01:02.628 --> 00:01:03.963 align:start size:47% position:53%
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.098 align:start size:56% position:44% line:83%
We can- we can get
back to it.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.098 align:start position:0%
Okay, thanks.

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:08.434 align:start size:63% position:38%
Can I ask
you something crazy?

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:09.702 align:start position:0%
Mm-hmm.

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:12.972 align:start size:78% position:22%
Would you ever do a suede
chaise lounge?

00:01:13.038 --> 00:01:14.807 align:start position:0%
Oh, that
sounds really expensive.

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:16.909 align:start size:72% position:28%
I've got news for you--
It's not...

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:18.243 align:start size:63% position:38%
and you
can dump the savings

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.613 align:start size:69% position:31%
straight into your new
fudge depot.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.981 align:start size:47% position:53%
You know,
your turd bank.

00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:23.249 align:start position:0%
I'd rather not.

00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:25.284 align:start size:66% position:34%
Look, a beautiful
corn silo is gonna be

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.518 align:start size:59% position:41%
a great investment.

00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:28.187 align:start size:75% position:25%
Remember, this is
the room where you spend

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:30.289 align:start size:50% position:50%
80% of your day.

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:32.291 size:84% position:42% line:85%
That doesn't seem accurate.

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:32.291 align:start size:50% position:50%
Close your eyes.

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:35.228 align:start size:53% position:47%
Hey-- Close them.

00:01:35.294 --> 00:01:37.230 align:start size:63% position:38%
Imagine coming home.

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:40.433 align:start size:94% position:6%
You plop down on your gorgeous
porcelain dook throne,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.634 align:start size:56% position:44%
drop a ton of heat

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:42.902 align:start size:56% position:44%
and then slip into
the tub

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:44.904 align:start size:63% position:38%
to clean your
filthy balloon knot.

00:01:48.474 --> 00:01:50.710 align:start position:0%
That actually does sound
kind of perfect.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:51.744 align:start size:19% position:81%
Right?

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:53.045 align:start position:0%
You know what--
Let's do it.

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:55.147 align:start position:0%
Yeah, I'm
completely on board.

00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:56.482 align:start position:0%
Will you just excuse me
one minute?

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.683 align:start position:0%
I just have
to pee real fast.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.220 align:start size:13% position:88% line:85%
Pee?

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.220 align:start size:28% position:72%
(gagging)

00:02:07.593 --> 00:02:08.828 align:start position:0%
I'll still take it.

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:09.629 align:start size:16% position:84%
Okay.
