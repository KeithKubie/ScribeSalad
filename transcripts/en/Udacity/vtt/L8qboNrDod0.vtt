00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.330
So why don’t you in this unit look at a field

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.043
example, if we are applying statistical techniques

00:00:06.043 --> 00:00:08.712
for problems of important significance in stock

00:00:08.712 --> 00:00:13.227
trading. So here is a stock price for a specific

00:00:13.227 --> 00:00:16.758
day in 2010 and the company we’re discussing

00:00:16.758 --> 00:00:19.643
is Apple, which on the day started trading just

00:00:19.644 --> 00:00:23.482
above $250 but in the afternoon the stock went

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:25.713
all of a sudden down to $200, back to the

00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:28.351
original price. As a statistician, we are

00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:31.156
concerned about this, because if we make trading

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:33.561
decisions based on what’s happening, we might

00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:36.131
lose millions or billions of dollars.

00:00:36.131 --> 00:00:40.734
This is a one in a decade abnormal behavior

00:00:40.734 --> 00:00:43.331
and as a statistician, we might care about

00:00:43.331 --> 00:00:45.307
writing software that finds these kind of

00:00:45.307 --> 00:00:47.498
behaviors, so we stop trading and we don’t

00:00:47.498 --> 00:00:50.493
fall into the trap of selling our stock at a

00:00:50.493 --> 00:00:53.330
unfortunate rate just because something really,

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.636
really strange is happening. And that’s a real

00:00:55.636 --> 00:00:58.219
example, in which have lost millions if not

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:59.073
billions of dollars.

00:00:59.874 --> 00:01:02.586
So on a typical trading day, Apple stock traded

00:01:02.586 --> 00:01:08.671
about 70,000 times, giving us 70,000 data points

00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:11.391
of prices during the day. What we’d be looking

00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:13.817
at is the percentage change between adjacent

00:01:13.817 --> 00:01:16.504
trades, which we call Delta T and this defined

00:01:16.504 --> 00:01:20.209
as the difference between two consecutive trading

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:26.064
points, XT plus one minus XT normalized by XT.

00:01:26.064 --> 00:01:28.921
So normally if XT and XT plus one is the same,

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:31.932
this will be zero. If there is a big difference

00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:34.507
then this is a larger value and we know for the

00:01:34.507 --> 00:01:37.058
day in question what the mean and the standard

00:01:37.058 --> 00:01:40.133
deviation is for this percentage change. The

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:45.561
mean is as small as 0.00074 negative in percent,

00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:47.136
so if we leave off the percent it’s even a

00:01:47.136 --> 00:01:49.836
hundred times smaller and this is the value

00:01:49.836 --> 00:01:53.748
for the standard deviation, 0.01344 percent.

00:01:53.748 --> 00:01:56.149
My first question for you is, to compute the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.364
confidence interval, assuming that we can use

00:01:58.364 --> 00:02:01.240
a confidence interval to detect outliers in

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.131
the data. If you assume a symmetrical confidence

00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:06.524
interval with five percent confidence, in our

00:02:06.524 --> 00:02:09.910
magic factor that percentile is 1.96; compute

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.729
for me in percent the confidence interval

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:15.000
for the variable Delta T.
