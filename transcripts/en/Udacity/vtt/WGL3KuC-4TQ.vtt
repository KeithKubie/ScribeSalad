00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.798
There are three elements that can change in the scene. The light's directions,

00:00:03.798 --> 00:00:08.874
the eyes position, and the objects orientaion. In the first answer, the object

00:00:08.874 --> 00:00:12.741
does not move. This means the objects normals are the same each frame. The

00:00:12.741 --> 00:00:16.798
lights can still move. If the lights move, the shade of the object will change,

00:00:16.798 --> 00:00:20.764
so we can rule out this answer. The second answer locks down the eye position

00:00:20.764 --> 00:00:25.660
and the light's directions. Now the lights cannot move, but the object could

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.864
rotate in space. If it does, the directions of its normals compared to each

00:00:29.864 --> 00:00:34.679
light will change, which changes the diffuse calculation. So this answer won't

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:38.748
work. The third answer locks down the lights directions, and the object's

00:00:38.748 --> 00:00:43.084
orientation. The eye position is not locked down, and so can move and change the

00:00:43.084 --> 00:00:47.140
direction it is looking in. However, the two elements that affect the diffuse

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.240
lighting equation are the lights directions, and the objects normals. Eye

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.140
direction is unimportant, as the diffuse material has the same shade from any

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.506
direction it's viewed. So this answer is correct. The fourth answer keeps the

00:01:00.506 --> 00:01:04.474
objects orientation fixed, but like the first answer, the lights can change

00:01:04.474 --> 00:01:09.973
directions. Surface shading can change. So this answer is incorrect.
