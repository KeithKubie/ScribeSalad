00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.699
Hello I’m Daven Hiskey, you’re watching
the Today I Found Out youtube channel, in

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:07.759
the video today, we’re looking at the husband
and wife team that gave us the first commercially

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:16.070
viable automobile, the Model 3, and the impromptu
road trip that saved it from obscurity.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.020
We may not have flying cars quite yet, but
the ground-bound automobile is the world’s

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.710
second most popular mode of transportation
(behind the bicycle).

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.820
Many think Henry Ford invented the car, but
that isn’t correct.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.940
While Ford certainly made the automobile affordable
for the middle-class, it was actually a German

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.710
engineer with a familiar name that invented
the first commercially available petrol-powered

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.710
motor vehicle.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.300
In 1885, Karl Benz created what he later would
call the “Motorwagen.”

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.350
However, this wasn’t an invention of a single
man.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.559
He had help from someone else - his wife,
Bertha Benz.

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.569
Credited as the first person ever to take
a so-called automobile "road trip," she also

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:55.579
discovered various issues with her husband's
invention during the drive, coming up with

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.309
some very innovative ideas in the process,
such as inventing the brake pad mid-trip.

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.610
As with many inventions, Benz’s Motorwagen
wasn’t a design that just came out of nowhere.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.220
It was a product of innovation-evolution,
simply the next iteration of a long line of

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.690
previous inventions.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.140
Perhaps the first vision of a horseless, mechanical
cart came from Leonardo da Vinci in 1479.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.659
Titling it “Design for Spring-Driven Car
or Horseless Wagon,” there’s no proof

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.490
he actually built it but his sketch looks
like a spring-loaded tricycle.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.320
A few hundred years later, steam engines were
also used in attempts to replace the horse-drawn

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.320
carriage.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.200
In 1769, Frenchman Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot constructed
what is regarded as the first working self-propelled

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.680
vehicle intended for human travel.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.000
Essentially a large steam-powered tricycle,
its top speed was slower than a brisk walk

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.619
(about two miles an hour).

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.799
This doesn’t include the four or five times
it needed to stop per hour for water refill

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.610
and to allow the steam pressure to build back
up.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.479
Needless to say, this was not practical.

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.009
Six decades later, Scotsman Robert Anderson
put a non-rechargeable battery on a carriage

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.600
and it moved...albeit not very fast and for
very long.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.939
Fellow countryman Robert Davidson expanded
on this innovation, creating a battery in

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.510
1841 that could propel a carriage to go 1.5
miles in less than thirty minutes.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.660
Then, unfortunately, it needed a new battery.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.550
While several advancements were made on the
electric car front (in fact in 1899 90% of

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.000
New York City’s Taxi Cabs Were Electric
Vehicles and the First Gas / Electric Hybrid

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.720
was Built in 1900), for various reasons it
wouldn't be until the 21st century that we

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.701
have finally gone full circle and started
coming up with commercially viable electric

00:02:31.701 --> 00:02:36.920
cars, with cars such as the Nissan Leaf, Chevy
Bolt, and Tesla Model S, Model X, and Model

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.990
3, the last of which shares the name of the
car we'll be discussing today.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.730
This brings us to the internal combustion
engine, which, much like the automobile, has

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.550
its own evolutionary history.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.130
The first combustion engines didn't take advantage
of any sort of internal compression and weren't

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.150
particularly powerful or practical.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.730
In 1806, Swiss engineer François Isaac de
Rivaz was the first to construct an internal

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.110
combustion engine that used hydrogen and oxygen.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.860
More explosive, it did at least provide the
germ of an idea for several other inventors

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.040
and their inventions, including Jean Joseph
Etienne Lenoir’s “Hippomobile.”

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.670
Considered the first successful horseless
carriage powered by an internal combustible

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.820
engine, it was patented by Lenoir in 1860
and looks more ship-like than car.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.230
American George Brayton was the first to develop
a kerosene-fueled engine in 1873, but that

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.150
also didn’t provide enough power for a commercially
viable automobile.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.650
12 years later, Benz used these previous innovations
to influence his own design for what is generally

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.040
considered the first "modern" automobile.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.690
Born in the southwest German city of Karlsruhe
in 1844, Karl Benz’s father died in a railway

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.130
accident when he was only two years old.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.410
Despite being poor, his mother made sure his
education got top priority, rather than sending

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.690
him off to work in some factory or the like
as so many others in such situations had to

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.690
do.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.400
Always a scientific-minded student who loved
riding his bicycle (a relatively new invention

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.250
at the time), he entered the University of
Karlsruhe at 15 years old.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.050
He graduated in July 1864 and began seven
long years working various jobs at mechanical

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.380
engineering companies.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.700
Eventually he saved enough money to open his
own iron construction business with a business

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.550
partner, August Ritter.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.570
Almost immediately the company started going
down the toilet, largely thanks to issues

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:18.790
with Ritter.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.750
Benz was on the verge of bankruptcy when he
met Bertha Ringer.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.900
Ringer was the daughter of a wealthy family
from the nearby German town of Pforzheim and

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.600
didn’t have a lot in common with Benz from
a socioeconomic standpoint.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.960
But she believed in him.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.500
As Benz himself would later note in his memoirs,
"Only one person remained with me in the small

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.190
ship of life when it seemed destined to sink.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.320
That was my wife.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.260
Bravely and resolutely she set the new sails
of hope."

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.510
As an unmarried woman of privilege, she was
awarded a rather large dowry that was to be

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.440
relinquished to her husband upon marriage
in order that she might continue to lead her

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.650
accustomed affluent lifestyle - but until
that time, it was hers to manage how she saw

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:56.650
fit.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.630
Now, it is unclear how Karl and Bertha met,
but it’s very evident that they had a special

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.630
relationship.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.410
In 1870 - two years before they married - Bertha
chose to invest a significant amount of her

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.570
dowry in Benz's business to help ensure his
company’s financial survival.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.660
While this kept the business afloat, unfortunately,
due to various issues with other shareholders

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.430
and Benz' role in the company ultimately becoming
marginalized, he was forced to leave this

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.430
business.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.650
But thanks to the rest of Bertha's dowry,
he was able to start a new company, Benz &amp; Cie.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.680
Now without interference from shareholders
or business partners, Benz began working on

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.250
whatever pleased him.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.570
And what pleased him was engineering several
components that today are associated with

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.840
modern-day vehicles.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.560
He then patented these devices and sold the
patents to subsidize his other inventing.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.040
These included patents for a throttle system,
battery-powered ignition systems, spark plugs,

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.389
gear shifters, carburetors, the water radiator,
and the clutch.

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.460
A commonly told legend has it that, looking
for a distraction one day, Benz visited a

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.620
nearby bicycle shop to indulge his lifelong
passion for the two wheeler.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.610
He, instead, became inspired that day and
went back into his shop and invented a new

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.780
type of human transportation device.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.090
In truth, Benz, and many others, had long
been seeking to create such a device and he

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.030
had devoted much of his professional life
to inventing and improving upon the necessary

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.640
mechanisms to make such a vehicle possible.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.280
It took several years of tinkering, but in
January of 1886, he was able to patent his

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.800
“Motorwagen” - a three-wheeled vehicle
with a one-cylinder, four-stroke gasoline

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.800
engine.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.070
While others, such as Gottlieb Daimler, were
independently working on essentially the same

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:32.420
thing with similar success, it was the Motorwagen
that is credited as the world’s first practical,

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.050
commercially available, internal combustion
engine powered automobile.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.920
After completing the Motorwagen, Benz demonstrated
it to the public, hoping to garner some sales,

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.030
or at least get someone interested in acquiring
rights to the patent.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.870
The demonstrations didn’t go so well, with
one resulting in the driver crashing into

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.640
a wall and scaring onlookers.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.090
Benz, who suffered from bouts of depression
and extreme self-doubt, went back to his workshop

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.420
and continued to try to perfect his device.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.419
Knowing her husband's lack of confidence and
perfectionism all-to-well, and frightened

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:04.630
that his invention would end in the dustpan
of history, Bertha decided to take matters

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.070
into her own hands.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:10.199
It was in August of 1888 when Bertha decided
to execute her plan.

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:14.470
Awaking early in the morning, she and two
of her teen sons, Eugen and Richard, pushed

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:19.240
the so-called Motorwagen Model 3 out of her
husband’s workshop and far enough away where

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.340
it could be started without waking him up.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.420
The purpose of the little joyride she had
planned was to visit her mother in Pforzheim,

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.810
65 miles away.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.650
In the process, she hoped to drum up a considerable
amount of publicity, doing something that

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.970
had never been tried before- taking an automobile
on a road trip.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:38.949
Bertha did not inform Karl of this adventure
beforehand, but rather left him a note that

00:07:38.949 --> 00:07:40.810
he discovered when he woke up.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:45.060
Unfortunately for history buffs the world-over,
exactly what this note said has been lost

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.060
to history.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:50.350
The road to Pforzheim was certainly less-traveled,
rocky and unpaved in many places.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:55.120
(Aside: the poem The Road Not Taken probably
doesn't say what you think it says, see our

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.330
video Robert Frost’s Commonly Misinterpreted
“The Road Not Taken” and the Role it Played

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.960
in the Death of His Best Friend) Despite the
driving conditions, Bertha was determined,

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.360
driving and repairing the car on the way.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.419
She and her sons had to push the car up many
of the hills (which later led her to suggest

00:08:10.419 --> 00:08:15.940
that the Model 3 needed a lower gear as the
2.5 horsepower engine simply wasn't sufficient

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:16.940
for hill climbing).

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.930
She also had to stop for fuel at pharmacies
that sold ligroin and was forced to make an

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:26.310
emergency repair to the car’s ignition using,
of all things, her garter to insulate a shorted

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.310
wire.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:30.860
When the fuel line became clogged, she identified
the problem and cleared it with her hairpin.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.999
When the drive chain broke, she found a blacksmith
and instructed him on how to make the needed

00:08:34.999 --> 00:08:35.999
repair.

00:08:35.999 --> 00:08:39.639
When the wooden brakes began to crack in the
face of sustained downhill usage, she came

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:43.680
up with the idea of putting leather on the
wooden shoes- the world's first automobile

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.089
brake pads- finding a shoemaker to provide
and attach leather soles for this function.

00:08:48.089 --> 00:08:52.540
(Along with adding the extra gear and certain
minor tweaks based on his wife's feedback,

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:57.089
this was another improvement Benz would immediately
add to the Model 3's design upon Bertha's

00:08:57.089 --> 00:08:58.089
return.)

00:08:58.089 --> 00:09:02.260
At dusk, Bertha Benz arrived at her mother’s
home, having made the 65 mile trip, repair

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.060
time included, in less than 12 hours.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:09.809
All along the way, excited villagers and bystanders
witnessed the marvel that was the Motorwagen

00:09:09.809 --> 00:09:13.990
- sure, it wasn’t perfect, but it moved
relatively fast and it was safe.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:18.189
She sent a telegram to her husband to tell
him of the successful journey, but he already

00:09:18.189 --> 00:09:22.589
knew due to the significant publicity that
echoed across the region thanks to her audacious

00:09:22.589 --> 00:09:23.589
road trip.

00:09:23.589 --> 00:09:27.290
Bertha had saved him before with her money-
this time she did it with her gumption and

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:31.550
faith that his invention could do what no
others like it had ever done.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:35.930
After several days at her mother’s, Bertha
and the boys returned home in the Motorwagen,

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:39.980
this time intentionally going in a different
direction, impressing even more people with

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.050
the Model 3.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:46.570
All in all, it was the world’s first automobile
road trip- 120 miles in less than 24 hours

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.490
of driving, including repair and refueling
time.

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:53.680
Prior to this, the only other known internal
combustion automobiles hadn't managed more

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.450
than a mile, and often had to be returned
by rail, pushed, or pulled by horses after

00:09:58.450 --> 00:09:59.740
having broken down.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:04.860
Directly after this well publicized road trip,
orders started coming in for Benz' Motorwagen.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:09.410
By the end of the century, Benz' company was
producing hundreds of cars per year and was

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:12.350
the largest automobile manufacturer in the
world.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:16.779
While Karl Benz was a phenomenal engineer
and visionary, history almost certainly only

00:10:16.779 --> 00:10:21.350
remembers him, instead of so many others that
were inventing virtually the same thing around

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:26.079
this same time, because of the constant financial
support and later keen promotional sense of

00:10:26.079 --> 00:10:28.230
his wife, Bertha Ringer Benz.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:32.420
Once again, as the man himself said, "Only
one person remained with me in the small ship

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.760
of life when it seemed destined to sink.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.980
That was my wife.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.049
Bravely and resolutely she set the new sails
of hope."
