00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:05.233
What is time?

00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:08.033
A deceptively simple
question, yet it is the key

00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:10.367
to understanding relativity.

00:00:10.367 --> 00:00:13.033
It is sort of the reason
my hair is going gray.

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:13.867
[laughter]

00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:16.633
When we describe
motion, we do so

00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:22.333
as a function of time, 10 meters
per second, 100 miles per hour.

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:25.000
But the mathematical
description of velocity

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.367
is moot unless we
can define time.

00:00:30.367 --> 00:00:32.233
Is time universal?

00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:34.834
In other words, is there
an audible tick-tock

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:38.533
throughout the galaxy, a
master clock, so to speak,

00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:43.000
forging ahead like
Mozart's metronome?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.834
The answer my friends is no.

00:00:45.834 --> 00:00:48.467
Time is not absolute.

00:00:48.467 --> 00:00:51.600
In fact, for us, the living
physicists, the distinction

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.500
between the past,
present, and future

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.967
is but a stubborn illusion.

00:00:59.967 --> 00:01:02.367
[music playing]

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.467
A lot to consider, I know.

00:01:14.967 --> 00:01:15.867
I know.

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:18.633
[laughter]

00:01:18.633 --> 00:01:21.900
But understanding time is
essential to understanding

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.433
relativity.

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:28.166
Now, I want you all
to close your eyes.

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:29.667
Not to worry, I don't bite.

00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:32.700
But I am on the
lookout for a new pen.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.500
[laughter]

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.300
Go on close your eyes.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.166
To truly grasp the idea of
time, we must take a step

00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:45.800
back and ask, what is light?

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.800
So journey with me to the Sun.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.233
Light travels from the Sun to
the Earth through space, yes.

00:02:04.233 --> 00:02:06.433
When I was your age,
I wanted to know

00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:10.433
how can something, light,
travel through nothing, space?

00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:15.300
Let us isolate a light beam
and travel alongside it.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.300
But let us go faster.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.867
You're there with me.

00:02:20.867 --> 00:02:22.967
Faster.

00:02:22.967 --> 00:02:23.700
Faster!

00:02:26.767 --> 00:02:29.567
What is time?

00:02:29.567 --> 00:02:30.633
[thud]

00:02:30.633 --> 00:02:32.233
PROFESSOR WEBER: Herr,
Einstein, wake up!

00:02:32.233 --> 00:02:33.133
I wasn't sleeping, sir.

00:02:33.133 --> 00:02:34.533
I was thinking.

00:02:34.533 --> 00:02:36.233
Oh, really.

00:02:36.233 --> 00:02:39.100
About what exactly?

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.367
The secrets of the
cosmos, I suppose.

00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:43.300
I suggest you think
about trigonometry

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.500
instead, with your eyes open.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.233
And sit up!

00:02:53.033 --> 00:02:56.967
Laws of sines and cosines?

00:02:56.967 --> 00:03:02.300
c squared equals a squared
plus b squared, subtract

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.467
2 [inaudible] cosine b.

00:03:04.467 --> 00:03:06.867
PROFESSOR WEBER: The
area of a triangle?

00:03:06.867 --> 00:03:10.633
STUDENTS: The area equals
b squared times a times

00:03:10.633 --> 00:03:13.433
b over 2 times c.

00:03:13.433 --> 00:03:19.000
PROFESSOR WEBER: What is
the solution [inaudible]

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.834
differential equation?

00:03:25.233 --> 00:03:28.900
Herr Einstein, are you
still too busy contemplating

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.066
the secrets of the cosmos
to solve this equation?

00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:32.967
Oh, no sir.

00:03:32.967 --> 00:03:35.233
I've already solved it.

00:03:35.233 --> 00:03:37.066
PROFESSOR WEBER: Leave, now.

00:03:37.066 --> 00:03:38.567
On what offense?

00:03:38.567 --> 00:03:40.800
PROFESSOR WEBER: Your mere
presence spoils the respect

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.934
of the class for me!

00:03:41.934 --> 00:03:43.166
That is not an
objective reason.

00:03:43.166 --> 00:03:44.633
Out!

00:03:44.633 --> 00:03:46.467
[music playing]

00:03:49.467 --> 00:03:53.066
The natural log of a
constant multiplied by x

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:56.400
equals the natural log
of 1 plus v squared.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.767
And since v equals y
over x, that gives us

00:03:59.767 --> 00:04:03.100
the final function, x
squared plus y squared

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.367
minus c x cubed equals 0.

00:04:06.367 --> 00:04:08.467
And speaking truthfully,
sir, your mere presence

00:04:08.467 --> 00:04:11.567
spoils my respect for the
future of Prussian mathematics.

00:04:11.567 --> 00:04:12.300
Out.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.800
[door slamming]
