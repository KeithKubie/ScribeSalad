00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.280
This 1940s singer might not be the man who
comes to mind when you think about the action-packed

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.280
Die Hard movies.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.890
At the start of his movie-making career, Sinatra
was cast mostly in singing roles, though he

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.270
did manage to break away from being a “singer
employed as an actor” and made a name for

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.070
himself as an actor alone, winning a few Academy
Awards and Golden Globes for his performances.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.210
That said, many people these days can’t
shake that image of young Sinatra crooning

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.500
into a microphone—not exactly something
you’d imagine the character of John McClane

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.500
doing.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.510
So, how did Frank come to be considered for
the role?

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.910
It all started with an author named Roderick
Thorp.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.559
You might not know it, but the Die Hard movie
was based on a book called Nothing Lasts Forever

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.110
by Thorp, which was published in 1979.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.470
The LA Times reviewed the book, saying it
was “A ferocious, bloody, raging book so

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.979
single-mindedly brilliant in concept and execution
that it should be read at a single sitting.”

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.240
This book is really what made Thorp a big
name, but he was on the publishing scene much

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.240
earlier.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.970
It turns out that Nothing Lasts Forever is
actually a sequel to a book called The Detective,

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.640
published in 1966 which was made into a movie
of the same name in 1968.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.330
The movie starred—you guessed it—Frank
Sinatra as the main character, Detective Joe

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.330
Leland.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.510
The book was extremely popular, remaining
on bestseller lists for a while and making

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.400
a name for Thorp; the movie also did well
in the box office.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.721
It was described as “gritty” for its time,
dealing with issues like homosexuality, but

00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:45.110
it was decidedly less action-packed than the
Die Hard movies we know today.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.540
Die Hard itself wasn’t picked up by producers
until 1988, nearly 10 years after the book

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.850
it was based on was published.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.840
Because the movie was technically a sequel,
they were contractually obligated to offer

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.630
Frank Sinatra the leading role.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.400
He was 73 years old at the time and gracefully
turned the offer down.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.759
After Sinatra turned the offer down, the role
was offered to Arnold Schwarzenegger, and

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:16.099
the movie was pitched as a sequel to the actor’s
1985 film Commando rather than a sequel to

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.099
The Detective.

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.270
Schwarzenegger also turned down the offer,
and instead Bruce Willis was cast in the leading

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.030
role, with the character renamed John McClane
instead of Joe Leland.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.760
Willis was not exactly the kind of person
the studio was hoping to cast in the role.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.590
At the time, he was mostly only known for
comedies, not action movies.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.360
But they had been turned down by a variety
of other actors since offering the role to

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.950
Sinatra and Schwarzenegger, and they had to
settle.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.020
The movie, of course, did extremely well,
with a budget of just $28 million, the film

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:55.990
grossed about $140 million by the time it
was out of theatres (about $268 million today),

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.940
earned four Academy Award nominations, and
was generally well-received by critics.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.290
The franchise of Die Hard is still going strong,
though its original writer and main character

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.600
have since passed away.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:14.360
Sinatra died in 1998 at the age of 82, while
Thorp passed away in 1999 at the age of 62.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.880
Willis, meanwhile, had his career made by
the Die Hard movies and despite now getting

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:28.989
up there in years himself (about to turn 59
) remains involved in 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:41.989
the series as well as other action movies.
