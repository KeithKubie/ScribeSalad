00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.340
LARRY SUSSKIND: We are
excited, and honored,

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.900
to have Professor Stephen
Carpenter with us.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.330
And this is the first
of a series of events.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:11.430
I'm Larry Susskind.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.350
I'm on the faculty in
Urban Studies and Planning.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.770
It's interesting to me
that several people here

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.830
have a water interest.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.480
Several people here have
a planning interest.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.980
Several people here have
artistic, or art methods

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:26.490
interests.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.780
Several people here have
public education interest.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.780
And all of those
are alive and well

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.350
in the Department of
Urban Studies and Planning

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.980
in different kinds of ways.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.250
There is an environmental
group in the department

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.400
that I have had some
responsibility for.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.870
And water is a concern within
the environmental group.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.130
Not just domestically,
but internationally,

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.340
which relates to
part of your work.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.470
We're interested in water as an
environmental justice concern,

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.260
not just a natural resource
management concern.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.190
And so, when I first
learned of some

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.740
of the ways in which
your work has focused

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.330
on making clean water available
to people in different places,

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.440
there was a direct connection
with that aspect of what we do.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.430
I was really interested
in how issues of race

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.300
could be raised in a way that
conversation was possible.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.430
And that is another
very big part

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.060
of what our department, and
our school, are interested in.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.670
So by way of
background, those are

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.770
some of the thematic interests
that led us to very much want

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.300
you to be here.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.100
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
Well thanks, Larry.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.830
As far back as I can
remember, I like making stuff.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.220
I would just make
things, you know?

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.050
I'm the oldest of four boys.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.550
And the oldest and
the youngest were

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.700
born 5 and 1/2 years apart.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.020
No twins.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.360
So we were constantly
together and doing things,

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.009
and we would make things.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.620
Like a set of golf clubs.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.820
My dad had golf clubs.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.220
We weren't allowed to use
them, so we made them.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.390
Of course we used his
copper pipe for the plumbing

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.160
in the house.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.057
So making things was always part
of what I did, and have done,

00:02:24.057 --> 00:02:25.140
and just engaging in the--

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.514
it shifts, and it has moved.

00:02:26.514 --> 00:02:28.680
My background's really
pottery-- is really ceramics.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.200
Touching the clay, touching
the mud, making things.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.440
That's my degree, is in
ceramics and fine art.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.320
I don't know what it was,
this urge, ability, interest

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.485
for teaching, for education.

00:02:40.485 --> 00:02:43.440
So that complicated
the situation.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.540
Making stuff, and
teaching stuff-- well,

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.730
actually, you can do that.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.960
That's called being an art
educator, or a teacher.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.430
And the ceramics
piece stayed with.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.440
I couldn't shake the clay,
I couldn't get the clay out

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.190
of my fingernails.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.280
The making of things
had to always be there.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.000
And then I taught
elementary school art,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.200
I was the art teacher,
elementary school.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.140
And that was among the most
invigorating experiences

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.660
of my life, because
the students are always

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.620
about making something.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.980
Their bodies are always moving.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.430
They're constantly in a state
of absorbing what they're

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.280
doing in the world, and seeing
other people doing, and moving,

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.630
and checking, and--

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.300
so that energy was
quite interesting to me.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.420
Followed that experience
up with a doctoral degree

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.530
in art education.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.680
But the idea was that the
making, and the teaching,

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.070
and the learning, and the asking
of questions through art--

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.650
through the visual imagery
that you're talking about--

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.720
that was what was so important.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.390
And you mentioned
the notion of access.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.850
Well, we didn't have golf clubs.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.192
We didn't have access to--

00:03:42.192 --> 00:03:44.150
we saw them, but we didn't
have access to them.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.980
So making our own access, I'm
interested in that as well.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.010
How does one make
one's own access?

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.150
So moving around to a series
of different universities

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.700
as an art educator.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.557
Part of both
graduate degrees was

00:03:57.557 --> 00:03:59.390
about being in the clay
studio as much as it

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.900
was being in the seminar room.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.620
That was really the
focus of my dissertation.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.320
In the clay studio we were
talking, and critiquing,

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.070
about color, and shape, and
form, and how the glaze works.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.099
And on the other side of
the same part of campus--

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.390
on the other side of the road--

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.014
in the theory classes
in art education,

00:04:16.014 --> 00:04:19.250
we're talking about postmodern
theory, and feminist theory,

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.640
and film theory, and
interpreting installations,

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.050
and performances.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.600
And then on the other
side of the road,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.340
I'd go to my class the next day.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.600
We were, again, critiquing.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.047
But we were talking about,
oh, I like that handle.

00:04:32.047 --> 00:04:33.380
Show me how you made the handle.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.005
This handle works
and that one doesn't.

00:04:35.005 --> 00:04:37.340
We never defined
what works meant.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.550
But putting those together-- the
making, and the interpreting,

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.930
and thinking, and
theorizing in both registers

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.730
doesn't have to be separated.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.980
So to think of us, even with
labels, I find kind of curious.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.560
We have to find a
place on campus,

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.470
but to understand
that we can move

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:55.610
in and out of those spaces.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.190
And we can start to
shed those identities.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.360
The kind of group that
has self assembled today

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.440
speaks to multiple
interests that I have,

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.060
and trying to weave it into,
what is an art education?

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.310
How does one learn through
the making of things,

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.380
through the display
of cultural products

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.180
through cultural production?

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.090
What kind of questions
can we ask, not just

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.596
about what someone
else has made,

00:05:21.596 --> 00:05:22.970
but what kind of
questions can we

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.360
ask through the act
of making, itself?

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.110
We can make meaning
through relationships,

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.300
we can make meaning
through conversation,

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.260
we can make meaning through
verbal or written responses.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.670
So it's the making of meaning,
making of cultural product,

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:37.784
making of a difference.

00:05:37.784 --> 00:05:38.700
LARRY SUSSKIND: Right.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.491
STEPHEN CARPENTER: So
this notion of making

00:05:40.491 --> 00:05:42.710
doesn't have to always have
this physicality to it.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.980
I'm saying all that
to say, the clay

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.330
left my fingernails for a
while, until I moved to Texas.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.510
My wife is an engineer--
a mechanical engineer,

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.560
material science--

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.684
and it's a great opportunity
for her to move there.

00:05:56.684 --> 00:05:59.630
For me, there's no art
education there at all.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.120
They got my CV and didn't
know where to put me.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.144
Sent it all over campus.

00:06:03.144 --> 00:06:05.560
And finally, the education
folks said, oh, we'll take him.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.300
It has education in his
degree, we'll take him.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.640
Telling you all that
to say, I got to Texas,

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.565
and art education had to be--

00:06:12.565 --> 00:06:13.940
I had reinvent
it, or at least, I

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.960
had to figure out
what I meant by it.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.490
And how I fit in.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:18.990
If you don't have
an art department,

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.186
how do you have art education?

00:06:21.186 --> 00:06:23.420
Well, you just open a
studio in your garage

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.190
and have people over on Fridays.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.820
I did that.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.400
Or you can engage in the
work in the curriculum,

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.510
that fixed set of notions
and premeditated concepts,

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.560
terms, practices,
skills, construct

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.630
that educational experience.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.530
My entrance into a more
curriculum instruction space

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.860
was through my background as an
artist, and as an art educator.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.630
The water filter work that I
do, and have started to do,

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.700
came about when I was in Texas.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.880
I met a guy, his
name's Oscar Munoz.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:01.790
Oscar is in charge of the
Texas A&amp;M Colonias programs

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.110
all along the border.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.290
Texas is a third the width
of the United States.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.500
So that distance, and
then 150 miles up,

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.880
is called the border of Texas.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.390
In that space, there
live over a half

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.790
a million people, most
of whom don't have access

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.890
to clean water in their homes.

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:23.690
And Oscar let me know this,
and he works with communities

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:24.955
all across that swath.

00:07:24.955 --> 00:07:27.080
And as an art educator,
that was interesting to me.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.840
Because I had to learn
about a lot of the practices

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.615
that he's up against, and faces.

00:07:32.615 --> 00:07:35.870
I'm telling you
all this to say--

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:40.400
not that I planned
where my work has gone,

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.120
but it's always migrated--
always moved and shifted--

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.650
to new-- it's almost like water,
water finds its own level,

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:47.150
right?

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.900
Water fills the vessel
in which it's poured.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.130
But I've never lost the clay.

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:53.713
I've never lost that
notion of making.

00:07:53.713 --> 00:07:57.020
Or the ways that meanings can
be made, and understandings

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.660
can be constructed through
engagement with other people.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:04.400
That's what education
is, it's a social space.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.740
Teaching and learning
is a social space.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.670
Art education can take up and
take on those tasks as well.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.670
LARRY SUSSKIND: The
title for this visit

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:17.720
that people have seen,
and that you gave us,

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.810
is Making Something
from Nothing.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:26.270
And first of all, the
immediate doubt about

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:27.840
whether you can actually make--

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.925
I mean, you can
transform things--

00:08:29.925 --> 00:08:32.299
but the notion that you can
make something out of nothing

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:36.289
would sort of defy most of the
laws of physics, presumably.

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:39.169
And so, you mean
something by that.

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:45.730
And then, Appropriate Technology
as Intentionally Disruptive

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:46.800
Responsibility.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.300
STEPHEN CARPENTER: That is a
mouthful, that title, isn't it?

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.633
LARRY SUSSKIND: I actually
had a lot of trouble with it.

00:08:53.579 --> 00:08:56.120
STEPHEN CARPENTER: To the left
of the colon, making something

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.200
from nothing.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.140
That piece was intentionally
provocative, right?

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.750
I mean, you kind of have
to do that, in some ways,

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.870
to entice folks to show up
to certain things, maybe.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.910
But the idea of making--

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:11.330
of course, defying laws of
physics, yeah, I'm with you.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.700
So knowing that there's
a problem with that,

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.290
if we think of it
in certain realms,

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:19.430
the idea that there's some
folks who don't necessarily have

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:20.930
access-- it's about access.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.570
Maybe it should have said,
making something from whatever

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:24.560
it is that you have.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.040
LARRY SUSSKIND: Right.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.081
STEPHEN CARPENTER: Right?

00:09:26.081 --> 00:09:28.850
But if we move it
to nothing, you

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:33.080
start to think, well, there's
a complete and utter lack

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:33.921
of something.

00:09:33.921 --> 00:09:35.420
For example, there's
some people who

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.750
have no access to clean water.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.240
We can raise a bit
of hyperbole there

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.120
and say they don't have
access, or they have nothing.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.360
They're folks who-- we
talk about food scarcity,

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.620
we talk about folks who
are homeless folks, who

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:50.600
need shelter.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.140
So you can take minimum,
and exaggerate it

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.439
just a little bit more--

00:09:55.439 --> 00:09:57.230
there's this thing
called artistic license,

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:58.430
let's use that--

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.290
and turn it into nothing.

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:01.880
So making something
from nothing,

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.070
what can we make from
what is available to us?

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.780
So that's the
something from nothing.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.846
And in the case of
this first visit,

00:10:07.846 --> 00:10:09.845
the something is adequate
access to clean water.

00:10:09.845 --> 00:10:12.350
And the nothing is
the lack of that.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:16.400
And the something is a
response, which in this case,

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.260
is a ceramic water filter
made out of clay and sawdust.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.010
The nothing is, well,
that's just clay.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:23.760
It's just in the riverbed.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.010
That's nothing.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.080
That's just sawdust,
that's leftover scraps.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.450
That's nothing.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.670
You understand that
play that's going there?

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:33.770
Appropriate technology
is essentially

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:36.590
whatever is
available culturally,

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:41.930
and locally, that fits in
within the cultural practices

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.000
of a community.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.460
Introducing an external,
or an unfamiliar substance,

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:54.740
or chemical, or food,
is not appropriate

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:55.859
to a certain community.

00:10:55.859 --> 00:10:57.650
Because it's either
against one's religion,

00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:59.930
it's against one's history,
against one's culture.

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.940
It doesn't fit in, so finding
something that's appropriate.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.750
For example, clay is
essentially a material

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.970
that is accessible to
almost every single culture

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:10.130
in the history of the world.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:14.480
And clay is a naturally
occurring material

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.130
in most places around the world.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:17.960
Now, some places
using plastic, that

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.130
doesn't seem to make sense.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.690
Or appropriate technologies,
using what is at hand.

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:25.280
Philosopher, theorist
Umberto Eco--

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.950
he was a guy who
knew everything,

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:28.120
but he didn't know it.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.800
Eco had numerous theories.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.460
Among them was this
theory of intentions.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.470
When he says the artist, or
the author, has an intention,

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.140
and the viewer, or the
reader, has an intention.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.360
But he also says the
work has an intention.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:44.620
That comes about through this
process, or a series of events.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.210
But this idea of
having an intention

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:48.160
means it's deliberate.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.340
So I'm interested in
thinking about why

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.570
we're doing what we're doing.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:54.150
That's where that
intentional piece--

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.620
disruptive.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.960
If I pick this up, and I threw
this water at the camera,

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.835
that would be disruptive
in a number of ways.

00:12:00.835 --> 00:12:06.460
Or if you're in a quiet library,
and a stampede of aardvarks

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.530
comes through the space,
that's disruption.

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:11.260
So we understand disruption
as something that is abnormal,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.140
or not expected within
a particular context

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:18.220
that has assumed rules,
regulations, and ways of being.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.960
But I'm also thinking
of disruption

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.610
in the intentional sense of,
to reveal, or to poke at,

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:28.930
or to engage, or to entice a
certain kind of conversation,

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:30.220
or relationship.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.990
And that conversation
or relationship

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.600
is the responsibility.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.810
LARRY SUSSKIND: Would you agree
that most educational efforts

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:41.980
are disruptions aimed at
fulfilling a responsibility,

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.984
that it's defining
education that way?

00:12:43.984 --> 00:12:46.150
STEPHEN CARPENTER: I don't
think enough of them are.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:47.300
LARRY SUSSKIND: Oh, you
think they should be.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:47.920
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
I think they should.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.550
I'd like to shift that
up, and question that.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:56.350
And it's very difficult to get
at new ways of doing something,

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:59.722
without disrupting a status
quo, without questioning it.

00:12:59.722 --> 00:13:01.930
LARRY SUSSKIND: We say it's
because we're responsible

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:05.440
and we have to disrupt,
but what about the choice

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.100
of the people, and the place,
whose lives you're disrupting?

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.330
Is that fair to them?

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:10.750
STEPHEN CARPENTER: Sure.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:11.250
Yeah.

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:14.480
Certainly the way you frame
it, it's not fair to them.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.960
But in the disruption
of the lives

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.170
of communities that I
mentioned, in Texas,

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:23.710
is not disrupting uninvited.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:25.300
It's an invited disruption.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.330
And second, the
disruption has to do

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:34.180
with whatever the current
practice was, was not

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:38.060
fulfilling, or responding
to needs of the community.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.310
LARRY SUSSKIND: In their eyes.

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:41.410
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
In their eyes.

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:44.139
And to my eyes, as well.

00:13:44.139 --> 00:13:45.430
So my friend-- as I mentioned--

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:51.340
Oscar, who for years has been
working throughout South Texas.

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.770
When he learned of the
work I that I was--

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.050
at that point-- still
learning how to do,

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:57.910
he said, oh, there's
a water issue.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:00.370
Would you come down, and
work with us, talk to us,

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:01.900
let's see if this
would work out.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:03.790
That was my
invitation to come in.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:05.498
Oscar was already part
of that community,

00:14:05.498 --> 00:14:08.770
I would never imagine
just driving down there--

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:10.780
driving to any community--

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.597
and say, hey, I have
something you need.

00:14:12.597 --> 00:14:13.930
I'm going to sell you something.

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:15.520
That's not my approach.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.830
And so, that kind of
disruption, I think,

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:21.620
is on the unethical side.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.300
He was a bit wary of
someone coming in.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.990
And he's shared--
and other people

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.970
have shared-- stories
with me of researchers

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:32.080
going into communities, oh,
yeah, I have these ideas.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.515
Let me study what you're doing.

00:14:33.515 --> 00:14:34.390
Let me work with you.

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:37.000
And they take the
information, and there's

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.850
a report that's promised,
and the report never

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:41.140
gets back to the communities.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.570
Or the results never help.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:47.920
And he said he had never
seen a report come back,

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.320
based on the invitations
to the scholars.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.930
And so, once we got
to know each other,

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:54.640
he felt comfortable with me.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:59.200
But then he had to go through a
process of talking with members

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.795
of the community and
say, hey, here's--

00:15:01.795 --> 00:15:04.364
I have this friend coming down.

00:15:04.364 --> 00:15:05.530
That's the invitation piece.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:08.470
LARRY SUSSKIND: So what does
an invitation have to consist

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:09.760
of-- for you--

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:15.100
to be of a sort that you are
comfortable then responding

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.700
in this disruptive way?

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.390
Do you need a vote
or the community?

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:20.830
Has to be 100 percent?

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:22.810
Majority rule?

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:25.020
People you like
say, come on down?

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:29.080
What is, in your
mind, what legitimizes

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.352
these kinds of disruptions?

00:15:30.352 --> 00:15:31.810
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
Again, there has

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:34.720
to be that invitation from
someone who is positioned

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.950
within the community.

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:38.110
Then there has to be--

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:39.850
for me-- a conversation.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.520
And so, no, the
entire community.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.470
Because defining who
is in the community

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.720
is often difficult to do anyway.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.790
Certainly, it's
often just a leader,

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:51.670
or a member of the
community who might

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:55.450
want engage a conversation,
that then might

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:56.860
expand in their own circles.

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.080
In this particular case--

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.180
in Texas, through
my colleague-- we

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:04.630
met with a few
leaders, people who

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.280
had worked within the
communities as [SPANISH],,

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:12.790
as community educators,
and other senior members

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:13.970
of the community.

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:16.870
Senior meaning they
had been doing work

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.470
at the community centers.

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:21.247
And it was, let's
just talk, let's

00:16:21.247 --> 00:16:22.580
see where the conversation goes.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.079
Very much like what we're doing
here, having a conversation.

00:16:25.079 --> 00:16:28.940
Now, it's not my role or
position, or personality,

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:31.820
or interest, to push that.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:35.340
After that conversation, that's
on whomever to take that up.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:38.354
So when I speak of community,
it's not the entirety.

00:16:38.354 --> 00:16:40.520
LARRY SUSSKIND: There's not
a simple answer to this.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.760
We all struggle with
this notion of the artist

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.720
as a independent thinker,
as a creator of something

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.900
that's an expression of
an individual view when

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:54.170
you're calling this a
form of art education.

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:58.430
But isn't it contrary to
artists being artists?

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:01.497
How is it art?

00:17:01.497 --> 00:17:03.580
STEPHEN CARPENTER: So
that's not a small question,

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.099
but it's a very
important question.

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:08.890
It's a central question that
I'm still answering for myself.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.890
But there are three realms here.

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:16.579
One is the work in South Texas,
that I actually wouldn't call

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:18.712
that art, or art education.

00:17:18.712 --> 00:17:19.670
LARRY SUSSKIND: Oh, OK.

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:20.586
STEPHEN CARPENTER: OK?

00:17:20.586 --> 00:17:23.750
Second is the kind of work
that I will do tomorrow,

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.470
the performance.

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:30.140
And that moves into the
realm of social practice.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:35.060
And that's where I've come to
an agreement, understanding,

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.160
comfortable place with
myself, that that's where

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.890
the art education happens.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:43.490
And then, there's a third piece,
your definition of an artist,

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:46.340
and what an artist does,
that I want to disrupt.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.650
Down in South Texas, that
kind of work, for me,

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:49.700
is not art education.

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:53.000
It certainly uses an employees
certain artistic practices.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.532
Folks who have
access to a kiln--

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:56.240
know how to fire a
kiln-- and have access

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.110
to clay, that's where you
want to begin your work.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:04.160
Usually that's the tile
person, or the potter,

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.270
or it's the brick maker.

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:11.060
But my collaboration, and my
involvement in that project, I

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.800
wouldn't call that art.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.570
That was kind of me shed--

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:16.710
if that helps to clarify
that piece of it.

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:19.790
So the work that I
will do tomorrow.

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:21.800
I'm going to set up a
water filter production

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.130
facility in one of
the rooms downstairs,

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:27.230
and going to make water filters.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:34.250
The idea there is to engage in
a practice that somehow blurs

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:37.760
what might be our conventional
notions of art making, art

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.960
practice, with practices
from other disciplines.

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.900
We're not quite sure where
one ends, and one begins.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.990
And it's supposed to remain
in that uncomfortable space,

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:51.200
if one is thinking in that
social practice-- art is

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.325
social practice-- register.

00:18:52.325 --> 00:18:55.220
If you can set up that
practice as an engagement,

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:58.610
as an ongoing set of
activities, where people

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:00.630
can come in and
out of that space,

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:02.030
there's an
educational component.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.980
Invariably, there'll
be a question, hey man,

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.930
what are you doing?

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.240
That's an invitation, right
there, for me to respond.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:11.494
So we can establish this
conversation as a relationship.

00:19:11.494 --> 00:19:13.160
LARRY SUSSKIND: You're
not creating art.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.670
You're creating something that
serves a function in response

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:18.560
to the need of a client.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.510
You're saying, no it's not art.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:23.120
I'm an artist, and
it's my social practice

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.640
that you should observe
here as art education.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.184
But the product of my
artwork is not art.

00:19:28.184 --> 00:19:30.350
STEPHEN CARPENTER: It's
more than the filter itself.

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:34.410
That filter is just one
component of the work.

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:36.680
The work being the performance.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.710
Education as experience,
this notion of experience

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:41.180
is where the education happens.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.510
LARRY SUSSKIND: For some of
us, the next step is, oh,

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:46.850
and I want to help
a place in Africa,

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:49.460
or Latin America,
in a community,

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:52.880
make a factory where
there are people--

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:57.140
now, without me there--
capable of making more filters.

00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:59.240
And maybe they can sell
'em for a small amount

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:03.320
to be able to maintain
a community business.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.649
The doing of all of that
seems to be a different realm.

00:20:06.649 --> 00:20:07.940
STEPHEN CARPENTER: It is, yeah.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:12.560
And I have not worked
closely with communities--

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.480
as you're saying--
to set up facilities.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.032
Although, in South Texas, I did.

00:20:16.032 --> 00:20:17.990
I helped laid the groundwork
in that facility--

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.260
LARRY SUSSKIND: I saw pictures.

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:19.040
STEPHEN CARPENTER: --is working.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.039
You saw pictures, right.

00:20:20.039 --> 00:20:22.340
But there are a
number of groups who

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:26.810
are doing the exact kind of
work that you're mentioning.

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:30.140
And it's not from an arts, or
an art education perspective.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:33.620
It is from that social
entrepreneur realm

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.540
that you're talking about.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.580
And I am very supportive
of that piece.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:40.010
And that is actually
an intriguing component

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:44.000
of what comes out of this work.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.090
It's that work that
then has benefits

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:52.880
in terms of health, economics,
self-sustaining capacity,

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.290
that I find intriguing.

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:57.290
And it's something
that can be attempted,

00:20:57.290 --> 00:21:00.080
where it's not intended to
be a money maker initially,

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.270
it's intended to
save people's lives,

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:04.580
and to respond in that way.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.350
AUDIENCE: So I'm
curious about the longer

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:08.600
term with this
community in South Texas

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.100
that you're working with.

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.474
Obviously, it sounds like
there's a really pressing need,

00:21:12.474 --> 00:21:14.840
so these water filters can
meet that immediate need.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:18.530
Is the long term goal still
to get a more traditional grid

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:19.551
water setup for them?

00:21:19.551 --> 00:21:20.550
STEPHEN CARPENTER: Yeah.

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:21.086
Yes.

00:21:21.086 --> 00:21:22.710
The origin of the
filters was that they

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:27.030
were supposed to be a first
response to natural disaster,

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:29.100
and they were not
supposed to be long term.

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:32.624
Their point of use,
temporary solutions.

00:21:32.624 --> 00:21:34.540
Unfortunately for some
folks around the world,

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:37.609
these have become more
long term responses.

00:21:37.609 --> 00:21:39.900
AUDIENCE: What do you do when
you're just starting out?

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:43.170
What's your advice for how you
go about getting an invitation?

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:45.840
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
That's a tough one.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:50.100
Sometimes it's not about poking
for the invitation initially.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:54.602
Sometimes you find ways to
become part of the community.

00:21:54.602 --> 00:21:56.310
At some level, that
might sound like, oh,

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:58.620
but you're really
kind of manipulating.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:21:59.790
Because in the back of
your mind you're saying,

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:02.100
OK, at the right moment, I'm
going to spring the question.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.510
I'm going to get the invitation.

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:04.926
That's not what
I'm talking about.

00:22:04.926 --> 00:22:07.530
What I'm talking about is
being part of a community,

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.600
and doing the work
in the community.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.510
Where the work that
you're doing might be seen

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:14.930
by folks who could invite you.

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:18.090
Again, that sounds like
it's some sort of nefarious,

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:20.520
manipulative component.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.910
But not really, I think it's
about continuing your work,

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:26.130
and staying visible.

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:27.810
And the invitations come.

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:31.560
There's an approach called
arts entrepreneurship that

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.650
is gaining traction,
and several universities

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:39.910
have courses in arts
entrepreneurship-- and minors,

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:42.539
and I think a few are starting
majors as well, or have majors.

00:22:42.539 --> 00:22:44.830
Because these other groups
are doing this kind of work,

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:47.040
folks know about the
water filter technology.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.373
It's starting to take off,
and people are collaborating,

00:22:49.373 --> 00:22:50.970
they're entering
into that space.

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.770
And what they're doing,
is they're making

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:54.210
available for their learners--

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:57.240
K-12 learners-- possibilities
that they might not

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:57.965
have thought.

00:22:57.965 --> 00:22:59.340
It's the curriculum
work that I'm

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.654
doing with teachers, I think,
that becomes quite engaging.

00:23:02.654 --> 00:23:03.570
LARRY SUSSKIND: Great.

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:04.620
Thank you all, very much.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:05.690
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
Thank you very much.

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:06.981
Yeah, hope to see you tomorrow.

00:23:06.981 --> 00:23:09.230
Thank you, thank you.
