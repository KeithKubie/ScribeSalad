00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580
 
 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.310
 
as in most sciences especially the human

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320
as in most sciences especially the human
 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.410
as in most sciences especially the human
sciences almost every major question is

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420
sciences almost every major question is
 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.769
sciences almost every major question is
open so for example the take the

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779
open so for example the take the
 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.260
open so for example the take the
question of the two obvious questions

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270
question of the two obvious questions
 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.499
question of the two obvious questions
one is how come there are any languages

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:26.509
one is how come there are any languages
 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.730
one is how come there are any languages
at all I mean a a second question is why

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740
at all I mean a a second question is why
 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.410
at all I mean a a second question is why
are there apparently so many these are

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420
are there apparently so many these are
 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.000
are there apparently so many these are
pretty elementary questions but they're

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010
pretty elementary questions but they're
 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.939
pretty elementary questions but they're
sensible questions roughly say a hundred

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949
sensible questions roughly say a hundred
 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:41.560
sensible questions roughly say a hundred
thousand years ago which is almost

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570
thousand years ago which is almost
 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.259
thousand years ago which is almost
nothing at evolutionary time the

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:44.269
nothing at evolutionary time the
 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:45.460
nothing at evolutionary time the
questions couldn't be raised because

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470
questions couldn't be raised because
 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.560
questions couldn't be raised because
there weren't any languages maybe two

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570
there weren't any languages maybe two
 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.670
there weren't any languages maybe two
hundred thousand but roughly that area

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680
hundred thousand but roughly that area
 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.979
hundred thousand but roughly that area
so it's a sensible question one is the

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989
so it's a sensible question one is the
 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.170
so it's a sensible question one is the
question how did languages suddenly

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180
question how did languages suddenly
 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.320
question how did languages suddenly
emerge in the evolutionary record and

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330
emerge in the evolutionary record and
 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.649
emerge in the evolutionary record and
it's pretty sudden by an evolutionary

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659
it's pretty sudden by an evolutionary
 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:04.810
it's pretty sudden by an evolutionary
framework you know of time involved and

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820
framework you know of time involved and
 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.969
framework you know of time involved and
then how come they proliferated how come

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979
then how come they proliferated how come
 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.969
then how come they proliferated how come
there isn't just one well there's steps

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979
there isn't just one well there's steps
 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.760
there isn't just one well there's steps
towards answering that there's progress

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770
towards answering that there's progress
 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.770
towards answering that there's progress
I think my own view I should say is

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780
I think my own view I should say is
 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.800
I think my own view I should say is
pretty Socratic it's not widely held but

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810
pretty Socratic it's not widely held but
 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.580
pretty Socratic it's not widely held but
I think we understand enough about the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590
I think we understand enough about the
 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.620
I think we understand enough about the
fundamental computational basis of

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630
fundamental computational basis of
 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.810
fundamental computational basis of
language to see that to develop a not a

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820
language to see that to develop a not a
 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.260
language to see that to develop a not a
plausible scenario for how there might

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270
plausible scenario for how there might
 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.750
plausible scenario for how there might
have been a reasonably sudden emergence

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760
have been a reasonably sudden emergence
 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.390
have been a reasonably sudden emergence
of the fundamental nature of language

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400
of the fundamental nature of language
 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.240
of the fundamental nature of language
and also of why the apparent diversity

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250
and also of why the apparent diversity
 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.970
and also of why the apparent diversity
is pretty superficial so that if say a

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980
is pretty superficial so that if say a
 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.250
is pretty superficial so that if say a
Martian was looking at humans the way

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260
Martian was looking at humans the way
 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.890
Martian was looking at humans the way
that we look at say frogs the Martian

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900
that we look at say frogs the Martian
 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.300
that we look at say frogs the Martian
might conclude that this is

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310
might conclude that this is
 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.100
might conclude that this is
fundamentally one language with minor

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110
fundamentally one language with minor
 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.640
fundamentally one language with minor
deviations and I think we're moving

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650
deviations and I think we're moving
 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.740
deviations and I think we're moving
towards an understanding of how that

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750
towards an understanding of how that
 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.649
towards an understanding of how that
might be the case and it is pretty clear

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659
might be the case and it is pretty clear
 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.969
might be the case and it is pretty clear
that it has to be the case the time of

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979
that it has to be the case the time of
 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.830
that it has to be the case the time of
development is much too shallow for

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840
development is much too shallow for
 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.080
development is much too shallow for
fundamental changes to taking place and

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090
fundamental changes to taking place and
 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.570
fundamental changes to taking place and
we know of no fundamental changes so a

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580
we know of no fundamental changes so a
 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.000
we know of no fundamental changes so a

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010
child from a hunter-gatherer tribe in
 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.190
child from a hunter-gatherer tribe in
Stone Age tribe and say the Amazon

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200
Stone Age tribe and say the Amazon
 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.470
Stone Age tribe and say the Amazon
brought to Cambridge and raised here

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480

we'll go on become a quantum physics

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090
we'll go on become a quantum physics
 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.450
we'll go on become a quantum physics
physicist at MIT there's no known

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460
physicist at MIT there's no known

differences in relevant cognitive
 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.790
differences in relevant cognitive
capacities so there's something

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800
capacities so there's something
 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.800
capacities so there's something
fundamentally the same about all of us

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810
fundamentally the same about all of us
 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.380
fundamentally the same about all of us
and it's whatever emerged pretty

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390
and it's whatever emerged pretty
 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.270
and it's whatever emerged pretty
recently and we have to work out the to

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280
recently and we have to work out the to
 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.180

show that the enormous apparent variety

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190
show that the enormous apparent variety
 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.140
show that the enormous apparent variety
is a kind of superficial variation and

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150
is a kind of superficial variation and
 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.760
is a kind of superficial variation and
