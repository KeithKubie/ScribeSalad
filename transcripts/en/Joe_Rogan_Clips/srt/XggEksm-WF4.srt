1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,310
It's like I have,
I have northern European bullshit genes.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,300
These mother fuckers from Kenya, you
know, it was a whole that this for sure.

3
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:12,630
It's really interesting that
the cradle of civilization,

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,850
which is where all human
beings emanated from,

5
00:00:14,851 --> 00:00:18,360
Africa has the best jeans,

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,740
they have the best athletic genes. When
it comes to like physical performance,

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,650
there's no denying
they'd be off the coast.

8
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:28,530
I mean like Nigeria and that area that,
those,

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,820
that's a of Senegal,
Senegal bring up that,

10
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:37,770
that what's that wrestling they call a,
I know what you're talking about.

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,310
Frank Grillo and on fight world did
a, he went to Senegal. He goes, dude,

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,950
six foot six. I mean
they all look like, uh,

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,000
like that's what the NFL is made up of
that and that guy wrote the sports gene,

14
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:48,820
Richard Bernstein,

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,050
I think sports illustrated writer said
the fastest people in the world come from

16
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:55,650
that part of the world to be off
for coast. That's where Jamaica,

17
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:58,710
that's where the slave trade
had gone. And, and they, they,

18
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,180
they came from that area.
So you can actually isolate the genes.

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,850
Well one of the lambda, oh
wow. This is interesting.

20
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:10,830
They're like pawn at each
other and they're all giant.
Why did it, why the fuck?

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,220
Huh? Because they punched in. They
wrestle and they do great high level.

22
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:16,680
Greco shit watches this punching too.
Now you'll see,

23
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:18,180
watch this high level Greco Shit.

24
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,130
They throw Singhalese
Wrestling indycar championship.

25
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:27,000
Beautiful La Luta is the um,

26
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,680
the title of the video. Yep. L A space l.

27
00:01:31,681 --> 00:01:36,350
U. T. T. E, single ease
wrestling, indycar championship.

28
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,510
Now they're working for a position but,
and if you see some of these guys,

29
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,160
you see what their bodies look like.
It's so just so ridiculous. Like,

30
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,460
like they, they live on fish and rice.
I mean, frank went there, it's so poor.

31
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,890
And he said, you just see
dudes where you're like, well,
if I had a body like that,

32
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:53,850
I would never work clothes. So I don't
understand what they're doing here.

33
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,090
They're just getting coaching, just
getting positioned. Whoever gets thrown.

34
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,990
These guys are rock stars in Senegal.
Okay. Do you need coaching? No, no, no.

35
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:03,720
You'll see now they punched me.
Tell you something.

36
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,500
Cain Velasquez shoots a power double in
these motherfuckers here on the back and

37
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:11,010
the stand. Sir, I'm going to ask you
to know that's true. Five minutes.

38
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,650
Five minutes dead.
Five minutes.

39
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:16,950
There's still a lot because they're
waiting to get passionate cakes, bro.

40
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,660
It's like sumo dude nuts. Oh,
exactly. It's nonsense. No, excuse me.

41
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,310
Tread trip. Oh, they're
punching each head. Dude know
shit. Dude. This is serious.

42
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,870
Oh Shit. They're punching from the clinch.
Yeah, Bro. Why is this is fighting. Yes.

43
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,620
Adjust his headband. Yeah. You got to
always adjust your headband time. Tom.

44
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,180
What does time? What did they do in time?
Time. That's it. That's done much. No,

45
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,930
I may be not. I'm confused. Hold. Keep
going with it's gotta be a better one.

46
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,570
You got to see the heavyweights.
They heavy weights are the championship.

47
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:48,780
I figured maybe it just sucks and you're
really into it. Besides foreign, sir.

48
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,230
That's possible. I'm telling you.
I've seen some incredible lamb.

49
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,690
Those dudes are play a petty case. You
will respect lamb book yet. Let's see.

50
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:59,950
Another one. Kickboxing world
champion. Oh, go to the far
right one. That one. Okay,

51
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,270
here we go. Now we'll see what's up.
Kickboxing world champion challenges,

52
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:05,290
singling these wrestlers.

53
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:09,250
Who is this kickboxing world champions
like a documentary? I sir, I don't care.

54
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:13,180
I want to see how it's not like
I've got to find the fight. Oh,

55
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:15,820
is it like an hour ago? There's still
shit. All sorts of stuff going on here.

56
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,480
Who is this? A kickboxing were old
and he's like, there's Sufi Muslim,

57
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,400
so they're hanging out with them
very, very spiritually. Kickbox. Okay.

58
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,670
Uh,
orally say his name.

59
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:31,920
Brian or learning or lean Duarte orally.

60
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,380
Duarte, French, multiple kickboxing,

61
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,290
Muay Thai and Choto con karate champion.
Sounds like me.

62
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,960
So it looks like he's
learning from these folks.

63
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,830
I don't think he's really challenging
them. Okay, let's see what happens in the,

64
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,460
there we go. Look at, look at my man
right there. Set up saying still,

65
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,260
what does it say instead of
saying, still, just let it go.

66
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:57,650
We'll see what happens here. Are they
wrestling? Yeah. Oh, so they're wrestling,

67
00:03:57,651 --> 00:04:01,400
but what? It's all Bouma c that dude
back up a little. Almost see that.

68
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:03,590
Do the kickboxing guy interact with them?
There we go.

69
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:07,870
Okay.

70
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,250
Okay. Let's see. Throws. Okay.

71
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:16,210
They're just teaching him to throw. Oh,
they're teaching them some technique.

72
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:19,510
It's kind of cool that they do it
on the beach though. That's smart.

73
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,050
That's a duck under right there. It
took his back. Yeah. Sandra Nelson,

74
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,170
they know some wrestling
techniques. Wrestling is, you know,

75
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,120
you could make the
argument that wrestling,

76
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:33,010
would you say that wrestling is probably
the best thing you could ever do coming

77
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:35,950
up? If you want to get an MMA,
like they have the space. Yes.

78
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,960
I think wrestling's the
most important sport. Yeah.
