 - Kellyanne's the best, she
 had absolutely no conscience.

00:00:03.736 --> 00:00:05.938
 In fact, that's our next act.

00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:08.574
 You can toss out the names of
 the worst people in history,

00:00:08.607 --> 00:00:10.676
and she'll happily defend them.

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:13.579
 All right, Kellyanne,
 here's the first one.

00:00:13.612 --> 00:00:16.249
 Bernie Madoff.

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:18.718
 - Did Bernie Madoff's
 investors go bankrupt?

00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:21.687 align:start position:0%
Yeah, but I find it interesting
the media used the words

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.056
pyramid scheme.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.191 align:start position:0%
 Frankly, that's anti-Semitic
 when you consider

00:00:25.224 --> 00:00:27.693
 the terrible suffering
 of the Jewish people

00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:30.063 align:start size:88% position:13%
 in Egypt at the
 time of the Pharaoh.

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:33.099 align:start position:0%
 (audience laughing)
 So this so-called bankruptcy

00:00:33.132 --> 00:00:36.436 align:start size:88% position:13%
is actually a moral
one on your part, Wolf.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.640 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Wow!
 (audience applauding)
