Welcome back! Differential equations are all about acceleration and forces aren't they?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Hmm, not really--in this unit, we use them to predict how many people have to be vaccinated

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to stop the outbreak of an epidemic and to find out about the effect of mosquito nets.

00:00:15.000 --> 09:59:59.000
As we do so, you'll see some more tricks to make simulations faster and way more robust.
