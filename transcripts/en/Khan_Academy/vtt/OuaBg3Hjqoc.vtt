00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.770
Identify the most
reasonable units

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.660
to measure each of
the following choices.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.970
So the time it takes to
bake one pan of cookies.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.930
Let's see, that's
usually in the minutes,

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.660
so I'll go with
minutes unless you're

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.670
doing some type of slow baking.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.300
But I'll say minutes is
a reasonable unit here.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.790
The time it takes to
pour a cup of coffee.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.617
Well, that might take you,
at most, 1 or 2 seconds.

00:00:25.617 --> 00:00:27.950
So you definitely don't want
to do it in hours or years.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.250
And we already used up
minutes, and you definitely

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.625
don't want to use
minutes either.

00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:31.990
It's only a few seconds.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.410
The time it takes to drive
from Chicago to Saint Louis.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.550
Well, that hopefully
won't take you years.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.390
That'll take you-- I don't
know the exact distance,

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.880
but it's going to take you
several hours to do that.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.390
So I will go with hours.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.540
Let's do a few more of these.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.270
Identify the most
reasonable units

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.372
to measure each of the
following choices below.

00:00:54.372 --> 00:00:56.330
So we have kilometers,
meters, and millimeters.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.150
And a kilometer, of
course, kilo tells

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.770
us that's equivalent
to 1,000 meters.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.519
And milli means
one-thousandth of a meter.

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.019
Or another way of
thinking about it,

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.840
a meter is 1,000 millimeters
and a kilometer is 1,000 meters.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.220
The length of a ladybug.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.730
Well, the length, unless it's
some kind of monster ladybug,

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.420
we're probably thinking
in millimeters.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.760
The height of an average person.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.170
So an average person
is multiple meters.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.900
It's going to be at least 1
meter tall and more likely

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.950
closer to 2 meters.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.250
Especially your average
male, adult male,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.780
would be right
around 2 meters tall.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.570
So I would go with meters.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.370
The length of a marathon.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.290
So this is a long-distance
race we're talking about here.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.280
If you're used to thinking
in US customary units,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.550
a marathon is 26 miles.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.580
A kilometer isn't
quite equal to a mile.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.280
1.6 kilometers is
equal to a mile,

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.645
but it also makes sense to
measure this in kilometers.

00:02:00.645 --> 00:02:02.395
You would measure the
length of a marathon

00:02:02.395 --> 00:02:03.900
in miles or kilometers.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.020
You'd measure the height
of an average person,

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.690
if you're using US customary
units, you would do it in feet.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.610
If you're using metric units,
you would do it in meters.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.770
The distance between San
Francisco and Los Angeles.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.400
So once again, this is
several thousand kilometers.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.682
We'll go with kilometers.

00:02:17.682 --> 00:02:19.390
Or actually, San
Francisco to Los Angeles

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.115
is several hundred kilometers.

00:02:21.115 --> 00:02:22.949
I thought that said New
York to Los Angeles.

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:25.323
San Francisco to Los Angeles,
several hundred kilometers,

00:02:25.323 --> 00:02:26.850
but still you want
to do kilometers.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.570
The length of an
average-sized swimming pool.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.240
Well, meters seems like a
reasonable measure there.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.250
Your average pool might
be 25 meters or 50 meters

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.670
or something like that.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.240
The thickness of
a slice of bread.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.500
So a slice of bread, it's
definitely a lot thinner

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.750
than a meter, so I'm going
to go with the millimeters.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.990
Let me check our answer.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.490
That right.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.564
Let's do one more.

00:02:54.564 --> 00:02:55.980
Identify the most
reasonable units

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.000
to measure the weight of each
of the following choices below.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.650
So see, we have
ounces and pounds.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.170
And just as a reminder, 1
pound is equal to 16 ounces

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.000
or an ounce is equal to
a sixteenth of a pound.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.940
So a couch-- well, that's going
to be many, many, many pounds,

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.570
probably over 100 pounds.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.560
So we definitely want to put
this in the pounds category.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.520
A cookie-- unless it's
a really large cookie,

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.430
it's going to weigh
less than a pound.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.320
So I'm comfortable
going-- it seems

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.510
reasonable to go with ounces.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.910
A television-- well, they're
getting lighter every day,

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.243
but they still weigh a good bit.

00:03:29.243 --> 00:03:31.130
They still weigh
multiple pounds, usually

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.950
multiple tens of pounds.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.960
So we'll go with pounds.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.890
A cracker-- and once
again, unless we're

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.110
talking about a
really huge cracker,

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.940
most crackers are
very, very light,

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.750
lighter than even a cookie,
so we will go with ounces.
