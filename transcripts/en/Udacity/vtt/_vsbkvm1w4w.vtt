00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.540
So I can start with idea validation and

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.870
go all the way to see if
my product works well.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:05.420
&gt;&gt; Absolutely,

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.730
there's ways for user research to
help you throughout that process.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.330
&gt;&gt; Okay, so we talked about user
research, but what does a designer do?

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.420
&gt;&gt; Well, if you're
an interaction designer like me,

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.480
you're going to spend a lot
of time grappling with tasks.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.070
You're going to think about,
well what are all of the different tasks

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.390
that the user is going to
perform inside of this product?

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.100
And, for every given task that you have,
you're going to try to dive in and

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.200
just try to figure out that sequence
of interactions that the user is going

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.330
to have.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.510
And sometimes you can think
about that like a dialogue.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.290
Think about, well if the user does x,
the system's going to do y, and

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.750
then the user is going to come back and
do z.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.490
You'll kind of go through that, and
you'll start by just kind of shaping one

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.580
of those, but then you'll kind
of go broader and broader.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.310
You'll think about all the other
variants of that same task, so

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.810
what if the user does w instead of y?

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.000
And how does the system respond to that?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.980
And that'll help you just kind of
understand what some of the constraints

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.620
are and what some of the things you
need to account for in the design.

00:01:06.882 --> 00:01:08.700
And then from there you go
kind of bigger and bigger.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.150
You think about what
the next task is and

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.470
you start to kind of chain those
together in interesting ways.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.890
You'll start to see things that
are kind of commonalities.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.910
Tasks that are similar or
sometimes even the same to each other,

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.960
that are kind of good opportunities.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.997
And also things that are really unique,
particular tasks that have these very,

00:01:30.997 --> 00:01:35.543
one-off set of interactions
that don't occur elsewhere.

00:01:35.543 --> 00:01:39.390
&gt;&gt; So I have to map every interaction?

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.880
&gt;&gt; Well either you're
going to map them all or

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.330
the user's going to kind of
have to create their own map.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.630
So trying to anticipate as many
of those interactions as you

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.390
can is going to make it easier for

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.440
the user to kind of follow through
on those goals inside your product.
