00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.550
Here are few tips for
creating a text campaign.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.110
First you really want to highlight
what makes your company stand out.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.530
Why are you unique?

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.180
Include prices, promotions,
or other exclusives.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.350
People often do searches because they
want to make a decision about something.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.290
Now if they're trying to decide what to
do with their dog while they're away,

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.860
let's help them make that choice.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.650
Don't forget a call to action.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.590
Tell a customer what they can
do to get what you're offering.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.280
Like sign up today,
book your first visit, things like that.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.850
Don't forget about your keywords.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.490
Be sure to include your
keywords in your ad

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.750
to show how relevant you
are to their search.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.010
For example, if they're searching for

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.722
earn extra income, our headline
could be earn income by dog sitting.

00:00:40.722 --> 00:00:43.560
We're going to talk about keywords
more later in the lesson.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.250
Your ad needs to match
your landing page.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.555
You want to make sure that customers can
easily find what they are looking for,

00:00:49.555 --> 00:00:51.365
and see the relevance of your ad.

00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:54.577
Also this relevancy will help you
later with your SEO performance,

00:00:54.577 --> 00:00:57.045
it'll help influence your ad placement.

00:00:57.045 --> 00:00:59.143
Think about it from your
customer's perspective.

00:00:59.143 --> 00:01:02.085
If they want to come to your site
because you're offering a two month free

00:01:02.085 --> 00:01:04.435
subscription, don't make them look for
it.

00:01:04.435 --> 00:01:06.655
Get them in and hooked right away.

00:01:06.655 --> 00:01:09.595
And finally experiment,
run a few different ad groups and

00:01:09.595 --> 00:01:11.000
different types of ads.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.980
See which ones perform the best.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.590
You can track your messaging and figure
out what ads are going to be best for

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.110
you and your customers.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.450
Okay, now I want you to
create your own campaign.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.570

you would run for your own company.
