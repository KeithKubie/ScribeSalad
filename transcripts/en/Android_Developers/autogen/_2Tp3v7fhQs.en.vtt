always find our achievement States

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959
always find our achievement States
 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.140
always find our achievement States
confusing revealed means that you know

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150
confusing revealed means that you know
 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.460
confusing revealed means that you know
what the achievement is but you haven't

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470
what the achievement is but you haven't
 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.170
what the achievement is but you haven't
earned it yet right as opposed to hidden

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180
earned it yet right as opposed to hidden
 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.449
earned it yet right as opposed to hidden
or unlocked which means you've actually

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459
or unlocked which means you've actually
 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.390
or unlocked which means you've actually
achievement unlocked yes and so this is

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400
achievement unlocked yes and so this is
 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.819
achievement unlocked yes and so this is
incredibly useful if again we're testing

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829
incredibly useful if again we're testing
 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.770
incredibly useful if again we're testing
achievements before our game goes out

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780
achievements before our game goes out
 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.770
achievements before our game goes out
and we want to kind of practice earning

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780
and we want to kind of practice earning
 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.059
and we want to kind of practice earning
an achievement we want to test that over

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069
an achievement we want to test that over
 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.710
an achievement we want to test that over
and over again we don't have to you know

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720
and over again we don't have to you know
 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.679
and over again we don't have to you know
create 500 test accounts we just know

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:09.689
create 500 test accounts we just know
 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:11.059
create 500 test accounts we just know
you didn't want to do that yeah reset

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069
you didn't want to do that yeah reset
 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.960
you didn't want to do that yeah reset

right well those are the management

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830
right well those are the management

right well those are the management
tools these are all open source you can

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750
tools these are all open source you can
 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.749
tools these are all open source you can
get them from yourself from github from

get them from yourself from github from
 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:31.149
get them from yourself from github from
our regular samples and I guess it's

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:31.159
our regular samples and I guess it's
 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:32.529
our regular samples and I guess it's
probably worth noticing compared to most

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:32.539
probably worth noticing compared to most
 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:34.360
probably worth noticing compared to most
of our sample apps that are like hey

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370
of our sample apps that are like hey
 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.309
of our sample apps that are like hey
here's a sample that you can kind of see

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:36.319
here's a sample that you can kind of see
 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:38.439
here's a sample that you can kind of see
how it works but then you need to go and

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449
how it works but then you need to go and
 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.180
how it works but then you need to go and
like make your own game kind of you know

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190
like make your own game kind of you know
 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.890
like make your own game kind of you know
and copy and paste bits here and there

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900
and copy and paste bits here and there

from our samples this is really intended

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:43.729
from our samples this is really intended
 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:46.420
from our samples this is really intended
for people to essentially use as an

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430

entire application download this thing
they run it yeah and in fact I guess

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930
they run it yeah and in fact I guess
 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.089
they run it yeah and in fact I guess
probably you can walk us through the

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:52.099
probably you can walk us through the
 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:54.610
probably you can walk us through the
setup steps but it really is hey this is

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620
setup steps but it really is hey this is
 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.260
setup steps but it really is hey this is
the code that you should be using on

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270
the code that you should be using on
 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.019
the code that you should be using on
your own uh and and because of API you

00:05:59.019 --> 00:05:59.029
your own uh and and because of API you
 

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:01.269
your own uh and and because of API you
can expand it any way you want yeah all

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:01.279
can expand it any way you want yeah all
 

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:02.469
can expand it any way you want yeah all
right well let's take a look at how

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479
right well let's take a look at how

we're going to set this out for you to
use these tools you're going to need to

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620
use these tools you're going to need to
 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.620
use these tools you're going to need to
host them someplace they're just a

couple of HTML pages and some JavaScript
 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:12.070
couple of HTML pages and some JavaScript

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:09.570
um you could ban them but then they
 

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:10.850
um you could ban them but then they
might notice and they might get angry

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:10.860
might notice and they might get angry
 

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.940

still going to appear in their social
 

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:19.820
still going to appear in their social
scoreboards and so if somebody looks and

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:19.830
scoreboards and so if somebody looks and
 

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.260
scoreboards and so if somebody looks and
says the guy yea he's still got the

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:21.270
says the guy yea he's still got the
 

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.940
says the guy yea he's still got the

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:22.950
highest score that's great but they may
 

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:24.380

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:24.390
be ruining the experience for the people
 

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.750
be ruining the experience for the people
in the public the public boards so this

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:26.760
in the public the public boards so this
 

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.130
in the public the public boards so this
allows them just to be like well they're

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:28.140
allows them just to be like well they're
 

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.420
allows them just to be like well they're
not going to appear on the public boards

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:29.430
not going to appear on the public boards
 

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.480
not going to appear on the public boards
and then uh they will when they look at

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:32.490
and then uh they will when they look at
 

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:33.590
and then uh they will when they look at
the public board they'll still see

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600
the public board they'll still see
 

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.210
the public board they'll still see
themselves but if anybody else looks to

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:35.220
themselves but if anybody else looks to
 

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.890
themselves but if anybody else looks to
the public board they will not be there

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:36.900
the public board they will not be there
 

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.360
the public board they will not be there
alright so that's probably something to

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:38.370
alright so that's probably something to
 

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.090
alright so that's probably something to
make sure hiding needs hide from

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:41.100
make sure hiding needs hide from
 

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.090
make sure hiding needs hide from
everybody except the cheating or be out

through nefarious purposes and then it
 

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:05.870
through nefarious purposes and then it
turns out they're just a really really

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:05.880
turns out they're just a really really
 

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.640
turns out they're just a really really
good player you do have the option to

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:07.650
good player you do have the option to
 

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.320

there right and and another real real
 

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.590
there right and and another real real
use is that you have a bunch of testers

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600
use is that you have a bunch of testers
 

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.329
use is that you have a bunch of testers
who've been playing it in beta and they

00:10:17.329 --> 00:10:17.339
who've been playing it in beta and they
 

00:10:17.339 --> 00:10:18.590
who've been playing it in beta and they
all have really high scores and you're

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:18.600
all have really high scores and you're
 

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.900
all have really high scores and you're
like I don't want to destroy your guys's

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:20.910
like I don't want to destroy your guys's
 

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.910
like I don't want to destroy your guys's
score but really we need to get that off

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:22.920
score but really we need to get that off
 

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.620
score but really we need to get that off
there so people can have a chance all

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:24.630
there so people can have a chance all
 

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.079
there so people can have a chance all
right makes sense yeah now using this

00:10:27.079 --> 00:10:27.089
right makes sense yeah now using this
 

00:10:27.089 --> 00:10:29.329
right makes sense yeah now using this
tool could I for instance you know my

00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:29.339
tool could I for instance you know my
 

00:10:29.339 --> 00:10:30.890
tool could I for instance you know my
customer service people someone emails

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:30.900
customer service people someone emails
 

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.150
customer service people someone emails
me and says hey I didn't get this

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160
me and says hey I didn't get this
 

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.650
me and says hey I didn't get this
achievement can we grant them that

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:33.660
achievement can we grant them that
 

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.930
achievement can we grant them that
achievement using this tool no you need

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:35.940
achievement using this tool no you need
 

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.300
achievement using this tool no you need
a valid access token for each account to

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:38.310
a valid access token for each account to
 

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:40.100
a valid access token for each account to
be able to unlock achievements or lock

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:40.110
be able to unlock achievements or lock
 

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:41.960
be able to unlock achievements or lock
achievements for them so the idea is

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:41.970
achievements for them so the idea is
 

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:44.960
achievements for them so the idea is
this is really used for unrevealed so

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:44.970
this is really used for unrevealed so
 

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:47.030
this is really used for unrevealed so
have to reveal this is really just used

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040
have to reveal this is really just used
 

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.070
have to reveal this is really just used
for testing purposes my testers have

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:49.080
for testing purposes my testers have
 

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.630
for testing purposes my testers have
earned the achievements they want to

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:50.640
earned the achievements they want to
 

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.010
earned the achievements they want to
practice earning the achievements again

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:52.020
practice earning the achievements again
 

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:52.500
practice earning the achievements again
or they wanted

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:52.510
or they wanted
 

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:54.420
or they wanted
that scenario again so we can get them

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:54.430
that scenario again so we can get them
 

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:56.010
that scenario again so we can get them
all back to the original state yeah the

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:56.020
all back to the original state yeah the
 

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.870

one of those areas has been yeah yeah
 

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.740
one of those areas has been yeah yeah
that's basically to got much quality so

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:55.750
that's basically to got much quality so
 

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:59.220
that's basically to got much quality so
what is this this is a factor that we

00:12:59.220 --> 00:12:59.230
what is this this is a factor that we
 

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.170
what is this this is a factor that we
are always trying to improve in

matches that we create so is it looks
like a couple weeks ago this graph took

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:15.130
like a couple weeks ago this graph took
 

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.550
like a couple weeks ago this graph took
a nice little a nice little depth yes so

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:17.560
a nice little a nice little depth yes so
 

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.620
a nice little a nice little depth yes so
what is this we started considering the

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:21.630
what is this we started considering the
 

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:27.780
what is this we started considering the
broad geographic the broad geographic a

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:27.790
broad geographic the broad geographic a
 

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:33.030
broad geographic the broad geographic a
place of our players to estimate the

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.040
place of our players to estimate the
 

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.460
place of our players to estimate the
Latin see that they are going to have

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:35.470
Latin see that they are going to have
 

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:40.950
Latin see that they are going to have
when we form the they match gotcha so

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:40.960
when we form the they match gotcha so
 

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.230
when we form the they match gotcha so
like you basically now kind of prefer

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:43.240
like you basically now kind of prefer
 

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.330
like you basically now kind of prefer
like if I am somewhere and say Seattle

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:45.340
like if I am somewhere and say Seattle
 

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.430
like if I am somewhere and say Seattle
you're saying hey we're gonna try and

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.440
you're saying hey we're gonna try and
 

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.930
you're saying hey we're gonna try and
match you with other people in the

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:48.940
match you with other people in the
 

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:51.180
match you with other people in the
Pacific Northwest area because chances

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:51.190
Pacific Northwest area because chances
 

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.490
Pacific Northwest area because chances
are you'll have better better latency

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:53.500
are you'll have better better latency
 

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.650
are you'll have better better latency
than if we match you excited I end so

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:55.660
than if we match you excited I end so
 

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.590
than if we match you excited I end so
yeah this is something tricky because we

00:13:58.590 --> 00:13:58.600
yeah this is something tricky because we
 

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.790
yeah this is something tricky because we
don't know they write latency after they

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:02.800
don't know they write latency after they
 

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.370
don't know they write latency after they
match is form and at that point is too

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:05.380
match is form and at that point is too
 

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.650
match is form and at that point is too
late to choose a different player you

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:07.660
late to choose a different player you
 

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.390
late to choose a different player you
can't kick someone out for having low

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:09.400
can't kick someone out for having low
 

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.690
can't kick someone out for having low
lanes no of course not so what we have

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:12.700
lanes no of course not so what we have
 

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.330
lanes no of course not so what we have
to do is to collect data for all the

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:15.340
to do is to collect data for all the
 

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.280
to do is to collect data for all the
matches between all the regions around

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:17.290
matches between all the regions around
 

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:20.430
matches between all the regions around
the world and we doing that data we

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:20.440
the world and we doing that data we
 

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.070
the world and we doing that data we
estimate what is likely to be the

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:23.080
estimate what is likely to be the
 

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.580
estimate what is likely to be the
latency between two players in different

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:26.590
latency between two players in different
 

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.620
latency between two players in different
visions so it doesn't necessarily have

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:28.630
visions so it doesn't necessarily have
 

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:30.000
visions so it doesn't necessarily have
to be the same region if we know that

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.010
to be the same region if we know that
 

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.830
to be the same region if we know that
for some reason you know City a and City

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:31.840
for some reason you know City a and City
 

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.420
for some reason you know City a and City
be have a really good internet

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:33.430
be have a really good internet
 

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.460
be have a really good internet
connection between us it's our gear

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:35.470
connection between us it's our gear
 

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:36.990
connection between us it's our gear
system would say oh it's ok to match up

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:37.000
system would say oh it's ok to match up
 

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.590
system would say oh it's ok to match up
these yes exactly so yeah I essentially

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:40.600
these yes exactly so yeah I essentially
 

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:45.330
these yes exactly so yeah I essentially
we do that and we this feature we get

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:45.340
we do that and we this feature we get
 

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:48.030
we do that and we this feature we get
better quality in the matches as you can

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.040
better quality in the matches as you can
 

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.860
better quality in the matches as you can
see in the graph yeah we have almost

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:49.870
see in the graph yeah we have almost
 

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:52.290
see in the graph yeah we have almost
fifteen or twenty percent improvement

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:52.300
fifteen or twenty percent improvement
 

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.660
fifteen or twenty percent improvement
that looks like is yeah so were there

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:54.670
that looks like is yeah so were there
 

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:57.810
that looks like is yeah so were there
any trade-offs involved in it is always

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:57.820
any trade-offs involved in it is always
 

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:04.050
any trade-offs involved in it is always
curve so if we have a match or we when

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:04.060
curve so if we have a match or we when
 

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.630
curve so if we have a match or we when
we are forming a match we see that this

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:06.640
we are forming a match we see that this
 

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.990
we are forming a match we see that this
match is not really good quality or the

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000
match is not really good quality or the
 

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.680
match is not really good quality or the
latency is likely to be not so good

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:14.690
latency is likely to be not so good
 

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:17.680
latency is likely to be not so good
but we don't have other players they are

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:17.690
but we don't have other players they are
 

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.050
but we don't have other players they are
probably we have to wait a little longer

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:20.060
probably we have to wait a little longer
 

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:24.820
probably we have to wait a little longer
to combine the matches in in order to

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:24.830
to combine the matches in in order to
 

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:28.720
to combine the matches in in order to
wait for new players to arrive and see

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:28.730
wait for new players to arrive and see
 

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:32.710
wait for new players to arrive and see
if they have better better quality or

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720
if they have better better quality or
 

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.760
if they have better better quality or
better expected latency between them so

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:35.770
better expected latency between them so
 

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:38.740
better expected latency between them so
this is the trade-off so maybe we need

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:38.750
this is the trade-off so maybe we need
 

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:42.310
this is the trade-off so maybe we need
the players to wait a little longer

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:42.320
the players to wait a little longer
 

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.280
the players to wait a little longer
before we from the matches gotcha so

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:45.290
before we from the matches gotcha so
 

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:46.960
before we from the matches gotcha so
what you're saying is you know for

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:46.970
what you're saying is you know for
 

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:48.490
what you're saying is you know for
instance I might be ready to play and

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:48.500
instance I might be ready to play and
 

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.980
instance I might be ready to play and
the only other you know player available

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:50.990
the only other you know player available
 

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:53.170
the only other you know player available
right now is in you know Australia or

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:53.180
right now is in you know Australia or
 

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.700
right now is in you know Australia or
somewhere we're far away you know

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:54.710
somewhere we're far away you know
 

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:57.310
somewhere we're far away you know
probably slower longer latency the

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:57.320
probably slower longer latency the
 

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.780
probably slower longer latency the
system's going to say we're not going to

00:15:58.780 --> 00:15:58.790
system's going to say we're not going to
 

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:00.160
system's going to say we're not going to
match you up with that guy we're going

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:00.170
match you up with that guy we're going
 

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:01.180
match you up with that guy we're going
to have to we're going to look for

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:01.190
to have to we're going to look for
 

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:02.830
to have to we're going to look for
somebody else with a better connection

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:02.840
somebody else with a better connection
 

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.780
somebody else with a better connection
and so it might take me longer to get

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:04.790
and so it might take me longer to get
 

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.820
and so it might take me longer to get
into a match because I'm not going to

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:06.830
into a match because I'm not going to
 

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:08.980
into a match because I'm not going to
play this guy in Australia yes but of

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:08.990
play this guy in Australia yes but of
 

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:11.710
play this guy in Australia yes but of
course we don't want our players to wait

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:11.720
course we don't want our players to wait
 

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.850
course we don't want our players to wait
too much so what we also estimate is the

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:15.860
too much so what we also estimate is the
 

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.600
too much so what we also estimate is the
waiting time to another player to appear

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:19.610
waiting time to another player to appear
 

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:23.710
waiting time to another player to appear
for this particular game and if we think

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:23.720
for this particular game and if we think
 

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.800
for this particular game and if we think
that it's going to be too long we don't

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:26.810
that it's going to be too long we don't
 

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:29.830
that it's going to be too long we don't
wait on combine the players right away

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:29.840
wait on combine the players right away
 

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.160
wait on combine the players right away
so you sort of you change based on you

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:33.170
so you sort of you change based on you
 

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:34.600
so you sort of you change based on you
change the criteria a little bit based

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:34.610
change the criteria a little bit based
 

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.000
change the criteria a little bit based
on how popular game is how many players

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:37.010
on how popular game is how many players
 

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:38.980
on how popular game is how many players
are playing multiplayer at that time

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:38.990
are playing multiplayer at that time
 

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:41.890
are playing multiplayer at that time
yeah exactly and this is something that

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:41.900
yeah exactly and this is something that
 

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:45.580
yeah exactly and this is something that
is dynamically adjusted so for each

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:45.590
is dynamically adjusted so for each
 

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:48.340
is dynamically adjusted so for each
application each variant and each moment

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:48.350
application each variant and each moment
 

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.860
application each variant and each moment
we calculate all these variables and

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:50.870
we calculate all these variables and
 

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:55.000
we calculate all these variables and
decide if white is a good idea or not so

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:55.010
decide if white is a good idea or not so
 

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:58.870
decide if white is a good idea or not so
then we we purifies these two things to

00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880
then we we purifies these two things to
 

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.930
then we we purifies these two things to
have a good quality but also not to wait

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:01.940
have a good quality but also not to wait
 

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.380
have a good quality but also not to wait
too much that the player drop the

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:05.390
too much that the player drop the
 

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:07.809
too much that the player drop the
montreux or whatever so for instance in

00:17:07.809 --> 00:17:07.819
montreux or whatever so for instance in
 

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:09.760
montreux or whatever so for instance in
a very popular game you could afford to

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:09.770
a very popular game you could afford to
 

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:12.640
a very popular game you could afford to
reject you know players that are too far

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:12.650
reject you know players that are too far
 

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:14.100
reject you know players that are too far
away might not have a good connection

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:14.110
away might not have a good connection
 

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:16.569
away might not have a good connection
because we know that there's constantly

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:16.579
because we know that there's constantly
 

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:18.340
because we know that there's constantly
new people coming in and that I won't

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:18.350
new people coming in and that I won't
 

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:19.720
new people coming in and that I won't
have to wait too much longer to find a

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:19.730
have to wait too much longer to find a
 

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:21.970
have to wait too much longer to find a
matching player wears a game where you

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:21.980
matching player wears a game where you
 

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.860
matching player wears a game where you
know it's you know it's just been

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:23.870
know it's you know it's just been
 

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:25.569
know it's you know it's just been
released or it's not very popular no

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:25.579
released or it's not very popular no
 

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:28.350
released or it's not very popular no
one's playing multiplayer even if some

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:28.360
one's playing multiplayer even if some
 

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.480
one's playing multiplayer even if some
connection isn't optimal the system will

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:30.490
connection isn't optimal the system will
 

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:31.770
connection isn't optimal the system will
say you know we're gonna try and match

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:31.780
say you know we're gonna try and match
 

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.000
say you know we're gonna try and match
you with him anyway because at least

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:33.010
you with him anyway because at least
 

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:34.980
you with him anyway because at least
it's better to have some some game they

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:34.990
it's better to have some some game they
 

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:37.110
it's better to have some some game they
no game at all yeah exactly that's the

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120
no game at all yeah exactly that's the
 

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.930
no game at all yeah exactly that's the
idea by the way we don't reject players

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:39.940
idea by the way we don't reject players
 

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.720
idea by the way we don't reject players
which asks i choose to combine them with

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:42.730
which asks i choose to combine them with
 

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:44.520
which asks i choose to combine them with
other player you're actually I should

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:44.530
other player you're actually I should
 

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.830
other player you're actually I should
take I should make better language yes

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:46.840
take I should make better language yes
 

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.410
take I should make better language yes
we love all of our players we just yes

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:49.420
we love all of our players we just yes
 

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:54.360
we love all of our players we just yes
okay okay so this is it that is that's

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:54.370
okay okay so this is it that is that's
 

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:58.260
okay okay so this is it that is that's
very cool so so so basically our players

00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:58.270
very cool so so so basically our players
 

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:00.210
very cool so so so basically our players
should be noticing a better multiplayer

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:00.220
should be noticing a better multiplayer
 

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.669
should be noticing a better multiplayer
experience yeah and a video yeah and

00:18:02.669 --> 00:18:02.679
experience yeah and a video yeah and
 

00:18:02.679 --> 00:18:04.650
experience yeah and a video yeah and
over time you know as as you adjust

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:04.660
over time you know as as you adjust
 

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:08.010
over time you know as as you adjust
these you know these matching systems

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:08.020
these you know these matching systems
 

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.020
these you know these matching systems
and I guess as more people start playing

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:10.030
and I guess as more people start playing
 

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:12.090
and I guess as more people start playing
multiplayer you'll start to see

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:12.100
multiplayer you'll start to see
 

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:17.789
multiplayer you'll start to see
improvements as well yes yes so another

00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:17.799
improvements as well yes yes so another
 

00:18:17.799 --> 00:18:19.710
improvements as well yes yes so another
thing that maybe in the future happened

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:19.720
thing that maybe in the future happened
 

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:25.760
thing that maybe in the future happened
is if a player or developers want to

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:25.770
is if a player or developers want to
 

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.250
is if a player or developers want to
improve based on the skills of the

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:29.260
improve based on the skills of the
 

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.930
improve based on the skills of the
players we can do some similar stuff

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:32.940
players we can do some similar stuff
 

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.010
players we can do some similar stuff
I've seen I've seen requests for that

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:35.020
I've seen I've seen requests for that
 

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.510
I've seen I've seen requests for that
the public database of like hey you know

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:36.520
the public database of like hey you know
 

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.890
the public database of like hey you know
I want to match you know advanced

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:37.900
I want to match you know advanced
 

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.570
I want to match you know advanced
players with advanced players or people

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:39.580
players with advanced players or people
 

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.190
players with advanced players or people
of the same difficulty level but I guess

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200
of the same difficulty level but I guess
 

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.960
of the same difficulty level but I guess
you do have a good point where there's a

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:42.970
you do have a good point where there's a
 

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:45.360
you do have a good point where there's a
trade-off there where if we start you

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:45.370
trade-off there where if we start you
 

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:47.220
trade-off there where if we start you
know not matching people with with

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:47.230
know not matching people with with
 

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:49.560
know not matching people with with
potential opponents just because maybe

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:49.570
potential opponents just because maybe
 

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:50.850
potential opponents just because maybe
they're not the same skill level the

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:50.860
they're not the same skill level the
 

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.500
they're not the same skill level the
wait time is going to is going to go up

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:52.510
wait time is going to is going to go up
 

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:54.450
wait time is going to is going to go up
and depending on sort of how picky we

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:54.460
and depending on sort of how picky we
 

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:57.539
and depending on sort of how picky we
get it could you know the more factors

00:18:57.539 --> 00:18:57.549
get it could you know the more factors
 

00:18:57.549 --> 00:18:58.980
get it could you know the more factors
we kind of have to wait until we get a

00:18:58.980 --> 00:18:58.990
we kind of have to wait until we get a
 

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:00.450
we kind of have to wait until we get a
perfect match the longer the wait I'm

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:00.460
perfect match the longer the wait I'm
 

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:03.060
perfect match the longer the wait I'm
could be yes but of course we have to

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:03.070
could be yes but of course we have to
 

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:06.419
could be yes but of course we have to
consider all these features or these

00:19:06.419 --> 00:19:06.429
consider all these features or these
 

00:19:06.429 --> 00:19:10.350
consider all these features or these
parameters when when we try to combine

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:10.360
parameters when when we try to combine
 

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:14.850
parameters when when we try to combine
matches for players and of course we

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:14.860
matches for players and of course we
 

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:18.210
matches for players and of course we
don't always the wait time it's a very

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:18.220
don't always the wait time it's a very
 

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.430
don't always the wait time it's a very
important factor and we don't want our

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:20.440
important factor and we don't want our
 

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.500
important factor and we don't want our
players to wait too much so that you

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:22.510
players to wait too much so that you
 

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:24.630
players to wait too much so that you
yeah so yeah it sounds like sounds like

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640
yeah so yeah it sounds like sounds like
 

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.210
yeah so yeah it sounds like sounds like
a tricky problem yeah it's it's not a

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:27.220
a tricky problem yeah it's it's not a
 

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:31.919
a tricky problem yeah it's it's not a
simple one and again the major problem

00:19:31.919 --> 00:19:31.929
simple one and again the major problem
 

00:19:31.929 --> 00:19:34.799
simple one and again the major problem
is that you don't know all the

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:34.809
is that you don't know all the
 

00:19:34.809 --> 00:19:37.890
is that you don't know all the
information after until is too late to

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:37.900
information after until is too late to
 

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.440
information after until is too late to
take the optimal decision so

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:40.450
take the optimal decision so
 

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:44.370
take the optimal decision so
custom ate a lot of details to do this

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:44.380
custom ate a lot of details to do this
 

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.580
custom ate a lot of details to do this
process well I'm glad you're working on

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:47.590
process well I'm glad you're working on
 

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:50.370
process well I'm glad you're working on
it and not me alright well I think that

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:50.380
it and not me alright well I think that
 

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.920
it and not me alright well I think that
