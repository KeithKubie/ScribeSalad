00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.300
This morning Google
released the new trailer

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.300
from its Glass project.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.100
Is augmented reality the next
big step in our everyday lives?

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:14.420
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.010
Hey, I'm Anthony, and if you
have not seen this new Glass

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.110
video, it's pretty awesome.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.330
It's showing people
getting live directions,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.090
taking and sending
photos and texts,

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.150
video-chatting, translating
foreign languages

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.190
as they go through
their daily routine.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.800
Well, the Google employee
version of a daily routine,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.690
anyway-- which is, I guess,
piloting vintage airplanes,

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.360
taking trapeze lessons,
and snowboarding.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.790
Thanks, stock options.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.370
Google's Glass is really
the first huge push

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.820
to get useful augmented reality
into the hands of everyone,

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.600
starting with developers who
can pre-order their unit now

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.346
for $1,500 and get it in 2014.

00:00:50.346 --> 00:00:51.720
Now a lot of stuff
in the trailer

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.730
might make it seem pretty silly.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.110
For instance, I'm very rarely
going to need to share the ice

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.960
sculpture I'm
carving on Google+.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.230
But I do love the
bit where the guy

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.690
is walking through the airport
and his gate and flight

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.630
information pop
up automatically.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.820
That sort of thing, that sort
of instantaneous, effortless

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.110
access to important information,
has been the main function

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.940
of augmented reality so far.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.340
Soldiers have had head-mounted
displays in the field

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.660
since 2005.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.440
And jet fighter cockpits
use heads-up displays.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.610
Both of them overlay
important target

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.560
and navigational information,
allowing a pilot or a soldier

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.480
to make these split-second
instinctive decisions

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.690
without hesitation.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.560
Automobile manufacturers
have already

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.770
showed off how that
would work in a car,

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.690
highlighting important
signs and lanes,

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.530
overlaying traffic information.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.190
It's going to be hard to miss
your exit if it's glowing

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.820
and there's a big arrow
pointing to it, right?

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.900
Spatial environmental
rooms, like the University

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.640
of Illinois at Chicago's
Cave 2, use giant rooms

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.830
with 3-D glasses
and control wands

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.570
to let people collaborate
on medical research

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.340
or other complex projects.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.240
They let people do things like
walk through the human brain.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.220
And now the general public
is getting Google Glass.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.875
But what happens when Google
Glass, or something like it,

00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:09.350
gets as powerful as Cave 2?

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.320
And hopefully much
less noticeable.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.740
Because let's be honest, Google
Glass looks really silly.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.050
I feel like my dad would wear it
with a fanny pack or something.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.760
Well, DARPA is currently
working on augmented reality

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.680
contact lenses called
Scenic-- tiny, full-color,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.250
high-resolution displays
right over your eye,

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.780
completely unnoticeable.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.230
Now it'll be a long time
before they trickle down to us.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.980
But something from last
week popped into my head

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.710
as I was thinking
about all this.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.260
The FDA just approved
the Argus 2 bionic eye.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.340
Now that's an
artificial retina that

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.540
restores partial
sight to the blind.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.090
The Argus uses a visor that
looks a lot like Google's Glass

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.390
to record the wearer's
field of vision,

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.700
send the image to a
belt-pack processor,

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.080
and then that processor
turns the videos

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.720
into electrical signals
that are wirelessly

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.220
transmitted to an implant
in the person's eye tissue.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.397
And right now, Argus sends
black-and-white, low-resolution

00:03:04.397 --> 00:03:06.480
images, but that's going
to get better and better.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.240
And as processing
power improves,

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.580
that belt-pack might be
replaced with, say, your phone.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.950
And right now, the
implant costs $100,000.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.940
But as technology gets better,
it's going to get cheaper.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.236
So what happens when augmented
reality just lives in our eyes?

00:03:22.236 --> 00:03:23.610
I think it's going
to be amazing,

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.870
but this stuff can be
a little frightening.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.060
For instance, I cannot even
remember my friends' phone

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.720
numbers anymore
because of smartphones.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.570
So what happens when I offboard
my whole life to the internet?

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.990
How conscientious are
people really going

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.360
to be when everything they need
to know is spoon-fed to them

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.680
at every moment?

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.260
And what happens when someone
hacks into what you see,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.024
or the implant just fails?

00:03:47.024 --> 00:03:49.190
It'll be interesting to see
how much this catches on

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.490
over the next few years and
how dependent we actually

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:53.875
become on it.

00:03:53.875 --> 00:03:54.750
Are you guys into it?

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.990
Are you thinking about
that $1,500 pre-order?

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.610
