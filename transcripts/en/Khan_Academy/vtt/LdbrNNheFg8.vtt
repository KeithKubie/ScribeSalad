00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.060
- [Instructor] We're asked
to determine for each x-value

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.480
whether it is in the domain of f or not.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.530
And they have our definition
of f of x up here.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.740
So pause this video and see
if you can work through this

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.063
before we do it together.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.030
All right, so just as a bit of a review,

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.610
if x is in the domain of our function,

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.530
that means that if we input
our x into our function,

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.990
when we are going to get a
legitimate output f of x.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.140
But if for whatever reason
f isn't defined at x

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.240
or it gets some kind of undefined state,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.560
well, then x would not be in the domain.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.240
So let's try these different values.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.410
Is x equal to negative
five in the domain of f?

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.530
Well, let's see what happens

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.970
if we try to evaluate f of negative five.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.880
Well, then in the numerator,
we get negative five plus five.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.030
Every place where we see an x,

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.300
we replace it with a negative five.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.131
So it's negative five plus five,

00:00:56.131 --> 00:01:00.960
over negative five minus
three, which is equal to

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.630
in our numerator, we get zero,

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.130
and in our denominator,
we get negative eight.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.507
Now, at first you see the zero,

00:01:07.507 --> 00:01:08.740
and you might get a little bit worried,

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.090
but it's just a zero in the numerator,

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.640
so this whole thing just
evaluates to a zero,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.100
which is a completely legitimate output.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.690
So x equals negative
five is in the domain.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.910
What about x equals zero?

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:22.743
Is that in the domain?

00:01:22.743 --> 00:01:23.576
Pause the video.

00:01:23.576 --> 00:01:25.290
See if you can figure that out.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.440
Well, f of zero is going to be equal to

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.827
in our numerator, we have zero plus five,

00:01:30.827 --> 00:01:34.760
and in our denominator,
we have zero minus three.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.110
Well, that's just going to
get us five in the numerator

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.970
and negative three in the denominator.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.940
This would just be negative 5/3.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.030
But this is a completely
legitimate output.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.240
So the function is
defined at x equals zero,

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.760
so it's in the domain for sure.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.310
Now what about x equals three?

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.690
Pause the video and
try to figure that out.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:52.950
Well, I'll do that up here.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.200
f of three is going to be equal to what?

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.210
And you might already
see some warning signs

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.510
as to what's going to happen
here in the denominator,

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.890
but I'll just evaluate the whole thing.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.260
In the numerator, we get three plus five.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.670
In the denominator, we
get three minus three.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.230
So this is going to be
equal to eight over zero.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.760
Now what is eight divided by zero?

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.880
Well, we don't know.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.960
This is one of those fascinating
things in mathematics.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.700
We haven't defined what happens

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.010
when something is divided by zero.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.900
So three is not in the domain.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.860
The function is not defined
there, not in domain.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.203
Let's do another example.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.870
Determine for each x-value

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.150
whether it is in the domain of g or not.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.983
So pause this video

00:02:36.983 --> 00:02:39.070
and try to work through
all three of these.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.790
So first of all, when x
equals negative three,

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.710
do we get a legitimate g of x?

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.570
So let's see.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.200
g of negative three, if
we try to evaluate this,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.400
that's going to be the square root

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.520
of three times negative three,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.250
which is equal to the square
root of negative nine.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.689
Well, with just a principle
square root like this,

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.130
we don't know how to evaluate this.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.220
So this is not in the domain.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.260
What about when x equals zero?

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.760
Well, g of zero is going to be equal to

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.870
the square root of three times zero,

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.900
which is equal to the square root of zero,

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.890
which is equal to zero,

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.910
so that gave us a legitimate result.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.010
So that is in the domain.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.800
Now what about g of two, or x equals two?

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.410
Does that give us a legitimate g of two?

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.790
Well, g of two is going to
be equal to the square root

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.330
of three times two, which is
equal to the square root of six

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.280
which is a legitimate output.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.120
So x equals two is in the domain.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.933
Let's do one last example.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.680
So we're told, this h
of x right over here,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.470
and once again, we have
to figure out whether

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.150
these x-values are in the domain or not.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.610
Pause this video and see if
you can work through that.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:53.920
All right, well, let's
just first think about

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.540
h of negative one.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.490
What's that going to be equal to?

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.690
Negative one, every place we see an x,

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.860
we're going to replace
it with a negative one,

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.450
minus five, squared.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.890
Well, this is going to be
equal to negative six squared,

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.990
negative six squared, which
is equal to positive 36,

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.800
which is a very legitimate output,

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.853
and so this is definitely in the domain.

00:04:16.853 --> 00:04:18.430
What about five?

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.320
So h of five is going to be equal to

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.890
five minus five squared.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.270
Now you might be getting worried

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.410
'cause you're seeing a zero here,

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.240
but it's not like we're
trying to divide by zero.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.480
We're just squaring zero,

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.190
which is completely legitimate.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.887
So zero squared is just a zero,

00:04:32.887 --> 00:04:36.410
and so h of five is very much defined.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.620
So this is in the domain.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.983
Now what about h of 10?

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.540
Well, h of 10 is going to be
equal to 10 minus five squared,

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.890
which is equal to five
squared, which is equal to 25.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.210
Once again, it's a very legitimate output.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.110
So the function is definitely
defined for x equals 10,

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.943
and we're done.
