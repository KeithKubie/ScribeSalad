00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.700
Welcome to the lecture series
of the College of Science.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.394
My name is Joaquin Ruiz.

00:00:20.394 --> 00:00:21.560
I'm the Dean of the College.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:28.580
[AUDIENCE CHEERING]

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.642
Last week we had
a lecture series,

00:00:30.642 --> 00:00:32.350
which was really
extraordinary in itself.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.940
It was about mind
and brain, and it was

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.930
all about what makes us humans.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.000
This lecture series now on
cosmology is what makes us.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.860
So I hope you enjoy it.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.190
Today's speaker I am really
proud of introducing,

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.350
Chris Impey though many
of you may know him.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.670
Before I introduce
Chris, of course

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.280
I think we have to recognize
again those folks that

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.630
make it free for the rest of
us, and those are the sponsors

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.730
of the lecture series.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.840
[AUDIENCE CLAPPING]

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.320
But let me now introduce
you to Chris Impey.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.370
Chris is a University
Distinguished professor

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.350
whose research interests
are observational cosmology,

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.280
gravitational lensing, and
the evolution of structure

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.540
of galaxies.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.320
He has 160 refereed publications
and 60 conference proceedings,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.380
and his work has been
supported by $20 million

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.940
in grants from NASA and NSF.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.020
He has won 11 teaching
awards, and he

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.770
has been heavily
involved in curriculum

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.530
and instructional
technology development.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.260
Chris is past President of the
American Astronomical Society.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.560
He has also been a
National Science Foundation

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.600
distinguished teaching scholar,
a Phi Beta Kappa visiting

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.370
scholar, and the Carnegie
counsel on teachings Arizona

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.770
professor of the year.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.060
He has written over 30
popular articles in cosmology

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.180
and astrobiology,
and co-authored

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.590
two introductory textbooks.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.410
He is the author of two popular
books, "The Living Cosmos"

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.510
and "How It Ends,"
and in 2009, he

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.770
was elected Fellow of
the American Association

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.039
for the Advancement of Science.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.820
In addition to all of
this, instead of sleeping,

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.860
Chris regularly
teaches cosmology

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.550
to Buddhist monks at the
monastery in the Himalayas,

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.110
has played pingpong at Mt.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.030
Everest base camp, and
I have to warn you,

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.900
his Scottish accent emerges
after drinking single scotch.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:26.689
Chris.

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:37.680
[AUDIENCE CHEERING]

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.490
OK.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.460
I'm really pleased to be here.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.380
So I want to start with history.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.780
A guy gave some amazing
and beautiful story

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.700
of the philosophical
and religious traditions

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.167
that underpin our
ideas of the universe.

00:02:51.167 --> 00:02:53.250
I'm going to give a little
more history leading up

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.870
to the idea of the Big Bang.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.250
And the fundamental
dichotomy in this subject

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.460
is a profound issue that
it's easy to understand.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.490
It's the distinction between
whether the universe is

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.040
finite or infinite.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.200
And that's either
in time or space.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.830
And worrying about
this is essentially

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:10.910
what cosmologists do.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.590
Normal people get
up and they worry

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.040
about paying their mortgage,
and paying the college bills,

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.700
cosmologists, people
like me, get up

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.060
in a cold sweat worrying
about whether the universe is

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.520
infinite or not.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.360
Does the universe go on forever
or does it have a limit?

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.150
These questions have
been asked for centuries.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.150
Plato's colleague, Archytas,
said, imagine a warrior

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.780
with a spear at the
edge of the universe,

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.210
and he hurls his spear swiftly.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.110
Do you imagine that
it goes forever?

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.290
And into what?

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.350
Or does it hit something,
or bounce back?

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.482
And in that case,
what's the limit?

00:03:42.482 --> 00:03:44.690
So you can see either way
there's a bit of a problem.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.570
It's either infinite, and
what's all that about?

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.569
Or there's an end, and
what's the end and what's

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:49.600
beyond the end?

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.880
And cosmologists wrestle
with the same questions.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.920
And I'll attempt to
partially answer them today.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.840
When Copernicus replaced
this, the geocentric model,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.360
with the heliocentric model,
it was a revolutionary move.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.150
The word revolution in
our modern sense of it,

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.500
as violent political
and social upheaval,

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.770
refers to Copernicus's
book on the revolutions.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.660
Because what he did was
not just astronomical,

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.120
it was a revolution, a
profound social revolution.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.250
You can imagine
also how difficult

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.940
it was when, beyond that,
in the mid 16th century,

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.660
Thomas Digges extended
the celestial sphere

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.550
to innumerable stars going off
the page in every direction.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.890
Infinite numbers of stars.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.320
This was an
incomprehensible idea.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.120
It got people into trouble.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.520
This is the statue in the
Campo de Fiori in Rome

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.440
of Giordano Bruno,
who was burned

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.070
at the stake as a pertinacious
and impenitent heretic

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.750
by the Catholic church,
for not only believing

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.430
in an infinite
universe, but believing

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.680
that those innumerable stars
had planets around them

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.750
with lifeforms on them,
and perhaps people.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.170
And this was too much to bear.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.630
Cosmology is a
shifting landscape.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.560
The next venture
towards the infinite

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.590
was Isaac Newton, who
postulated an infinite universe.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.330
Infinite in extent,
in time, and space.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.270
And this was followed
by Wright, who

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.740
imagined infinite inhabited
worlds in this universe.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.710
It's still a difficult
concept, and it's

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.520
difficult conceptually.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.210
If you were in a large
forest, every sightline

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.540
through the forest
would end in a tree.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.980
In an infinite universe,
every sightline

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.840
must end on a point
of light, whether it's

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.780
a star or a galaxy.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.780
Since the light from
each star diminishes

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.330
as the square of the distance,
but the number of stars

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.800
rises by the same factor,
logically the night sky

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.250
should be bright-- as
bright as the daytime sky--

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.010
in an infinite universe.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.080
This was a paradox that
Newton never resolved.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.810
Not only infinite in light,
but infinite in gravity too,

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.780
since that's an
inverse square law.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.440
So it took longer to learn
how the universe works,

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.560
and to resolve Olber's paradox,
which, to cut to the chase,

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.540
is resolved by the finite age
of the universe and the fact

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.830
that it is expanding.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.360
Our sense of the
universe evolved

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.830
through the time of
Herschel, making a catalog

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.980
of fuzzy objects in the sky.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.360
Another dichotomy
arose as an argument

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.580
over whether the Milky Way,
the system of stars we inhabit,

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.750
was the whole universe
or whether there

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.050
were other Island Universes,
systems of stars like our own.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.130
Herschel managed to
map out the Milky Way

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.200
and knew it was vast, perhaps
100,000 light years across.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.800
But at the turn of
the 20th century,

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.210
two very different
ideas were in play.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.380
In one of them,
the fuzzy nebulae--

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.900
including the Andromeda
nebula, the easiest

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.870
to study with big
telescopes-- were hypothesized

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.640
to be distant systems of
stars like the Milky Way,

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.520
perhaps hundreds of thousands
or millions of light years away.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.490
The countervailing
model, which was actually

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.610
accepted through the
beginning of the 20th century,

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.350
said that these fuzzy
patches of light

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.070
were just regions
of star formation

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.750
within our own large galaxy,
which was the universe.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.790
This was resolved
by Edwin Hubble, who

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.370
made the breakthrough discovery
by measuring the distance,

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.820
astronomically, to
the Andromeda nebula

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.630
and a few dozen other
galaxies for the first time.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.110
The method he used involved
isolating variable stars

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.150
within the body of the
galaxy and recognizing

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.450
that they were identical
to similar variable stars

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.220
in the Milky Way.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.830
Nature provides a
linear relationship

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.270
between the absolute
brightness, or flux,

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.410
from these variable stars
and relates it to the period.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.910
So by measuring the period of
variable stars in Andromeda,

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.600
comparing them to local
examples at known distance,

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.930
he was able to show that
Andromeda was several million

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:40.950
light years away.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.820
It was an external galaxy.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.550
And by the end of
his career, he had

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.440
extended the size of
the known universe

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.230
by a factor of thousands.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.980
From a few thousand light
years to a few hundred

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.450
million light years.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.860
That's the Hubble revolution.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.570
The second revolution
is to come,

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.730
that of the expanding universe.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.130
But before going any further in
talking about a vast universe,

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:07.490
let me remind you, as Guy
did last week, that cosmology

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:09.060
involves assumptions.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.730
We don't know everything.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:13.190
The first assumption,
very profound,

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:16.250
is that the universe is
in fact comprehensible.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.660
It's not necessarily the case.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:23.020
In fact, it's difficult to
keep the universe in your head.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:27.430
Another assumption is that the
universe obeys physical laws.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.600
It's a thing that has
been found magical

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.190
to scientists and
mathematicians,

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.530
that the universe
is so well described

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.750
by simple and sometimes
complex mathematics,

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.230
and by a very small set
of physical laws that

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.000
seem to apply everywhere.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.520
It didn't have to be that way,
but it seems to be that way.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.190
These physical laws
remind us that our venture

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:48.880
into the universe is incomplete.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.620
We don't know where
this will end.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.990
If we simplistically imagine
that the universe, nature,

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.760
consists of things that happen
and things that don't, things

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.670
that are and things that
aren't, the theory we have,

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.950
being modest,
describes some subset

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.910
of the things that
actually happen.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.200
It's not the theory we want.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.780
The theory we want is
the theory of everything.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.620
A theory that describes
everything that

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.800
actually is in the universe.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.670
But the danger, of course, is
we don't know how to get there.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:17.650
And along the way, we
might, in our over-ambition,

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:19.720
end up with a
theory of too much.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.090
And how would we
know the difference?

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.180
Another way of looking
at this, and maybe

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.120
a little more
profound, is the fact

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.530
that we're bounded actually
not by our science,

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:31.010
but or by our imaginations.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:35.177
And our imaginations are very
supple and very impressive.

00:09:35.177 --> 00:09:37.010
So there are the set
of things, for example,

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:38.961
that are possible that
don't actually happen.

00:09:38.961 --> 00:09:41.210
That includes everything
that happens in the universe,

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.290
plus some things that
break no law of nature,

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:44.740
but don't actually happen.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:49.520
And if you wonder about the
things that you can imagine,

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.910
the imaginable things hopefully
include all the things

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.380
that do happen, but
maybe not all of them,

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.970
almost certainly include a lot
of things that are possible,

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.780
but not all of
them, and includes

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.570
a lot of things that
just don't happen,

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.030
but they're fun to think about.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:05.010
Once again, how do we
bound our imaginations

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.490
in the universe that
has not yet presented us

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:10.820
with all of its phenomena?

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.230
We also assume that the universe
obeys very simple laws that

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:16.950
says effects have causes.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.000
You have to think a bit to
realize how incomprehensible

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.130
the universe would be
if causality did not

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:23.860
operate at some level.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.260
Now note that this does
not imply determinism

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.470
in the universe.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.700
Laplace famously caricatured
Newton's Law of Gravity

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.534
by implying that if we knew
the positions and velocities

00:10:35.534 --> 00:10:36.950
of every particle
in the universe,

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.330
we could predict the entire
future of the universe

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:40.760
deterministically.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.330
Science is not
deterministic, but causality

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:44.970
is a foundation stone.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.460
Without causality, events
could proceed causes.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.800
Things can move backwards
and forwards in time.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.020
And we know that that
is extremely tricky.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.920
We make another assumption
that is improperly

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.640
tested by modern science, which
is that the laws of physics

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.900
are the same everywhere.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.999
We do know that the
cosmological principle, which

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:08.040
is the underlying assumption
that the universe is

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.230
the same in every direction
and every location,

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:13.600
is true in the sense
of every direction.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.590
Here looking across the sky,
we see roughly equal numbers

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:19.010
of galaxies in each sideline.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:21.740
But testing it in location
is impossible because

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.100
of the finite speed of light.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.600
If the speed of
light were infinite,

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.060
we could see the entire
universe as it is now, laid out

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.420
before us in its wonderfulness.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.420
But the speed of
light is finite,

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.610
and that leads to a
very interesting issue.

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.710
The issue of ancient light.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:41.580
Now cosmologists turn
the lemons into lemonade,

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.960
and the fact that light
has a finite speed

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:49.520
becomes an advantage because
it means that distant light is

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.890
old light.

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:52.780
The light that you
see reflecting off me

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.200
from the stage lights
takes maybe a nanosecond

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.300
to reach your eyes.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.190
You can't detect
that difference.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:00.350
You probably remember
the little time delay

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:02.960
when people talk to the
astronauts at the moon.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.720
That's about a second.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.270
If you're talking about
the sun and some evil alien

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.430
civilization squashed
it into a black hole

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.380
and extinguished
its light, it would

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.781
be eight minutes before
we were the wiser

00:12:13.781 --> 00:12:16.030
because that's how long it
would take that information

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.310
to reach us.

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:20.110
And it actually makes no
sense to ask of nature,

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:21.960
what is the sun doing now?

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.670
What is Sirius doing now?

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:25.320
No, you have to be patient.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.880
You have to wait
those nine years

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.570
for the light of that
bright star to reach you.

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:32.060
And by the time you're in
the extra galactic universe,

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.550
those light travel times
are becoming interesting.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:36.390
Far longer than a human life.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:40.220
Even the nearest galaxy is a
few million light years away,

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.390
which means we see it
as it was in the past.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.590
And at the limit of our
telescopes, which I'll get to,

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:46.970
they become time machines.

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:51.220
And that's an extraordinary
thing to be given.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.820
A final assumption is
that our location is not

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:55.590
special in the universe.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:58.540
And the more general
cultural way of saying that

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.980
is that we are not
privileged in any way.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.250
I mean, occasionally it's
hard to get over the fact

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:06.520
that we feel privileged, but
the Copernican revolution,

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.770
if it's telling us anything,
is saying, get over yourselves.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:11.550
Just get over yourselves.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:14.460
You're not that special,
you're not that important.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.000
Starting with the Copernican
revolution itself,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.110
we have found that we are
not special in our location

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.380
in our galaxy, and
our galaxy is not

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.475
special in its location
in the universe.

00:13:24.475 --> 00:13:26.100
As I'll mention, we
found that were not

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.580
even made of the stuff
the universe is made of.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.950
And the universe we
occupy may be one

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:32.820
of a larger set of universes.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.620
And our biology
may not be unique.

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.550
There's really nothing that
might be special about us

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.880
in a cosmic sense.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.390
But this idea of
light travel time

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.870
is critical to understanding
how the universe started,

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.450
because it means to look at
how the universe started,

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:49.770
all we have to do is look
out further and further.

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:52.400
And so we have
the nearby now, we

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.690
have the realm of the stars,
which is quite recent,

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:56.540
maybe human lifetimes.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:00.010
We have long ago galaxies,
and for the universe itself,

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:00.640
its ancient.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.644
Its looking back to
the dawn of time.

00:14:03.644 --> 00:14:05.060
And now you thought
you were going

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.060
to go away with just
being participants here,

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.310
we're going to have some
audience participation.

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.180
Yes, you are part of the show.

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.920
You all got a card.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.700
Don't be scared,
it's quite harmless.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.870
We do this all the time.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:19.001
You have a card.

00:14:19.001 --> 00:14:19.500
OK.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.708
There is one way to screw up.

00:14:20.708 --> 00:14:24.520
Don't fold the card so
the white points outwards.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.590
So you can fold the
card, the piece of paper,

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:29.170
in half and then half again.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:30.724
And it doesn't
matter in which order

00:14:30.724 --> 00:14:33.140
you do the haves and half
again, as long as the colors are

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:34.770
pointing outwards.

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:39.250
And you will have made a
quadrant piece of paper,

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:42.370
which with one fold,
you can put whatever

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:44.870
ABCD do you want in front.

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:46.720
And so I'm going to
ask you a question,

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.830
and you're going to vote,
and the way you vote

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:51.320
is by putting your
answer facing me.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.165
Don't put the answer facing you.

00:14:53.165 --> 00:14:54.730
You know what your answer is.

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:56.770
You don't need to
remind yourself.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:00.910
If this is my answer, I point it
to you, and you point it to me.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:01.930
OK?

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:02.830
Is everyone clear?

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.650
Look, I can come out
here, you know, I'm

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:07.090
not-- if anyone's not clear.

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:08.906
John, are you clear about this?

00:15:08.906 --> 00:15:10.730
Gale, do you know
how this works?

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:11.880
You know how this works.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:12.580
OK.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.694
So if nobody's-- if
someone's not clear,

00:15:15.694 --> 00:15:17.610
just tell me and I'll
come back and help them.

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:21.220
But anyway, we're
going to warm up.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.877
And I'm going to
count down to three,

00:15:22.877 --> 00:15:24.710
and then we'll flip to
a camera where you'll

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:25.960
be able to see how you voted.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:26.996
So you have to trust me.

00:15:26.996 --> 00:15:28.620
Because otherwise
you have to trust me,

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.390
and I'm probably going to lie.

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:32.770
So here's your warm up question.

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:38.885
Yes, it is a very easy question.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:45.340
And there's no E. There's no
E, so no-- oh, you're too good.

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.590
We're not ready with a camera.

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:47.660
I'm going to count
down to three.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.450
You're too good.

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:52.040
But there's no E, so there's
no failing this class.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.899
I'm going to get
my answer ready.

00:15:53.899 --> 00:15:55.690
Actually I'm not sure
because I'm finished,

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:57.250
I could still screw up.

00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:00.036
So I'm going to give myself
a tentative B, but go ahead.

00:16:00.036 --> 00:16:01.660
On a count of three,
hold your cards up

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.450
and we'll show
you what you said.

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:04.240
One, two, three.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.460
There you are.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:10.670
Oh, my goodness, that's a--
we got a few people in there.

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:13.250
There's a-- there's
a few people who

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:17.800
are pretty hard on themselves,
but mostly you're doing well.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.170
OK.

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:22.930
If we go back to-- now I'm going
to ask you a real question.

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:24.960
So this is an analogy question.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.580
The age of the universe
is to a human life

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:30.290
as a human life is to what?

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:32.310
And I'll give you few
seconds to think about it.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:35.820
Just prepare your answer so
we can do it all together.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:36.920
And I'll count down.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.050
So we do it all together and
then we'll flip to the camera.

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:41.560
So think about that.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:42.360
OK, that's enough.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.110
You're all smart, you
can figure this out.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:47.600
Three, two, one, go.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.240
Very good.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.130
Wow.

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:52.240
So you're right, it's
a fraction of a second.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.160
Human lives are about
a billion times less

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.440
than the age of the universe.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.810
Actually, you kind of
know all this stuff.

00:16:57.810 --> 00:16:58.970
I think I'm going to quit.

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:02.220
I've heard they're serving
some really good single malts

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:05.890
downtown, so we could all
get out of here early.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:06.697
But no.

00:17:06.697 --> 00:17:07.280
That was good.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.990
So the first lesson on
the age of the universe

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:12.910
is of course the
vastness of time

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:16.000
that astronomers have
indeed pretty much probed.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.599
But let's return to what the
universe is made of before we

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:22.484
go back in time
towards the Big Bang.

00:17:22.484 --> 00:17:24.400
Well talk about normal
matter first, the stuff

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.220
that we're made of.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:30.580
99.9% of the universe
is hydrogen and helium.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.310
Rather uninteresting, and
the two simplest elements.

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:34.860
Now, Phil [INAUDIBLE]
in a few weeks

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.580
is going to talk
about the 0.1% that's

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:41.200
left, but don't think of that as
a residue that's uninteresting,

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.280
because without
that residue formed

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.670
in the fiery heat of
stars, we wouldn't be here.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:47.960
That includes all
the nitrogen, carbon,

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.030
and oxygen that life depends
on, the heavy elements.

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:53.004
So that's a critical
part of the universe,

00:17:53.004 --> 00:17:54.420
but it's very
important that stars

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:57.620
exist because if stars had
never formed in the congealing

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.440
gas of the expanding
universe, the universe would

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.189
have stayed hydrogen as helium.

00:18:02.189 --> 00:18:04.230
Now you know, I'm a
physicist, I'm not a chemist.

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:06.230
But let me put my thinking
hat on and figure out

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:10.710
what you can make with
hydrogen and helium.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:11.330
Nothing.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.550
You can't make anything
with hydrogen and helium.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:15.639
You can make a
hydrogen molecule, duh.

00:18:15.639 --> 00:18:17.430
And then you've got
helium, which is inert.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:18.540
That's really dull.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.540
Would be a dull universe
without stars, don't you think?

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.810
That's the normal
matter, that's the atoms.

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:25.030
And look how many there are.

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:26.950
A one with 80 zeros after it.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:30.480
That's maybe the biggest
true pure number in science,

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.450
because that's an
actual number of atoms.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:35.360
I know, I've counted-- no,
I haven't counted every one.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.490
Nobody has counted
everyone, it's an estimate.

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.400
But it's pretty good.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.820
But it's actually eclipsed
by a factor of a billion

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.730
by the number of
photons in the universe.

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:47.560
There are a billion photons in
the universe for every atom.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.510
That's an interesting fact,
which will be fully explained,

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:52.300
I think, by Mike
Turner next week,

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.660
but I'll allude to where
it may have come from.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:56.820
Something we need to
explain about the universe,

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.464
most of those photons
are unnoticed by us

00:18:59.464 --> 00:19:01.130
because they're dim
microwaves that I'll

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:03.680
talk about in a few minutes.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.280
And those atoms, those 10
to the power of 80 atoms,

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:09.980
are agglomerated into 100,000
billion billion stars--

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.790
10 to the power of 23--
which typically are

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:16.230
parsed 100 billion per galaxy.

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:19.099
And there are a hundred billion
galaxies, round numbers,

00:19:19.099 --> 00:19:20.640
in the visible
universe, the universe

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.170
we can see with our telescopes.

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:26.170
So they're, in a nutshell, is
what the universe is made of.

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:28.890
That's a lot of stars
and a lot of galaxies,

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:32.000
and just to put a little forward
light onto Carolyn Porco,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.840
the last speaker in
this series, she's

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.230
going to talk about the
proclivity of the universe

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.720
for life, and she's going
to talk about the way

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.600
we search for life
in the solar system.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:45.490
Our technology only lets us look
for biology in our backyard.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:46.900
So far.

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:50.200
But what you should realize
is the cosmic number that

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.600
based on the census
of Earth-like planets

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.160
with the Kepler
Telescope and what

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.960
we know from our backyard
in the Milky Way,

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.750
the best guess is that there
are a billion billion Earths

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:01.850
out there.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:02.770
More or less.

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.180
Earth-like.

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.580
That is an incredible number.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.804
And so you have to ask
yourself the question,

00:20:08.804 --> 00:20:10.720
since life started on
the earth almost as soon

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.480
as you can imagine, when
the conditions were really

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.110
inhospitable, do
you imagine that all

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:19.180
of those billion billion
Earths out there are sterile

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.370
and there's no biology
in any of them?

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:23.060
Or put another way,
how many of them

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.440
do you think have spawned
some interesting biological

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.810
experiment, perhaps
even eclipsing

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:30.550
the intelligence and
complexity of life on Earth?

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:32.060
Wouldn't that be
nice to find out?

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:36.400
But that's the cosmic context
for life in the universe.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.780
And these galaxies are real.

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:40.220
We can observe them with
the Hubble deep telescope.

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.840
The galaxies you see panning
across this tiny region of sky

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.600
are all 10 or more million times
fainter than the eye can see.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:52.290
Each of them is within 10, 5
to 10 billion light years away,

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:54.090
so you're looking
at an ancient light.

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:56.760
And as you look at them,
each of these galaxies

00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.660
has roughly 100 million earths.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.790
You can imagine the
possibility that

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:06.770
on some of these galaxies
across the eons of time, someone

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:09.622
or something is
looking back at us.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:24.910
Each fuzzy smudge is a galaxy,
a distant system of stars,

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:26.410
seen with the Hubble
Space Telescope

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.540
in the deepest image ever made.

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:36.910
That's the normal
matter, but in a surprise

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:40.590
to astronomy that's now 30 or
40 years old so astronomers have

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.770
gotten over their
surprise, the universe

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:45.820
is made of six or
seven times more dark

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.770
and mysterious material than
the light and visible stuff

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:49.890
that we're familiar with.

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:51.190
It's called dark matter.

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.300
It's seen here, not
because we can see it,

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.300
but this is a
computer simulation

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.990
where we try and understand
the universe by spooning

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:00.930
dark matter with the appropriate
properties into a computer,

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:03.230
and seeing how it
structures over time.

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:05.570
The dark matter
itself is invisible.

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:07.050
So how do we know it's there?

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:08.220
Good question.

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.270
And was answered
painfully by astronomers

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:12.110
over several decades.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.989
We weigh galaxies by
looking at star motions.

00:22:14.989 --> 00:22:17.280
Now if you looked at the
motions of stars near the sun,

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.000
they're just milling
around randomly

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.440
because the little cube
within 100 light years

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.860
is partaking in a leisurely
quarter billion year orbit

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:26.440
of the center of our galaxy.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.590
But if you map out the motion
of stars across the entire Milky

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:32.150
Way, you see a
pattern of rotation

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:34.190
which should have a
particular character

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:36.440
if the mass of the
Milky Way is where

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.440
you see the light, which
is where the stars are,

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.380
which is what you expect.

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:43.450
What astronomers saw, starting
actually 30 or 40 years ago,

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:45.310
was something quite different.

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:48.240
Again, if the galaxy's
mass was really just

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.910
where its light was,
then by Kepler's law,

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:53.820
you would expect the velocities
of those peripheral stars

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:57.280
to start to decline because
you've seen past the mass.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.600
Just in the same way that
moving out from the sun,

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.980
the velocities of
the planets all

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.090
declined to the outer planets.

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:05.110
What was seen was
not that at all.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:07.040
The velocities
continued high, even

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.220
rising beyond the
distance of the sun

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.540
to the outer edge
of the Milky Way.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.070
Not only in the Milky
Way, but in every spiral

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:15.420
galaxy ever observed.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.700
This is a universal
phenomena as far as we know.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.520
And the only
sensible explanation

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:24.119
for this in terms of gravity
is that the mass of a galaxy,

00:23:24.119 --> 00:23:25.660
if you just look at
its stars, you're

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.340
underestimating by a
factor of six or seven.

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:33.040
And that larger factor
additional is dark matter.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.440
The second way we've
measured it very convincingly

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.480
is by gravity bending light.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.860
If you look at
the distant galaxy

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.630
through a cluster of
galaxies between you

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:44.770
and I-- between it and
us, mass bends light

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:46.560
according to general relativity.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.500
And so the light of
those distant galaxies

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.780
is stretched,
sheared, and amplified

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:52.230
into little arcs of light.

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:53.760
It's a very striking phenomenon.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.430
Can't be explained
any other way.

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:57.930
This gravitational
lensing, as it's

00:23:57.930 --> 00:23:59.690
called, a prediction
of general relativity

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:01.720
and a confirmation of
general relativity,

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:05.560
is a way of weighing a cluster,
and also individual galaxies.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.310
And it confirms what
motions of stars do,

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:13.127
that galaxies are dominated
by invisible matter.

00:24:13.127 --> 00:24:15.210
And the question becomes,
what is the dark matter?

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:17.880
And all I can say at
this point, but we're

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.300
optimistic within a
decade we may know,

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.660
is play a game of elimination.

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.840
First of all, why not question
your theory of gravity?

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.330
And people have done
that, to be fair.

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:30.380
The point is that the
gravity law, and that

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.980
is Newton's law on large
scales and Einstein's law when

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:36.070
gravity is strong, has
passed so many tests that

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:38.220
were unwilling to throw
it away because then you

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.220
throw everything away.

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:43.140
And so the hypothesis has
become that there is a dark form

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:44.980
of material in the universe.

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.200
You can only make the
universe in a computer look

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.190
like the universe we see if
you put dark matter into it.

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:52.915
So far all we've done
is eliminate things.

00:24:52.915 --> 00:24:55.620
Well, black holes are dark,
maybe it could be black holes.

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:57.610
No, because before
you have a black hole,

00:24:57.610 --> 00:25:00.090
you have a supernova, and
that's a pyrotechnic display

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:02.060
that would be easy to find.

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.950
Maybe they're just
dim normal stars?

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:06.180
No, our stellar senses,
with things like the Hubble,

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.340
is just too good.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:10.230
You can't hide stars in
sufficient quantities,

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:12.250
because remember, you
need five or six times

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:14.110
more than normal stars.

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:17.700
What about things that are just
too low in mass to turn on,

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:21.370
to ignite in fusion and so
they don't shine, so their dim?

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:23.530
Dark things like brown
dwarfs, or even planets,

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:24.940
free floating planets.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:25.820
Can't do it.

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.800
Once again,
gravitational lensing

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.510
would find the signature
of those insufficient

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:34.430
if they were in that large
number, and that's ruled out.

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:36.110
And then you can
go all the way down

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:38.270
to mountain-sized
boulders in space,

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:41.080
to things the size of your
fist, to microscopic dust

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.390
grains just littering space.

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:47.610
And indeed those things would
be very faint if no nearby star,

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:50.320
hard to see with a telescope,
but those are actually

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.400
ruled out because
they would still

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.940
be subject to the ambient
radiation of stars,

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.040
and they would radiate
in the infrared.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.519
And infrared satellites have
convincingly ruled this out.

00:26:00.519 --> 00:26:02.060
If you look at what
we've done, we've

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.360
ruled out dark objects all
the way from black holes down

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.690
to microscopic grains of dust.

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:11.030
All that's left is subatomic
fundamental particles,

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:12.470
and that's where the game is.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:15.984
Mike Turner will talk
more about this next week.

00:26:15.984 --> 00:26:17.900
Time for a little more
audience participation.

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.240
This time on the
size of the universe.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.615
You've done the age, so now
it's time to do the size.

00:26:22.615 --> 00:26:23.740
I don't have to explain it.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:25.110
You know the drill.

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:27.579
So if we're-- let's make
a model of the universe,

00:26:27.579 --> 00:26:28.870
just to give you a sense of it.

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:33.600
Centennial Hall is the Milky
Way, 100,000 light years.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.330
Just use your
powers of estimation

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:36.770
to guess how big
the universe is.

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:39.210
And just remember, in
this model, each of you

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:41.900
is standing in for 100
million stars, which

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.230
is pretty impressive.

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:43.900
Yeah.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.390
OK.

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:48.200
So you all know-- you're
all quick with this,

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.800
so we'll just count it down.

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:54.200
Three, two, one.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.020
Whoa.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:56.620
Very good.

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:57.740
And you're right.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:01.210
So the visible universe--
just the visible universe--

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:04.140
would be that enormous size.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:05.650
And that's sort of
like the Earth--

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:08.760
that's 10 times the
radius of the Earth.

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:12.730
So imagine a volume
which is 1000 times

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:14.770
the volume of the Earth,
filled with things

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:16.190
the size of Centennial Hall.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:19.230
And that's the observable
universe, pretty well.

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:19.730
OK.

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:20.480
Good.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:24.590
So I think the message here
is ignominy, to use the word.

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:25.660
Mediocrity.

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:27.200
Whatever.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.230
We're on an average planet
orbiting a midsized star.

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:32.070
Our galaxy is unexceptional.

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:34.440
We're on the periphery
of a kind of mediocre,

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:38.890
not that impressive cluster
in a undistinguished corner

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:42.840
of a ridiculously
large universe.

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.710
And so, you know, this
is part of the punchline.

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:48.080
There's you and
there's the universe.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.480
We're insignificant.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.720
Get over it.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:52.220
Let's go back to the Big Bang.

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:54.080
Enough beating around the bush.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.360
We have expansion.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:00.470
Hubble's first discovery that
external galaxies [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:02.699
distant systems of stars
expanding the known universe

00:28:02.699 --> 00:28:05.240
would have been enough to make
him the most famous astronomer

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:08.215
of the last century, but he
made a second discovery close

00:28:08.215 --> 00:28:09.715
on the heels of his
first discovery,

00:28:09.715 --> 00:28:12.460
and that the cosmic expansion.

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:14.280
Hubble observed the
spectrum of galaxies

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.440
shown in the visible
spectrum just turning light

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.020
into a rainbow, and then
represented graphically

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:23.327
where you track the wavelengths
of the sharp emission

00:28:23.327 --> 00:28:24.910
or absorption features
of the elements

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:26.950
that galaxies and
stars are made of.

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:29.650
And when you do that, you find
that the distant galaxies,

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:32.340
the external galaxies
are always shifted.

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:33.880
Very, very occasionally
to the blue,

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.170
but almost entirely to the
red, to longer wavelengths.

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:39.210
And sometimes, as in this
case, by a significant fraction

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:40.200
of the speed of light.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:43.200
So they're moving
away very fast.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.010
Beyond that, he showed
a linear relationship

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:48.990
between the recession velocity,
the speed of moving away--

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:51.750
and its a large number,
1,000 kilometers per second

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:53.210
there-- and the distance.

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:56.370
MPC is megaparsec, that's
three million light years,

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:58.470
so you're going out to
6 million light years.

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:00.190
It's not a very
good correlation,

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:03.210
but that was his first data
and it established the idea

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:04.700
of an expanding universe.

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:07.300
Since then, we've
expanded Hubble's relation

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:08.725
by factors of 100.

00:29:08.725 --> 00:29:11.380
Hubble's original relation,
that previous graph,

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:14.640
is the little blue dot that
would fit the origin here.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:18.460
With modern telescopes, we
now extend the regime out

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:20.360
to 1 and 1/2
billion light years,

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.930
and the perfect linear
relationship holds.

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:25.730
The expansion, the cosmic,
linear, smooth expanding

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:29.810
universe is valid on huge
scales of the universe.

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:32.310
And it logically
begs the question,

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:35.070
if everything is moving away
from everything else, what

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:36.920
happens if you run
the clock backwards?

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.700
Surely there was a time when
all the galaxies, now further

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.830
apart than ever, were
on top of each other.

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:45.940
And since the universe behaves
in some ways like a gas,

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:49.730
the universe must have been
smaller, hotter, and denser.

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:52.270
You also have your first
check on this idea,

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:54.660
because we know how to
measure the age of the oldest

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:56.731
stars in the galaxy.

00:29:56.731 --> 00:29:58.480
And on the principle
that you should never

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.370
eat anything bigger
than your head,

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:03.600
the universe should not be
younger than the oldest object

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.770
that it contains.

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:07.610
So that's a first check on
this expanding universe idea.

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:10.130
For a while it wasn't clear
how well that check worked,

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:11.380
but now it works.

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.240
The age of the
universe projected

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.650
by running the expansion
backwards in time

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:18.570
is consistent with the
oldest stars we can find.

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:21.160
And the age of the
universe is between 13,

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.880
closer to 14 billion years.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:26.750
And actually now measured
with quite high precision.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:28.050
So what about this expansion?

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:30.050
How can we understand
this expanding universe?

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:32.740
Because it begs a
question, of course,

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.389
is this violating Copernicus?

00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:35.930
If everything is
moving away from us,

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:38.060
maybe we're special after all.

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.630
I was really getting worried.

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:41.290
You know, you're
all thinking you're

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:43.200
going to have to buy
this crap about us

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.430
being sort of insignificant.

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:44.810
No, no.

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:45.480
We're the center.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.000
It's OK.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.080
It's cool.

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.200
Well no, we're not.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:51.680
We're not the center, because
here we are on the red galaxy

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.970
and we look at galaxies--
the blue and the red one,

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:54.770
for example.

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:57.600
The blue and the green-- and we
see them moving away from us.

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.490
And the more distant
one moves away faster,

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:01.060
as Hubble's law said.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.460
But now translate
your point of view

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.080
to the blue galaxy or the
red one, and look around

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:07.480
and you see the same thing.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.850
Every galaxy sees
the same thing.

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:13.540
It's a democracy of viewpoint,
and so no galaxy is the center.

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:16.180
Every galaxy is the center,
no galaxy is the center.

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:19.410
And presumably on this
blue galaxy, not ours,

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:21.340
there is a planet
going around a star

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:25.292
and someone not called Hubble,
who named the law after them.

00:31:25.292 --> 00:31:27.750
And they're going to argue with
Hubble when they eventually

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:30.080
meet in whatever afterlife.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.534
No, that was my law,
I saw that first.

00:31:32.534 --> 00:31:34.200
Well did you account
for a lookback time

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.449
when you say you saw it first?

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:39.830
To describe the
expanding universe,

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:42.880
you have to use general
relativity, which is definitely

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.140
a whole different yarn
than Newton's theory, which

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:47.750
is linear space and time.

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:50.860
General relativity accommodate
the idea of curved spacetime,

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:54.290
in fact, demands it, because
matter curves space--

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:56.730
as we saw in the little
animation-- on small scales,

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:59.777
but on the global scale as well.

00:31:59.777 --> 00:32:01.610
Here's what the Hubble
expansion looks like.

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:03.693
So now we've got the idea
of curved space in play,

00:32:03.693 --> 00:32:05.820
we can use the little model.

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:07.440
There is no sound
on this, is there?

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.534
I better do it.

00:32:09.534 --> 00:32:12.310
[HISSING SOUND]

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:13.640
That's tiring.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.200
So there are creatures
in this curved,

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.510
two dimensional
universe, an analog,

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:21.490
and they will see every other
creature moving away from them.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:23.450
So there's a Hubble expansion.

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:25.940
Now the key distinction
between terrestrial physics,

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:29.340
the physics we're familiar with,
is that the Hubble expansion

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:31.900
is a cosmological
redshift because it's

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:33.620
the lower situation.

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:36.770
Spacetime itself is
expanding and the galaxies

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:39.930
are like witless, hapless
victims just being pulled apart

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:42.020
by the expanding
fabric of space.

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.960
They are not moving
through an external medium,

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.200
as in the upper example.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.710
That's a Doppler shift.

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:51.860
This is one of the fundamental
conceptual changes of the idea

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.350
that Hubble introduced,
and Einstein really

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:55.800
understood physically.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.220
We're dealing with a
situation where the universe

00:32:58.220 --> 00:32:59.940
itself is expanding.

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.850
The galaxies are not
moving like shrapnel

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:04.396
through an external medium.

00:33:04.396 --> 00:33:05.770
There is no external
medium, it's

00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:09.130
space time itself expanding.

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:11.320
And so we have a
universe which may not

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.550
have any boundary in space.

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:15.940
And so to answer the Greek
question, all the way

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.310
through the ages, does
the universe have an edge?

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:19.530
It need not.

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:22.630
It may only have an edge in
time because of its finite age,

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:27.110
and the distance we can see with
finite lightspeed in that age.

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:28.850
We can't talk about
a boundary in space

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:30.721
and we have not seen one.

00:33:30.721 --> 00:33:32.220
The other thing is
that the universe

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.930
has no center, logically.

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:36.940
And it doesn't have to be
expanding into anything.

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:40.570
You just have to wrap
your mind around that.

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:42.460
And then the last
weird component

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.490
of the universe, which
I'll say not much about.

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:46.790
Mike will say more next
week because we really

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:49.250
don't know much about it
at all, is dark energy.

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:52.790
An entity, an agent of
some kind physically

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:55.310
that is causing the
universe to accelerate.

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:57.070
So I'll briefly talk about it.

00:33:57.070 --> 00:34:00.170
It happened because we tried to
trace the expansion rate back

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:02.460
in time with more
distant objects.

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:04.534
When supernova go off
in a distant galaxy,

00:34:04.534 --> 00:34:06.950
these three galaxies are three
to five billion light years

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:07.630
away.

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:10.020
And when a single star dies,
it can rival the brightness

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:12.760
of the galaxy, allowing
us-- because these

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.580
are like standard light bulbs
when they explode-- to measure

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:17.699
the distance to these galaxies.

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:20.239
This allowed us to
take the linear Hubble

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:22.590
law, the smooth
cosmic expansion,

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:25.820
and project it to even
earlier lookback times.

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:28.810
What we predicted, what
cosmology predicted,

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:32.060
since the universe has mass
and mass will slow down

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:35.929
the expansion, we predicted that
as you go further back in time,

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:39.181
you should see either
constant or faster expansion.

00:34:39.181 --> 00:34:40.639
In other words,
the universe should

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:44.690
have decelerated since five or
six or seven billion years ago.

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:46.280
What was observed
with the red data

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:49.030
points was that the universe
was expanding slower

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:52.770
in the past, which implies that
it's accelerated since then.

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:54.477
And that was a
complete surprise.

00:34:54.477 --> 00:34:56.810
Because we know of nothing
that should make the universe

00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:58.160
accelerate.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.430
And so it leads to the idea of
dark energy, which I will just

00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:03.720
introduce and leave
Mike Turner to do

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.120
the heavy lifting next week.

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:06.720
He's a theorist
and that's really

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.205
one of his main subjects.

00:35:08.205 --> 00:35:10.580
And I will say very little
about it for the simple reason

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:12.010
that we don't know what it is.

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:14.860
It's indicated by the
observation I just showed.

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:18.340
It's a repulsive force working
in opposition to gravity.

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:20.670
Its absolute level
of strength is

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:23.220
too weak to be understood
by conventional physics,

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:26.470
the physics of the textbooks
you might have on your shelf.

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:27.960
And that's about it.

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:30.340
It doesn't seem to vary
over time and space,

00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:32.731
but that's not been
measured very well.

00:35:32.731 --> 00:35:34.980
And that's the third major
ingredient of the universe.

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:37.710
So we end up with a universe
where definitely we're

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:39.050
not the major part.

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:41.040
In the pizza of
the universe, we're

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.380
a kind of paltry little
slice that would barely

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:46.260
keep a sparrow alive,
and the dark energy

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:49.530
and the dark matter, the dark
forces that actually govern

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:53.020
the cosmic expansion,
acceleration, and deceleration

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.490
or the overwhelming entities.

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:56.390
So let's look back.

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:58.810
Let's see how close to
the Big Bang we can get.

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:00.360
So here we are on
the right hand edge

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.980
of the diagram in a big, empty,
cold universe looking back

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:06.180
through time, through
the aging of galaxies

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:09.220
towards the dawn of time
and a much smaller, denser,

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:11.170
and hotter universe.

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:13.180
We simulate this in computers.

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:15.820
Now in the computer, the
expansion of the universe

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:18.440
is done in the computer, and
when I show a simulation,

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:20.380
that expansion
will be taken out.

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:23.720
And so you can see that since
this expanding hot gas is

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.550
thinning out,
gravity has to work

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:29.410
against the expanding universe
to congeal stars and galaxies.

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:32.510
In a sense, it's lucky
that it happened at all.

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:34.750
Here's a simulation run
from half a billion years

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:36.380
after the Big Bang
to the present day.

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:39.250
It's a 300 million
lightyear cube.

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:43.130
And you see it goes from an
initially smooth distribution

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:46.240
to galaxies not
randomly distributed,

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.800
but strung along sheets
and voids and filaments

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.740
of large-- beautiful large
scale structure of galaxies,

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:53.800
which is what we see
in the real universe.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.860
The next one is the
same, but rotating so you

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:58.280
get a sense of the three
dimensional structures that

00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.310
form.

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:01.010
And these structures
are sculpted

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:04.960
by the single forest of gravity
acting over 12 billion years.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:11.430
So with our telescopes, here's
how far back we can look.

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:14.020
Our frontier instrument is
still the Hubble Space Telescope

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:16.069
until the James Webb
Space telescope,

00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:18.360
which the University of
Arizona has an interest in both

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.490
of these telescopes.

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:22.470
And you can see that we're
working our way back to a time

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:25.190
that astronomers call the
dark ages, before there

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:26.930
were any stars or galaxies.

00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:29.934
If the universe started hot and
smooth and with no structure,

00:37:29.934 --> 00:37:31.600
there must have been
a time before there

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:35.550
was light of any kind, and
that's called the dark ages.

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:38.790
Here's the deepest image
of the sky ever made again.

00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:42.590
In this area, [INAUDIBLE] the
sky would be the head of a pin,

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:44.200
and there are about
4,000 galaxies

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.590
if you cared to count them all.

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:49.740
And just two weeks ago,
the largest redshift

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:51.430
or most distant
galaxy was observed.

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:55.100
This tiny little smudge
zooming in two steps, which

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:58.630
is seen as it was
13 billion years ago

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:01.140
in a universe that's not
much older than that.

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:03.930
And that's pretty much the limit
of our ground-based optical

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:06.090
telescopes, or space-based.

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:08.280
So we've pretty much
seen to the edge of time,

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.047
to the edge of the
visible universe.

00:38:11.047 --> 00:39:20.162
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:39:20.162 --> 00:39:21.120
Well, that's the story.

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.910
But there's more,
it gets weirder.

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:25.360
Because if you look back
more than about five

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.410
billion light years,
any two objects in space

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:31.737
were moving apart faster
than the speed of light.

00:39:31.737 --> 00:39:33.570
Wait a minute, didn't
Einstein say something

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:35.810
about the speed of light
being an absolute limit?

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:38.090
That's his special
theory of relativity.

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:40.707
You know, he didn't get
exhausted after that,

00:39:40.707 --> 00:39:42.040
though that's exhausting enough.

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:43.530
He went on to the
general theory,

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:45.001
which describes the universe.

00:39:45.001 --> 00:39:46.500
And the general
theory of relativity

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.860
has no speed limit
applied to the universe

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:50.510
and the cosmic expansion.

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:53.250
If you trace the standard
Big Bang model back

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:55.490
for most of the first
half of the universe,

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:57.490
the universe was expanding
faster than light.

00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:00.200
Which means that the light
from those distant galaxies,

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:02.060
as it was emitted,
those galaxies

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:05.004
were moving away from
us faster than light.

00:40:05.004 --> 00:40:06.420
And it's only
because the universe

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.440
decelerated subsequently
that light was

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.890
able to eventually reach us.

00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:14.290
Now a complication on
that is dark energy,

00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:16.640
which is causing the
universe to accelerate.

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.924
And that means,
even more weirdly,

00:40:18.924 --> 00:40:20.340
that some galaxies
that we've been

00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:22.360
able to grasp with
our telescopes

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:25.770
will eventually have their light
taken away from the telescopes

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:27.620
because once more
they'll be ripped

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:30.720
faster than the speed of
light away from our view.

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.600
It's pretty weird.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:36.270
And the implication of
faster than light expansion

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:38.880
of the universe-- and this
is profound and important,

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.540
and it's a standard part of
cosmology, not speculation,

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:43.720
not the lunatic fringe
of the subject--

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:46.255
is that the physical
universe, all that there is,

00:40:46.255 --> 00:40:49.330
is substantially,
maybe vastly larger

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:50.820
than the observable
universe, what

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:54.226
we can see to the limit of the
Hubble telescope or any other.

00:40:54.226 --> 00:40:57.410
In other words, those
100,000 billion billion

00:40:57.410 --> 00:41:01.290
stars in 100 billion galaxies
are not necessarily, and very

00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:03.510
likely, not all there is.

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:06.250
That's just what we can see.

00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:07.509
So let's get back closer.

00:41:07.509 --> 00:41:09.050
Let's get real close
to the Big Bang,

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:10.770
and in fact this is
the best evidence

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:12.330
that the Big Bang happened.

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:13.960
So when that person
sort of collars you

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.760
in Walgreens or in a
supermarket queue and you

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:19.260
happen to mention, they heard
you talking about the Big Bang

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:20.990
and they say, what's
with that Big Bang thing?

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:22.810
I don't believe that,
that sounds crazy.

00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:24.730
You say, no, no, listen.

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:27.250
Let me tell you about
the microwave background.

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:28.730
Because the
microwave background,

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:32.150
now that will convince anyone
that the Big Bang happened.

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:33.700
This is a picture
of the microwave

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:36.540
sky from a satellite,
an exquisite image made

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:38.790
just a year ago, but we've
been trying to gather

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:40.180
this data for decades.

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:42.230
And it's a baby picture
of the universe,

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:46.120
looking far back before the
oldest life in those galaxies.

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.600
So we can do much
better with this image,

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:51.430
much closer to the Big Bang
than with visible telescopes.

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:54.310
In fact, in the analogy,
this is like a picture of you

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:56.120
when you were a few hours old.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.630
That's how early it is in
the history of the universe.

00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:03.210
It's a remarkable picture
from just under 400,000 years

00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:06.210
after the Big Bang, in a 14
billion year old universe.

00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:08.590
So you can think of the ratio.

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:12.340
In that time, the universe has
expanded by a factor of 1,000.

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:15.310
It's got 1,000 times bigger,
and 1,000 times cooler.

00:42:15.310 --> 00:42:18.070
The physics is
actually quite simple.

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:20.840
And the way to understand why
we can get an image like this

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:24.100
is that if you look at a cloud
in the sky, the edge of a cloud

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:26.030
is not a physical
barrier, it's just

00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:28.810
the point in the cloud in which
the density of water vapor

00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:30.630
diminishes to the
point that light

00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:33.620
travels freely and reaches
your eyes, so you see an edge.

00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:37.080
Inside the cloud, there's
still water vapor, but more,

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.720
and the light bounces around.

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.340
So it was in the universe.

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:42.590
Before 400,000 years
after the Big Bang,

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:45.880
the universe was as dense
as the atmosphere of a star,

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:48.270
and light could
not travel freely.

00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:51.220
After 400,000 years, the
radiation travels freely

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:56.430
and we see an image of the
early universe from that era.

00:42:56.430 --> 00:43:00.010
Since that era, those
photons, that light,

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:02.510
have been stretched
by a factor of 1,000.

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:05.500
So not only does the expanding
universe carry galaxies away

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.520
from each other,
the waves of light

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.410
that travel through
expanding space

00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:13.330
are stretched by expanding
space by the same factor.

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:15.850
And so visible
light, dim red light

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:19.350
from the very early universe, is
stretched by a factor of 1,000

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:20.800
into feeble microwaves.

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:23.380
And that's what the
satellite is seeing.

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:25.750
Those microwaves are everywhere.

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:28.090
There's a million or so
in every breath you take.

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:29.740
Right now they feel this room.

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:30.750
They're ambient.

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:33.580
Ambient radiation from the
Big Bang in the universe.

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:37.280
Because they're microwaves,
they're not really noticeable.

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.280
I've occasionally had
people get worried-- maybe

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:42.120
in that same supermarket queue,
someone gets worried about it.

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:42.200
What?

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:43.660
Do you mean there are
microwaves in space?

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:44.530
I might get sterile.

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:47.360
You know, or something
bad might happen.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:49.750
And if you do the calculation,
I'll reassure everyone

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:54.230
and, you know, that the
intrinsic radiation, the radio

00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:57.060
luminosity of the
microwaves around you

00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:59.600
is 10 to the minus 5
watts of radio power.

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.210
So it's like a 10 millionth
of a light bulb worth of radio

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:02.760
energy.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.465
It's not going to
sterilize anyone.

00:44:04.465 --> 00:44:05.965
And it's not really
very noticeable,

00:44:05.965 --> 00:44:08.630
which is why it
was hard to find.

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:12.290
And the Big Bang, because it's
everywhere, is not a place.

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:13.390
There is no place.

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:15.290
It's every place and no place.

00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:17.480
It was a time, not a place.

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:20.219
Very zen like, isn't it?

00:44:20.219 --> 00:44:22.010
And if you really want
to see the Big Bang,

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:24.910
you don't need a fancy radio
telescope, just take your TV

00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:27.282
and tune it between
stations, and 1%

00:44:27.282 --> 00:44:29.240
of the speckles on the
phosphor of your screen,

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.310
if you have an old
style phosphorus screen,

00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:35.430
are interactions of the phosphor
with the microwave background

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:36.300
radiation.

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:39.570
And although your friends
and kids and neighbors

00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:42.800
may think you're pretty weird
staring at a screen doing

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.730
that, I assure you
that that station,

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:47.817
the Big Bang station
is better than the crap

00:44:47.817 --> 00:44:48.900
on all the other channels.

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:56.450
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:58.800
So we can't really get
close to the Big Bang,

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:02.500
but here's a cool thing that
a researcher in Virginia did.

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:05.080
This is the interactions
of matter and radiation

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:07.570
in the first 10 million
years of the universe

00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:11.200
shrunk to 10 seconds and
raised from a deep organ

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:14.240
pitch of a large universe,
infinite large universe,

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:15.140
to audible range.

00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:16.870
So it was boosted by 50 octaves.

00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:19.590
And this is what the Big
Bang actually sounded like.

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:22.184
You didn't think I was going
to show you the Big Bang.

00:45:22.184 --> 00:45:24.619
[WHOOSHING SOUND]

00:45:24.619 --> 00:45:26.687
Actually I'm going to--
If we bring the sound up,

00:45:26.687 --> 00:45:28.270
I'll do that again
because that wasn't

00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:29.912
quite loud enough to hear.

00:45:29.912 --> 00:45:32.270
I'm going to rewind a little.

00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:35.560
[WHOOSHING SOUND]

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:39.546
So that's a sonification of the
actual, physical interactions

00:45:39.546 --> 00:45:41.420
of the first 10 million
years of the universe

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:45.710
shrunk to 10 seconds and
boosted by 50 octaves.

00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:48.130
And so now we can look
at the known universe

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:51.610
all the way out from the roof of
the world to the dawn of time.

00:45:51.610 --> 00:47:13.446
[AMBIENT MUSIC PLAYING]

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.200
So let's go back
as early as we can,

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:09.840
and now I'm moving into the
part where we're not so sure.

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:12.300
The things I've told you so
far are pretty conventional

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:14.760
cosmology, they've been
established actually

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:18.350
in some cases for a few decades
with better and better evidence

00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:19.230
and data.

00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:22.350
And for people who work on the
very early universe theorists,

00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:24.580
not like myself, I use
telescopes, you know,

00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:27.140
actually what happens after
the Big Bang is kind of dull.

00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:29.590
Like they don't really care.

00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:31.390
We're looking back
to the dawn of time

00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:34.640
now, even maybe before the
dark ages, if possible.

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:36.870
An enormous success
of the Big Bang model

00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:39.890
that's not as well publicized
as the microwave background

00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:41.570
is the fact that we
have physics that's

00:49:41.570 --> 00:49:45.010
tested in the first three
minutes after the Big Bang.

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:47.420
So a 13.7 billion
year old universe,

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:50.260
we have solidly
tested astrophysics.

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:52.672
Because the amount of
helium in the universe--

00:49:52.672 --> 00:49:54.880
remember the universe is
mostly hydrogen and helium--

00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:58.560
is too much to have been
produced by normal processes

00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:00.990
in 100,000 billion
billion stars.

00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:02.830
We understand stars very well.

00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:05.810
There is not enough helium
made in all those stars

00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:09.180
to make one quarter of the
mass of the universe's helium.

00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:11.370
However, the entire
universe three minutes

00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:13.389
after the Big Bang
was the temperature

00:50:13.389 --> 00:50:14.430
of the center of the sun.

00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:17.740
And like the sun, it made
helium and other light elements.

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:19.950
It didn't do it for long
because it was expanding.

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:21.620
The sun is stable.

00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:25.170
And in fact not only helium,
but three other light elements

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:28.020
have their abundances
measured in space,

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:31.502
and their abundances of four
different light element species

00:50:31.502 --> 00:50:35.300
match a single parameter, a
single quantity in the Big Bang

00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:38.040
model, which is the
density of order of matter.

00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:42.320
That 4% slice of the cosmic pie.

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:44.720
This is a stunning success
of the Big Bang model

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.680
because otherwise you
have to explain where

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:49.440
these light elements came from,
and there's no other mechanism

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:50.510
to explain them.

00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:53.470
But the Big Bang
brilliantly explains

00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:56.230
something that happened
in the first few minutes.

00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:58.770
That's our largest
lookback time where

00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:02.220
we have a benchmark in
very understood physics.

00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:04.660
However we can trace the
expansion all the way back

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:06.460
on a logarithmic
plot, you can see

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:09.110
going to crazy small
fractions of a second.

00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:10.860
And, you know,
there are theorists

00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:13.330
who are quite happy to
explore the first fractions

00:51:13.330 --> 00:51:15.460
of a second, and
next week you're

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:17.660
going to enter the realm here.

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:19.370
You're going to
enter this realm.

00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:23.170
If you ask, where's our
tether, our last tether

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:26.170
on the world of the real,
on the world of the lab?

00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:27.110
It's here.

00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:29.760
That's the limit of the
Large Hadron Collider, which

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:32.610
for an instant, under very
special circumstances,

00:51:32.610 --> 00:51:35.140
can create this incredible
temperature of tens

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:37.610
of trillions of degrees,
10 trillion degrees, which

00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:41.000
corresponds to the Big
Bang about a nanosecond

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.490
after it happened.

00:51:42.490 --> 00:51:45.450
So lab physics can
corroborate the Big Bang

00:51:45.450 --> 00:51:47.170
all the way back to here.

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:50.790
Beyond here, or before
here, demons lurk.

00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:53.080
And Mike Turner
will tell you all

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:54.780
about those demons next week.

00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:56.770
It'll be fun.

00:51:56.770 --> 00:51:58.050
And I don't do that.

00:51:58.050 --> 00:51:58.890
I'm not a theorist.

00:51:58.890 --> 00:52:00.930
So when I try and think
about the singularity,

00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:04.950
my head just hurts, or it
explodes, or something happens.

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:07.950
So let me just finish with the
frontiers of the subject, which

00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:10.680
is sort of a taster of what
Mike's going to talk about

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:13.470
because he's going to give
full play to dark energy,

00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:15.430
to dark matter, to
inflation-- something

00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:18.930
I'm barely going to mention--
and talk about where

00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:20.206
the limit of our knowledge is.

00:52:20.206 --> 00:52:21.830
Because it's still
an exciting subject,

00:52:21.830 --> 00:52:23.996
it's not like everything
is written in the textbook.

00:52:23.996 --> 00:52:26.180
When you get to the first
fraction of a second,

00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:28.470
you recognize unity
in nature symbolized

00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:31.090
by the ouroboros, an
ancient symbol found

00:52:31.090 --> 00:52:34.390
in almost all human cultures,
the snake that eats its tail.

00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:37.300
And it represents the fact
that over these 45 orders

00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:40.040
of magnitude of
scale, our best placed

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:42.920
to test the fundamental
theories of nature, of particles

00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:45.890
and atoms at the very
high temperatures

00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:47.120
is the Big Bang itself.

00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:49.990
No batter, no other.

00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:53.160
And we can zoom over those
45 orders of magnitude

00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:54.580
from the largest
structures we see

00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:57.010
into the universe to the
quarks at the heart of an atom.

00:52:57.010 --> 00:53:00.388
Here done two seconds
for every power of 10.

00:53:00.388 --> 00:53:06.875
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:53:06.875 --> 00:53:29.330
[WHOOSHING SOUND]

00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:47.840
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:51.100
And it is in fact the case,
if you trace this story back,

00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:54.210
there is the fraction of time
when the universe was smaller

00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:55.370
than an atom.

00:53:55.370 --> 00:53:57.030
And you have to
understand that using

00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:59.910
the same physical theories
we use to understand

00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:01.640
the interior of an atom.

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:03.830
And there are still
mysteries in that world

00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:06.850
because, as you know, there
are four forces of nature.

00:54:06.850 --> 00:54:09.520
As you go back in time
towards the Big Bang,

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:12.140
you simulate conditions of
extraordinary temperature

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:14.870
where these forces
become indistinguishable.

00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:16.600
They merge together.

00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:19.400
And in fact, we are looking
for a unified theory of nature

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:22.890
that deals with the super force
that melts all of these forces

00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:23.670
together.

00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:26.200
At the moment, our
physics is only tested

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:27.830
to the merger of
electromagnetism

00:54:27.830 --> 00:54:30.490
and weak, with hints of what
goes on before because we

00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:32.150
can't do better in the lab.

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:34.410
In the Big Bang,
we have witnessed,

00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:37.716
or we could witness, the
super force in operation.

00:54:37.716 --> 00:54:39.340
And I'll give a taste,
again, of things

00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:41.870
that Mike should talk
about more next week,

00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:44.470
but the reason why there
are a billion photons,

00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:46.530
or several billion
photons for every particle

00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:48.880
is that a tiny imbalance
and the forces of nature

00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:51.240
early on left us
with, say, 10 billion

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:55.000
and 1 particles for every
10 billion anti particles.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.680
And they all annihilated,
leaving a residue of matter.

00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:02.000
So the billion photons we
see cooled into microwaves

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.860
represent the
totality of radiation

00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:06.350
from this matter, anti
matter annihilation.

00:55:06.350 --> 00:55:11.810
And the little residue went on
to become 100 billion galaxies.

00:55:11.810 --> 00:55:13.810
This must have been an
amazing thing to witness.

00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:14.643
Another thing that--

00:55:14.643 --> 00:55:17.100
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:19.090
I'm glad I wasn't
around, actually.

00:55:19.090 --> 00:55:21.310
Another thing that Mike
will talk about next week

00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:22.830
is something called inflation.

00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:25.670
It's a hypothetical
era-- very early,

00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:28.860
look at the crazy small number,
10 to the minus 35 seconds--

00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:31.690
when the universe inflated
from many times smaller

00:55:31.690 --> 00:55:34.494
than a proton to about
the size of a tennis ball.

00:55:34.494 --> 00:55:36.410
That's a nice, familiar
object, a tennis ball.

00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:38.750
We can imagine the
universe as a tennis ball.

00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:41.170
And we use inflation--
it's motivated

00:55:41.170 --> 00:55:44.270
by this merger of
forces as a mechanism--

00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:46.800
but we use inflation to
explain why the universe is

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:49.350
so smooth and flat,
which otherwise is not

00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:50.980
a feature of the
standard Big Bang.

00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:54.390
It's not explained naturally
in the Big Bang model.

00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:56.860
What we're really reaching
for is a theory of everything

00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:58.530
that incorporates gravity.

00:55:58.530 --> 00:56:00.599
Now you know-- this,
you may-- everyone's

00:56:00.599 --> 00:56:02.390
entitled to their own
theory of everything.

00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.890
It's fine.

00:56:02.890 --> 00:56:04.880
There can be 1,000
theories of everything.

00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:07.450
Let 1,000 flowers bloom.

00:56:07.450 --> 00:56:09.750
Now you probably know
that Einstein fruitlessly

00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:12.570
spent the last 15 years
of his career searching

00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:15.450
for a unified theory that
incorporated gravity.

00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:17.470
It's a very hard thing to do.

00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:19.740
The current frontier
theory-- which

00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:22.840
I will just skate over very
briefly, it's beyond my domain

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:24.930
here, and you'll hear
more about it next week--

00:56:24.930 --> 00:56:27.700
is string theory, which
postulates another,

00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:31.210
deeper level of structure
beyond the electrons,

00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:33.140
protons, neutrons,
and quarks that we're

00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:36.180
familiar with in our
standard model of physics.

00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:38.150
So these are
extraordinary ideas that

00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:41.530
postulate tiny, one dimensional
entities vastly smaller

00:56:41.530 --> 00:56:44.810
than a proton, which
compose everything.

00:56:44.810 --> 00:56:46.330
Which compose
everything there is.

00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:49.340
And they're motivated
by extremely beautiful

00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:51.860
but extremely
difficult mathematics.

00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:53.970
These theories of
nature only work

00:56:53.970 --> 00:56:58.100
when there are about 10 or
11 space time dimensions.

00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:00.310
And the mathematics, of
course, is very difficult.

00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:01.600
This has not been observed.

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:04.320
It's extremely
hypothetical theorizing

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.950
that's reaching for
another level of structure.

00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:08.620
If it's relevant
at all, though, it

00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:10.560
must be relevant to
the early universe,

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:14.020
as well as to what
matter is made of.

00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:16.820
And so we actually are
faced with the probability,

00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:20.730
to use the word that's relevant,
that the universe is a quantum

00:57:20.730 --> 00:57:22.850
entity.

00:57:22.850 --> 00:57:26.460
It upset Einstein
very much, you know.

00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:29.660
All that damned quantum jumping.

00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:32.550
It spoiled his
idea of God, which

00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:34.980
I tell you frankly is the only
I get of Einstein's I never

00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:35.690
understood.

00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:38.480
He believed in the
same God as Newton.

00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:40.510
Causality, nothing
without a reason.

00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:44.700
But now one thing led to another
until causality was dead.

00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:50.330
Quantum mechanics made
everything finally random.

00:57:50.330 --> 00:57:52.210
A thing could be
this way or that way.

00:57:52.210 --> 00:57:54.390
The mathematics
deny certainty, they

00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:56.950
reveal only
probability and chance.

00:57:56.950 --> 00:58:01.355
And Einstein couldn't believe
in a God who threw dice.

00:58:05.218 --> 00:58:06.710
He should've come to me.

00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:09.220
I would have told him,
listen, Albert he threw you.

00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:09.720
Look around.

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:10.428
He never stopped.

00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:16.080
Well you've been a good audience
and you've come this far,

00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:19.190
so one last little turn
in the rollercoaster

00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:21.690
that hopefully doesn't
eject you at a high speed

00:58:21.690 --> 00:58:23.170
and a high height.

00:58:23.170 --> 00:58:24.730
I'll talk about the
multiverse, which

00:58:24.730 --> 00:58:28.010
is a frontier idea based
on the idea of the universe

00:58:28.010 --> 00:58:30.960
as a quantum originating event.

00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:34.750
Which logically leads to the
possibility of other quantum

00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:36.210
events.

00:58:36.210 --> 00:58:38.480
In the inflationary idea--
which you will definitely

00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:40.271
hear more about if you
go next week, that's

00:58:40.271 --> 00:58:43.420
Mike Turner's specialty, one
of his specialties-- inflation

00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:45.960
this early epoch of
very rapid expansion

00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:48.680
from micro microscopic
scales to the beginning

00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:52.620
of a macroscopic scale actually
stretched quantum fluctuations

00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:56.250
into ripples that became the
seed for galaxies to form.

00:58:56.250 --> 00:58:58.600
So in that microwave
map of the sky

00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:01.890
with the red, yellow, and blue
colors, those little speckles

00:59:01.890 --> 00:59:03.970
that are about a degree
across in the sky,

00:59:03.970 --> 00:59:06.140
if inflation is
correct, the speckles

00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:09.930
are quantum fluctuations
boosted to the size of galaxies

00:59:09.930 --> 00:59:13.010
that would subsequently evolve
into systems of hundreds

00:59:13.010 --> 00:59:14.330
of billions of stars.

00:59:14.330 --> 00:59:17.700
Quite a wild idea, isn't it?

00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:21.070
And it's the basis for the
idea of parallel universes,

00:59:21.070 --> 00:59:23.990
because if you have a set
of quantum fluctuations

00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:27.100
originating at the origin
of time and space, then

00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:30.790
you have a mechanism where our
inflating bubble of space time

00:59:30.790 --> 00:59:31.960
is not the only one.

00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:33.090
There can be many.

00:59:33.090 --> 00:59:36.280
And because of the random
nature of quantum fluctuations,

00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:38.430
those parallel
universes, if you like,

00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:40.430
will be randomly different
in their properties.

00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:43.320
They won't all be like this one.

00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:46.710
How do we understand these
randomly different universes?

00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:48.312
Well, we reach
for string theory.

00:59:48.312 --> 00:59:50.520
And string theory doesn't
help very much because it's

00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:53.070
too difficult to calculate in,
but the best string theorists

00:59:53.070 --> 00:59:54.920
will tell you is
that there are 10

00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:57.960
to the power 500
different possible vacuum

00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:59.480
states in string theory.

00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:01.980
And so that is the basis
for the multiverse.

01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:04.152
That's plenty of
universes, you know?

01:00:04.152 --> 01:00:05.610
I think E.E. Cummings
said, there's

01:00:05.610 --> 01:00:07.680
a hell of a universe
next door, let's go.

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:10.500
Well, there's a lot of
universes next door,

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:12.430
except we can't
really reach them.

01:00:12.430 --> 01:00:14.800
So quantum fluctuations
and string theory

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:17.440
provide this
context for the idea

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:21.090
that our universe was
not a unique event.

01:00:21.090 --> 01:00:22.550
And how can we test that?

01:00:22.550 --> 01:00:24.130
Of course that's
the current question

01:00:24.130 --> 01:00:25.600
on the plate of cosmologists.

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.670
Is this a testable idea?

01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:29.590
String theory is
difficult enough to test,

01:00:29.590 --> 01:00:31.630
let alone the idea
of a multiverse.

01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:33.894
So I won't pretend that
it has been tested,

01:00:33.894 --> 01:00:35.560
and I won't even
pretend that it can be.

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:38.310
It's a frontier idea
that we hope maybe

01:00:38.310 --> 01:00:40.990
in a decade or so
to be able to test.

01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:43.670
And so in this
inflationary model,

01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:47.030
different space times spawn
with different laws of physics,

01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:49.560
and the idea is that our
universe is quite special

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:52.580
because it was long lived
and it formed stars,

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:54.840
and the stars made
carbon, and the carbon

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:57.030
sat around long enough at
inequitable temperature

01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:59.120
to make biology, and then us.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:02.690
Many of these universes spawning
from different conditions

01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:04.520
would be grossly inhospitable.

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:07.740
Universes that had only
anti-matter, or equal

01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:08.900
anti-matter and matter.

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:11.750
Universes that lasted a
microsecond and are gone again.

01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:14.000
Universes where
there's no causality.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.750
Every imaginable
universe could be there.

01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:20.300
And so our universe is perhaps
one of the few hospitable ones

01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:23.250
to life in the
multiverse concept.

01:01:23.250 --> 01:01:25.660
So the final piece of
audience participation.

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:27.510
I've talked about
the past, and now I

01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:29.050
want to ask about the future.

01:01:29.050 --> 01:01:32.379
So your last question is--
and you get to choose,

01:01:32.379 --> 01:01:34.170
so this is not just
audience participation,

01:01:34.170 --> 01:01:37.880
this is you get to tell me
how I should finish the talk.

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:40.650
So if you could choose
the fate of the universe,

01:01:40.650 --> 01:01:43.530
I'll give you the options
that physics provides.

01:01:43.530 --> 01:01:45.630
The universe could
end as a heat death,

01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:48.390
so everything crunches
down matter is obliterated,

01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:50.130
not very good news for us.

01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:52.162
We won't be here, but
somebody will be here.

01:01:52.162 --> 01:01:54.370
There's dissipation and
decay where it sort of coasts

01:01:54.370 --> 01:01:58.020
to a halt and entropy takes
over, and matter falls apart,

01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:00.600
and you end up with a sea of
low energy photons, neutrinos,

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.780
and anti neutrinos.

01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:03.880
That doesn't sound very good.

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:06.380
There's cold death, which is
the big rip where everything

01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:08.970
dissipates and is
stretched out in a kind

01:02:08.970 --> 01:02:11.810
of dissipative cold expansion.

01:02:11.810 --> 01:02:14.260
And then, of course, there's
the possibility-- you know,

01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:16.700
there is a possibility
that it doesn't end

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:18.120
and it would go on forever.

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:20.940
And so you can tell
me what you prefer.

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:22.390
One, two, three.

01:02:25.872 --> 01:02:29.660
Keep them up there so-- oh.

01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:33.200
You want it to go on forever.

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:35.490
That's very selfish of you.

01:02:35.490 --> 01:02:37.327
I mean, I don't
like to be a downer,

01:02:37.327 --> 01:02:38.660
but you're all going to be dead.

01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:40.870
It doesn't really matter.

01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:43.030
But, but, I don't
want to be a downer.

01:02:43.030 --> 01:02:45.030
I'm not going to finish
by being a downer.

01:02:45.030 --> 01:02:49.700
So here I'll just summarize
the kind of nasty scenarios,

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:52.360
and because you want the
universe to go on forever.

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:53.230
OK, fine.

01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:55.120
Have it your way.

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:58.200
I will tell you the scenario
that cosmologists have come up

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:01.160
based on these multi-dimensional
theories of space time,

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:03.210
so cutting edge, leading edge.

01:03:03.210 --> 01:03:06.140
It may not be right, but it's
very comforting, of course.

01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:09.010
And these theories not only
have an eternal universe,

01:03:09.010 --> 01:03:11.630
but they posit that
the Big Bang was not

01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:13.620
the origination of everything.

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:16.690
That the Big Bang was an event
in a series of events taking

01:03:16.690 --> 01:03:18.400
place in higher dimensions.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.780
So they finesse not only
the issue of ending,

01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:22.770
but the issue of
beginning itself.

01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:24.380
It's an eternal universe.

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:26.380
And it works a
little bit like this.

01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:28.610
You have to imagine
higher dimension-- they're

01:03:28.610 --> 01:03:31.740
reduced into dimensions I can
show on a graph-- you imagine

01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:33.970
higher dimensional
membranes, or branes,

01:03:33.970 --> 01:03:37.290
as they're called in the jargon,
so these are higher dimensional

01:03:37.290 --> 01:03:39.860
spaces, maybe five
six seven dimensions

01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:42.310
within which are three
dimensions of space

01:03:42.310 --> 01:03:44.320
and one of time are embedded.

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.210
And our universe, our
expanding universe

01:03:46.210 --> 01:03:49.853
is spawned by the collision
between two higher dimension

01:03:49.853 --> 01:03:51.090
branes.

01:03:51.090 --> 01:03:52.950
So the energy of
that collision is

01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:56.780
what generates the motive
force for the Big Bang.

01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:59.960
Subsequently, forces operating
in those higher dimensions

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.860
pull the branes back together.

01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:04.180
The universe
expands, dissipates,

01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:05.690
but then the whole
cycle repeats.

01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:07.273
And the time scale
and in the theory's

01:04:07.273 --> 01:04:08.690
about a trillion years.

01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:11.230
So you have an eternal
universe spawning three

01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:13.240
dimensional expanding
universes filled

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:16.940
with matter and radiation
caused by episodes that

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:19.920
occur in higher dimensions,
and collisions of branes,

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:21.650
or even higher
dimension things that

01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:23.160
are impossible to visualize.

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:26.730
All of this, all of this around
us, the 100 billion galaxies,

01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:29.190
the diversity of
structure of the stars,

01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:31.420
the planets, the people
that we haven't yet met,

01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:33.460
all of this from
an iota space time.

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:35.020
It's kind of amazing.

01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:37.830
And not to pretend that there
aren't some really profound

01:04:37.830 --> 01:04:40.380
mysteries, and you'll hear
more about those next week,

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:43.040
but I think every now
and then you step out

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:46.400
of your world and your life and
the things you read every day,

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:50.180
and you feel good because
this cosmology, this idea,

01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:52.830
these ideas that are tested in
part of the edifice of science,

01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:55.720
part of what we know about
nature, and in a sense

01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:58.320
about ourselves because
we're part of this story,

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:01.960
is one of our greatest triumphs.

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:04.000
And that is the end.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.300
