[Crescendo into a triumphant tune]

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.540
[Triumphant music]

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.540

[Triumphant music]

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.060
You ready?

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.260
Yeah.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.620
Let's do this.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.240
[Elevator music]

[Inception "Boom"]

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.640
Oh hey guys.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.540
What's up?

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.900
[Knuckles crunching]

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:27.120
[Intro theme]

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.080
So what do you think of our prequel to DC Avengers part one?

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.180
We accomplished what Marvel did in several movies with just one movie with the exact same results.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.660
I'd rather we saw a good Batman Superman movie.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.940
What? I thought you liked it.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.440
NO!!!

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.180
Kinda...

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.460
Well then you didn't like it?

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.960
No...

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.520
KINDA!!!!

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.760
Well then what's the problem?

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.880
People have been waiting years to see this team up.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.120
Yeah and the choices that you made were just so... so...

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.140
DC!

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.300
Critic: This is arguably the most anticipated comic book movie of all time,

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.420
in that people have been waiting to see it even before it was announced.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.380
There have been several comics where Batman and Superman are together, as well as cartoons

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.280
but despite there being tons of Batman and Superman movies there had never been one with them together.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.120
However, with the Marvel crossovers proving to be exceptionally successful

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.020
DC felt it was time to throw their hat into the ring and use this as a means to start their own DC cinematic universe.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.900
Despite a very strong opening, it's box office dropped a shocking 68% the following weekend.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.480
How bad is that? Batman and Robin's second weekend had a 63% drop.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.340
Wow... that means more people went back to see that film rather than Batman versus Superman.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.320
What the hell have you done Zach?

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.840
Alright, well why don't just you start from the beginning of the film?

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.860
Alright.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.680
Wait wait you're just playing a few minutes from Batman Begins.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.620
EXACTLY!!

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.700
Critic: After showing a flashback we've seen done so much I'm surprised there's not action figures of it

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.500
we cut to yet another flashback of Bruce driving through Metropolis when it was being destroyed by Zod.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.660
Vague business associate, you have to get out of Metropolis.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.640
Why?

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.900
Oh, wow good thing you called me I never would have looked out the window to notice that.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.680
[Explosion]

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.260
I will avenge you man the audience barely knows.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.800
As well as all the lives we're only now acknowledging might be Superman's fault!

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:38.940
Joe: Flash forward a year later as thank God Lois figures out Clark Kent is Superman and they discuss their future together.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:46.320
Clark, I'm concerned people were shot to death in the desert and they're blaming you for some... reason. Hey Zach what's that about?

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.640
Yeah, what's that about?

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.440
Well if you can't see how they would mistake Superman shooting people to death..

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.060
Yeah who do they think he is, Batman?

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.180
I don't think I should have to explain the obvious. Besides, this leads to a very deep conversation.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.120
I just don't know if the world is ready to accept you. Or if what you're doing is right. Or if it is right if it's just going to make things worse.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:04.960
You're standing in the bathtub.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.000
I'm standing in the bathtub.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.300
I feel like we were discussing some very important issues here.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.820
But I'm standing in the bathtub.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.180
Eh, good point.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.600
Critic: But it looks like one of the people intimidated by Supes is Lex Luther, played remarkably without an apology by Jesse Eisenberg.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.420
Hey mister senator man look what I got!

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.280
A shiny green rock that can weaken Kryptonians! I'll let you have it if you give me access to Zod's ship.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.580
You seem completely unbalanced, why would I give you access to any of that?

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.380
Because I've got Jolly Ranchers.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:31.680
Sold!

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.020
Cherry!

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.900
Cherry.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.900
By the way Wonder Woman is in this movie.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.860
Hello.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.520
Okay so what's the problem? Come on.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.840
First Jesse Eisenberg.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:59.420
Second if Superman took down military satellites trying to track him, why the hell didn't he take Zod's ship a weapon from Krypton away from them?

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.180
Third Jesse Eisenberg.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.080
Fourth there's no reason for Luther to hate Superman here.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.180
In the comics and movies Superman foils his evil plans constantly so it makes sense to try to kill him.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:19.100
But in this movie if anything Lex Luther benefits from Superman as he said he has contracts to rebuild everything that was destroyed.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.120
His motivations are completely backward!

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.600
Well like everyone else he's afraid of Superman's massive power and ability to destroy.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.720
He makes Doomsday later!

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.620
That's like five Supermans with a fist for a brain!

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.600
And what was that other thing?

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.440
Oh yeah.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.240
JESSE EISENBERG!!

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.320
Critic: Whether you want to call him Lex Luther Jr. or whatever this is a beyond awkward performance.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.100
Joe: Even at his corniest, Lex is a powerful charming diabolical mastermind.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:56.320
He always had a cool attitude, a business type mindset and a suave calculating demeanor.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.620
Critic: This guy is more like Roger Rabbit if he was a super villain.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.040
But at least he introduces Clark Kent to Bruce Wayne. That will really get them hating each other.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.180
Yeah, but why?

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:13.620
We have a vague understanding of why Batman hates Superman but there is really no reason Superman should hate Batman.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.280
So nice to meet you Bruce Wayne.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.340
The pleasure is all mine Clark Kent.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.880
I hear Batman is trampling on civil liberties, making people live in fear thinking he's above the law.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:30.400
[Music]

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.780
I hear Superman is powerfully dangerous putting tons of people in harm's way.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.580
If there's even a one percent chance that he's unstable he must be destroyed.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:45.460
[Music]

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.540
By the way Wonder Woman is in this movie.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.320
Hello.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.880
Howdy boys! God I love bringing people together this reminds of the time.. [continues talking in background]

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.760
Who's the pipsqueak?

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:55.780
That's Lex Luther.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:56.940
No!

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:57.940
Afraid so.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.100
Does he ever shut up?

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.220
I don't know, let's ask him.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:01.720
[Punches]

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.420
Well I guess I had that coming. See ya later boys!

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.120
Smooookin'!

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.780
This is like a bad dream man.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.580
No, that's my department.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:15.320
What?

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.580
Yeah, I want most people to look at me and say he was such a good Batman he could do most of it in his sleep.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.560
So I do most of it in my sleep. In fact this is a dream sequence right now.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.420
No kidding.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.180
Yeah.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.320
[Eerie music]

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.420
Subplot

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.300
Future characters

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.540
Things you don't understand yet so it must be clever

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:32.900
Hello.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.100
[Gasps]

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.660
Master Wayne, what is it?

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:37.500
[Sigh]

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.380
I just don't know commissioner Alfred.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.680
I just feel like the motivations of the next film are being figured out before the motivations of this film.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.220
That's still not going to get me grandchildren any time soon.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.880
[Sigh] Not this again.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.160
Yes this again!

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:58.240
Joe: It gets even weirder when Batman is chasing down some guys who have the kryptonite and Superman stops him right in his tracks for pretty much no reason.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.740
Well, bye only weakness that can kill you.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:01.600
I hate you.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.220
Why?

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.620
Because you're a vigilante.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.160
You're a vigilante, I hate you because you're responsible for a ton of deaths.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.020
You're responsible for a ton of death!

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.420
That's ridiculous! I value human life much more than you ever will.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:18.200
Just stop hypocriting where I'm hypocriting. Go back to Gotham, it's literally across the street.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.640
Tell me something.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.140
[Ominous music]

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.920
Do you bleed?

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.420
Whoa whoa whoa. We're cool, we're cool.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.820
Yeah, that's what I thought.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:36.260
Listen detective, if I'm so bloodthirsty as you say I am why haven't I killed you already?

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.360
Because I intimidate you?

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:41.740
Boo.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.140
You never answered me. Do you bleed?

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.460
You will.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:52.800
What did you say?

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:53.980
Nothing, nothing.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.600
[Crash]

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.540
Oh, real mature.

[Music]

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.720
Okay so you guys don't think Batman and Superman have enough reasons to hate each other.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.840
But hey you got to give me credit, Lex Luther his plan is pretty amazing.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.140
How?

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:32.620
Zach: By inviting Superman to the capital building and then blowing it up causing people to hate him more.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.500
But even in the movie they know he didn't do it.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:39.800
And why would Superman use a bomb? He doesn't need one!

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.540
But it's okay because he scares Superman into exile.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.260
Was that Lex's plan?

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.260
I don't know.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.120
[Scoffs]

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.920
I mean yes, yes that's exactly what he wanted.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.220
Why does he make another Kyrptonian then?

00:09:51.700 --> 00:10:02.400
Joe: He tricks the incredibly advanced Kyrptonian technology using fake fingerprints and forces it to genetically combine his DNA with that of Zod.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.980
Computer: You know genetic mutation is forbidden by Kyrptonians.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.100
But they're all dead so it really doesn't matter.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.880
Computer: Even though your fingerprints convinced me otherwise, I'll roll with it.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.540
Point. Don't you wish this is how all advanced technology worked?

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.000
Computer: This phone is password protected.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.900
Yeah, but the guy who owned it died.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.340
Computer: Oh, okay here's all his info.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.540
Critic: Jackpot!

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.760
Oh hey, whose phone is that?

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.540
Oh it's yours.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.540
What? Hey, give me that!

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.940
Critic: Oh! Look at all the spartan porn!

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.500
I don't need this I'm friends with Christopher Nolan.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.480
Critic: So while in exile, Clark comes across his dead father building a snow fort.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.080
This is either because

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.240
A) He's a ghost

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.100
B) Clark's hallucinating

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.600
C) More inconsistent Kryptonian technology

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.560
or D) If this is really your biggest question through all of this you're on Quaaludes.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:48.880
Nut up.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.540
Okay!

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:52.840
Joe: Meanwhile Luther's men sneak up on Lois and kidnap her.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:56.920
Oh, don't worry this happens ALL the time. I brought my own chloroform.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.120

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.020
Critic: And she wakes up on top of Lex's building.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.160
Hello my dear.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.440
Aha, I knew it!

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:10.580
Through my journalistic skills I figured out it was you thus completing my incredibly essential role to this film.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.560
Oh, you figured out that Lex Luther was the bad guy huh?

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.720
Real brain scratcher there. Nobody else would have figured that one out.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:22.700
You really solidified yourself as a necessity there. You know what I was doing while you were figuring out that incredible info?

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.360
I figured out who Superman was. I figured out who Batman was.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.060
And I planned two kidnappings to take place on the night that he was planning to finish him off.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.480
See, see? There you go.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.200
And you know what the best part is?

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.020
I did all of that off screen so even I don't know how I did all this impossible shit!

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.180
Um...

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.320
Phew! Is it chilly up here or is that just the cold uselessness of your character?

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.500
Hey! I'm really important.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.280
Oh, yeah sure. Let's get to the one thing that we know you're good at.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.320
[Yells]

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.560
Lois: Thank you, I really am important!

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.920
It's over Luther.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:58.940
Your mama says blah.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:11:59.620
Says blah?

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.660
No, but she will when I slit her throat.

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.220
MAMA!

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.120
Now go kill Batman because I think it would be cool.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:06.780
Okay.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.440
This is it, we barely have a reason to hate each other except we hate the fact that the other one kills.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.280
I'll kill you for that!

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:21.420
[Yelling]

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:22.300
Eh?

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:23.400
Ehh?

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.760
Pretty high drama huh?

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.740
Isn't this it? Isn't this what you've always wanted to see?

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.160
Yeah, it's what we've always wanted to see..

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.640
But not why we wanted to see it.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:41.560
Critic: We want to see Batman and Superman fight because they have different ideologies that we enjoy.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.540
One is dark and aggressive, the other is kind and hopeful.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:51.080
Seeing two points of view that are different but we identify with go head and head is deep and conflicting drama.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:57.360
Joe: But Superman is fighting to save his mom and Batman is fighting because he pretty much does what he does.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:04.040
It's not an epic fight if the motivations are weak. It is the literal definition of forced.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:08.040
Yeah, but isn't it so cool the way Batman swings him around like a yo-yo?

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.680
Yeah...

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.280
And isn't it cool the way Superman punches him across the building?

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:14.600
Yeah...

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:21.640
And wasn't it cool when Batman sprayed him with kryptonite gas so just minutes later he could stab him with a kryptonite spear?

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:25.300
Wait a minute. Why didn't he just stab him with the spear first?

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:26.500
Huh?

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:32.160
Yeah, this is a battle of brains as well as brawn. Why didn't Batman just stab him as his first move?

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.120
I... um...

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.640
Well.. Look Aquaman is in the movie!

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.520
Hello.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.080
Answer the question!

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.420
Okay we did it so people could see more of them fighting. I'm cool!

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:48.200
And there's your problem. They see them fighting but they don't experience them fighting.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.320
Anyone can just watch two people fight.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:56.040
Hell, you can just take two strangers put them in Batman and Superman costumes and have them do cool stuff.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:02.000
Joe: But if you're constantly questioning why throughout the whole thing you're not experiencing it.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.620
You're constantly being distracted by elements that don't add up.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.660
But perhaps you didn't hear me.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.860
Aquaman is in the movie!

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:10.840
Hello.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:11.980
[Both sigh]

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.340
Cyborg?

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.480
No Zach, no.

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.600
Critic: Batman has the upper hand until an amazing discovery is made.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.780
Martha...

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.240
What? What did you say?

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:29.600
I.. need to save.. Martha!

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.860
Oh my God.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.040
My mother is still alive.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.760
No you idiot! Your mothers have the same name.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.560
This instantly erases all hatred.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.580
From now on you and I will be best friends.

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.800
I'll throw this over here then.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.480
[Splash]

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.200
Haha! I've created the ultimate Kryptonian devil!

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.820
I'll just go and grab that then.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.100
[Splash]

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.460
Lois: Oh, Clark! I'm drowning in the water!

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.740
[Sigh] What is this like the fourth time?

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:04.060
I'll save you Lois. And I'll grab the spear which is the only thing that weakens me.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.140
Lois: I'm important!

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.340
Superman: Yeah, you used to be.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.600
And I'm Batman.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.940
Haha! I've done it I've created the ultimate Kryptonian devil!

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:12.840
Candy?

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.300
Oh, oh my face!

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.240
Why did you smear it all over my face?

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:21.040
What's going on here Lex?  I thought you hated Kyrptonians, now you've made another one?

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.900
Your plan makes no sense.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:28.740
You don't get it, my plan is chaos. God versus god, anarchy.

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.020
The bell has been rung. Ding ding ding ding ding!

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.260
Let's put a smile on that face!

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.840
Lex... Luther?

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.120
Uh-huh.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:41.100
You're portraying Lex Luther right now?

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.260
That's nothing, wait until you see how well we understand Doomsday.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.380
Doomsday?

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:49.200
Yes, we wrote him so he's a combo of Lex and Zod's DNA creating...

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:54.080
Rawr. Rawr. I am your Doomsday.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.020
I will fight him!

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.480
But that's not what Doomsday looks like.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.300
Oh, what did you expect?

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:08.820
A monster evolved from cloning thousands of alien babies dying and being reborn until it created the ultimate killing machine?

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:09.960
Like in the comic?

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.680
Yeah!

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:15.400
Well, why would that look anything like Zod and Luther's goddamn DNA!?

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:20.640
Critic: A combination of Zod and Luther should look exactly like that, Zod and Luther.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:25.440
Where did this double size double muscle brain dead dick missing creature come from?

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:32.940
In fact wait a minute, Lex Luther combining his DNA with Kryptonian DNA to create an uncontrollable monster?

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.940
That's Nuclear Man!

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:43.120
Oh my God! Zach Snyder is getting inspiration from Superman IV, the worst Superman movie ever!

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.060
But... But...

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.140
We got Doomsday in the movie!!

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:51.580
Dude this isn't a contest for how much shit you can jam in this movie.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.860
We loved these characters because they were given time to develop.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:17:00.040
Just because you give them the same name doesn't automatically make them the same character.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.240
But what if we had the Flash?

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.320
Shut.. the hell..

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.540
UP!

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:10.220
Okay.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.940
Joe: So after Wonder Woman finally joins the team...

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:14.560
Hello.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.900
Oh, I can stay this time? Awesome.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.220
Joe: Batman has a great idea!

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:24.600
We need to lure him into the city towards the kryptonite where all this innocent people are.

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.760
Wouldn't it be easier to bring the easily transportable kryptonite here?

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:32.340
[Sigh] Don't you watch these movies? We don't save people from destruction we bring it to them.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.780
Joe: Then Superman has a great idea.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.080
I'm going to sacrifice myself to save us all.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:37.900
Are you sure?

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:44.240
Yes, even though there is probably a thousand other ways we can be doing this right now but no, I'm going to sacrifice myself.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:48.340
No, I meant are you sure you're going to kill him? Because wasn't killing Zod a big deal in the first one?

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.960
Yeah, but I got over it.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.200
You seem to do that a lot.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.220
[Yells]

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.640
I will fight him!

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:59.340
Joe: Superman rushes towards Doomsday with the kryptonite spear and...

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:00.620
He dies.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:06.040
Superman dies in the second movie?

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.600
Well, don't forget there's even more than that.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:13.320
Zach: We use even more Jesus symbolism, don't worry we'll get through all the stations of the cross.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.920
Luther is sent to jail.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.920
See, I have a bald head now. I'm totally Lex Luther.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.920
Why so serious?

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:27.140
Zach: And just when you think he's really gone for good a few specks of dirt rise from his coffin.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:32.980
Hinting that maybe, just maybe he'll come back.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:40.980
Thus we have combined the most famous Batman and Superman stories into one emotional package.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:47.720
Giving you exactly what you've always wanted to see.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:49.820
Come on.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:10.560
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.220
You know what I want to see?

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:12.720
No.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:16.380
I want to see the Justice League at his funeral, but now I can't.

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:25.160
I want to see a hero slowly stripped of his life in the ultimate battle instead of just being stabbed in one swoop, but now I can't.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:34.860
I want to build a connection with this Superman the same way he built a connection with me in hundreds of stories, but now I can't.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:42.300
I want to fear that this might be the time that Superman doesn't make it back, but now I can't.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.980
How many comics were there before Superman died?

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:45.540
I don't know.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:49.200
Hundreds, thousands! And how many movies did you make with him?

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:49.740
Two.

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:54.260
Two! You killed him in two movies and you barely even focused on him!

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:58.060
You know what I want to see? I want to see you EARN Superman's death!

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.920
This isn't fucking Jimmy Olsen. This is goddamn Superman!

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:05.180
He deserves your time and respect!

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.320
Ditto.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:24.280
Critic: This movie is trying to be Marvel, the Dark Knight, Wonder Woman, Justice League, the Death of Superman and Batman versus Superman

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.860
when Batman versus Superman would have been more than enough.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:35.600
The reason we love so many of the stories that you were trying to fit into this is because each one was its own individual story.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:41.980
The Death of Superman wasn't also a prequel to Suicide Squad or the retelling of Dark Knight Returns.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.580
It focused on one story and allowed us to get invested.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:49.400
Sure you have to compromise a story when it comes to making a movie,

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:58.740
but when you lose the heart and soul of what made that story so special is it worth just squeezing in instead of devoting the time it deserves?

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.780
So uh... That's what you really think huh?

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:07.000
Well, I'm sorry that my movie didn't please you in the least.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.620
Oh, no. A lot of it was pretty awesome.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.420
What!?

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:16.820
Joe: As much as so many of those scenes suck there's a lot of scenes that are friggin' amazing.

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:22.900
The action, the visuals, Affleck as Batman, Irons as Alfred.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:27.660
When it did certain parts of the comic right it was a pretty kick ass film.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.740
So wait, did you like it or not?

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:33.960
I uh, I mean uh...

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:36.120
It's not good.

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:37.760
I am glad that I saw it.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:45.280
Critic: If you're just looking for Batman and Superman to fight each other you'll get it, it's just not in a story that makes any sense.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:49.780
Joe: It's got a lot of cool scenes that are hard to say not to go check it out.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:53.600
So in a strange way I'm still recommending it.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:59.620
I suppose that's all over the map, but then again your movie is all over the map so I guess it comes full circle.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.840
If those are your thoughts then why did you come all the way out here then?

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:09.220
Well uh, we were thinking that maybe we could write the next one.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.520
That is a very violent man.

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.240
Mhmmm.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:44.660

Critic: And I'm Batman.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.200
Hey, Doug Walker here doing the charity shout out.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:02.060
And this is one of the few where I am actually not going to show video from their YouTube channel even though there is video from it.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:11.080
In fact, the imagery is so graphic and so uncomfortable that I was debating even whether or not to do this charity

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:16.900
but for that exact reason that's why it really needs to be done it's called KillTheJigger.org.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:24.480
And a jigger is a sand flea, the smallest type of flea there is, in tropical and third world countries

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:32.340
where they can burrow in through your foot and they can just pretty much eat you from the inside out.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:40.040
And if you are brave enough to go and see some of these videos and everything it's, it's tough.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:50.320
It's really rough um, but that is all the more reason why these people need to exist and they need to go and kill these things.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:57.560
I mean these things survive by pretty much burrowing into people's feet and just like I said, just destroying them.

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:02.900
A lot of them have to have their feet amputated or if they don't get to it quick enough it can spread to other parts.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:10.640
And it's, it's really horrific and this is an organization that goes in and gets rid of these things.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:14.680
And they are trying to build a clinic uh, specifically for this.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:21.720
Because the type of stuff that these things do and how many of them there are uh, it's just astounding.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:28.900
I've never even heard of this thing before, but this is going on and if you want to just donate

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:37.740
if you go their site KillTheJigger.org uh, you can just go donate trust me you will be sending it to a good cause.

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:41.260
If you want to look at the videos or the imagery you can.

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:51.040
Uh, but if you don't want to I would almost advise not to but yeah if you don't want to you can just go to their website and you can donate.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:59.060
and trust me you would definitely be sending it to a good, good cause these are people that really don't deserve to go through this kind of stuff.

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:05.760
So definitely go check it out show your support and donate to something really great. Take care.
