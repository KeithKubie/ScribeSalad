00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.940
In a single minute your body produces 120 to 180 million red blood cells,

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.800
people ask Google 2.4 million questions,

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.880
and 25 million Coca-Cola products are consumed.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.440
Many of those bottles will end up in a landfill,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.200
where the World Bank estimates we produce 5 million pounds of garbage.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.020
108 human lives will be lost in this minute and an adult male will lose 96 million cells.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.700
Fortunately, 96 million cells divide, replacing those lost.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.660
Speaking of divisions, in the USA, 1.5 people will get divorced, while world-wide, 116 people will get married,

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.160
83,300 people have sex, but only 258 babies will be born

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.500
and a fetus is developing neurons at a rate of 250,000 per minute,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.480
so it's no wonder that a computer simulation takes 60 quadrillion bytes to simulate a minute.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.300
An average of 1.38 micrometers of rain fall around the world, which is 4.7 billion bathtubs of water every minute

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.120
and with the storms comes approximately 6,000 bolts of cloud-to-ground lightning hitting the Earth.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.720
A 150 pound person expends 1.1 calories of energy per minute while sleeping,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.780
while the sun provides us with 83.33 terrawatts of energy.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.660
The earth will 1800 kilometers of its 940 million around the sun, moving 1,034 times faster than a cheetah,

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.280
70,000 hours of Netfilx are watched, 300 hours are uploaded to YouTube,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.760
