now we've made progress on those by the

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830
now we've made progress on those by the
 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.580
now we've made progress on those by the

environments made huge progress but

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270
environments made huge progress but
 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.090
environments made huge progress but
we've not made anywhere near as much

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100
we've not made anywhere near as much
 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.340
we've not made anywhere near as much

there's there'll be an abundance of
 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.319
there's there'll be an abundance of
human labor available and so the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329
human labor available and so the
 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.200
human labor available and so the
combination of the costs not so much

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.670
progress and the availability of human
labor will probably mean that we'll see

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680
labor will probably mean that we'll see
 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.820

less automation happen there because

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830
less automation happen there because
 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.950
less automation happen there because
there's always going to be an

mostly thinking work the algorithm that

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850
mostly thinking work the algorithm that
 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.810
mostly thinking work the algorithm that
does the medical diagnosis or pattern

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820

recognition or image recognition is

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740
recognition or image recognition is
 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.679
recognition or image recognition is
essentially an algorithm there's no

so the economists that are very very low

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470
so the economists that are very very low
 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.530
so the economists that are very very low
and by the way we've made more progress

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540
and by the way we've made more progress
 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.719
and by the way we've made more progress
there in the last five years and we've

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729
there in the last five years and we've
 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.670
there in the last five years and we've
made in the last 50 with machine

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680
made in the last 50 with machine
 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.319

learning and deep learning and by the
 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.120
learning and deep learning and by the
way that's where the labor and the

way that's where the labor and the
 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.100
way that's where the labor and the
skills are in short supply so when you

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110
skills are in short supply so when you
 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.760
skills are in short supply so when you
put the technology and the labor

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770
put the technology and the labor
 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.830
put the technology and the labor
economics that go with it which is a

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840
economics that go with it which is a
 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.840
economics that go with it which is a
shortage you'll likely to see more of it

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850
shortage you'll likely to see more of it
 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.550

2008 2000 ages because that was the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420
2008 2000 ages because that was the
 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.700
2008 2000 ages because that was the
start of the recession in that period

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710
start of the recession in that period
 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.139

much of the conversation we had about

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149
much of the conversation we had about
 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.179
much of the conversation we had about
you know the five point eight million

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189
you know the five point eight million
 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.120

jobs we lost in in manufacturing was
 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.479
jobs we lost in in manufacturing was
always a conversation about offshoring

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489
always a conversation about offshoring
 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:11.029
always a conversation about offshoring
now when we look back and various

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039
now when we look back and various
 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.770

economies like the United States where
 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.899
economies like the United States where
something like you know 60% of our GDP

something like you know 60% of our GDP
 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.599
something like you know 60% of our GDP
growth comes from household and you know

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609
growth comes from household and you know
 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.030
growth comes from household and you know
and consumer consumption and spending

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040
and consumer consumption and spending
 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.800
and consumer consumption and spending
it's going to be important for people to

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810
it's going to be important for people to
 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.099
it's going to be important for people to
be able to consume and spend to drive

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109
be able to consume and spend to drive
 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.740
be able to consume and spend to drive
GDP so people aren't earning anything

GDP so people aren't earning anything
 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.970
GDP so people aren't earning anything
because they're not working whatever the

because they're not working whatever the
 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.159
because they're not working whatever the
case may be what happens to that so I

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:50.169
case may be what happens to that so I
 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:51.839
case may be what happens to that so I
think this question of automation is

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849
think this question of automation is
 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.089
think this question of automation is
actually a bigger deal I think we got

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099
actually a bigger deal I think we got
 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.319
actually a bigger deal I think we got
distracted a little bit of the

distracted a little bit of the
 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:56.909
distracted a little bit of the
offshoring question of course that's

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:56.919
offshoring question of course that's
 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:58.740
offshoring question of course that's
that's real but the bigger question is

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750
that's real but the bigger question is
 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.489
that's real but the bigger question is
what happens to work
