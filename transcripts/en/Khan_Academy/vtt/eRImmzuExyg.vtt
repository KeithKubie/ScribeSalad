00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:02.880
So what happened in the
previous video?

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.450
We had a nice, simple
neighborhood in 1995.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.390
Everyone prudently bought houses
with 20% down, they

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.100
bought it for a $100,000.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.480
And frankly, there were probably
more people who

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.780
wanted to buy houses then but
they couldn't get financing.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.850
And that was in place for a
reason; because you had to

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.130
prove yourself worthy to
get the financing.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.510
But anyway, 10 years go by,
financing gets really cheap

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.670
because you have this dynamic of
rising home prices; people

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.570
downplay risk; people are
willing to give loans to more

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.150
and more people.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.479
And they kind of do that,
just to keep up

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.180
with the other banks.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.760
And you have in 2005, at kind
of the peak of the bubble,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.680
someone buys house number one
for $1,000,000, with no money

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.180
down, subprime loan.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.660
And then, a year later, they
foreclose and the house is

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.270
auctioned off and it
only gets $300,000.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.510
But between the time that the
house was bought for a million

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.590
dollars and auctioned off for
$300,000, let's say that

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.250
that's in-- I don't know, let me
do that in year, let me say

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.430
this is 2008, now.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:08.620
So 2008, this house get's
foreclosed, and

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.580
auctioned for $300,000.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.565
And in the meantime, all of
these people-- let's say all

00:01:14.565 --> 00:01:17.850
of them-- took $500,000 home
equity loans, right?

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.570
So they all have $500,000 of
debt from the home equity

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.790
loans, plus whatever they have
left from the original $80,000

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.300
loan, so, maybe, $580,000;
if they were only paying

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.540
interest. It may be a little
bit less than that.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.940
Let's just say, it's
roughly $500,000.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.900
And at first, maybe in 2008,
they all say, you know what,

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.100
this is temporary, that was just
a fire sale price, and

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.410
these auctions don't really
reflect a market reality.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.290
So we're just going to sit tight
and wait for our housing

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.900
prices to go up because this
wasn't a real transaction.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:58.800
But let's say 2009 comes along,
and this individual,

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.040
house number two's owner either
has to move, has a

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.850
different job in a different
city; or maybe they just get

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.740
laid off and they can't pay
their mortgage anymore and

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.260
they need to sell their house.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.940
Well they try to sell their
house a little bit and it's no

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.190
coincidence that they
sell for $600,000.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.810
And no one [? call ?]

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.080
[? line ?]

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.060
for awhile, and [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.410
starting up, because you have
a lot of people trying, at

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.720
least, just be made whole on
their loan when they sell

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.450
their house.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.750
But no one's buying
their house.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.580
So at some point,
they give up.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.630
They go to the bank and they
say, hey bank, can I do a

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.280
short sale where if I sell
it for less, then I

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.120
don't owe you any debt.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.900
But the banks are still pretty
confident then, and

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.490
they're like, no.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.630
A short sale is when you sell
something for less than what

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.270
you owe on it.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.860
So a short sale would be like
this guy has house number two,

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.040
has let's say a $500,000
mortgage.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.630
And if he were to sell his house
for $480,000 and the

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.470
bank were to agree that $480,000
is all he has to pay

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.770
back, then that would
be a short sale.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:08.000
Right?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.750
But the bank says, no, you
either sell your house or

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.090
we're going to foreclo-- You
either pay us for the debt, or

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.020
we're going to foreclose
on you.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.500
So the guy says, sure,
you know what, I

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.260
have nothing to lose.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.700
I've just lost my job.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.010
Here are the keys to the
house, foreclose on it.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.220
And so the bank says, OK I
foreclosed on it and the bank

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.040
realizes in a few months that
was a bad decision.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.430
Because now, when they auction
the house, they don't get even

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.560
$580,000; they don't get
$480,000 for it; they get

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.860
$250,000 for it.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.680
And all of this sounds like
a very extreme example.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.550
Things not that different than
what I'm describing happened

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.380
in places like Modesto and
Stockton, California, and

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.870
parts of Miami and Nevada
and Arizona.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.740
But anyway, so it auctions
off for $250,000.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.310
Now everyone in the neighborhood
gets scared

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.160
because this guy, house number
two, made an honest effort to

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.820
sell; couldn't sell; tried to do
a short sale; couldn't do a

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.510
short sale; and when the bank
auctioned, they actually

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.080
auctioned it off for
less than house

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.850
number one, it was $250,000.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.100
So now, all these people
say, what am I doing?

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.510
I'm working three jobs to pay a
$500,000 mortgage on a house

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.750
that's probably worth
$250,000.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.630
And if someone really were to be
rational about it, $250,000

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.250
isn't some crazy
lowball price.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.660
They paid $100,000 for it.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.390
Maybe, if you adjust that for
GDP growth or inflation, that

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:30.020
$100,000 in 2009 dollars might
be $150,000 or $200,000.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.080
So $250,000 actually,
isn't a crazy price.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.670
But anyway, all of these people
said, why do I keep

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.470
working so hard, being
an indentured

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.370
servant to this mortgage?

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.240
I'm just going to give the keys
back to the bank, that's

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.160
called: jingle mail.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.790
So you give the keys
back to bank.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.260
Let's say this guy gives the
keys back to this bank.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.240
This bank that thought that they
had made a prudent loan,

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.360
this is house number
three, I think.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.790
So they give the keys back
to the bank instead of

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.030
paying off the loan.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.820
And this bank says, oh boy,
now I have this house.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.180
They auction it off;
they get $250,000.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.620
So what happened to the bank?

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.550
The bank had a $500,000 loan
out, it got $250,000 back.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.960
And also, this person has also
lost all of the equity in

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.520
their house that they
originally had.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.520
House number three
lost their house.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.640
So how much wealth is gone
from each person's

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.610
perspective?

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.480
Well the bank had given $500,000
of real capital, real

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.950
money that could have been used
to build a factory; to

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:36.260
plant some crops; to work on
research and development that

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.050
might have developed new
materials or new technologies.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.520
That was real $500,000
of capital.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.050
And now, they got a house and
they auctioned off that house

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.725
and they got $250,000.

00:05:46.725 --> 00:05:47.850
Right?

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:56.640
So they lost $250,000.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.900
And this individual, number
one, what did they lose?

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.240
Well, they lost, by entering
into this transaction,

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.220
essentially, they lost
whatever equity they

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.030
originally had in their house.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.950
And what equity would they
have had in their house?

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.630
Well, they had, let's just
say, they had $20,000 of

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.520
equity before they did this
transaction, right?

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.600
So they lost that $20,000
of equity.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.280
And frankly, they could've
sold that

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.320
$100,000 house for $250,000.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.410
We know, even in this quote,
unquote, tough real estate

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.680
market, they could have
sold it for $250,000.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.500
So they really had, let's see,
they had an $80,000 loan, a

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:38.860
$250,000 asset, so they really
had $250,000 minus $80,000,

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:39.390
that's $170,000.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:44.280
So they really had $170,000 of
lost equity, if I'm doing my

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.810
math right.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:45.600
But I think you get the point.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.000
So they did build some equity
through housing appreciation,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.365
just the house didn't go from
$100,000 to a $1,000,000, it

00:06:51.365 --> 00:06:53.530
went from $100,000
to $250,000.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:59.420
So their equity was actually
$20,000 plus the $150,000 that

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.530
they got from just the
increasing asset value-- if

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.530
they didn't enter into
this transaction.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:09.000
So they would've had a another
$170,000 of equity that they

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.640
lost. So the homeowner
lost $170,000.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.410
So combined, these two parties,
by entering into this

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.400
transaction, how much
did they lose?

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.320
Let's see, 300,000, they
lost $420,000.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.220
$420,000 was just wiped out.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.710
It just disappeared
from the economy.

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.710
And where did it go?

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.770
It existed at some point, it
must've gone someplace.

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:34.750
Well, it was consumed.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:37.490
It went into these granite
countertops and these hardwood

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.440
floors and the vacation; the
vacation is pure consumption.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.790
You could argue, maybe, some of
it's investment if it helps

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.980
you become more productive, but
for the most part, that's

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.360
pure consumption.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.780
Things like wood floors and the
two more bathrooms and the

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.120
granite countertops, there is
some value there, but that

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.290
value is definitely not
equivalent to the amount of

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:57.290
money that was spent on them.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.720
They were depreciating assets;
they're luxury goods; they're

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.310
probably according to
the taste of the

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:03.750
person who did it.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.700
But anyway, the whole point of
this video is, is when you

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.620
have these asset bubbles, like
in real estate, and you have

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:14.320
this downplaying of risk, and
this psychology that an asset

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.700
class can only go up.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:20.090
And then people start to have an
inflated notion of what the

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:22.940
assets are worth, and start to
borrow against those and

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.550
leverage up against those
inflated notions, you have to

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:30.290
have a misallocation of wealth
and, essentially, a lot of

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.429
resources end up getting
destroyed.

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:36.610
Resources that could have built
factories, could have

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.490
built schools, could have built
roads, whatever, ended

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.799
up building granite countertops
and sending people

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:45.770
on vacation and making them feel
good to go start shopping

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.500
at Williams-Sonoma or Neiman
Marcus or whatever.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.810
And all of that is, essentially,
just consumption

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.430
that just destroys wealth.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.570
So it just disappears.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:57.790
And I want to make this point
because we have a government

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:03.620
now that somehow thinks that
it can legislate away real

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.240
wealth destruction.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.600
It thinks that, you know what,
if we just somehow buy this

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.890
loan from this bank, this
$500,000 loan, and if we were

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:18.110
to hold on to it long enough,
maybe the underlying asset--

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.020
the house got foreclosed on, so
we don't even have the loan

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.410
anymore, we have the house.

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:24.110
So maybe the government says,
oh what if we just buy this

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:27.170
house and hold it long enough,
maybe it'll get back to a

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:28.280
million dollars.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.580
It may get back to a million, if
our population increases so

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.780
much that, one day, that might
become a productive asset

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:37.390
again, or becomes a
high demand asset.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.530
Or, it might not ever go up; it
might be a house that was

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:41.680
built in the middle of nowhere
that's not really useful to

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.570
anyone; and, if anything, it's
going to become a place where

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.710
squatters start to come and the
whole place turns into an

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:50.530
empty neighborhood.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:51.480
Who knows?

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.560
But the bottom line is the
government somehow thinks that

00:09:54.560 --> 00:10:00.280
once things get bad, it can
step in and try to not let

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.480
people realize that they
have destroyed wealth.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.340
I call that legislating
against reality.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:09.030
And reality is something it's
very hard to do anything

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.550
against, whether you want to
legislate against it, or speak

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:15.430
against it, or perceive a
universe that's not in

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:16.460
accordance with it.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.420
But anyway, this is the
crux of the issue.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.460
But with that said, I don't want
to seem like one of these

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.740
defeatist people who says that
there's no solution to the

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.310
credit crunch.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.020
In particular, this banking
crisis we're

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:26.990
dealing with right now.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:30.340
In the next video, I'll give you
a proposed solution that

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.110
was actually suggested
to me by a friend

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:32.600
from business school.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.990
And I actually think it makes
a lot of sense, if you think

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.620
that the credit freeze
that's going on is

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.540
the crux of the issue.
