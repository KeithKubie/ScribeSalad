00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.890
[Chris Bavitz] Welcome to a very special Tuesday
talk here at Pound Hall, across the street

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.920
from the Berkman Klein Center. As with a lot
of our events on campus, this is being live

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.000
webcast and recorded. Please just keep that
in mind if and when you ask questions, which

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.250
I hope you will toward the end.
I have the privilege and the pleasure of being

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.310
able to introduce Prof. Susan Crawford and
Chairman Tom Wheeler this afternoon. As I'm

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.980
sure you know, Prof. Crawford teaches here
at HLS, works with us a lot in the Cyberlaw

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.990
Clinic, and works a lot on issues related
to telecom as well as civic innovation, government

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:38.170
innovation, and helping cities think through
data-smart governance and policies.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.290
Joining Susan today, Chairman Tom Wheeler
who spent three decades working in telecom

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.989
on both the business side and law and policy
side. In November of 2013, he was appointed

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:54.240
by President Obama to the position of FCC
chairman, where he was unanimously confirmed.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:00.920
His tenure as FCC chair was one of the extraordinary
accomplishments on a wide range of issues,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.850
and it's particularly well-known for ushering
in the FCC's final rule on net neutrality

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.000
in April 2015, which I'm sure is one of many
things that Susan and Chairman Wheeler will

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.780
talk about.
Without further ado, I'm going to turn things

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.830
over to Prof. Crawford and FCC Chairman Tom
Wheeler. Thanks so much.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.750
[Susan Crawford] Thanks so much, Chris.
[Tom Wheeler] Thank you, Chris.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.610
[Susan Crawford] It is indeed a singular pleasure
and honor to have Tom Wheeler here as the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:39.920
country goes through this whirlwind over the
last few days. The 31st FCC chairman, a proud

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.630
graduate of the Ohio State University and
a recipient ...

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.909
[Tom Wheeler] You got that right, the ...
[Susan Crawford] The Ohio State University

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.710
and a recipient of its Alumni Medal, a former
president and chairman of the National Archives

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.930
Foundation, a student of history, who cares
about America's documents and America's future

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:06.030
and America's past, and the most consequential
FCC chairman since a 35-year old Newt Minow

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.650
went to the Sheraton Park Hotel, to the lion's
den, to the National Association of Broadcasters

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.510
in 1961, the beginning of the Kennedy Administration,
and told those broadcasters that they were

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.359
supposed to be serving the public interest.
[Tom Wheeler] Interesting concept �

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:27.790
[Susan Crawford] Isn't that something? Tom
Wheeler told four companies that want to control

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.230
our destinies that they should be serving
the public interest as well and was active

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:43.230
on a huge range of issues, as Chris mentioned.
Tom, I know that someone you revered was your

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.810
grandfather. Pretend you're speaking to your
grandfather right now, someone with absolute

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.110
compassion and affection for you, and tell
him what you're really proud of in your tenure

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.560
at the FCC.
[Tom Wheeler] Golly, Susan.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.730
[Susan Crawford] What are you really proud
of? What did you do?

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.579
[Tom Wheeler] I think we did a lot of things.
[Susan Crawford] Okay. You did.

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:12.339
[Tom Wheeler] Let's start with the basic.
Note that I said, "We did a lot of things,"

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:19.760
because what I'm most proud of is the team
that did these things. Here's the silly thing.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:27.480
You're chairman. You're the guy who ends up
in the newspaper or in front of the Congress

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.529
or whatever the case may be, but you're just
the band leader. I mean the people who are

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:45.059
making the music and playing the instruments
are the people who were doing the real work.

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:54.989
We were just incredibly fortunate to be able
to attract to the commission a team of new

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:02.579
senior folks, bureau chiefs, folks in the
Office of the Chairman, General Council, et

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:12.089
cetera, to work with a really strong staff.
I mean they are really dedicated, really bright,

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:19.579
really caring people on the staff of the FCC.
What am I proudest about? I got to work with

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:25.900
them. I went around on the last couple of
days, and I met with every bureau, and I had

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:33.509
one thing that I said in common to all of
them, and that was that I was proud of the

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:41.290
fact that I was able to say I was their colleague
because there's a lot to be proud of in that

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:47.520
agency. I think you have to put everything
in perspective because it basically boils

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.090
down to it's all about people. Now, really
what you're going for is ...

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.050
[Susan Crawford] How do you know?
[Tom Wheeler] Let's talk about net neutrality.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.710
Let's talk about privacy. Let's talk about
�

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.240
[Susan Crawford] Actually, I wanted to put
the personal angle on it, but really the human

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.139
pride here.
[Tom Wheeler] It only happens because of the

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.669
people. You mentioned this small struggling
educational institution called the Ohio State

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:12.270
University. When I was in graduate school
there, I was Assistant Alumni Director, and

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:20.530
my job was the care and feeding of Woody Hayes.
It was a fabulous experience. That's an overstatement.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:27.580
My job was that I would, I traveled the state
with the coaches including Woody, and so I

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:35.930
got to know Woody Hayes up close and personal.
It was, "Son." "Yes, coach." Woody used to

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:42.270
say, "You win with people," and there's nothing
more true than that, "You win with people,"

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.490
and so the reason why Woody really gets some
things done so we had really good, really

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.060
dedicated people who busted their ass, who
believed in things and busted their ass.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.450
[Susan Crawford] Let me tick off a few things
then.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.150
[Tom Wheeler] Okay.
[Susan Crawford] Bringing fiber access to

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.830
about 50% of America's schools, the ...
[Tom Wheeler] More than that.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.820
[Susan Crawford] What, more than? We're at
about 50 now?

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.710
[Tom Wheeler] Here's where we are. When I
came in, two-thirds of the schools in America

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:14.409
did not have fiber connections and the third
that did did not have Wi-Fi; only half of

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:20.740
them had Wi-Fi to the student's desk. The
latest report out of EducationSuperHighway

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:29.090
says that 90% of the school districts in America
now have the standard, the 100 megabits per

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.099
student to the student's desk.
[Susan Crawford] Terrific.

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:38.300
[Tom Wheeler] That's because of a team that
worked together to overhaul a program that

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:45.460
had originally been envisioned by Al Gore
but had atrophied as a narrowband program

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:51.759
that wasn't making sense in a broadband world.
I'm very proud of that.

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:56.300
[Susan Crawford] Big one and revolutionizing
the idea of subsidizing low cost phone service,

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.469
changing that over to high speed Internet
access, that's a big deal.

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:06.210
[Tom Wheeler] We've always had a program where,
starting with the Reagan administration, we

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:14.010
have had a program that subsidized low income
Americans to be able to have phone service

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:25.060
because how are you going to dial 911, but
same story. It atrophied as dial-up telephone

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:30.009
service, when the world had gone broadband.
How do we make sure that the same kind of

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:36.409
concept supports subsidies for low income
Americans for broadband. The champion for

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:42.680
that was Commissioner Mignon Clyburn. She
was the person that was constantly, constantly

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.219
pushing on that, and she was my conscience
on that issue.

00:07:46.219 --> 00:07:51.969
[Susan Crawford] It's a wonderful issue. There
are some things that didn't happen, before

00:07:51.969 --> 00:07:58.330
we get to the Title II discussion, the Comcast-Time
Warner Cable merger.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:02.479
[Tom Wheeler] That didn't happen, and T-Mobile
Sprint didn't happen.

00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:06.370
[Susan Crawford] T-Mobile Sprint, that�s
the one that didn't happen.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:15.159
[Tom Wheeler] We had dinner last night with
former Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust

00:08:15.159 --> 00:08:22.370
Bill Baer and his deputy Renata Hesse and
then my two key folks who had been involved,

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:30.349
Phil Verveer and Jon Sallet. We had dinner
to reflect on not only the substance of the

00:08:30.349 --> 00:08:35.300
issues we had worked on but, again, back to
this people angle, I don't think there had

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:40.979
ever been a better working relationship between
the Antitrust Division and the FCC because

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:48.670
we all shared a common belief, and we all
liked each other and liked working together

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.670
with each other.
[Susan Crawford] A lot of learning on both

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:54.120
sides. Everything depended on a lot of information
trading around.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:09:02.260
[Tom Wheeler] No. I mean the Comcast-Time
Warner decision broke some new ground.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:13.730
[Susan Crawford] Privacy?
[Tom Wheeler] There's a really simple issue

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:24.830
that I think that we're going to have to face
again because of the new administration, and

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:33.860
that is that privacy is a civil rights issue
of the 21st century, of the connected era.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:48.500
Let me give you an example of it. We had,
for decades, rules that applied to telephone

00:09:48.500 --> 00:10:00.500
companies that said that the information that
was transmitted in order to set up the call

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:08.750
could not be used by the telephone companies.
For instance, if I call Air France, Verizon

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:13.050
can't turn around and sell that information
to some tour operator or hotel company in

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:19.620
Paris.
That doesn't exist in the broadband world.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:26.780
You had that strange situation where your
smartphone, if you used it to make a voice

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:33.040
call, your privacy was protected. If you use
that same device and the same network to go

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:39.370
on the web and go to the Air France website,
that information was for sale. It was not

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:45.250
your information anymore. The very fact that
you had used the network meant you were giving

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:52.390
that information. We said no. This is the
consumers' information, and so we put a rule

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:58.960
in place that said that the consumer gets
to make the choice as to how the network is

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:04.589
going to use the information. That was another
one of our three to two votes.

00:11:04.589 --> 00:11:08.880
[Susan Crawford] We'll talk about party line
in a bit. I want to get there. I'm still ticking

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.760
off the great moments of Tom Wheeler.
[Tom Wheeler] Do you want me to keep talking

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:17.110
about it? Are you interested?
[Susan Crawford] The idea of labeling an Internet

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:27.329
service provider as a common carriage Title
II entity. That was pretty big. I've always

00:11:27.329 --> 00:11:33.529
wanted to know, what is it like to hear from
3.7 million Americans? What's that feel like?

00:11:33.529 --> 00:11:38.530
[Tom Wheeler] They crashed our servers.
[Susan Crawford] Exactly.

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:44.779
[Tom Wheeler] You don't always want to hear
everything they say about you. I've heard

00:11:44.779 --> 00:11:53.310
more descriptions about what could I do to
myself with a pineapple than I ever want to

00:11:53.310 --> 00:12:04.230
hear. The whole open Internet discussion debate
was fascinating. You're a 

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:09.490
part of this because you and I, we're on the
phone discussing this. For me, it was kind

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:20.050
of a Damascus Road experience. You go back,
and let's put it in perspective that twice

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:28.480
before the commissioner tried to do something
and twice before the broadband companies,

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:33.370
the carriers, took it to the court and the
court said, "No, you can't do that."

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:41.899
Let's see. I walked in in November, and then
in February the court came down with a rising

00:12:41.899 --> 00:12:50.149
decision that threw out the previous attempts
at open Internet. It seemed to me that the

00:12:50.149 --> 00:12:59.019
court was leading us in a certain direction
built around Section 706 and protecting what's

00:12:59.019 --> 00:13:05.970
the virtuous circle of, if you have good broadband
that'll drive more services, which will drive

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:11.550
more broadband, and the job of the commission
is to protect that.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:17.589
Initially, my proposal was that we should
follow what I thought the court was trying

00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:23.009
to signal to us. At the same point in time,
I asked in the notice proposed rule I can

00:13:23.009 --> 00:13:33.720
ask about Title II and other areas. It became
clear over the debate, the discussion, that

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:42.160
that wasn't going to be sufficient, 706 wasn't
going to be sufficient. People like to point

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:52.319
to John Oliver and all that. I will show you
one thing here that my daughter gave me. This

00:13:52.319 --> 00:13:58.630
is my cell phone case. It says, "I am not
a dingo."

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:03.709
[Susan Crawford] Dingo is inherently funny
no matter what.

00:14:03.709 --> 00:14:08.089
[Tom Wheeler] Dingo is inherently funny until
you stand up and say, "You know, I've decided

00:14:08.089 --> 00:14:19.090
I'm not a dingo." That's not funny. Do not
mess with that guy who is funny for a living.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:24.190
One of the things that you and Chris didn't
mention in my background is that I was the

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:37.261
CEO of the Wireless Industry Association for
a dozen years. In 1994, 1993, the Wireless

00:14:37.261 --> 00:14:47.760
Industry went to Congress and said, "Please
make us a common carrier but put us under

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:58.630
Title II." Because Title II was designed for
a different era, with different technology,

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:07.430
less competition, et cetera, remove a lot
of these old requirements that were in Title

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:14.490
II. Congress did that, and the commission
followed through, and the Wireless Industry

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:24.769
went like this.
The summer of 2014 I guess, I'm going through

00:15:24.769 --> 00:15:34.750
options, and it's kind of, "Wait a minute.
Section 332 of the Communications Act, which

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:40.350
is this structure that I subscribed for the
wireless industry, is the perfect model for

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:48.269
this. Yes, you should be a common carrier
with all the responsibilities that come with

00:15:48.269 --> 00:15:53.009
a common carrier, but at the same point in
time you can forbear from some of the most

00:15:53.009 --> 00:15:58.800
ridiculous things. The statute says you got
accounting rules, who's on your board, who

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:07.060
you can buy from, and all kinds of things,
including ex-ante price regulation. We can

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:13.149
forbear from that.
Let's take that as the model of how we implement

00:16:13.149 --> 00:16:22.300
Title II in a broadband world, and that was
the decision that we ended up making. We were

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:28.120
constantly working through various iterations
of it. The President, of course, came out

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:36.740
and said he was a strong Title II supporter,
and so we were able to put together three

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:41.379
votes and uphold it in court.
[Susan Crawford] A very strong decision.

00:16:41.379 --> 00:16:48.339
[Tom Wheeler] With a very strong decision
that was crucial for that. Third time we got

00:16:48.339 --> 00:16:52.270
it right because we did it this way, and the
court strongly agreed to this.

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:56.500
[Susan Crawford] I got a quote from you, recent
speech. You've said recently, "Those who build

00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:00.580
and operate networks have both the incentive
and the ability to use the power of the network

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:05.970
to benefit themselves even if doing so harms
their own customers and the greater public

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:10.410
interest." We're hearing from the Trump Administration
today that they're looking forward to getting

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:17.910
rid of 75% of regulations. The idea is that
they inevitably dampen innovation in the investment.

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:26.180
What's your view of that claim, the dampening
of investment by regulation?

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:36.730
[Tom Wheeler] Part of my experience is that
I've made the same argument when I was an

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:41.400
advocate.
[Susan Crawford] How about that?

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:49.700
[Tom Wheeler] Let me tell you a story. I was
CEO of the Wireless Industry Association,

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:57.510
and I was proud of the job that I did at the
Cable Association when we were taking on the

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:01.470
broadcast because they were trying to shut
down in the early days of wireless when I

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:11.010
was at CTIA. The least proud moment of my
public policy life was when I opposed the

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:17.630
commission's efforts to have local number
affordability so that �

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:20.670
[Susan Crawford] That means for humans?
[Tom Wheeler] If you decided you could take

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:26.180
your, if you wanted to switch your service
from AT&amp;T to T-Mobile that you could take

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:32.770
your number with you, it didn't used to be
that way. I was imposed by regulation, and

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:39.610
I opposed it and you know that. Saying, "Okay.
So, I mean, how are we gonna oppose this?"

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:43.570
You can't exactly go out and say, "Hey, you
know, we think it's a really bad idea that

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:48.170
consumers can't, can't leave us, and they're
trapped in their carrier because they can't,

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:53.490
they're giving everybody their telephone number."
That's not an argument that's a real winner.

00:18:53.490 --> 00:19:02.630
The argument I made was, "Ah, stalling this
is gonna take money that should be spent on

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:13.380
infrastructure and expanding connectivity."
Unfortunately, that didn't sell. Like I said,

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:25.050
I regret that activity, but I'm guilty of
this. It is going to slow down our incentive

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:35.260
to invest is kind of the first line of defense
of everybody and it's balderdash. I clean

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:36.260
that up.
[Susan Crawford] That's a strong word.

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:50.560
[Tom Wheeler] I clean that up. The reason
that you invest is to get a return. You don't

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:55.170
say, "Well, I'm not gonna invest because I
might trigger some regulations." The question

00:19:55.170 --> 00:20:00.750
is: Am I going to make a return off of this?
Broadband is a high-margin operation. You

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:08.130
can make a return off of it.
The facts speak for themselves. Since the

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:23.090
open Internet rule went in place, broadband
investment is up, fiber connections are up,

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:36.240
usage of broadband is up, investment in companies
that use broadband is up, and get ready for

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:46.990
it, revenues in the broadband providers are
up because people are using it more. The reason

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:56.330
why you invest is for this reason, to generate
more revenues and a good return on those revenues.

00:20:56.330 --> 00:21:03.180
The oh-my-goodness-it's-gonna-be-a-terrible-thing-for-investment
is just the first refuge that everybody makes,

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:08.560
and you have to look past that.
[Susan Crawford] As a student of the Civil

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:14.950
War, you don't remember that one of the big
prizes of 1863 was Chattanooga: railroad hub,

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:20.010
three railroad lines, two big rivers, two
mountain ranges. What role did Chattanooga

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:24.070
play in your tenure?
[Tom Wheeler] What a setup. That was well

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:25.150
done.
[Susan Crawford] Thank you.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:27.790
[Tom Wheeler] That was real. You want to talk
to the Cracker Line that broadened the supplies

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:30.220
after Tennessee?
[Susan Crawford] It's an incredible story.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:34.220
We're going to get there but let's start with
something related to telecom.

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:51.470
[Tom Wheeler] My good friend, Susan Crawford,
says to me when I took this job that I should

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:58.700
bear three things in mind. I wrote these down.
I kept them in my desk. The first was to return

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:09.290
the regulatory ideal, that there is a legitimate
role for regulation to benefit the broad scope

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:20.610
of the population. The second was that we
should have a legitimate credible definition

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:26.491
of what broadband is because broadband used
to be defined as 4 megabits a second. That's

00:22:26.491 --> 00:22:41.500
hardly broadband. The third was to tackle
the outrageous practices that the ISPs, the

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:46.370
Internet service providers, the telephone
companies, the cable companies, were doing

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:52.640
where they were going around the country and
going to state legislatures and getting state

00:22:52.640 --> 00:23:01.320
legislatures to pass laws that prohibited
cities in that state from building their own

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:10.490
broadband network to compete with.
I thought, "Hey, you know, if the people through

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:18.200
their local government decide they don't like
the quality of service that they're getting,

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:23.800
they ought to be able to organize through
their government and say, 'I want something

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:36.520
better including the government building it.'"
Chattanooga was the case study of a Tennessee

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:52.450
law, so we sued Tennessee and North Carolina,
making the argument that this was overreach

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:58.700
of the states� authority. Unfortunately,
the Sixth Circuit disagreed with us.

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:09.120
The great thing is all the hubbub about this
woke up an awful lot of cities, triggered

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:17.470
an awful lot of referenda to do things, and
there is more activity to build competitive

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:21.570
broadband in the municipal levels, never has
been. You know what happens? You do know what

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:27.770
happens. Of course what happens, I'm talking
to Miss Fiber here being about that what happens

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:34.150
is when they decide to build, it's just amazing.
The cable company decides to go faster and

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:39.900
expand their service. It's just incredible.
I love this thing called competition.

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:45.790
[Susan Crawford] Private citizen Tom Wheeler,
the legislatures of Missouri and Virginia

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:51.890
just introduced new snarling bills along these
lines. What would you tell a sincere earnest

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:59.801
State legislature today about those bills?
What would your two talking points be to that

00:24:59.801 --> 00:25:05.000
legislature?
[Tom Wheeler] First of all, that the people

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.230
do have a right to come together and say,
"I want something better for my city." The

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:17.960
second political point that I would make is
it's not really the Chattanooga�s where

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:23.950
this is a big challenge. It's the Wilson,
North Carolinas, and it's the areas where

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:31.310
the people who voted for Donald Trump do not
have access to the Internet and are not getting

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:38.410
access by the existing companies. They're
the ones who were fed up with the system,

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:45.410
and I voted to that they were fed up. You
need to be responsive to that.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:50.910
[Susan Crawford] They voted your way. They
have to.

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:54.050
[Tom Wheeler] I would hope they want to.
[Susan Crawford] We're still wrestling with

00:25:54.050 --> 00:26:00.500
this in such a big way that you're 10 times
more likely not to have access to reasonable

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:05.120
high speed Internet access in a rural area
than in an urban area. If we add together

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.520
wires and wireless, you're just not going
to get it in rural areas at all. We have a

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:13.370
lot, a lot of progress, I understand.
[Tom Wheeler] This is the idea. I think that

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:20.290
one of the messages that people were voting
for in this campaign is, "I want power back

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:25.820
to me. I want decisions." The whole thing
about draining the swamp is to get the power

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:37.670
back. If the government closest to the people
is saying our people would like to have better

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:41.910
broadband, then who's to say no?
[Susan Crawford] I talked to you about the

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:46.410
vision of the FCC because now we're going
to go through the crossroads. I love looking

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:55.700
back. Let's walk on. The design of it as FDR�s
agency was to be an expert agency insulated

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:59.950
from politics. Is that true?
[Tom Wheeler] Of course not.

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:06.780
[Susan Crawford] Many of the staffers, people
who are working at the FCC, there's a lot

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:12.020
of flow back and forth: people who have been
staffers end up as commissioners, lobbyists

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:14.640
end up as staffers. There's a big circle here.
What do we do about all of that?

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.910
[Tom Wheeler] Let me give a, you deserve a
better response ...

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:20.430
[Susan Crawford] Thank you.
[Tom Wheeler] Than the smart ass response,

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:37.830
I guess. Look. One of my aha moments was how
special and independent the agency is. I'll

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:52.440
tell you a story. Early in my tenure we said
that, for technology reasons, it was no longer

00:27:52.440 --> 00:28:01.520
necessary to turn off your cellphone on an
airplane for fear of interfering with the

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:10.710
grounding stations, which is the only reason
that rule existed. You own the hubbub of,

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:14.890
"Oh my god, we're gonna be 35,000 feet and
people are gonna be, the guy next to me is

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:18.920
gonna be yacking away." I didn't want that
either. We were just doing that technical

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:25.300
issue.
Anthony Foxx, the Secretary of Transportation,

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:32.740
and I are on the phone because he has the
responsibility for the FAA of how consumers

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:36.549
behave on the plane. I was just doing the
technology. You don't need, without interfering

00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:44.990
the work of, say, what�s also on the plane.
He says, "Well, this is cool. We can work

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:49.400
this all out." He said, "You take the technology.
I'll take the consumer. We'll solve it." I

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:55.520
said, "That's fabulous." I said, "I'm testifying
tomorrow in Congress at 10 o'clock and they're

00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:01.450
going to ask about this. Let's make sure that
we've got our language down. That's exactly

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:05.150
what you and I just agreed to." He says, "There
are staffs at work on that. That's great."

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:08.550
About an hour later, somebody comes in, one
of my staff folks comes in and says, "You

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:12.140
just got a call from General Council at the
Department of Transportation. They can't do

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:21.440
it." Why? It was overruled by the White House.
Now making a very long story short, there

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:25.500
was somebody in the communication shop at
the White House that didn't like this idea.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:31.190
The White House ended up approving it. I went
and testified when the things moved forward.

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:36.910
The point of the matter is that I made the
decision looking at the guy in the mirror

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:43.970
in the morning, and the Cabinet Secretary
had to run it through, and as a former White

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:52.700
House staffer he know how that works. The
ability to have an independent agency to be

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:59.770
an expert agency and to make independent judgments
is really important. That does not mean that

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:06.550
there's any political agency, to answer your
question, and in particular having an agency

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:16.840
that, for the vast majority of my term, was
dealing with a Republican Congress that didn't

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:31.670
like what we were doing. That helped politicize
the activities at the commission.

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:45.330
It is an independent agency, but of course,
the commissioners read the newspapers like

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:50.990
the Lyman Supreme Court, Grand Supreme Court
reads the election. They respond to letters

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:53.840
from Congress.
[Susan Crawford] It's an agency made up historically

00:30:53.840 --> 00:31:00.130
of one agency being glued together with memories
of another agency essentially. Now people

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:08.390
are talking about taking it apart. Modernizing
the FCC is the lingo being used. What's your

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:11.010
thought about that?
[Tom Wheeler] It's a fraud.

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:17.040
[Susan Crawford] Keep talking.
[Tom Wheeler] It's interesting. Actually,

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:26.150
I was going through some papers this weekend
and I ran across a September 2013 article

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:33.090
in the Washington Post, the headline of which
was something to the effect: "Here's how the

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:45.590
networks plan to defang the FCC." It quoted
all of the cable and telephone company Washington

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:54.230
office heads saying that really the consumer
protection and competition work of the FCC

00:31:54.230 --> 00:32:03.790
should be transferred to the FTC, the Federal
Trade Commission. It's no surprise where they

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:12.340
want to transfer.
The FTC doesn't have rule-making authority.

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:18.660
They've got enforcement authority, and their
enforcement authority is whether or not something

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:31.540
is unfair or deceptive. First, the only regulation
that they would be subject to would be an

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:40.381
adjudicatory finding that it's unfair or deceptive,
one. Two, you got this agency over here, the

00:32:40.381 --> 00:32:47.740
FCC, that is constantly worrying about all
things in telecom. The FTC has to worry about

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:57.190
everything from computer chips to bleach labeling.
Of course, you'd want to get lost in that

00:32:57.190 --> 00:33:01.650
morass. We're, "Okay. We will get to that.
We got to get bleach labeling taken care of

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:11.370
first." This was the strategy all along.
What surprises me, no, what doesn't surprise

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:16.851
me is that, then the Trump transition team,
which is basically folks from the American

00:33:16.851 --> 00:33:21.460
Enterprise Institute who were folks who were
...

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:23.140
[Susan Crawford] True. It's not even funny.
It's just true.

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:29.130
[Tom Wheeler] Who were long time supporters
of this concept, come in and say, "Oh, we

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:34.420
oughta, we oughta do away with this." The
story gets even more interesting. First of

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:38.490
all, it makes no sense to get rid of an expert
agency and to throw it over here to an agency

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:43.630
with no rule-making that has to compete with
everything else that's going on in the economy

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:48.360
and can only deal with unfair or deceptive
because we're talking about one-sixth of the

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:55.080
economy, but more importantly, we're dealing
with the network that connects six-sixths

00:33:55.080 --> 00:34:00.470
of the economy.
Here's what's really bizarre and how the story

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:16.490
really gets interesting. We in the FTC brought
an action against AT&amp;T and the FTC using their

00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:27.740
unfair or deceptive standard, us using our
broader capabilities. AT&amp;T took the FTC to

00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:37.389
court and said, "You don't have authority."
The FTC statute says that common carriers

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:48.059
are exempt from the jurisdiction of the FTC.
Now this is the same company that was previously

00:34:48.059 --> 00:34:53.450
in this Washington Post article, the head
of their Washington office arguing how it

00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:58.609
should only be the FTC that has jurisdiction
over their issues.

00:34:58.609 --> 00:35:07.230
The court said, "Yes, you are right. And not
only are you right about the FTC not having

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:13.980
jurisdiction over common carriers, the FTC
doesn't have jurisdiction over the non-common

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:26.870
carrier activities of common carriers." Now,
we have a situation where the carriers and

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:33.839
their supporters at the AEI and inside the
commission are saying, "We should transfer

00:35:33.839 --> 00:35:41.500
everything to the FTC,� which is a result
of a Ninth Circuit decision on a case brought

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:51.640
by the same people that are arguing it should
be moved, doesn't have authority. Go figure.

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.430
That's not modernization.
[Susan Crawford] No. It is ...

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:57.420
[Tom Wheeler] That's just hiding the �
[Susan Crawford] It's like escape velocity,

00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:02.670
no coverage at all. You may not have heard,
but there's a new chairman of the FCC.

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:03.890
[Tom Wheeler] Really?
[Susan Crawford] Yeah.

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:07.559
[Tom Wheeler] No.
[Susan Crawford] It just came out. It's news.

00:36:07.559 --> 00:36:12.549
Ajit Pai. I can't tell who he is because I
got these press releases, and they seemed

00:36:12.549 --> 00:36:18.961
to be talking about two different guys, so
from NCTA which used to be called The Cable

00:36:18.961 --> 00:36:24.310
Association, now called The Internet and Television
Association. Michael Powell saying, "During

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:28.559
his tenure on the Commission, Chairman Pai
has consistently demonstrated a commonsense

00:36:28.559 --> 00:36:33.450
philosophy that consumers are best served
by a robust market place that encourages investment,

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:37.930
innovation, and competition. We stand ready
to assist Chairman Pai to ensure that America

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:42.720
remains a global Internet communications entertainment
leader." That's one Ajit Pai.

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:47.339
The other Ajit Pai, according to Free Press,
"He's been on the wrong side of just about

00:36:47.339 --> 00:36:51.270
every major issue that has come before the
FCC during his tenure. He�s never met a

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:54.960
merger he didn�t like or a public safeguard
he didn�t try to undermine. He�s been

00:36:54.960 --> 00:37:00.960
an opponent of Net Neutrality, expanded broadband
access for low-income families, privacy, all

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:06.040
kinds of issues. And he's been an obstructionist
who," get this, "Has always been eager to

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:11.710
push out what the new presidential administration
might call alternative facts, in defense of

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:15.630
the corporate interest he used to represent
in the private sector."

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:22.890
I listened to a radio interview of you just
a couple of days ago, when you said that commissioner

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:27.820
Pai canceled all the meetings that you set
with him.

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:38.430
[Tom Wheeler] True. When I came in, we're
a five-person commission, and the chairman

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:43.720
sets the agenda, and the chairman is a CEO,
but there are four other commissioners that

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:52.190
are important to relate to, and it takes three
votes to do anything. I set up that with every

00:37:52.190 --> 00:38:01.690
commissioner every other week. We had a date
on our calendar that was an hour for the two

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:09.599
us just to sit without staff and talk about,
if you talk about baseball, they would have

00:38:09.599 --> 00:38:13.990
talked about baseball, but talk about the
issues of the day and other concerns and how

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:23.230
do we work our way through a series of problems.
Commissioner Pai and I had early on a lot

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:28.660
of those meetings, but for the last 18-24
months he's canceled every meeting. The only

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:36.779
point I was making on Marketplace was that
it's hard to work for consensus when you won't

00:38:36.779 --> 00:38:41.890
sit down with each other.
[Susan Crawford] Yeah. Time will tell I suppose,

00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:48.759
or the next step. I think it's coming up right
away, the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger. There are

00:38:48.759 --> 00:38:53.000
two Donald Trumps on this one too. There's
the Donald Trump in October who said, "This

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.160
is, you know, distraction of democracy." Then
there's the Donald Trump of last week who

00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:02.880
said, after meeting with AT&amp;T, "I got to get
some more facts. We'll see." Do you have any

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.650
guesses for us about what's likely to happen
with that merger?

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:14.519
[Tom Wheeler] AT&amp;T has now designed the merger
to avoid the FCC. I think the commission probably

00:39:14.519 --> 00:39:22.339
still has some jurisdiction, but I don't make
those decisions anymore. Somebody said to

00:39:22.339 --> 00:39:26.330
me the other day, "I have lost the Windex
to my crystal ball."

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:32.490
[Susan Crawford] Good line. I have determined
that you have something in common with Donald

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:39.619
Trump. You're maybe surprised to hear this.
It is the exclamation point because of your

00:39:39.619 --> 00:39:49.740
first book, Take Command!: Leadership Lessons
From the Civil War. This is the Harvard Leadership

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.130
School. You may think it's the Harvard Law
School. It's actually the Harvard Leadership

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:59.830
School. I wanted to get your reflections on
leadership in this role because I want everybody

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:07.319
to understand what it takes to run an agency
with a $388 million budget and 1,700 employees.

00:40:07.319 --> 00:40:13.529
I thought I could tie this again back to the
Civil War and have you talk to us about Ulysses

00:40:13.529 --> 00:40:18.140
Grant. You don't have to talk about yourself
but you could talk about Gen. Grant because

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:24.490
that must be a model leadership for you.
[Tom Wheeler] Gen. Grant is my hero and not

00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:35.160
just because he was from Ohio. The first chapter
in the book that you said is called Dare to

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:47.039
Fail. I think that's the first rule of leadership,
that what the book says is that if you prepare

00:40:47.039 --> 00:40:57.039
for failure, you will no doubt succeed. One
of the things that was so great about Grant

00:40:57.039 --> 00:41:11.650
was that he was dogged in his, "I just won't
fail, I'll get this done," and so he's always

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:18.220
been my hero.
I got a little consulting company that I had

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:28.150
before the Commission that I just reopened,
and it's called Shiloh Group. Why is it called

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:35.779
Shiloh Group? It's called Shiloh Group because
it was probably the definitive battle of Grant's

00:41:35.779 --> 00:41:52.809
career, and he lost on the first day. He got
creamed. Everybody expected, the rebels expected

00:41:52.809 --> 00:42:04.779
him to retreat away, but he didn't. He brought
more troops up. The OK man saved the day.

00:42:04.779 --> 00:42:14.730
That night, William Tecumseh Sherman finds
Grant sitting under a tree whittling, working

00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:23.109
at his frustrations on a piece of wood. He
says, "Well, Grant. We've had the devil's

00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:31.999
day." Grant looks up, "We�ll lick 'em tomorrow,"
and he did.

00:42:31.999 --> 00:42:41.599
[Susan Crawford] He sure did.
[Tom Wheeler] Persistence is the key, and

00:42:41.599 --> 00:42:47.190
Ulysses Grant was a great model of persistence.
[Susan Crawford] Gen. Lee and Gen. Grant,

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:53.869
I mean, keep going with this. Both went to
West Point. Gen. Lee graduates top of his

00:42:53.869 --> 00:43:01.460
class, no demerits. Gen. Grant, number 21
out of 39, plenty of demerits. Comment.

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:06.089
[Tom Wheeler] You're asking a guy who barely
got out of Ohio State.

00:43:06.089 --> 00:43:15.980
[Susan Crawford] There you go. Moral courage.
[Tom Wheeler] You can't criticize me. You

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:20.140
can criticize him for being on the wrong side,
but you can't criticize him for being a great

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:33.640
leader. That's a really good question. Look.
I think the bottom line is this. It is what

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:42.329
you make of things. Let's go back, and let's
take Ulysses Grant after he left West Point.

00:43:42.329 --> 00:43:44.690
He distinguished himself from the Mexican
War.

00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:51.210
[Susan Crawford] He met Lee there.
[Tom Wheeler] He met Lee, but Lee didn't remember.

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:58.210
Lee was a hotshot. He was a quartermaster.
Lee was a hotshot engineer because he graduated

00:43:58.210 --> 00:44:10.310
first in his class. He didn't get posted to
various remote posts, particularly out west

00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:18.249
where Julia, his wife, can't come with him
and he starts drinking. He drank himself out

00:44:18.249 --> 00:44:33.509
of the army. He came back to St. Louis where
his wife Julia lived with her parents were

00:44:33.509 --> 00:44:37.740
and tried to take up farming. That really
didn't work.

00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:47.490
He was reduced to selling firewood on the
streets of St. Louis, wearing his old army

00:44:47.490 --> 00:45:01.500
greatcoat selling firewood. He finally went
back to work for his father in Galena, he

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:14.670
and his father never really got along that
well, to be a clerk in the tannery. He was

00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:25.160
passed over for early leadership roles in
the Civil War. McClellan was one of the guys

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:42.259
who passed him over. Failure, failure, failure,
failure, and then all of a sudden, and so

00:45:42.259 --> 00:45:51.220
the point is, okay, so he failed. Move on.
That's the great leadership lesson of Ulysses

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:53.200
Grant.
[Susan Crawford] Another part of this is that

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:57.630
Ulysses Grant wrote to his wife Julia everyday
when he was away from her. They were both

00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:03.279
invited to see My American Cousin by President
Lincoln the night of April 14th. Julia got

00:46:03.279 --> 00:46:10.119
spooked so they left. Speaking of leading
Washington, my segue here, as you walk away

00:46:10.119 --> 00:46:16.470
from the portals, what's that like to be the
chairman, to walk out and no longer be the

00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:27.109
chairman? What does that feel like?
[Tom Wheeler] First of all, you get a long

00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:29.840
time, you get 77 days to work up to it.
[Susan Crawford] That's true.

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:40.819
[Tom Wheeler] It's not a big surprise. You
walk away with just an incredible gratitude

00:46:40.819 --> 00:46:49.900
for the fact that at a time of such incredible
change in how Americans communicate that you

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:58.740
got to be the guy who sat there and dealt
with how Americans relate to those changes.

00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:09.710
Because the people who say the problem is
government are so wrong, and the government

00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:16.109
is the people. It's where we come together
to solve our common problems. It is a messy

00:47:16.109 --> 00:47:23.619
process, and it's a painful process, but if
we can�t work things out there, we're in

00:47:23.619 --> 00:47:29.420
a whole hell a lot of trouble.
The fact that I got to sit at the head of

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:38.230
that agency in these incredibly changing times
and to say, "How do you look at these changes

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:47.349
in technology, economics, how people connect
and make sure that public interest is represented?"

00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:52.440
was a terrific privilege. I walk away from
there proud that I could do it with the people

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:56.020
that I did it with. How fortunate can you
be?

00:47:56.020 --> 00:48:00.770
[Susan Crawford] Last question as this is
about to turn to a Q &amp; A here, but what are

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:06.549
you most worried about? There are millions
of people who marched over the weekend, and

00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:14.809
if they knew it, they would be marching about
telecom as well. What should they be doing?

00:48:14.809 --> 00:48:20.329
What should people worried about the concentrated
market, the high prices, that inadequate service,

00:48:20.329 --> 00:48:27.640
all of that, be doing in America?
[Tom Wheeler] The most powerful asset of the

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:36.150
21st Century is the networks that connect
us; networks have always been important. The

00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:42.150
railroads ruled the industrial revolution.
Networks have always been crucial, and the

00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:52.140
network will define the 21st Century. These
are broadband networks. As I said, we had

00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:57.440
jurisdiction over one-sixth of the economy
but six-sixths of the economy using those

00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:05.660
networks. I've always used this phrase that
how we connect defines who we are both commercially

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:18.329
and culturally. That connection and whether
or not it is going to be controlled on a gateway

00:49:18.329 --> 00:49:27.839
basis by essentially four companies is an
existential question for American commerce

00:49:27.839 --> 00:49:37.190
and culture. I am worried about what that
future looks like.

00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:52.349
What is amazing to me 
is how the Commission and seemingly the Congress

00:49:52.349 --> 00:50:01.410
want to do things on behalf of these four
companies that will have an impact on tens

00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:09.779
of thousands of other companies and millions
of consumers. I just don't think the debate

00:50:09.779 --> 00:50:15.069
has gotten to the point where people recognize
we're talking about fewer than half a dozen

00:50:15.069 --> 00:50:23.049
companies here and how should you make policy.
That's my concern.

00:50:23.049 --> 00:50:29.539
[Susan Crawford] It's the public education
moment of huge opportunity. What do you want

00:50:29.539 --> 00:50:39.509
to ask Chairman Wheeler? Yes. A mic is flying
through the air towards you. It's coming.

00:50:39.509 --> 00:50:50.950
[Question] If you today have been replaced,
what about the people who are working under

00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:58.289
the Civil Rights Commission jobs. What percentage
of people in the FCC ...

00:50:58.289 --> 00:51:02.190
[Tom Wheeler] You mean the Civil Service.
[Susan Crawford] Civil Service.

00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:12.180
[Question] Our government employees, and does
Trump think that he can just change everybody?

00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:15.400
[Tom Wheeler] I'm the last guy to ask what
Trump thinks.

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:19.829
[Susan Crawford] You can have that exclamation
point.

00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:26.260
[Tom Wheeler] The reality is you're absolutely
correct that the vast majority of the employees

00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:33.660
of the FCC are civil servants. I imagine that
the new chairman will bring in, as I did,

00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:42.829
a new top tier, and that they will be the
ones managing those civil servants.

00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:48.700
[Susan Crawford] Yes.
[Tom Wheeler] They have to follow the directions.

00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:53.309
[Question] What do we, the American people
including the people in this room, need to

00:51:53.309 --> 00:51:59.490
do to protect net neutrality?
[Tom Wheeler] Thank you for asking the question,

00:51:59.490 --> 00:52:08.190
first of all. I think that there are two things.
One, we need to be heard but, two, we need

00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:19.950
to be heard in different ways than before.
Susan says 3.7 million emails and comments

00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:26.940
to the Commission. They were pushing on a
door that was already open. The door is locked,

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:37.700
latched, bolted, and welded right now.
I think the battering ram is, to paraphrase

00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:41.630
here, Madison had this great line in Federalist
10 where he said that ambition must be made

00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:48.640
to counteract ambition. This was the whole
concept of how the government was set up.

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:55.259
Economic ambition is what is driving this
handful of companies. There must be economic

00:52:55.259 --> 00:53:02.960
ambition that counters them. What we need
is we need to hear the voices of those that'll

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:10.769
be affected. Yes, the small startups but also
the big companies. GE, GM, if there are, so

00:53:10.769 --> 00:53:19.519
let's just go through a couple of things.
Artificial intelligence and machine learning,

00:53:19.519 --> 00:53:31.390
what is it? It is the connectivity of all
kinds of database resources. If that connectivity

00:53:31.390 --> 00:53:39.779
has to worry about gatekeepers, what happens
to AI, the Internet of Things? The Internet

00:53:39.779 --> 00:53:44.530
of Things is going to change the whole economics
of the Internet I believe from a push environment

00:53:44.530 --> 00:53:52.549
to a pull economics. We can talk about that
later if you want. Who will be deciding which

00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:58.079
things get connected and on which terms?
If one of the caregivers says, "Wait a minute.

00:53:58.079 --> 00:54:03.619
I like my things better, and I'm gonna price
differently to them, that I am this competitive

00:54:03.619 --> 00:54:08.800
provider of this service." What does it mean?
We see they already do that because we are

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:18.569
waiting on video. This is not a hypothetical.
We need to be making sure that the companies

00:54:18.569 --> 00:54:24.010
that are affected are delivering the message
because I think that's what the Congress would

00:54:24.010 --> 00:54:29.380
be most responsive to.
[Susan Crawford] Question, anyone?

00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:33.249
[Tom Wheeler] This is great. We answered every
question in the room.

00:54:33.249 --> 00:54:37.200
[Susan Crawford] I'm just looking for �
[Tom Wheeler] Here she is, over here in the

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:38.779
corner.
[Susan Crawford] There in the back.

00:54:38.779 --> 00:54:42.789
[Question] I think my colleague probably asked
this question better than I can, but I'm just

00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:48.930
going to do it. We work at some rural community
access television. I wanted to know a couple

00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:55.190
of things. One is what is the role, like how
can community access television play an important

00:54:55.190 --> 00:55:01.229
role? What do you think? What do you predict?
Can you predict? I know our Windex isn't working

00:55:01.229 --> 00:55:09.660
anymore, but what the new chairman, what his
perspectives are on public access, and how

00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:18.109
we might stay protected?
[Tom Wheeler] Great questions. When I was

00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:29.280
at NCTA, I was a great supporter of PEG, Public,
Educational, and Governmental Access. We actually

00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:39.989
got it codified for cable ad. Things have
changed a lot since �84. There had been

00:55:39.989 --> 00:55:44.359
some intervening legislations and rulings
by the Commission. I don't know where Ajit

00:55:44.359 --> 00:55:52.830
Pai is on that issue. We never had an occasion
to discuss it so I'm sorry, but good for you

00:55:52.830 --> 00:56:03.700
for what you're doing. The diversity of voices
is, so the beauty of technology is that it

00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:12.680
has created the opportunity for a diversity
of voices. That is also the vein of the technology

00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:20.289
because if you're not using things like PEG
to express yourself, there are others who

00:56:20.289 --> 00:56:25.220
are using the opportunities for diversity
of voices to do that.

00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:42.660
The other thing is that we need to begin to
become our own editors where we used to outsource

00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:55.849
the editorial function to NBC or CBS or New
York Times. Now, anybody with web access has

00:56:55.849 --> 00:57:06.519
as much reach as any of those, and it's going
to force consumers to be better consumers

00:57:06.519 --> 00:57:11.009
of information. I think we'll get there but
we're certainly going through a rough period

00:57:11.009 --> 00:57:15.839
right now.
[Susan Crawford] Over here, yep.

00:57:15.839 --> 00:57:21.369
[Tom Wheeler] Wait a minute.
[Susan Crawford] Mic.

00:57:21.369 --> 00:57:26.599
[Question] FirstNet is Congress's effort to
create a fifth cellular network for public

00:57:26.599 --> 00:57:32.079
safety. We got three million price-sensitive
picky cops and firefighters, maybe 12 if we

00:57:32.079 --> 00:57:36.509
expect it for the second responders but to
break even for network is about 40 million

00:57:36.509 --> 00:57:40.869
users. In Britain, they said priority preemption
and quality of service had to be provided

00:57:40.869 --> 00:57:46.750
by carriers. I can't see a way through the
success for FirstNet and this network in the

00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:49.990
country given the vision of how this will
end up.

00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:58.619
[Tom Wheeler] FirstNet has been controversial
since the day that Congress made the decision

00:57:58.619 --> 00:58:08.569
made by Congress championed by Senator Rockefeller
in particular, and it has evolved to a point

00:58:08.569 --> 00:58:18.569
now where they're going to be buying services
from an existing wireless provider and will

00:58:18.569 --> 00:58:24.799
be getting the kind of priority service that
you are referencing is available elsewhere

00:58:24.799 --> 00:58:30.410
in other countries. It's going to be interesting.
Let's see what happened.

00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:36.700
We had three jobs with regard to FirstNet.
One was to make the spectrum available. We

00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:43.940
did that. Two was to make sure that they had
$7 billion to start the process. We did that

00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:55.089
out of auction revenues. Three was, in the
coming year, there is the option of states

00:58:55.089 --> 00:59:04.859
to opt out of FirstNet, and we were to be
the judge as to whether a state should be

00:59:04.859 --> 00:59:09.520
allowed to opt out, and that's a decision
that the Pai Commission is now going to have

00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:15.269
to make. That's going to be key because, for
instance, if New York opts out or California

00:59:15.269 --> 00:59:25.349
opts out or Illinois opts out or Texas opts
out, the nationwide network collapses. That's

00:59:25.349 --> 00:59:32.079
something we have to live through. I don't
know how it's going to end up.

00:59:32.079 --> 00:59:42.279
[Susan Crawford] Last question, anybody? Yes.
[Question] Question around wireless spectrum,

00:59:42.279 --> 00:59:50.489
when one looks on one side, the public benefit
revenue from auctions are being able to just

00:59:50.489 --> 00:59:58.441
type communication and the other side the
rights of spectrum holders. There's been a

00:59:58.441 --> 01:00:04.970
lot of controversy in this area with bankruptcy,
spectrums that never used. Do you have any

01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:11.779
thoughts on do we have the optimal model for
how we license or sell and look at the whole

01:00:11.779 --> 01:00:17.809
life cycle of spectrum management over long
periods of time and also take in account innovation

01:00:17.809 --> 01:00:22.249
that occurs?
[Tom Wheeler] We could be here a while, it's

01:00:22.249 --> 01:00:31.569
so well past dinner time. Let me go through
a couple of things. One, spectrum allocation

01:00:31.569 --> 01:00:45.400
was originally done based on analog physics.
A TV signal is a six megahertz waveform, so

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:55.760
you need a six megahertz spectrum to put out
a TV station. When you go digital, the efficiencies

01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:04.420
of digitization allow you to get four or five
channels into that same spectrum but the problem

01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:12.239
is that everything that, not everything, the
vast majority of the spectrum allocation tables

01:01:12.239 --> 01:01:20.810
were decided using analog physics, and we're
now in a digital time. You can get a lot more

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:29.340
out of the spectrum except that it's my spectrum.
You can't have my spectrum.

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:33.470
[Susan Crawford] They'd rather give up their
babies than give their spectrum.

01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:42.979
[Tom Wheeler] My cold dead fingers, take my
spectrum. This is true internationally. I

01:01:42.979 --> 01:01:49.420
mean we have troubles in a big international
conference allocating spectrum just last year,

01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:57.240
two years ago I guess. The world is not as
sensitive to this as we are. That's kind of

01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:06.759
issue one. We're operating under old rules
that support, "It's mine. I don't wanna leave

01:02:06.759 --> 01:02:09.600
it."
One of the great things that the national

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:17.160
broadband plan came up with, Blair Levin led
a team under my predecessor Julius Genachowski

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:23.170
to develop a national broadband plan, you
had a large hand in that, was to say there

01:02:23.170 --> 01:02:31.390
ought to be a spectrum auction where we would
re-purpose spectrum by having an auction to

01:02:31.390 --> 01:02:40.119
buy it back and then resell it. The broadcast
spectrum was the key there because go back

01:02:40.119 --> 01:02:44.660
to my ...
Why do you need six megahertz if you can get

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:51.420
a bunch of channels in there, get them in
there and then sell off the others for wireless

01:02:51.420 --> 01:03:00.210
applications both licensed and unlicensed
by the way? Just literally, my next to the

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:05.759
last day on the job, that auction which everybody
said, "Oh, it will never work. It will never

01:03:05.759 --> 01:03:09.549
work."
That auction hit what was called the final

01:03:09.549 --> 01:03:18.020
stage rule where, in fact, we have created
a market where broadcasters have agreed to

01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:26.819
sell 84 megahertz of spectrum and the wireless
carriers have agreed the necessary price to

01:03:26.819 --> 01:03:34.849
buy that. For the next 39 months, there will
be a whole process across the country of reallocating

01:03:34.849 --> 01:03:41.569
spectrum re-banding and making this spectrum
of available. The challenge with spectrum

01:03:41.569 --> 01:03:50.500
is, A, they're not making any more, and B,
is the physics that describe the chart, the

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:54.079
spectrum allocation chart or analog physics
in a digital era.

01:03:54.079 --> 01:03:58.430
[Susan Crawford] Here's a shared challenge
I think we have, that for you this is blood

01:03:58.430 --> 01:04:06.769
and guts entertaining fascinating stuff and
for me frankly. How do we reach more people

01:04:06.769 --> 01:04:11.239
with what are ultimately extraordinarily personal
issues? People's phones are very close to

01:04:11.239 --> 01:04:17.509
their hearts. They would give up a food before
they give up a cell phone. What thoughts as

01:04:17.509 --> 01:04:23.420
you give us a benediction here as you pass
into private life? How do we get the resistance

01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:28.289
going to focus on these issues in a more dramatic
way?

01:04:28.289 --> 01:04:34.109
[Tom Wheeler] You don't ask easy questions.
[Susan Crawford] No. This is important.

01:04:34.109 --> 01:04:43.249
[Tom Wheeler] I've just sat here and given
you a wonk's eye view of telecommunications

01:04:43.249 --> 01:04:55.329
policy. I love my wife dearly, and she loves
me, but I can't hold her interest across the

01:04:55.329 --> 01:05:02.559
dinner table on these topics. How in the world
do we get ahold the interests of the vast

01:05:02.559 --> 01:05:14.299
majority? We need to get out of discussing
this kind of, we need to get out of our technocrat

01:05:14.299 --> 01:05:24.299
mode and into our mode of Susan's point about
how it's the Trump voter who has the worst

01:05:24.299 --> 01:05:30.640
Internet experience and the key to getting
an education to be able to do your homework,

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:37.089
the key to being able to get a job, the key
to be able to interact with the world around

01:05:37.089 --> 01:05:41.529
you, is to have broadband, and these people
have been denied it.

01:05:41.529 --> 01:05:49.319
Why? Because we built things around, again,
four companies and we need to be getting the

01:05:49.319 --> 01:05:55.319
story out that let's talk not about the networks
but let us talk about the network effects

01:05:55.319 --> 01:05:59.259
that the effects are the ability to do your
homework, the effects are the ability to get

01:05:59.259 --> 01:06:07.310
a job. The effects are job creation.
Let me tell you great story, and then I'll

01:06:07.310 --> 01:06:16.989
shut up. This is a story that more people
need to hear. Hal Rogers, who is the chairman

01:06:16.989 --> 01:06:24.640
of the House Appropriations Committee, represents
Eastern Kentucky, which is coal country and

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:32.999
which is just as you know economically devastated,
and Trump made a big play in coal country.

01:06:32.999 --> 01:06:40.630
Hal Rodgers has said, "Connectivity is key."
It kept bringing me back to the district to

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:46.019
pump the importance of fiber connectivity,
Ms. Fiber.

01:06:46.019 --> 01:07:02.150
I�ll tell you two stories. I was in McKee,
Kentucky, one stoplight, 900 people, fiber

01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:15.249
to every home, and business as a result of
the Obama stimulus. There are more people

01:07:15.249 --> 01:07:26.259
employed today in McKee than there were three
years ago. Who's getting employed? It's not

01:07:26.259 --> 01:07:33.039
just the folks who got let go from the coal
mines or those who were selling goods and

01:07:33.039 --> 01:07:37.569
services to them, but it's the disabled. I
mean one of the things that we haven't talked

01:07:37.569 --> 01:07:43.660
about that I'm most proud about is what we
did to make technology available for individuals

01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:49.329
who are disabled, the people who can't get
out and about are now working for U-Haul,

01:07:49.329 --> 01:07:56.769
Avis, and folks like this being online from
McKee to West Virginia.

01:07:56.769 --> 01:08:09.229
You go down the road to Pikesville where I
met with a bunch of ex-coalminers. You shake

01:08:09.229 --> 01:08:25.330
hands with these guys and you know who are
now coding for Apple and others because there's

01:08:25.330 --> 01:08:35.190
fiber in the Pikesville, the community college
has fiber, was teaching coding. These guys

01:08:35.190 --> 01:08:41.730
who had the gumption to go way underground
and go to the coal face had the gumption to

01:08:41.730 --> 01:08:48.960
say, "I'm going to take charge of my life
in the new economy because I can, because

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:56.780
there is a fiber connection allowing me to
do it." Those are the kinds of stories that

01:08:56.780 --> 01:09:04.040
we have to be telling because how we connect
defines who we are.

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:08.800
[Susan Crawford] Thank you for helping keep
America being the Pottersville of the Internet.

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:16.190
We appreciate that. Thank you for your leadership.
Thank you for your character and for the many,

01:09:16.190 --> 01:09:18.740
many hours you put in on our behalf. We really
appreciate it.

01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:19.870
[Tom Wheeler] Thanks, Susan.
[Susan Crawford] Thank you.
