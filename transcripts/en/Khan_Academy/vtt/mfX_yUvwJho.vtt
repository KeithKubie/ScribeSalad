00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.290
Shira's math test
included a survey question

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.150
asking how many
hours students had

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.000
spent studying for the test.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.090
The graph below shows
the relationship

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.520
between how many hours
students spent studying

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.360
and their score on the test.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.900
Shira drew the line below to
show the trend in the data.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.940
Assuming the line is correct,
what does the line slope of 15

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.060
mean?

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.190
So let's see.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.400
The horizontal axis is
time studying in hours.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.080
The vertical axis is
scores on the test.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.409
And each of these blue
dots represent the time

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.040
and the score for
a given student.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.670
So this student right over
here spent-- I don't know,

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.270
it looks like they spend
about 0.6 hours studying.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.260
And they didn't do
too well on the exam.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.920
They look like they got
below a 45, looks like a 43

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.010
or a 44 on the exam.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.180
This student over here spent
almost 4 and 1/2 hours studying

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.180
and got, looks like, a 94,
close to a 95 on the exam.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.940
And what Shira
did is try to draw

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.660
a line that tries
to fit this data.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.620
And it seems like it
does a pretty good job

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.440
of at least showing
the trend in the data.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.170
Now, slope of 15 means
that if I'm on the line--

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.040
so let's say I'm here--
and if I increase

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.515
in the horizontal
direction by 1-- so there,

00:01:13.515 --> 00:01:16.180
I increase the horizontal
direction by 1--

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.272
I should be increasing in
the vertical direction by 15.

00:01:19.272 --> 00:01:19.980
And you see that.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.170
If we increase by one hour here,
we increase by 15% on the test.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.470
Now, what that means is
that the trend it shows

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.960
is that, in general,
along this trend,

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.675
if someone studies
an extra hour,

00:01:34.675 --> 00:01:36.175
then if we're going
with that trend,

00:01:36.175 --> 00:01:38.130
then, hey, it seems
reasonable that they

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.630
might expect to see a
15% gain on their test.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.850
Now, let's see which of
these are consistent.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.120
In general, students
who didn't study at all

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.064
got scores of about
15 on the test.

00:01:50.064 --> 00:01:50.730
Well, let's see.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.434
This is neither true--
these are the people who

00:01:54.434 --> 00:01:56.850
didn't study at all, and they
didn't get a 15 on the test.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.800
And that's definitely
not what this 15 implies.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.680
This doesn't say what the people
who didn't study at all get.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.900
So this one is not true.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.410
That one is not true.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.600
Let's try this one.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.210
If one student studied for one
hour more than another student,

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.130
the student who studied
more got exactly

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.140
15 more points on the test.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.330
Well, this is getting
closer to the spirit

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.780
of what the slope means.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.090
But this word "exactly" is
what, at least in my mind,

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.512
messes this choice up.

00:02:24.512 --> 00:02:26.970
Because this isn't saying that
it's a guarantee that if you

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.440
study an hour extra that you'll
get 15% more on the test.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.650
This is just saying that
this is the general trend

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.940
that this line is seeing.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.727
So it's not guaranteed.

00:02:35.727 --> 00:02:37.560
For example, we could
find this student here

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.380
who studied exactly two hours.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.660
And if we look at the students
who studied for three hours,

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.900
well, there's no one
exactly at three hours.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.020
But some of them-- so
this was, let's see,

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.180
the student who
was at two hours.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.390
You go to three hours,
there's no one exactly there.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.094
But there's going to be
students who got better

00:02:56.094 --> 00:02:57.760
than what would be
expected and students

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.960
who might get a
little bit worse.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.793
Notice, there's points
above the trend line,

00:03:00.793 --> 00:03:02.540
and there's points
below the trend line.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.260
So this "exactly,"
you can't say it's

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.570
guaranteed an hour
more turns into 15%.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.780
Let's try this choice.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.780
In general, studying
for one extra hour

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.590
was associated with a 15-point
improvement in test score.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.670
That feels about right.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.167
In general, studying
for 15 extra hours

00:03:19.167 --> 00:03:21.500
was associated with a 1-point
improvement in test score.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.890
Well, no, that would get the
slope the other way around.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.570
So that's definitely
not the case.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.653
So let's check our answer.

00:03:26.653 --> 00:03:28.480
And we got it right.
