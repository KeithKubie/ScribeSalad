at the phone again now you can see it's

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820
at the phone again now you can see it's
 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.850
at the phone again now you can see it's
sort of the UI for when you're doing the

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860
sort of the UI for when you're doing the
 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.039
sort of the UI for when you're doing the
selection again is it's it's simple and

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049

it highlights things as we go over them

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330
it highlights things as we go over them
 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.689
it highlights things as we go over them
so in terms of usability I'd say that's

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:27.699
so in terms of usability I'd say that's
 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.570
so in terms of usability I'd say that's
that's pretty good you got any comments

Fred yeah the only thing I like to that
is the bit of the red bar the hot spot

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770
is the bit of the red bar the hot spot
 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:36.930
is the bit of the red bar the hot spot
is that what they're calling it yes

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940
is that what they're calling it yes
 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.740
is that what they're calling it yes
about area I guess it will it

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750

applications I mean it's pretty thin but

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639
applications I mean it's pretty thin but
 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:46.770

I'm just wondering if there are any

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780
I'm just wondering if there are any
 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.020
I'm just wondering if there are any
corner cases it's an interesting point

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030
corner cases it's an interesting point
 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.490
corner cases it's an interesting point
and I wondered about that particularly

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500
and I wondered about that particularly
 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.920
and I wondered about that particularly
in apps which have you know the ability

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930

there yeah ocean right so yeah you're

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530
there yeah ocean right so yeah you're
 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.430
there yeah ocean right so yeah you're
right i guess you could test but yet it

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440
right i guess you could test but yet it
 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.590
right i guess you could test but yet it
is pretty sensitive and that it has to

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600
is pretty sensitive and that it has to
 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.090
is pretty sensitive and that it has to
be in that small zone i have found

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100
be in that small zone i have found

myself more missing being unable to

of other things so yeah that's a good

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690
of other things so yeah that's a good
 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.029
of other things so yeah that's a good
point I think that's probably one of the

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039
point I think that's probably one of the
 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:28.800
point I think that's probably one of the
reasons why I would be a little bit

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810
reasons why I would be a little bit
 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.060
reasons why I would be a little bit
hesitant about using it it's just

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070
hesitant about using it it's just
 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.230
hesitant about using it it's just
because I worry that it's going to

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240
because I worry that it's going to
 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.180
because I worry that it's going to
interfere with my sort of normal

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190
interfere with my sort of normal
 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.260
interfere with my sort of normal
usability but yeah just work with a look

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270
usability but yeah just work with a look
 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.940
usability but yeah just work with a look

that's a reasonable tutorial there yeah

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400
that's a reasonable tutorial there yeah
 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.230
that's a reasonable tutorial there yeah
yeah they wanna on a tablet screen it's

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240
yeah they wanna on a tablet screen it's
 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.320
yeah they wanna on a tablet screen it's
a lot of blank space bigger and tomatoes

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330
a lot of blank space bigger and tomatoes
 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.640
a lot of blank space bigger and tomatoes
earlier point you know there's a little

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650
earlier point you know there's a little
 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.950
earlier point you know there's a little
blank space on the left and right and

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960
blank space on the left and right and
 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.270

screenshot for tablet because what we're

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780
screenshot for tablet because what we're
 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.240
screenshot for tablet because what we're
looking at is the screenshot for the

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250
looking at is the screenshot for the
 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.129
looking at is the screenshot for the
screen I mean for that a phone screen

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:17.139
screen I mean for that a phone screen
 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:19.050
screen I mean for that a phone screen
that we just looked at that's a good

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060
that we just looked at that's a good
 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.159
that we just looked at that's a good
call and you could do that fairly

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:20.169
call and you could do that fairly
 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:21.690
call and you could do that fairly
straightforwardly just by packaging

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:21.700
straightforwardly just by packaging
 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.820
straightforwardly just by packaging
additional image assets for the larger

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830
additional image assets for the larger
 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.930
additional image assets for the larger

let's go to next

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:28.700
let's go to next
 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.410
let's go to next
and with more instructions no shortage

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:32.420
and with more instructions no shortage
 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:49.660
and with more instructions no shortage
of instructions but yeah that's the job

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:49.670
 
 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.260
 
up here hot spots general &amp; addons where

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:53.270
up here hot spots general &amp; addons where
 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.140
up here hot spots general &amp; addons where
I guess you can purchase some additional

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.150
I guess you can purchase some additional
 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.980
I guess you can purchase some additional
items so now let's have a look at how

00:06:59.980 --> 00:06:59.990
items so now let's have a look at how
 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.870
items so now let's have a look at how
the hot spot is triggered so as I walk

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880
the hot spot is triggered so as I walk

the screen I popped up a bunch of grids

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:09.860
the screen I popped up a bunch of grids
 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.220
the screen I popped up a bunch of grids
just like what we saw on the phone and

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:12.230
just like what we saw on the phone and
 

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:17.380
just like what we saw on the phone and
based on what we see here the it looks

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:17.390
based on what we see here the it looks
 

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.110
based on what we see here the it looks
like the grid layout is optimized for a

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:20.120
like the grid layout is optimized for a
 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.660
like the grid layout is optimized for a

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.750
phone form factor with it was narrower
screen but it's sort of feels like the

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:25.760
screen but it's sort of feels like the
 

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.170
screen but it's sort of feels like the
grids squished together on a larger

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:29.180
grids squished together on a larger
 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.400
grids squished together on a larger
tablet screen size but other than that

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:33.410
tablet screen size but other than that
 

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:38.490
tablet screen size but other than that
is pretty straightforward implementation

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:38.500
 
 

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.290

of a natural follow on that though it
 

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.380
of a natural follow on that though it
doesn't seem to have functionality which

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:47.390
doesn't seem to have functionality which
 

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:48.670
doesn't seem to have functionality which
is significantly different with the

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:48.680
is significantly different with the
 

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.380
is significantly different with the
exception of that of that great I think

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:50.390

beautiful battery so this is effectively
 

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.320
beautiful battery so this is effectively
a widget so one of the interesting

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:32.330
a widget so one of the interesting
 

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:33.850

hard today okay so this is this is what

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:52.850
hard today okay so this is this is what
 

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:55.810
hard today okay so this is this is what
happens when you open it up and so this

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:55.820
happens when you open it up and so this
 

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.610
happens when you open it up and so this
is really interesting because the whole

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:57.620
is really interesting because the whole
 

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:58.870
is really interesting because the whole
notion of this widget is that it's

00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:58.880
notion of this widget is that it's
 

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.040
notion of this widget is that it's
beautiful it's the most

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:00.050
beautiful it's the most
 

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:01.690

attractive-looking widget that you could

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:01.700
attractive-looking widget that you could
 

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.760
attractive-looking widget that you could
come up with to display something which

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:03.770
come up with to display something which
 

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.170
come up with to display something which
you already have on the top left of your

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:05.180
you already have on the top left of your
 

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.490
you already have on the top left of your
screen so we can already see how much

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:06.500

know having the information here it's

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480
know having the information here it's
 

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.550
know having the information here it's
kind of cool but yeah it's it's not it's

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560
kind of cool but yeah it's it's not it's
 

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.860
kind of cool but yeah it's it's not it's
not it's not beautiful so yeah I'd go

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:24.870
not it's not beautiful so yeah I'd go
 

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.230
not it's not beautiful so yeah I'd go
right back to sort of the defaults here

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:27.240
right back to sort of the defaults here
 

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.639
right back to sort of the defaults here
I think you'll find that's a better

00:11:28.639 --> 00:11:28.649
I think you'll find that's a better
 

00:11:28.649 --> 00:11:30.680
I think you'll find that's a better
experience interesting go i wonder how

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:30.690
experience interesting go i wonder how
 

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:34.879
experience interesting go i wonder how
to put a type lithium iron you can

00:11:34.879 --> 00:11:34.889
to put a type lithium iron you can
 

00:11:34.889 --> 00:11:36.670
to put a type lithium iron you can
actually get most of this information

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:36.680
actually get most of this information
 

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.019
actually get most of this information
through the API so the voltage and

00:11:39.019 --> 00:11:39.029
through the API so the voltage and
 

00:11:39.029 --> 00:11:40.220
through the API so the voltage and
battery level you can get straight out

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:40.230
battery level you can get straight out
 

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:42.769
battery level you can get straight out
of the API type I think as well I think

00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:42.779
of the API type I think as well I think
 

00:11:42.779 --> 00:11:45.680
of the API type I think as well I think
if you ask for the battery temperature

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:45.690
if you ask for the battery temperature
 

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:47.810
if you ask for the battery temperature
is actually an answer yeah that's right

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:47.820
is actually an answer yeah that's right
 

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.879
is actually an answer yeah that's right
so the temperature sensor gives you

00:11:49.879 --> 00:11:49.889
so the temperature sensor gives you
 

00:11:49.889 --> 00:11:52.370
so the temperature sensor gives you
internal temperature in most cases i

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:52.380
internal temperature in most cases i
 

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.610
internal temperature in most cases i
think it's been deprecated now because

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:54.620
think it's been deprecated now because
 

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.840
think it's been deprecated now because
sometimes was ambience sometimes it was

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:56.850
sometimes was ambience sometimes it was
 

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.560
sometimes was ambience sometimes it was
internal and the api was ambiguous so

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:00.570
internal and the api was ambiguous so
 

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:01.730
internal and the api was ambiguous so
there's now an ambient temperature

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:01.740
there's now an ambient temperature
 

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.019
there's now an ambient temperature
sensor me you can use for that and

00:12:03.019 --> 00:12:03.029
sensor me you can use for that and
 

00:12:03.029 --> 00:12:04.639
sensor me you can use for that and
generally speaking the temperature

00:12:04.639 --> 00:12:04.649
generally speaking the temperature
 

00:12:04.649 --> 00:12:05.960
generally speaking the temperature
sensor is going to return the internal

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:05.970
sensor is going to return the internal
 

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:07.610
sensor is going to return the internal
battery temperature what happens to this

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:07.620

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.430
battery temperature what happens to this
checkbox show battery state I wonder

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:10.440
checkbox show battery state I wonder
 

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.129
checkbox show battery state I wonder
what it does by place on chose to look

00:12:13.129 --> 00:12:13.139
what it does by place on chose to look
 

00:12:13.139 --> 00:12:15.410
what it does by place on chose to look
anything another thing itself let's

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:15.420
anything another thing itself let's
 

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.620
anything another thing itself let's
display battery info in status bar so

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:18.630
display battery info in status bar so
 

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.689
display battery info in status bar so
okay so it's done that up here so if we

00:12:20.689 --> 00:12:20.699
okay so it's done that up here so if we
 

00:12:20.699 --> 00:12:23.600
okay so it's done that up here so if we
drag that down again that's that's not

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:23.610
drag that down again that's that's not
 

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.180
drag that down again that's that's not
necessarily the most beautiful so again

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:26.190

up see status bar config the battery is

00:12:45.139 --> 00:12:45.149
up see status bar config the battery is
 

00:12:45.149 --> 00:12:47.240
up see status bar config the battery is
to be displayed okay so that's a little

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:47.250
to be displayed okay so that's a little

bit grammatically suspect is the battery
is to be displayed in the status bar so

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:50.970
is to be displayed in the status bar so
 

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:54.639
is to be displayed in the status bar so
maybe work on that convert to Fahrenheit

00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:54.649
maybe work on that convert to Fahrenheit
 

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:58.790
maybe work on that convert to Fahrenheit
so rather than saying can of currently

quite busy you want to keep this as

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:27.490
quite busy you want to keep this as
 

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:29.189
quite busy you want to keep this as
simple as possible like it's it's great

00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199
simple as possible like it's it's great
 

00:14:29.199 --> 00:14:31.350
simple as possible like it's it's great
to call out the translators and to you

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.360
to call out the translators and to you
 

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.699
to call out the translators and to you
know make those requests to get more

00:14:32.699 --> 00:14:32.709
know make those requests to get more
 

00:14:32.709 --> 00:14:34.139
know make those requests to get more
languages it's a great way to get more

00:14:34.139 --> 00:14:34.149
languages it's a great way to get more
 

00:14:34.149 --> 00:14:35.970
languages it's a great way to get more
distribution of your app this is

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:35.980
distribution of your app this is
 

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.980
distribution of your app this is
probably the wrong place for it if this

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:37.990
probably the wrong place for it if this
 

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:39.060
probably the wrong place for it if this
is what you're going to show people

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:39.070
is what you're going to show people
 

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:42.060
is what you're going to show people
straight away I think you know basically

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:42.070
straight away I think you know basically
 

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:46.230
straight away I think you know basically
just everything up that is probably all

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:46.240
just everything up that is probably all
 

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.970
just everything up that is probably all
you need to be displaying if you want to

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:47.980
you need to be displaying if you want to
 

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.850
you need to be displaying if you want to
display anything at all yeah even even

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:50.860
display anything at all yeah even even
 

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.430
display anything at all yeah even even
then I also got a small blurb explaining

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440
then I also got a small blurb explaining
 

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.519
then I also got a small blurb explaining
what Android widgets are on top exactly

00:14:56.519 --> 00:14:56.529
what Android widgets are on top exactly
 

00:14:56.529 --> 00:14:59.370
what Android widgets are on top exactly
it's like assume this if someone has

00:14:59.370 --> 00:14:59.380
it's like assume this if someone has
 

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:00.810
it's like assume this if someone has
installed this then they understand how

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:00.820
installed this then they understand how
 

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.819
installed this then they understand how
widgets work if they don't understand

00:15:02.819 --> 00:15:02.829
widgets work if they don't understand
 

00:15:02.829 --> 00:15:05.130
widgets work if they don't understand
which at this point your little blurb is

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:05.140
which at this point your little blurb is
 

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.319
which at this point your little blurb is
probably not going to explain it I do

00:15:07.319 --> 00:15:07.329
probably not going to explain it I do
 

00:15:07.329 --> 00:15:09.269
probably not going to explain it I do
understand the rationale behind having

00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279
understand the rationale behind having
 

00:15:09.279 --> 00:15:11.370
understand the rationale behind having
it but perhaps less again less verbiage

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:11.380
it but perhaps less again less verbiage
 

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.439
it but perhaps less again less verbiage
it's all about making sure that users

00:15:13.439 --> 00:15:13.449
it's all about making sure that users
 

00:15:13.449 --> 00:15:15.569
it's all about making sure that users
get to the app as quickly as possible

00:15:15.569 --> 00:15:15.579
get to the app as quickly as possible
 

00:15:15.579 --> 00:15:17.639
get to the app as quickly as possible
and so you don't want to make them read

00:15:17.639 --> 00:15:17.649
and so you don't want to make them read
 

00:15:17.649 --> 00:15:19.079
and so you don't want to make them read
stuff because my eyes just glaze over

00:15:19.079 --> 00:15:19.089
stuff because my eyes just glaze over
 

00:15:19.089 --> 00:15:21.780
stuff because my eyes just glaze over

glowy green situation here I can tell

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:10.190
glowy green situation here I can tell
 

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:11.470
glowy green situation here I can tell
you from experience that when the

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:11.480
you from experience that when the
 

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.350
you from experience that when the
battery level drops down below I think

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:14.360
battery level drops down below I think
 

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.180
battery level drops down below I think

are two different widgets so if i if i

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:39.950
are two different widgets so if i if i
 

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:43.030
are two different widgets so if i if i
go to add the widgets you can see that

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:43.040
go to add the widgets you can see that
 

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.890
go to add the widgets you can see that
there's two there's battery widget small

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:44.900
there's two there's battery widget small
 

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.320
there's two there's battery widget small
and battery widget and this is the

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:47.330
and battery widget and this is the
 

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.510
and battery widget and this is the
effect of dropping them both know which

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520
effect of dropping them both know which
 

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.320
effect of dropping them both know which
one do you think is small

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:51.330
one do you think is small
 

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:54.630
one do you think is small
take a guess you gonna teach an eft

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640
take a guess you gonna teach an eft
 

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.270
take a guess you gonna teach an eft
correct correct and so what it what it

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.280
correct correct and so what it what it
 

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.100
correct correct and so what it what it
actually is is the one on the left is

00:17:59.100 --> 00:17:59.110
actually is is the one on the left is
 

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:01.530
actually is is the one on the left is
battery widget without padding and the

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:01.540
battery widget without padding and the
 

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.060
battery widget without padding and the
one on the right is battery widget with

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:03.070
one on the right is battery widget with
 

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:05.250
one on the right is battery widget with
padding so this is a two by one so it's

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:05.260
padding so this is a two by one so it's
 

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.920
padding so this is a two by one so it's
two cells hi and this is a one by one

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:07.930
two cells hi and this is a one by one
 

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:10.890
two cells hi and this is a one by one
yeah I'm so yeah so I imagine that

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:10.900
yeah I'm so yeah so I imagine that
 

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:14.450
yeah I'm so yeah so I imagine that
they've done this for being able to

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:14.460
they've done this for being able to
 

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.250
they've done this for being able to
position things on the home screen in

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:17.260
position things on the home screen in
 

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.230
position things on the home screen in
the right way I'd be interested to have

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:19.240
the right way I'd be interested to have
 

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.580
the right way I'd be interested to have
a better understanding of the the

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:20.590
a better understanding of the the
 

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:22.560
a better understanding of the the
rationale behind it well I was kind of

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:22.570
rationale behind it well I was kind of
 

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:23.940
rationale behind it well I was kind of
expecting for the big one was the

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:23.950
expecting for the big one was the
 

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:25.770
expecting for the big one was the
ability to resize it right it drag it

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:25.780
ability to resize it right it drag it
 

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.350
ability to resize it right it drag it
right I was expecting a big icon or

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:28.360
right I was expecting a big icon or
 

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.800
right I was expecting a big icon or
something something yeah so yeah I don't

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:31.810
something something yeah so yeah I don't
 

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:33.660
something something yeah so yeah I don't
think carefully about is certainly the

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:33.670
think carefully about is certainly the
 

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:35.340
think carefully about is certainly the
naming if you've named one small and one

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:35.350
naming if you've named one small and one
 

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:37.740
naming if you've named one small and one
not small then you would expect a size

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:37.750
not small then you would expect a size
 

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.170
not small then you would expect a size
difference now I realized that this is

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:40.180
difference now I realized that this is
 

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:43.650
difference now I realized that this is
probably all sort of PNG's or final

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:43.660
probably all sort of PNG's or final
 

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:44.850
probably all sort of PNG's or final
graphics which is why it looks quite

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:44.860
graphics which is why it looks quite
 

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:48.390
graphics which is why it looks quite
nice which makes resizing difficult but

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.400
nice which makes resizing difficult but
 

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.190
nice which makes resizing difficult but
again that would be an interesting thing

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:50.200
again that would be an interesting thing
 

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.110
again that would be an interesting thing
to try and do was to create a way that

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:52.120
to try and do was to create a way that
 

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.730
to try and do was to create a way that
it maybe you have multiple different

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:53.740
it maybe you have multiple different
 

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.680
it maybe you have multiple different
images different image levels and then

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:55.690
images different image levels and then
 

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:58.470
images different image levels and then
based on the size number of cells you

00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.480
based on the size number of cells you
 

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.360
based on the size number of cells you
know load a bigger version so you still

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:00.370
know load a bigger version so you still
 

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:02.900
know load a bigger version so you still
have the high res but it's bigger

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:02.910
have the high res but it's bigger
 

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.070
have the high res but it's bigger
because yeah if someone really likes the

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.080
because yeah if someone really likes the
 

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.840
because yeah if someone really likes the
idea of beautiful battery widgets on the

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:06.850
idea of beautiful battery widgets on the
 

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:08.220
idea of beautiful battery widgets on the
home screen and they may want to have a

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:08.230
home screen and they may want to have a
 

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:11.280
home screen and they may want to have a
really big right a big one or one with a

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:11.290
really big right a big one or one with a
 

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:13.350
really big right a big one or one with a
different design yeah exactly different

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360
different design yeah exactly different
 

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.360
different design yeah exactly different
designs are nice see I mean the same way

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:15.370
designs are nice see I mean the same way
 

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:16.950
designs are nice see I mean the same way
that you've got themes set up for the

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960
that you've got themes set up for the
 

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.260
that you've got themes set up for the
notification you may want to do the same

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:19.270
notification you may want to do the same
 

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:22.260
notification you may want to do the same
sort of thing for the action or a

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:22.270
sort of thing for the action or a
 

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:23.850
sort of thing for the action or a
battery itself right you're different

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:23.860
battery itself right you're different
 

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.620
battery itself right you're different
different themes different kinds of

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:25.630
different themes different kinds of
 

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:28.320
different themes different kinds of

whatever else I wonder if they have

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:29.740
whatever else I wonder if they have
 

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.260
whatever else I wonder if they have
different graphics for the different

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:31.270
different graphics for the different
 

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.870
different graphics for the different
types of battery be hard to test back a

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:33.880
types of battery be hard to test back a
 

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.940
types of battery be hard to test back a
phone without a lithium-ion battery all

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:35.950
phone without a lithium-ion battery all
 

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:37.970
phone without a lithium-ion battery all
right let's look for that in view to be

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:37.980
right let's look for that in view to be
 

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.410
right let's look for that in view to be
when i hook this up to my car battery I

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:40.420
when i hook this up to my car battery I
 

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:43.770
when i hook this up to my car battery I
want to see a different image all right

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:43.780
want to see a different image all right
 

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.720
want to see a different image all right
shall we have all right at the tablet

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:45.730
shall we have all right at the tablet
 

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:47.790
shall we have all right at the tablet
version yeah la by all means yeah let's

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:47.800
version yeah la by all means yeah let's
 

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:51.660
version yeah la by all means yeah let's
switch to the tablet awesome try

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:51.670
switch to the tablet awesome try
 

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:53.990
switch to the tablet awesome try
beautiful and great animation by the way

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000
beautiful and great animation by the way
 

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.480
beautiful and great animation by the way
so I've added a does the large widget

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:57.490
so I've added a does the large widget
 

00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:59.400
so I've added a does the large widget
which s i currently have sixty-eight

00:19:59.400 --> 00:19:59.410
which s i currently have sixty-eight
 

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:01.470
which s i currently have sixty-eight
percent basically we have the same

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:01.480
percent basically we have the same
 

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:01.950
percent basically we have the same
design

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:01.960

as what we just saw in the film this

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:04.510
as what we just saw in the film this
 

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:10.919
as what we just saw in the film this
then have a look at the app itself so

00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:10.929
then have a look at the app itself so
 

00:20:10.929 --> 00:20:12.330
then have a look at the app itself so
it's pretty trivial it's a stretched

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:12.340
it's pretty trivial it's a stretched
 

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:14.519
it's pretty trivial it's a stretched
version straight horizontal horizontally

00:20:14.519 --> 00:20:14.529

beautiful one really interesting thing

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:26.110
beautiful one really interesting thing
 

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:27.750
beautiful one really interesting thing
you can see really well here on the

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760
you can see really well here on the
 

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.669
you can see really well here on the
display is that there's almost no

00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679
display is that there's almost no
 

00:20:29.679 --> 00:20:32.490

keep pressing more you want more you

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:34.120
keep pressing more you want more you
 

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.269
keep pressing more you want more you
want to really bad ooh so you can

00:20:36.269 --> 00:20:36.279
want to really bad ooh so you can
 

00:20:36.279 --> 00:20:37.620
want to really bad ooh so you can
actually see on your screen here that

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:37.630
actually see on your screen here that
 

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:39.750
actually see on your screen here that
we've we're losing text because it's

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:39.760
we've we're losing text because it's
 

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.159
we've we're losing text because it's
being cropped slightly on out on our

00:20:41.159 --> 00:20:41.169
being cropped slightly on out on our
 

00:20:41.169 --> 00:20:43.320
being cropped slightly on out on our
output right so obviously it's not gonna

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:43.330
output right so obviously it's not gonna
 

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:44.880
output right so obviously it's not gonna
be cropped in a real device but there's

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:44.890
be cropped in a real device but there's
 

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:46.590
be cropped in a real device but there's
it's just right hard up against the

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:46.600
it's just right hard up against the
 

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.789
it's just right hard up against the
edges and you definitely want to have

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:47.799
edges and you definitely want to have
 

00:20:47.799 --> 00:20:49.169
edges and you definitely want to have
some padding there just to give a little

00:20:49.169 --> 00:20:49.179
some padding there just to give a little
 

00:20:49.179 --> 00:20:51.450
some padding there just to give a little
bit of space yeah generally it's good

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:51.460
bit of space yeah generally it's good
 

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.659
bit of space yeah generally it's good

do two things right increase the font

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:58.450
do two things right increase the font
 

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:00.450
do two things right increase the font
size and have some padding just like

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:00.460
size and have some padding just like
 

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.399

techniques to try and encourage you to
 

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.799
techniques to try and encourage you to
monetize your app so all those sorts of

sorts of monetization techniques so an

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:12.380
sorts of monetization techniques so an
 

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:15.070
sorts of monetization techniques so an
ad would show up in a notification in

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:15.080

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:23.950
of those so from that perspective this
is this is an interesting application so

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:23.960
is this is an interesting application so
 

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.600
is this is an interesting application so

it although from a technical standpoint
I wonder how to achieve it I'm curious

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:36.660
I wonder how to achieve it I'm curious
 

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:40.190
I wonder how to achieve it I'm curious
myself so I mean this is this sort of

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:40.200
myself so I mean this is this sort of
 

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.240
myself so I mean this is this sort of
fits into an interesting category

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:41.250
fits into an interesting category
 

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:44.870
fits into an interesting category
because it's it's sort of anti adware

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:44.880
because it's it's sort of anti adware
 

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.660
because it's it's sort of anti adware
and he you know sort of virus checking

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:47.670
and he you know sort of virus checking
 

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:48.860
and he you know sort of virus checking
sort of thing and generally we have

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:48.870
sort of thing and generally we have
 

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:50.780
sort of thing and generally we have
pretty short shrift for sort of

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:50.790
pretty short shrift for sort of
 

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:53.450
pretty short shrift for sort of
antivirus software because they're

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:53.460
antivirus software because they're
 

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.340
antivirus software because they're
pretty much all pointless and don't do

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:55.350
pretty much all pointless and don't do
 

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:58.280
pretty much all pointless and don't do
anything this one I don't have any of

00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:58.290
anything this one I don't have any of
 

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:00.409
anything this one I don't have any of
these apps installed which would use

00:25:00.409 --> 00:25:00.419

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:04.020
this so if I hit scan now it scans and
 

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:05.990
this so if I hit scan now it scans and
what what it's doing while it scans is

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000
what what it's doing while it scans is
 

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.780

not clear to me hasn't found any adware

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:08.790
not clear to me hasn't found any adware
 

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:11.870
not clear to me hasn't found any adware
which is nice but again it's all right

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880
which is nice but again it's all right
 

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:14.600

have no idea whether it was useful or

00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679
have no idea whether it was useful or
 

00:25:19.679 --> 00:25:24.110

not so yeah so it's it's interesting i'm

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.120
not so yeah so it's it's interesting i'm
 

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.210
not so yeah so it's it's interesting i'm
intrigued by the notion and certainly i

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:26.220
intrigued by the notion and certainly i
 

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:30.799

am a i'm not a fan of the of the sort of

techniques which this app is trying to

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:32.610
techniques which this app is trying to
 

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:34.909
techniques which this app is trying to
combat so on that level i think that's

00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919
combat so on that level i think that's
 

00:25:34.919 --> 00:25:37.100
combat so on that level i think that's
that's fair enough we look at the app

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:37.110
that's fair enough we look at the app
 

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:38.750
that's fair enough we look at the app
itself from a UI perspective it's kind

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760
itself from a UI perspective it's kind
 

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.720

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:39.150
thing right now yeah so I can this is
 

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:42.110
thing right now yeah so I can this is
this is not my phone so I can it's real

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120
this is not my phone so I can it's real

time protection so presumably at this

00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919
time protection so presumably at this
 

00:27:43.919 --> 00:27:45.530
time protection so presumably at this
point it's going to check for

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:45.540
point it's going to check for
 

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.180
point it's going to check for
notifications to see whether something

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:47.190
notifications to see whether something
 

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:49.669
notifications to see whether something
is being displayed by a dodgy as it pop

00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679
is being displayed by a dodgy as it pop
 

00:27:49.679 --> 00:27:52.299
is being displayed by a dodgy as it pop
has anyone pop up a notification so I

00:27:52.299 --> 00:27:52.309
has anyone pop up a notification so I
 

00:27:52.309 --> 00:27:55.159
has anyone pop up a notification so I
know it doesn't okay which is okay so

00:27:55.159 --> 00:27:55.169
know it doesn't okay which is okay so
 

00:27:55.169 --> 00:27:57.140
know it doesn't okay which is okay so
this is a good point so it may seem

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:57.150
this is a good point so it may seem
 

00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:59.030
this is a good point so it may seem
counterproductive for an app which is

00:27:59.030 --> 00:27:59.040
counterproductive for an app which is
 

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.970
counterproductive for an app which is

stuff and then you can go through and
 

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:01.030
stuff and then you can go through and
start the ones to know this is one

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:01.040
start the ones to know this is one
 

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:03.240
start the ones to know this is one
interesting thing in terms of usability

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:03.250
interesting thing in terms of usability
 

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:06.430
interesting thing in terms of usability
so starring these things is actually

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:06.440
so starring these things is actually
 

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.220
so starring these things is actually
modifying my UI so if I start I start

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:09.230
modifying my UI so if I start I start
 

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:12.010
modifying my UI so if I start I start
try to start last one that's sort of

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:12.020
try to start last one that's sort of
 

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:14.530
try to start last one that's sort of
disrupt low exactly suddenly like you

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:14.540
disrupt low exactly suddenly like you
 

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.450
disrupt low exactly suddenly like you
know if I go through the third one here

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:16.460
know if I go through the third one here
 

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:18.580
know if I go through the third one here
and then suddenly yeah where I moves to

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:18.590
and then suddenly yeah where I moves to
 

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:20.200
and then suddenly yeah where I moves to
the top and and you kind of lose your

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:20.210
the top and and you kind of lose your
 

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:21.280
the top and and you kind of lose your
way and if I just want I just want to

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:21.290
way and if I just want I just want to
 

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:24.580
way and if I just want I just want to
take the first three and then things are

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:24.590
take the first three and then things are
 

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:26.290
take the first three and then things are
just moving away so that's a very good

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:26.300
just moving away so that's a very good
 

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:28.300
just moving away so that's a very good
observation yeah I see what you see

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:28.310
observation yeah I see what you see
 

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:29.560
observation yeah I see what you see
where you're going with this and it

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:29.570
where you're going with this and it
 

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:31.450
where you're going with this and it
certainly makes sense to try and move

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:31.460
certainly makes sense to try and move
 

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:33.220
certainly makes sense to try and move
the favorites to the top for having a

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:33.230
the favorites to the top for having a
 

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:35.620
the favorites to the top for having a
sort of a dynamic uy like that is a

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:35.630
sort of a dynamic uy like that is a
 

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:39.040
sort of a dynamic uy like that is a
little bit confusing now I actually have

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:39.050
little bit confusing now I actually have
 

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:41.290
little bit confusing now I actually have
a really great solution for this because

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:41.300
a really great solution for this because
 

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:42.550
a really great solution for this because
usually I would suggest that you should

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:42.560
usually I would suggest that you should
 

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:46.660
usually I would suggest that you should
put it in in the navigation Dorrit items

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:46.670
put it in in the navigation Dorrit items
 

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:47.690
put it in in the navigation Dorrit items
yeah

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:47.700
yeah
 

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:48.860
yeah
but you know they've already they're

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:48.870
but you know they've already they're
 

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:50.480
but you know they've already they're
already using this for a sort of

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:50.490
already using this for a sort of
 

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:53.450
already using this for a sort of
categories so that trumpeting your

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:53.460
categories so that trumpeting your
 

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:56.139
categories so that trumpeting your
backpack on the table sorry mic pack

00:32:56.139 --> 00:32:56.149
backpack on the table sorry mic pack
 

00:32:56.149 --> 00:33:02.120
backpack on the table sorry mic pack
yeah no no Mike Oh getting a ton of it

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:02.130
yeah no no Mike Oh getting a ton of it
 

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:04.250
yeah no no Mike Oh getting a ton of it
appears no interference that's

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:04.260
appears no interference that's
 

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:07.730
appears no interference that's
unfortunate sorry everyone um you won't

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:07.740
unfortunate sorry everyone um you won't
 

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:08.750
unfortunate sorry everyone um you won't
have to put up with us for much longer

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:08.760
have to put up with us for much longer
 

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.269
have to put up with us for much longer
um so yeah what I would what I would

00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279
um so yeah what I would what I would
 

00:33:11.279 --> 00:33:13.460
um so yeah what I would what I would
suggest is maybe if you change this into

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:13.470
suggest is maybe if you change this into
 

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:15.919
suggest is maybe if you change this into
a split action bar so that you have your

00:33:15.919 --> 00:33:15.929
a split action bar so that you have your
 

00:33:15.929 --> 00:33:17.240
a split action bar so that you have your
actions along the bottom then you could

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:17.250
actions along the bottom then you could
 

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:19.639
actions along the bottom then you could
probably have another another kind of

00:33:19.639 --> 00:33:19.649
probably have another another kind of
 

00:33:19.649 --> 00:33:22.460
probably have another another kind of
navigation along the top now that might

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:22.470
navigation along the top now that might
 

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:24.860
navigation along the top now that might
be something to look into because you

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:24.870
be something to look into because you
 

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:26.810
be something to look into because you
basically you want to be able to you

00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:26.820
basically you want to be able to you
 

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:29.500
basically you want to be able to you
know have that have those stars

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:29.510
know have that have those stars
 

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:31.310
know have that have those stars
separately but without having them

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320
separately but without having them
 

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:34.850
separately but without having them
pushed to the top yeah i'm not sure that

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:34.860
pushed to the top yeah i'm not sure that
 

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:35.990
pushed to the top yeah i'm not sure that
i have a great solution to that maybe

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000
i have a great solution to that maybe
 

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.180
i have a great solution to that maybe
that's something that the Roman can can

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:38.190
that's something that the Roman can can
 

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:40.580
that's something that the Roman can can
suggest or even some of the people

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:40.590
suggest or even some of the people
 

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:41.690
suggest or even some of the people
watching if you want to make suggestions

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:41.700
watching if you want to make suggestions
 

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:43.610
watching if you want to make suggestions
into the G+ stream that would be

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:43.620
into the G+ stream that would be
 

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:46.159
into the G+ stream that would be
interesting but yeah for me that's a

00:33:46.159 --> 00:33:46.169
interesting but yeah for me that's a
 

00:33:46.169 --> 00:33:47.870
interesting but yeah for me that's a
little bit disconcerting having them

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880
little bit disconcerting having them
 

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.299
little bit disconcerting having them
jump around like that the app itself is

00:33:50.299 --> 00:33:50.309
jump around like that the app itself is
 

00:33:50.309 --> 00:33:53.060
jump around like that the app itself is
nice and fast responsive everything else

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:53.070
nice and fast responsive everything else
 

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:55.129
nice and fast responsive everything else
do you have a quick look at Alinea on

00:33:55.129 --> 00:33:55.139
do you have a quick look at Alinea on
 

00:33:55.139 --> 00:33:57.230
do you have a quick look at Alinea on
the tablet yeah let's have a look at the

00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:57.240
the tablet yeah let's have a look at the
 

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.450
the tablet yeah let's have a look at the
tablet so I think Fred's just starting

00:33:59.450 --> 00:33:59.460
tablet so I think Fred's just starting
 

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:02.529
tablet so I think Fred's just starting
here so I just went through the setup so

00:34:02.529 --> 00:34:02.539
here so I just went through the setup so
 

00:34:02.539 --> 00:34:06.669
here so I just went through the setup so
well so it's a very nice UI with a

00:34:06.669 --> 00:34:06.679
well so it's a very nice UI with a
 

00:34:06.679 --> 00:34:09.889
well so it's a very nice UI with a
fragments on the left and one on the

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:09.899
fragments on the left and one on the
 

00:34:09.899 --> 00:34:12.230
fragments on the left and one on the
right with a with an action bar

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240
right with a with an action bar
 

00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:14.450
right with a with an action bar
basically in terms of functionality is

00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:14.460
basically in terms of functionality is
 

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:16.460
basically in terms of functionality is
the same as what we just saw they've got

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:16.470
the same as what we just saw they've got
 

00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:19.099
the same as what we just saw they've got
a bunch of sample credit card and

00:34:19.099 --> 00:34:19.109
a bunch of sample credit card and
 

00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:21.470
a bunch of sample credit card and
password informations seated already

00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480
password informations seated already
 

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:24.260
password informations seated already
with e with yet when it comes in lets

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:24.270
with e with yet when it comes in lets
 

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:27.829
with e with yet when it comes in lets
try to have a look at the the behavior

00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839
try to have a look at the the behavior
 

00:34:27.839 --> 00:34:29.690
try to have a look at the the behavior
when somebody tries to star something

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:29.700
when somebody tries to star something
 

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.879
when somebody tries to star something
started okay same behaviors interesting

00:34:31.879 --> 00:34:31.889
started okay same behaviors interesting
 

00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:35.349
started okay same behaviors interesting
popped to the top so maybe we can

00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:35.359
popped to the top so maybe we can
 

00:34:35.359 --> 00:34:38.300
popped to the top so maybe we can
potentially you know on the UI of a

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:38.310
potentially you know on the UI of a
 

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:40.790
potentially you know on the UI of a
tablet you can fit more items here

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800
tablet you can fit more items here
 

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.500
tablet you can fit more items here
because that's just more in real estate

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:42.510
because that's just more in real estate
 

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:44.149
because that's just more in real estate
well in the in fact you're here on the

00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159
well in the in fact you're here on the
 

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:47.839
well in the in fact you're here on the
tablet they they're using the categories

00:34:47.839 --> 00:34:47.849
tablet they they're using the categories
 

00:34:47.849 --> 00:34:49.040
tablet they they're using the categories
are all listed here so they're not using

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:49.050
are all listed here so they're not using
 

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:50.750
are all listed here so they're not using
any top level navigation so you could

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:50.760
any top level navigation so you could
 

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.990
any top level navigation so you could
have that as a top-level tab between

00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:53.000
have that as a top-level tab between
 

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.409
have that as a top-level tab between
naw start pretty easily if we switch

00:34:56.409 --> 00:34:56.419
naw start pretty easily if we switch
 

00:34:56.419 --> 00:34:58.150
naw start pretty easily if we switch
back to the tablet sorry to the phone I

00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.160
back to the tablet sorry to the phone I
 

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.190
back to the tablet sorry to the phone I
just want to demonstrate at the

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:00.200
just want to demonstrate at the
 

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.410
just want to demonstrate at the
beginning it sort of gives you this this

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:02.420
beginning it sort of gives you this this
 

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:04.720
beginning it sort of gives you this this
intro telling you what the app does in

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:04.730
intro telling you what the app does in
 

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:07.090
intro telling you what the app does in
sort of a wizard and it goes through and

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:07.100
sort of a wizard and it goes through and
 

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:08.980
sort of a wizard and it goes through and
tells you exactly how your passwords

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:08.990
tells you exactly how your passwords
 

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:10.000
tells you exactly how your passwords
protected and all that sort of stuff

protected and all that sort of stuff
 

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:12.610
protected and all that sort of stuff
which i think is quite nice so it gives

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:12.620
which i think is quite nice so it gives
 

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.040
which i think is quite nice so it gives
you that on that intro I mean one of the

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:15.050
you that on that intro I mean one of the
 

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:16.300
you that on that intro I mean one of the
things I really like about this half a

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:16.310
things I really like about this half a
 

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:17.710
things I really like about this half a
minute again it's pretty straightforward

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:17.720
minute again it's pretty straightforward
 

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.180
minute again it's pretty straightforward
it's something which has been done a lot

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:19.190
it's something which has been done a lot
 

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:22.270
it's something which has been done a lot
of times it looks nice and I think one

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:22.280
of times it looks nice and I think one
 

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:23.590
of times it looks nice and I think one
of the keys for me is that as you're

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:23.600
of the keys for me is that as you're
 

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:27.250
of the keys for me is that as you're
going through it explains everything so

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:27.260
going through it explains everything so
 

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:28.600
