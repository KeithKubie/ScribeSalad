Speaker 1:          00:01          So, um, we just got to move on now and follow up on what we talked about last time, which is the seven fold permutation is as kind of intimidating, um, but it's actually what we'll be talking about in the fall class that was devoted to for whom devout hose. Um, and last time we talked a lot about the voluntary versus involuntary association, including, um, the idea of the involuntary foreigners, right? That both Americans and the Spanish actually, um, can be involuntary foreigners, the Americans in the simple fact that they don't have perfect command of the language and also that they are recognizable as far and as, as outsiders in the community. But the Spanish can also be outsiders in their own community, uh, because of two things because of the print illiteracy and because of the 10 of the logical, uh, illiteracy. So in those two ways, um, they are both stuck with a kind of voluntary association.

Speaker 1:          01:03          Um, today we'll move on to the next, uh, way to configure, um, the contents of for whom the bell tolls. And, um, I'd like to think of it as a very sustained structure. Hemingway, um, is, uh, uh, a writer who actually, um, keeps, not only starts out with a pattern, but kids elaborating on that pattern. So in many ways it really is a kind of a musical structure, FEMA and very Asian, um, and the paradigm of distant home versus onsite environment that actually is a theme and variation almost out the entire for whom the bell tolls, um, and plugged into that is a kind of play between the comic and the tragic. Uh, but really the, the main, the dominant theme today would be the relation between distant homes and onsite environment. Um, so I've seven candidates for distant homes. One is, um, in Paris, which is very odd because you know, already where in the foreign countries to American readers, um, Spain, uh, but there's yet another foreign country of France and especially Paris, uh, which makes a cameo appearance.

Speaker 1:          02:17          Um, and then they have five locations, we'll spatial locations and 10 fro locations in the United States that are distant homes for Robert Jordan. So we'll talk about why each of them is involved. Um, and relation betrayal, that distant home and the immediate is Spanish setting. But first of all, Perez, um, Paris comes up, um, in the context of Robert Drinking the abstinence that he carries with him. Um, and right before that he's actually asked for wine and there's not a lot is one left. So Maria wants to give him one. The public says there's not much left, so he doesn't get to have to unwind from the, from the, just the, from the logos. Um, and instead he pulls out this bottle of absence. Um, and nobody there has seen this. Um, so he tells them that this is Madison and um, the Gypsy state wants to tase where there's medicine tastes like Robert Jordan pushed the cup to what him, it was milky yellow now with the water.

Speaker 1:          03:19          And he hoped that Gypsy would not take more than a swallow. And this was very little of it left. And one cup of it took the place of the evening papers of all the old evenings in cafes of all IHG has not trays that would be in bloom now in this month of the gray slow horses of the outer boulevards of bookshops, of chaos and of galleries of the pop here of the stat about the stock buffalo of the beauty Shamone of the guaranty trust company. And again, there was a day or four years, oh hotel and being able to read and relaxed in the evening of all the things they enjoy it and forgotten. And that came back to him when he tasted that peg, that her tone now main brain warming, stomach warming, idea changing liquid alchemy. This is as beautiful praise on to Paris as I've seen.

Speaker 1:          04:24          Um, but what is odd about this praise Song of Paris is that it actually is not pointing to all the monumental, um, tourists attractions of Paris, right? No Ivo Towel in there. I know off the tree on, um, instead it is the chestnut trees, actually the horse chestnuts in this picture. Um, but chestnut trees all from Harris v very common site. Um, kiosk, very, very common site. Um, hot most who he is is not really, it's actually kind of, um, out of the way and it's not, it's not very spectacular. It's just a park. Um, and then this stat buffalo, actually, I've never, I don't eat, I have to look it up. You might not even be there. Um, it's a cycling tracks. Um, and then the pop, the abuse, um, it's also not mean it's a nice pop, but I don't think it's that famous. Um, is more of a kind of a neighborhood park.

Speaker 1:          05:23          It's on the hill. So are kind of this Hillary structure. This is the Butte that gives the pop the name. Um, and that year they elicit is the, uh, island in the middle of the sand. Um, it's very beautiful place. But once again, this is a neighborhood rather than, you know, kind of major tourist attraction. Although the, um, the Notredam Cathedral, um, is there, um, and finally, uh, the hotel for you, once again, it's a, you know, as a legend. Um, but there's also a place that you would just walk by every day without noticing it. And that's really the main point is that all those names, um, this, I don't even think it is Hemingway's name dropping because those names as we are not rex recognizable to most of us. Those are just a neighborhood features, a logo features of one particular various Paris neighborhoods. Um, and those are the things that people would walk by every day and just take them for granted.

Speaker 1:          06:25          And that is really what Harris means. Uh, for Hemingway, he did spend, well for him. I learned also for Robert Jordan. Anyway, this spent several years in Paris. He wrote about it, um, in a movable feast. Uh, so, and he, he wrote very well in Paris. He said he could have stay right about Michigan best when he was in Paris. He said that in the movable fees. Um, so it, it was Hemingway's home. Um, in a sense that is a place where a writer could write. And I think that there really is no better definition of whom home is that as a place where you can work with ourselves consciousness where you have a work routine, um, and you can count on being able to produce something every day. That's for me, that's also actually my, my own definition of home. Um, so I'm in, so it's kind of a minor variation on, on the Hemingways can total obsession with writing.

Speaker 1:          07:26          Um, but, um, so it just, you don't have to think about it. It's just there every day and you can just do the same thing every day. Um, so that is the, it's the security. Um, and the every day knows our Paris that is contrasted with the, um, onsite environment, which is very violent, unpredictable where he's so obviously a foreigner, even though Hemingway was so far in, uh, in Paris, um, the fact that he was able to write so well in Paris and that, that as they sue the foreigners with the racket, um, by his very, um, productive relation to his own craft, um, here, um, this in Spain's a totally different relations. So we'll look at what comes after that invocation in his own mind of Paris that is brought on by the absence. Um, the Gypsy may the face and handed the cup back is smells of banners, but it's bitter as gall.

Speaker 1:          08:29          He said it is better to be safe than have that medicine. That's the wormwood probably told until them in this through real absent there is wormwood is supposed to rot your brain out. But I don't believe it. It only changes the ideas. You should pour water in to it. Very slowly. A few drops at a time. But I brought it into the water, whether you saying hello, said angrily, feeling the mockery, explaining the Madison rubbish and told him in Greenland, I've bought it in Madrid. It was the last bottle and it's lasted me three weeks. He took a big swallow of it and felt it coasting over his tone and delicate and the Stesha in looked at Pablo and grinned again. So we've seen how aggressive the low hosts can be when it comes to hopping on Kashkin. Right. And you know, there's four other, just like Robin ran name debt.

Speaker 1:          09:31          Um, Ooh, what's the explosive, um, the aggressions on the logos, um, is very well matched by when I would say is to sue the good natured aggression. But none the less aggression on the part of Robert. Um, these people know nothing about Paris then never have been outside of Spain. Um, they've never been able to have the local community. Um, so it seems that some of them, many of them have never been to Madrid even, ah, because these are the local good drillers. They have, you know, very much these, they put in their own small community. Um, so even the drip is in many ways a foreign country to them. And Rather John in the American, there was Perez, he knows the capital of Spain. He knows this liquor they're never tasted, and he's fooling them into thinking that this medicine, um, and his mother, the last bottle of absence and Madrid.

Speaker 1:          10:34          Um, so all of this, just like the print illiteracy, um, the, he comes apart, he just discovers without meaning to, um, this is actively highlighting the fact that he is much more a man of the world than they are. And there's no competition, right? I mean, this is a very well travel man just by the nature of what he's doing is wild travel. Um, and these people are completely rooted in their own environment. Although I should say that it is an entirely Alton question by the Anna's novel, um, which is the better fair whether it is the weld travel person who has a better future or whether it's actually people who are rooted in the environments who have a better future. I think it's very much an open question. Um, but by the end as an Avo at this moment though, this is the moment when, uh, Robert has his law of victory over the locals are just able to show them all the things, highlight dramatized to them other things that he knows that they don't know.

Speaker 1:          11:40          Um, so the first location of a distant home has the effect actually, uh, bringing out an edge to say the least. And Pablo suddenly recognizes that, um, and edge attention between Robert and the locals who otherwise his comrades on the same side of the war. Um, it has a funny effect on both sides. It does something to Robert, it does something to the locos. Um, and that's just not even in America. That's, you know, Paris is really doesn't have any kind of special connotation, I don't think, um, to, to the vocals in a sense that it, Robert is not really, you know, um, never consider Frenchmen. Um, but when it comes to the invocation of the United States is a different story. They all know that that's something that he has a relation to. Um, and the eye within the progression. Um, this is the kind of, we're starting out with the most benign, uh, most kind of, um, at least not completely, not an innocuous invocation of the United States and businesses.

Speaker 1:          12:49          Most Missoula Montana, where Robert Jordan it's from and where he's thinking that he would go back to after war and that maybe he'll take them rear, um, with him. Um, and this is actually a good moment to think about, you know, exactly the nature of that Romance Between Rama, Jordan and Maria. Why don't marry her sure that I will marry her. Then we'll be mister and missus Robert Jordan of Sun Valley, Idaho or Corpus Christi is taxes of Beautiful Montana. Spanish girls make wonderful wives. I've never had one. So I know, and when I get my job back at a university, she can be an instructor's wife. And when undergraduates who take Spanish four come into smoke pipes in the evening and have those feel valuable informal discussions about Queer Vedo Lope, Invega Geldof's and other always admirable debt, Maria can tell them about how some of the blue shirt, the crusaders for the true faith set on her head while others twisted her arms and put the skirts up and stuffed it in her mouth.

Speaker 1:          13:58          Um, it, I began by saying that this is relatively high, but if in fact there's no such thing as benign evocation of a distant home in Hemingway, it might start out, you know, even from beginning to end. Is there's something very funny about the tone of that invocation. Um, the first poll of it is, it's just a kind of, um, the first little bit of that about going back to all the cities, you know, the kind of the heartland of America. Um, and then the particular job that he had, he was a professor at a university. I'm teaching Spanish. Um, and the kind of the joke about, you know, people coming in, informal discussions best, I would say that actually it's kind of a benign or in the sense that, um, we all tend to be ironic about things actually that we are quite attached to.

Speaker 1:          14:51          I know this, yesterday I was talking about a riot as I love, um, who writes about food and I said, you know, she's corners just two books out, one suit. And I said that she cornered the market on foot writing. It wasn't as long and they really looked at me. Um, but I mean actually love this author. Um, but that's just my way, you know, of, of, of not being, being too attached and you know, showing some critical distance. Um, so the first part of their, um, of, of, of that is just the kinds of the typical professional RNA. Um, you know, it was something that you really actually do want to go back to and, and, and w, you know, have some yearning for. Um, but in the midst of that, um, the, um, the Robert just can't stop himself from importing something else to that otherwise benign environment.

Speaker 1:          15:49          And so we sort of know ahead of time that Maria was once rate with no idea when that happened. Um, is it, this is Hemingway's way of telling the story. I'm giving this and he says of the story, uh, one at a time. So this particular input Asian, um, of something that happens in Spain into an otherwise innocent American environment has to weigh not only of darkening the textures of that otherwise innocent college town, um, but also completely changes his relation to the local setting. Um, is not even just a place where he's having trouble with Paolo. That's the least of the problem. Um, they are much more deep rooted problems. Um, so this is another spin on the idea of being rooted in your community. Um, usually when we think of being rooted in our community, uh, we just think of, you know, being, having stayed there for a long time, maybe having been there for generations, uh, or at least within the life of a person many, many years.

Speaker 1:          17:04          Um, and usually is a good thing. But this, another way in which being rooted in your environment, um, means that all the dark episodes from the past are visited upon you all. A few other oh angers, oh hatreds, um, are constantly being reactivated sometimes just in memory and sometimes reenacted in the bodies of people who are otherwise young and is very young girl. Um, but was being visited upon her is not personal. It really has nothing to do with her, is not, they don't mean to write Maria, they made raping, verve, um, as a symbol or something else. So this is the other, this is hazard of, um, spending all your life and being rooted in one particular community. Um, is that ancient angers, um, can, uh, can be inherited by, by people who are relatively young. So, um, this, I will say this is the basic dynamics of the relation between the United States and Spain, is that there's a kind of a spill over in both directions, um, something very violence spilling over into the American context.

Speaker 1:          18:20          Um, and then we'll see another way in which the violence of the American context will spill over into the Spanish setting. Um, and um, this is Ashley. This is still relatively benign instance. Um, but again, something just not quite right. Um, yes. And talking about Gypsies and I was just say that the Hemingway actually is very, um, um, uh, kind of surprisingly, I'm fascinated about the problem of the Gypsy even as they're now called Roma and is a huge problem in the sense that the year that European Union is recognizing the fact that the role most actually have always been oppressed by various national government. And so it's a quite a big issue in Europe. Um, and Hemingway back in the, in the, when he was writing about Spanish or war ready seem to have caught on? Um, yes. And Samuel said the Gypsies belief the bearer to be a brother of man.

Speaker 1:          19:22          So also believe the Indians in America, Robert Jordan said, and where they kill a bear, they apologized to him and asked his part. And do you have any gypsy blood? No, but I seen much of them and clearly seems to movement more. They are many in the hills to them. It is not as sin to kill outside the tribe. They deny this. But it is true like the Moore's. Okay. So it is not as sin to kill outside tribe usually. I mean, if most of us, I think no, the in gelatin is against killing period. Right? So there's just no qualifying, no qualify after that. But according to the Samo, it is completely okay for the Gypsies to kill anyone outside of the immediate tribe. So you know, is a straight, um, ethnic divide within your own tribe. You don't kill anyone or you don't cure anyone unless you are under serious [inaudible] outside of your tribe, you're free to kill anyone.

Speaker 1:          20:25          So that's of been crowd or charge two level, um, against the Gypsies. But what is weird is that rather than comes up with this and Knology is then to Gypsies. I just liked the morals. Okay. So this might not make any sense to us right now, but it turns out that this is actually one of aspects of the deep cultural groups in Spain. Um, this is a beautiful, um, instance of the mortgage architecture in Spain. You guys know that the Moore's, um, from Africa, from North Africa, um, Ashley were the rulers in Spain for 800 years. It was in 1492 the same year that Columbus discover the new world. It was the same year that the Moore's were expelled from Spain along with Jews. The more than the Jews were the two persecuted ethnic groups in Spain. Um, and so, uh, what, what Isabella of Castille, um, expelled the, the, the, the from Granada, uh, other, um, there was a, uh, policy, uh, throughout Spain, um, to try to erase, um, Islamic book learning.

Speaker 1:          21:46          Um, Carter above was a huge, uh, centered learning throughout the Middle Ages. Um, and people from all over Europe. We'd go the call over to study Arabic science was very, very advanced, Arabic, more edge architecture was beautiful. Um, Coloma had bath houses, more public baths than any other city in Europe. It was basically a beacon of enlightenment in Spain, in, in all of Europe. Um, and when they were destroyed by the Catholic, um, forces by the Catholic monarchs, um, there was a much of an attempt to try to erase all of that wasn't as successful. So we still today if we were to go to quarterback or two later, we're still seeing lots of borage architecture. So there's one kind of, um, saw point in Spanish history is that they really have done this to the very glorious, that legislation. Um, but there's another sore point that is more immediate to the Spanish civil war.

Speaker 1:          22:49          And this is reported by the American poet most and he was who was there along with Hemingway. Um, and lesson hills was really struck by the presence of the Morris in the Spanish civil war. Um, so he wrote several pieces about the Moore's outs, sometimes seeing them in the hospitals and actually having this very uneasy kinship between himself. And the more, so this is, uh, from his essay general Franco's Morris to Morris truths were colonial crimes. Grips on man from the Moroccan, the villages and ties into the army by offers was theme to them. Very good pay. Franco's personal body guard consisted of war as soldiers, tall picture as fellows and flowing ropes and winding turbans before I left home American papers like Harry photographs of turban or hammered and troops marching in the streets of Bogos. They'll am locker and then, you know, then press dispatched from gelato that summer and said Arabs having crossing this trace that you brought Gibraltar from Spanish Morocco to Algiers theorists and a locker at a rate of 300, 400 a day.

Speaker 1:          24:06          General Franco intends to mass 50,000 new aerators in Spain. So given the past history, given the, an easy relation between the Spanish, it's the Spanish and, and more Asian population of North Africa for General Franco Ashley to use the Morris trips as very active combat unit against the Spanish Republican side that is about the worst he could have done was successful. Actually, you know, he won the war. Um, but it was about was in terms of being Tom Death, he was probably about as tone deaf as anyone could be one at the end. Um, but, um, that's what happened. And so they were in the loss and loss of pink lots and lots of pictures of um, the worst crossing over from Africa, just paying a five fight the Spanish republic here, here's a mortgage bodyguards and um, the engage in then engage in more active combat. Um, so to bring up two more years, um, I don't even know if it's, you know, what motivates, um, Robert to make that analogy between the GPS and invoice, it couldn't really be, um, just blinders or just carelessness.

Speaker 1:          25:32          I think there's some intentionality in there, but it's hard to know why he would want to bring up this very, very sensitive issue for the Spanish. Um, so I think that, um, or we can say is that it seems that it's very easy, um, for an involuntary, for other, um, to say something that is wounding to locals maybe without intending it to have the extent of the in south the extended injury. Um, that is actually the actual outcome of saying something like that. Um, Robert probably had no idea that managing them wars with create those kinds of connotations. Um, those kinds of, um, just just as you know, is um, on the part of this vantage hearers, but there's, um, what he's doing. So once again, it kind of spilling over thinking about native Americans with their own very uneasy history in the United States. Think about the roof Americans thinking about Gypsy's in Europe and thinking about the Moore's three ethnic groups, all with uneasy histories behind them.

Speaker 1:          26:43          And it is the invocation of all three of them in the same breath that makes that particular exchange especially, um, uncomfortable. Um, if not downright hurtful, but, um, let's just look at them more serious, instant, um, incidence of, of, of this kind of distant home being the kind of irritation, um, uh, to, to the immediate environment. Um, so also I'll know where Robert Johnson and they start talking about lynching in Ohio. Um, this is completely uncalled for. This is in the context of talking about the execution of the fascist. And out of the blue, Robert just mentioned this lynching that he was the witness to, um, and about the trunk and there's on, they've had them done in it. So people in general, um, it is so rubbish on is that, um, when I was seven years old and going with my mother to attend a wedding in the state of Ohio at which I was to be the boy of a Po boy and girl who carry flowers.

Speaker 1:          27:52          Did you do that? That Maria, how nice. In this town and Negro was hand to a lamppost and they been burned. It was an arc light, a light which lower from the post to the pavement. And he was hoisted first by the mechanism, which was used to hoist the arc light. But this broke, this is a bizarre, um, description of lynching to say the least is stuck in the middle of this long story about execution of the fascist. And not only that, but it seems that much of the focus is on the mechanism was hoisting this person up who's about to be, um, and on how unreliable this mechanism is, um, that it adds to it bricks ones. And then he was asked to be done over again. So, um, what we can say is that this kind of slightly out of Focus, um, uh, nature, uh, to the invocation of the United States, um, the proper focus, really odd to be on the act of lynching yourself.

Speaker 1:          29:03          Anyone telling the story it would have been on the APP of lynching and instead it is our focus. So that's, it somehow is just focus on the mechanism of hoisting the person up. Um, and I think there's a kind of a deliberate, Lorraine is there suggest that this is really how the United States looks, um, to the Spanish logos that you know, they can get the focus right if some how off and that all focus is dramatized by Maria's response. We just kind of completely inappropriate shows the highest degree of ignorance. Um, well she doesn't know what's coming, but you know, just to say how nice. She has no idea. She's completely, all of it. Doesn't get any of it. Um, so the reference to the lynching, my seem out of the blue to us reading a forum to the belt hosts right now, but lynching actually was a big issue, um, all through the 1930 is um, even though the actual number of lynching had declined at that point, um, it was highlighted.

Speaker 1:          30:09          Um, it was brought to the public consciousness for a number of reasons. Um, one is, um, this very famous song and I think that you guys probably have heard Billie holiday, strange fruit, 1939. Um, it's a great collaboration between um, a black singer and actually the song writer, um, is um, with Jewish, um, April Mirror on the wall. So this is one of the first instances of a black Jewish collaboration with having in this class, like, um, a song, um, in the jazz repertoire. But these are the lyrics of strange food and you can see why it would that image with lead to those lyrics. Selling trees, Bayer strange fruit, blood on the leaves, blood at the rude black bodies swinging in the southern breeze, strange fruit hanging from the path of the trees. Pastoral scene of the gallon self, the bulging eyes and the twisting of the sentiment.

Speaker 1:          31:15          Nalliah is Sweden fresh than the southern smell burning flesh. Here is a fruit for Lacrosse to blog for the rain together for the winter stuff. Stop The Sun to rot from the tree to drop here is a strange and there's a crap, um, the lyrics than Billie holiday was the one who made the song famous, but really it was an Abl, mere Roho that, that made. The songs are such a great song. Um, and I think the power of the song religious comes from the contrast, the arch and the rhythm between the kind of cliche image and the south, you know, the past road south, um, the Madonna, Leah, the smell of the Magnolia. And then the smell of burning flesh is that alternate rhythm that creates, generates that peculiar power, this song. So that's partly why lynching a was such an issue on everyone's consciousness in the 30s.

Speaker 1:          32:14          Um, but there were also other issues and in fact, the song, um, it's a great song, but it's also slightly misleading in a sense that it's suggesting that's lynching was strictly a southern phenomenon, um, which actually wasn't the case. Um, and so all we have to do is to look at this New Yorker cover about March, 1919 38 for, I laid really very, very late for this to be on the New Yorkers cover. This raises, um, you know, just the northern population have been flabbergasted at how lazy and drunken blacks are, um, because they were migrating in large numbers to the north. So I'm relatively new phenomenon in the 20th century, actually. Was there, um, substantial number of lynchings, uh, both in the north east and also, um, in the Midwest. So this is a kind of very famous, um, lynching, double lynching, autonomous ship and Aaron Smith and Indiana in 1938.

Speaker 1:          33:20          So once again, very, very late for that. Um, and it's because of this, um, Verizon station or a lynching was in the north, um, that the Anaise ACPA, um, Ashley, um, had this, um, regular practice of just hanging up a flag in the New York City office announcing that the man was still lynch yesterday. Um, and that was also in the 1930s. Um, so it was something that was an ongoing problem, um, and have very much a kind of, um, uh, a hot button issue in the 1930s. So, um, as a consequence of that, there was an anti lynching bill. Those trying to make us wait, uh, through Congress and the Senate and it passed in the house. Um, but because of the filibuster filibusters buster Senate, it led to the withdrawal of the bill in February in 1938. Um, so, um, it, it, um, it was just something that just never went away.

Speaker 1:          34:25          I mean it was an unresolved issue, um, all the way through the 1930s. And so having, we actually was very much plugged into the politics of the United States when all of a sudden he would make Ramadan and suddenly make a reference to lynching. Um, but just to go back, you know, move away from that history of lynching in the United States back to his impact, um, on the Spanish environment. Um, the response rear and um, and, and, and pillar two lynching in another state is once again, very art. As I said, when they lifted the Negro up for the second time, my mother and pull me away from the window. So I saw no more children's that. But since I've had had experiences with demonstrate the drunkenness is the same in my country, it is ugly and brutal. You and too young as seven, Maria said you were too young for such things. I've never seen a negro except in a circus unless the mowers are Negros. Some of Negroes and some are not pillows that I can talk to. You have the morals.

Speaker 1:          35:34          This is mind boggling that this should be the response to lynching in the United States. Um, we can't even say that it would be reassuring to say that it's just cultural ignorance or the impossibility of cross cultural understanding that is resulting in the responses from Maria and polite. It would be nice to be able to just to say, you know, it's because they don't know anything about United States, but I don't even think that that is the case. Um, so I would invite you, actually, this is something to think about. You know, why the Spanish always have some weird, um, and that's putting it mildly. We're responses to violin to violence a United States period. Um, the response to this and never the right response is always so off focus that is, you know, it's not even the wrong response. It's just, it's just hard to believe that anyone would respond like that.

Speaker 1:          36:32          Um, so, um, but the, what we see right there, um, is that this, once again, we're in vocation of the Morris in conjunction. Um, with violence in the United States. So all we know is that when they try to make sense of something, they don't understand. When the Spanish try to make sense of something that we to the more than one. Um, and the ones who are the people who come to the mice. Um, so, but it's, is, is, is, is a moment when any kind of community in between Robert and Marie and color, any previous can chameleon between them is completely breaking down. Um, so I just want to, um, talk about another episode that has exactly the same kind of structure of incomprehension ignorance and income comprehension on the positive Spanish. Um, and this has to do with the Republican Party. You guys remember that? The leftist in Spain where the Republicans right there as they're defending the Spanish republic.

Speaker 1:          37:32          So to be Republican in Spain means that you are on the left. And this is the context for that conversation. My father was Republican Eyes Live, Maria Sat, it was for that, that they shot him. My father was also a Republican, always live. Also my grandfather Robert, is that in what country? The United States, they should them, the mother, the woman asked Paver, Maria said, the United States is the country of Republicans. They don't shoot you for being a Republican. They're all the same. It is a good thing to have a grandfather who was a republican. The woman said it shows a good blood. My grandfather was on the Republican National Committee, Robert Jordan said that impressed even Maria and it's my father's still active in the republic polo ass. No, he is. That can one asks how he died. He shot himself for avoiding being tortured. The woman asked yes, or I'll visualize them to avoid being tortured.

Speaker 1:          38:35          So this is where we get that mix of the comic and the tragic, it is a comedy of errors so far for a good part of that passage. It is accommodated of cross cultural era. Um, just not being able to wrap your mind around the fact that to be a Republican and now this is a very different thing being a Republican, um, in Spain. So just not being able to, you know, this is just a kind of a, that the permanent blind there is, um, in the mind of Maria and pillow. So if that was just the case and it wouldn't go no further, um, that would just be a kind of comic, uh, you know, kind of almost moment with common relieved, um, in phoned about hose. Um, but as is always the case with Hemingway in this particular novel to comics certainly morphs into something else without any warning.

Speaker 1:          39:36          So all of a sudden we get into detail about Raga Jordan's father shooting himself too for being tortured. And that can only have only one meaning for the Spanish. Um, it fits completely into the person who history of Maria, if it's completely, um, in two philosophy understanding of political history in Spain. Um, but right now we don't know why his father killed himself, uh, and what kind of torture he is talking about. So we have to wait a little longer to have that mystery clear up for us. Um, and to have that mystery clear up, we actually have to go through further into the past. So, um, I've been talking about this 10 homes in terms to some spatial locations, but this also a distant Tim fro home. Um, it turns out that the 19th century is also unnecessary home for Robert Jordan, especially the civil war.

Speaker 1:          40:33          It's almost the equivalent of Paris in terms of psych, psychological need for that home. Um, and it, it's not just any civil war but his grandfather civil war and this is his moment of homecoming. This is the home they would receive him and shelter him. Remember something concrete and practical. Remember grandfather's Sabre, Right and well oiled in a standard scabbard and grandfather show you how the blade had been thin from the many times it had been to the grinders. Remember grandfather's Smith and Wesson. It was the single action officers model when 32 caliber and there was no trigger. Got It. Had to softer, sweetest trigger for you have ever felt. And there was always, well oil and boy was clean, although the finish was all one off and the bright meadow of the barrel and the cylinder was one smooth from the letter of the host or, um, so this is like Hemingway's description of the trout fishing, um, in in our time, very, very clear the smoothness cleaners of their operation.

Speaker 1:          41:40          Um, but in this particular context, um, the smoothness and the cleaners and the one alumnis, uh, of that pistol suggest that this is a well used weapon. Uh, Robert Jordan [inaudible] grandfather was a hero of the civil war. Um, his favor had been to the grinders numerous times because it has been this, the provide had been so well used. So without saying anything, without using the word glory or heroic, any comparable adjective, um, Hemingway gives us the, um, the sense that the civil war was the heroic moment was the high point in the history of Robert's family. And it was very much vested in his grandfather. And at that point it has receded. It has to, it has to be received into the past is belongs to the 19th century. But Roger that wants to activate it over and over again bring it up to the 20th century because he needs that and we know why he needs to bring the 19th century back on the next page when we know what happens to that pistol.

Speaker 1:          42:53          Then after your father has shot himself with a pistol and you had come home from school and they had a funeral, Ricardo had returned it after the inquest thing. Bob, I guess you might want to keep the gun. Um, he climbed. Okay. I should just stop and clarify. That is something we'll be talking about. Um, Ashley, the narrative switches from second person Pronoun, rubber Jordan, interesting himself as to you. So that's you is rubber Jordan. And then it switches back to the person. He climbed out on a rock and leaned over and saw his face and there's still water and saw himself holding the gun and that he dropped it, holding it by the muscle. And so I'd go down making bubbles until it was just as big as a wash charm in the clear water. And then it was all the site. So this passage that comes just on the opposite page, um, from the previous evocation of the civil war weapons, the grandfather tells us exactly why the 19th century in the civil war is unnecessary emotional shelter for Robin.

Speaker 1:          44:05          He's just so ashamed of his father. Um, he wants to clean out that entire episode, drop it into the clear water so that it will be completely outside. Um, he can do that too. The pistol, he can do it to the actual history is that, but that's as close as he can get to wiping out that history. Um, and so in this moment, Ashley, uh, there is no Spanish environment that is invoked and I think that this is no mention of the immediate Spanish setting and I think that that is suggestive as well. Um, in the sense that really the homes for Robert, I think, um, and it's a very pessimistic reading of the novel. Uh, they basically just two homes. Robert. One is the Paris, um, of the, um, evening papers and the chestnut trees and out the other home for him is a home that never was a home that was in his lifetime, but the home that he can inherit vicariously through his grandfather. And that is the American civil war as his spiritual home, because this is the one place where he has affirmation of himself that he's not ashamed of himself, not ashamed of his family history. Um, and so those are impossible Homans for them at this spoon.
