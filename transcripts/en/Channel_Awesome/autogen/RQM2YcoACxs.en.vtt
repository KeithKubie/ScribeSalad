more thing about it uh but she just kind
 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.670 align:start position:0%
more thing about it uh but she just kind
of<00:07:18.000><c> moves</c><00:07:18.300><c> like</c><00:07:18.480><c> how</c><00:07:18.660><c> everyone</c><00:07:18.960><c> else</c><00:07:19.200><c> moves</c><00:07:19.530><c> it</c>

of moves like how everyone else moves it
 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.940 align:start position:0%
of moves like how everyone else moves it
and<00:07:19.800><c> I</c><00:07:19.830><c> think</c><00:07:20.300><c> what</c><00:07:21.300><c> real</c><00:07:22.170><c> one</c><00:07:22.470><c> of</c><00:07:22.620><c> the</c><00:07:22.710><c> things</c>

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:22.950 align:start position:0%
and I think what real one of the things
 

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.260 align:start position:0%
and I think what real one of the things
that<00:07:23.100><c> really</c><00:07:23.160><c> drew</c><00:07:23.280><c> me</c><00:07:23.430><c> to</c><00:07:23.580><c> the</c><00:07:23.760><c> other</c><00:07:23.880><c> films</c>

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:24.270 align:start position:0%
that really drew me to the other films
 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.580 align:start position:0%
that really drew me to the other films
is<00:07:24.450><c> that</c><00:07:24.600><c> even</c><00:07:24.840><c> though</c><00:07:24.960><c> again</c><00:07:25.110><c> they're</c><00:07:25.440><c> not</c>

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:25.590 align:start position:0%
is that even though again they're not
 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.980 align:start position:0%
is that even though again they're not
like<00:07:26.090><c> phenomenally</c><00:07:27.090><c> character</c><00:07:27.480><c> driven</c><00:07:27.810><c> but</c><00:07:27.930><c> I</c>

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:27.990 align:start position:0%
like phenomenally character driven but I
 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.510 align:start position:0%
like phenomenally character driven but I
mean<00:07:28.230><c> they're</c><00:07:28.410><c> that's</c><00:07:28.740><c> still</c><00:07:29.010><c> kind</c><00:07:29.280><c> of</c><00:07:29.400><c> the</c>

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
mean they're that's still kind of the
 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.220 align:start position:0%
mean they're that's still kind of the
focus<00:07:29.940><c> everyone</c><00:07:30.360><c> has</c><00:07:30.510><c> their</c><00:07:30.690><c> own</c><00:07:30.720><c> distinct</c>

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:31.230 align:start position:0%
focus everyone has their own distinct
 

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.470 align:start position:0%
focus everyone has their own distinct
identity<00:07:31.860><c> and</c><00:07:32.010><c> movement</c><00:07:32.430><c> and</c><00:07:32.610><c> it's</c><00:07:33.180><c> really</c>

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
identity and movement and it's really
 

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.570 align:start position:0%
identity and movement and it's really
all<00:07:33.690><c> blending</c><00:07:34.200><c> together</c><00:07:34.350><c> here</c><00:07:35.010><c> and</c><00:07:35.250><c> I</c><00:07:35.520><c> think</c>

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
all blending together here and I think
 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.790 align:start position:0%
all blending together here and I think
that's<00:07:36.080><c> surprisingly</c><00:07:37.080><c> what</c><00:07:37.320><c> made</c><00:07:37.470><c> a</c><00:07:37.500><c> lot</c><00:07:37.770><c> of</c>

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
that's surprisingly what made a lot of
 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.100 align:start position:0%
that's surprisingly what made a lot of
those<00:07:37.950><c> jokes</c><00:07:38.310><c> work</c><00:07:39.000><c> in</c><00:07:39.270><c> the</c><00:07:39.420><c> first</c><00:07:39.660><c> two</c><00:07:39.840><c> films</c>

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:40.110 align:start position:0%
those jokes work in the first two films
 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.410 align:start position:0%
those jokes work in the first two films
even<00:07:40.830><c> though</c><00:07:40.920><c> not</c><00:07:41.100><c> all</c><00:07:41.280><c> of</c><00:07:41.430><c> them</c><00:07:41.550><c> work</c><00:07:41.760><c> it's</c>

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
even though not all of them work it's
 

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
even though not all of them work it's
still<00:07:42.630><c> what</c><00:07:43.290><c> gave</c><00:07:43.470><c> it</c><00:07:43.500><c> its</c><00:07:43.770><c> charm</c><00:07:44.130><c> and</c><00:07:44.370><c> I</c><00:07:44.490><c> think</c>
