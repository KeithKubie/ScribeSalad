00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.560
PROFESSOR: All right, so lecture
10 was about two main things,

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.060
I guess.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.370
We had the conversion
from folding states

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.480
to folding motions,
talked briefly about that.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.050
And then the bulk
of the class was

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.450
about Kempe and Kempe's
universality theorem

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.980
and the beginning of linkages.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.480
So let's start with an open
problem about converting

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.960
folded states to
folding motions.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.390
This is a nice question.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.130
So suppose you have a sheet
of paper like this one,

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.970
but it has a hole in the middle.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.890
And then you
construct some folded

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.830
state of that piece of
paper with a hole in it.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.720
And now you'd like
to actually get there

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.190
by continuous folding motion.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.880
So the question is
why doesn't that work?

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.100
What we know is that the same
proof technique doesn't work.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.670
We don't necessarily know
that it's impossible.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.820
That would be a nice
problem to solve, actually.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.210
So what difference
does the hole make?

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.730
So this is the
method we saw before.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.560
You imagine having
some folded state, say,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.890
from a flat piece
of paper to a crane.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.900
You roll up that piece of
paper to a tiny triangle

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.120
that maps to a nice almost
flat portion of the crane.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:24.230
Then you basically play
that motion backwards,

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.760
but on the surface of the crane
instead of on the flat sheet.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.840
And that always works for
simple polygons, polygons

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.280
without holes.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.630
If you have a hole in here,
you could imagine just

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.520
filling the hole.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.330
That's what the
question suggested.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.440
Just fill the hole,
do this thing,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.490
and then remember that the
hole actually wasn't there.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.640
Erase it again.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.170
That should give you a motion.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.340
Erasing the hole is fine.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.180
The trouble is this part.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.760
So if I define a folded state
of a piece of paper with a hole,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.690
it doesn't tell you
where-- let's say

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.590
there's a little hole here--
this mapping won't tell you

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.919
where that hole goes in 3D.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.170
You have no idea.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.070
And in fact, it may
be impossible to map

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.230
the hole anywhere in this
folded state that's valid.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.460
When you tear a piece
of paper, new foldings

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.820
become possible that were
not otherwise possible.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.940
What's an example of that?

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.150
When I do a big tear
like this, now I

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.070
can pull these points
of paper apart.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.915
And it's impossible to
fill this hole in in 3D.

00:02:34.915 --> 00:02:36.540
It's possible to fill
the hole in here.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.280
It's just suturing.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.530
But when I separate
things, that means

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.430
the original sheet could
not fold into this state.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.180
So you get new folded
states when you have holes,

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.560
that you cannot just patch the
hole and hope to find a place

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.250
that it folds over here.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.070
There are other issues.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.060
You could maybe patch it in
with some stretchy material

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.950
or something.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.030
I have one example
in the notes where

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.950
you-- suppose you
have a tube of paper.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.560
So this is not a flat example,
but it's an interesting example

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.430
anyway.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:18.240
So let's say the outside
of this tube is purple,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.210
and the inside is white.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.580
And one thing you can do with
the tube is turn it inside out.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:32.290
So you can make the inside
purple and the outside white.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.570
So this is possible
with a tube of paper.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.450
If you imagine this
as being a hole

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.870
and the bottom side is also
being a hole-- both of these

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.410
are open right now--
then you could also

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.500
imagine filling them in and
getting a cube of paper.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.280
So in this case you'd get a
cube that's entirely purple.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.070
This would be bad, because a
cube cannot be turned inside

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.346
out without self intersection.

00:04:01.346 --> 00:04:02.720
So this is an
example where there

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.020
is a folding motion without
the holes filled in.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.950
There is not a folding motion
when you fill the holes in.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.570
So I don't know what that says
exactly about the problem,

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.820
but it's some intuition why
this is tricky business.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.850
That's for a
polyhedron, of course.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.870
If you're just trying to
take polygon with holes

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.560
and fill it in somehow, I
mean, maybe there's a way,

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.402
but certainly the obvious
way does not work.

00:04:23.402 --> 00:04:25.840
What else did have
in my notes here?

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.390
All right.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.660
Any questions about
that open problem?

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.620
Next question is about,
it's a neat idea.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.250
We talked about linkages that
have joints like this one where

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.500
you must stay connected.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:47.040
And then we briefly also talked
about a different kind of joint

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.920
where this vertex was pinned
right along another edge.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.730
And we showed you
could simulate that

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.170
by just making a zero
area triangle here.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.750
So you can force these
edges to come right

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.120
at this point of that bar.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.340
Well, different
idea is what if you

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.660
allow this point to be able
to slide along that bar?

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.220
Is that some new kind of
linkage that's more powerful

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.100
or something?

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.790
Turns out, no, it's
not more powerful.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.625
You can simulate that too.

00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:17.750
So I thought I'd show that.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:18.780
I had to think about it.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.250
It's kind of fun.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.250
This would have made a
good problem set problem,

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.040
but I decided to cover it.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:30.300
So remember our good friend
the Peaucellier linkage,

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:40.010
which looks like this.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.800
So these guys are equidistant,
and this is a rhombus.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.790
All the edge lengths are equal.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.870
Then this vertex lies
along a straight line.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.550
And it has a limit.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.100
Let's say it can go
this high and this low,

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.840
something like that.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.030
We've seen that in
animation before.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:10.270
So what I'm going to do is
imagine this as being my bar,

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.040
and this as my flexible point
that can move along that bar.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.900
So here's the existing bar.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.070
And if I want to add a point
that can' slide along the bar,

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.800
I'm just going to attach this
construction to this bar,

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.970
and this is where things
get a little bit messy.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.374
These are the guys that are
normally rigidly on the ground,

00:06:34.374 --> 00:06:36.040
but instead of them
being on the ground,

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.560
I'm going to attach them here.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.490
So I'm going to attach this
to that, this to that, this

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.251
to that, this to that.

00:06:45.251 --> 00:06:46.750
And because there's
two connections,

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.583
this is at the intersection
of two-- I mean,

00:06:48.583 --> 00:06:49.890
this is a rigid triangle.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.710
So these guys
can't move anymore.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.720
But, well, they move
relative to this edge.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.050
So however this edge
moves in the plane

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.190
or in space, whatever, I
guess in the plane here,

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.764
this guy will be forced
to track along the bar.

00:07:03.764 --> 00:07:06.180
So if you don't worry about
intersections, which we're not

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.951
in this lecture,
this construction

00:07:08.951 --> 00:07:10.450
you could attach
to any bar and make

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.150
a point that can
slide along the bar.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.520
Kind of fun.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.700
So you see the power of
Peaucellier linkages.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.740
You can do all sorts of fun
constructions like this.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.111
You could make it just
occupy a little portion

00:07:22.111 --> 00:07:23.360
of the bar, whatever you want.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.770
Just build the appropriate
Peaucellier linkage.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.990
OK.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.470
So we're into linkages.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:35.570
Next we're into Kempe's
universality theorem, or sort

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.240
of Kempe's universality
theorem that he almost proved.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.620
So one question just
to review, there

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.820
is this parallelogram
and contra parallelogram.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.528
Pretty much all of
his construction other

00:07:45.528 --> 00:07:50.020
than Peaucellier at the end
are a mix of these two gadgets.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.840
And there's this issue that you
could flip one into the other.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.390
Here we had, this was
the translator gadget.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:59.430
If you have two parallelograms,
you can collapse one of them,

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:03.340
say, and then flip it out to
be a contra parallelogram.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.390
If you don't do any
bracing, this can happen.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:06.692
And this is bad.

00:08:06.692 --> 00:08:08.900
You can actually see a few
ways in which this is bad.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.210
One is here, we have
the parallelogram--

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.030
or, the point of this
translator gadget

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:18.360
was to preserve this angle
alpha, the green angle here.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.310
It's supposed to be the same
as the green angle here.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.490
But if you do this flip,
it won't be anymore.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:26.250
It's the angle between
this and horizontal.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.450
Right now this edge
is almost horizontal.

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.270
So the new angle's almost 0.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.260
Here it's not.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.289
Here's an example with
contra parallelograms.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:37.049
This is our angle trisector.

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:40.059
If you line up this big
angle with something,

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:43.159
you get the thirds
of it, or vice versa.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.430
We actually wanted to
use it to triple angles.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:47.100
This is Kempe's
original drawing.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.360
And if, say, this outermost
contra parallelogram

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.280
flipped open and became a
parallelogram like this blue,

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.530
then you'd be in big trouble.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:00.000
These two angles no longer
equal this third angle.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.630
So you'd no longer be
tripling or trisecting.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.279
So that's why it's bad.

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:07.070
Next question is, how
did you fix it again?

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.650
I mean, the
parallelogram was easy.

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:15.990
I don't think I need to review
that using the construction we

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.222
already talked about.

00:09:17.222 --> 00:09:19.680
Let me tell you a little bit
about the contra parallelogram

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.138
bracing, although it's very
messy to prove that this works,

00:09:22.138 --> 00:09:24.360
so I don't want to spend
too much time on it.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.750
The idea again was to take
the midpoints of the four

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.680
edges of the contra
parallelogram.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.840
And first you prove those
always remain colinear

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.530
in the contra
parallelogram state.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.750
They are not colinear in
the parallelogram state,

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.910
and that's kind of
what's good about it.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:44.730
Then you find a magic point out
here off the board called X,

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:50.470
and X is going to be on this
perpendicular bisector of PR.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:53.250
It's also the perpendicular
bisector of SQ.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:57.500
Turns out this distance
always equals this distance

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.910
by the symmetry of
contra parallelogram.

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.490
That's actually
really easy to see,

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:04.810
because you have opposite
edge links being equal.

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:07.486
You get that symmetry.

00:10:07.486 --> 00:10:10.110
So it turns out that has to be
a fairly specific point for this

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.611
to work.

00:10:12.611 --> 00:10:13.110
All right.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.400
So what do we do next?

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.010
And then we add these four bars.

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:21.040
And the harder part of the claim
is at that this thing still

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.740
moves within an
appropriately chosen X.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.990
I kind of don't want to
get into that too much.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:32.980
The easier part to see is
that you can no longer-- if X

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:39.310
is sufficiently far down there,
this is no longer possible.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.470
So let's prove that first.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:45.224
So let's see.

00:10:45.224 --> 00:10:46.640
If you look at
these bars, the bar

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.430
PX and RX have the same length.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.440
That means however
you fold this thing,

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.360
X must be on the
perpendicular bisector of PR.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.990
Here, that's fine.

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:04.300
Over here, the perpendicular
bisector would be, I guess,

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.610
some thing like this, I guess.

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:08.110
All right?

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:12.145
So the perpendicular bisector
of PR some ray like that.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:15.600
OK.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.430
And simultaneously
for the same reason,

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.530
X must be on the
perpendicular bisector of S

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:24.950
and Q. S and Q are these
opposite midpoints,

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:27.850
and so you've got to be in some
kind of perpendicular bisector

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:28.420
here.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.919
If you have to be on both of
those lines, that means in fact

00:11:30.919 --> 00:11:33.702
you must be at the center
of this parallelogram.

00:11:33.702 --> 00:11:35.410
Or, I don't really
need this as a center.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:37.760
It's some point inside
the parallelogram.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.510
That's really bad for X. If
these links are really long,

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:45.790
say, longer than the perimeter
of this linkage, then

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.946
X has to be outside,
because, yeah.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.005
If it has to be far
from S, R, Q, and P,

00:11:55.005 --> 00:11:57.430
you can't be inside the polygon.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.930
OK?

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.470
So provided these lengths are
sufficiently long, say longer

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.800
than the perimeter,
there's no way X is inside,

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.320
and yet in the parallelogram
state it has to be inside.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.550
And so the parallelogram
stays impossible.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:11.302
So that's the easy
part of the proof.

00:12:11.302 --> 00:12:13.740
The tricky part is
to get this thing

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:19.290
to still fold when this is in
the contra parallelogram state,

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:22.740
that X is still OK here.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.256
And I'll just mention
to convince you

00:12:26.256 --> 00:12:34.490
that it's tricky-- you set
the length of the XS bar

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:47.180
must be in square, this thing.

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:51.170
XS bar squared must be the XP
bar squared plus 1/4 AB squared

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:52.501
minus AD squared.

00:12:52.501 --> 00:12:53.750
And I won't go into the proof.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:57.580
There's some details
in the notes here.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:03.180
But what this says is that we're
talking about XS versus XP.

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.180
The other two are symmetric
, so they have to be equal.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.440
So XS has to be a
bit bigger than XP,

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.430
and this says how much bigger.

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:13.000
The formula says
how much bigger.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.760
They can both still
be very large,

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.210
so we can still get
the part that we need,

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:19.060
but we need that
they're actually

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:22.390
related in this way for the
whole thing to hold together.

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:23.970
And I will leave it at that.

00:13:27.094 --> 00:13:28.510
Sorry, it's a
little unsatisfying,

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:30.556
but the details are
just not that exciting.

00:13:30.556 --> 00:13:31.930
If you're interested
in them, you

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:35.180
can read Tim Abbot's
master's thesis,

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.490
which is on my web page.

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:39.100
Cool.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:43.920
I wanted to briefly remind
you about some of the project

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:49.720
ideas for Kempe before we go
to generalizations of Kempe.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.420
So one of them is
to implement Kempe.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.860
It's never been implemented, as
far as I know, in general form.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.060
And it would be
interesting to actually see

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.900
it happen in action,
some version of it.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.310
There's a lot of
different versions,

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:08.580
but ideally with
bracing, I guess.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.830
Another fun sort of
more design project

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.620
would be to design
an alphabet and be

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.140
able to make every letter of
the alphabet with some linkage.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:17.780
That doesn't have
to follow Kempe,

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.220
but it would be in the
spirit of signing your name.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:24.260
And I have here one
example that's on the web.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:28.730
I'll show you the web page of
making the letter C. Here's

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:31.330
what it looks like in action.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.650
So it's just a four bar
linkage, pretty simple.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:36.890
I mean, it's three bars
plus this closing bar.

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:38.848
And then you look at the
midpoint of this edge,

00:14:38.848 --> 00:14:41.070
and it happens to trace
out this kind of letter C.

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.706
So if you had a pen there,
that's what it would make.

00:14:43.706 --> 00:14:46.080
You could imagine just a whole
bunch of these in sequence

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.170
and be another kind
of mathematical font

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:50.970
which would be fun to have, so.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:56.025
A lot more, 25 open
problems left to go.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.970
I think I could do a circle.

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:02.030
I can do an O, so.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:06.250
24, and these [? fall ?] fast.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:07.940
Another direction
would be to build

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.500
some kind of sculpture
inspired by Kempe.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.042
This is one by Arthur
Ganson since called Faster!

00:15:13.042 --> 00:15:15.500
And if you've been to the MIT
Museum, you may have seen it.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.110
Sometimes it's out, although
I've never seen it running.

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:20.651
But there's a video of it online
if you want to check it out.

00:15:20.651 --> 00:15:21.670
So this is a device.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.350
It's a kind of push cart.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:25.350
It's a sculpture push cart.

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:27.160
You have to run
with it, and as you

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.510
run, the wheels
power these gears,

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:33.000
and the pen there
with the hand signs

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.580
faster, as in you
should push it faster.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.830
It's pretty crazy.

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.460
Now, this could be done
with Kempe, but in this case

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:40.960
it's not.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.630
It's done with these
weirdly shaped gears.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:47.630
And those weirdly shaped gears
control the different axes

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:48.960
of the pen.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.540
X, Y, Z, N, in and out.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:57.550
You can see it actually lifts
up to do the exclamation point.

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:00.930
So that's one sculpture
inspired by Kempe.

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:04.290
In general, there are lots of
ideas for making sculptures out

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:05.090
of linkages.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.650
Arthur Ganson is
particularly cool in making

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:11.250
linkage-like sculptures
that move kinetically.

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.651
If you haven't been to the
MIT Museum to see his stuff,

00:16:13.651 --> 00:16:14.400
you really should.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.470
It's super cool.

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:19.200
All right.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.635
So that's that.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:28.517
Next we go on to
generalizations of Kempe.

00:16:28.517 --> 00:16:30.100
So there are few
questions about this.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:33.560
One was higher dimensions,
how exactly does that work?

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:34.916
Particularly D equals 3.

00:16:34.916 --> 00:16:36.666
If you want to follow
a surface, does that

00:16:36.666 --> 00:16:38.750
mean the linkage now has
two degrees of freedom?

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.791
The answer is yes.

00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:41.540
You get to choose.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.040
If you want to
trace out a surface,

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.700
you'll have to have
two degrees of freedom.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.450
So it's not just turning
a circular crank.

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:49.270
It's more like a spherical
crank, which is indeed

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:53.750
what my hand can do
relative to my elbow is move

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:57.707
along a sphere, well, maybe
a half sphere or something.

00:16:57.707 --> 00:16:59.040
So that's what's possible there.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.540
If you want to trace
out a 3D curve,

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:04.545
then you only have one
degree of freedom, of course.

00:17:04.545 --> 00:17:08.359
I thought I'd briefly tell you
a little bit about how 3D works,

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:10.550
or show you one of
the constructions,

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:13.710
which is the
Peaucellier linkage.

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:24.880
So here is the 2D
Peaucellier linkage.

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:31.244
In 3D, this won't work.

00:17:31.244 --> 00:17:33.160
Well, it won't work in
the sense that this guy

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.010
is rather unconstrained.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:42.710
But if we add, let's see,
it's a little hard to see.

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:50.460
Imagine a plane here, a vertical
plane through these points.

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.430
So if this is in
the board plan, I

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:56.110
want to choose a point that's
roughly here out of the plane.

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:58.010
I'm going to draw that here.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:00.330
And then connect it
up the same as before.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:01.500
So it's connected to here.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.940
It's connected to here.

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.910
And it's connected to there.

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:07.170
So it's just a third
point just like these two.

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.460
These two are symmetric, so
this one's also symmetric.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.820
And all these lengths
are equal if you put it

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.280
at right C coordinate.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.810
Then this is like
a 3D Peaucellier.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.410
I don't think
Peaucellier invented it.

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:27.200
Probably we did,
but the result is

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.455
that this point will
lie on a plane out here.

00:18:31.455 --> 00:18:32.080
So that's cool.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.940
It's like the higher dimensional
version of Peaucellier.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:38.420
Now if you actually want this
point to move along a line,

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.579
what would you do?

00:18:40.579 --> 00:18:41.870
AUDIENCE: Intersect two planes.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.880
PROFESSOR: Intersect
two planes, exactly.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.400
Take two planes, intersect them.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:50.250
It is a line.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:52.524
There's the line
of intersection.

00:18:52.524 --> 00:18:53.690
Generically, you get a line.

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:55.960
Unless they're the same
planes, you always get a line.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.626
So if you take two
Peaucellier linkages,

00:18:57.626 --> 00:18:59.910
you overlap them
at this one point.

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:02.010
Then this point,
on the one hand,

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:03.862
these two points are pinned.

00:19:03.862 --> 00:19:05.070
We'll have to line one plane.

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:06.710
On the other hand, I'll
have to line another plane

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:08.168
from the other
Peaucellier linkage,

00:19:08.168 --> 00:19:10.960
so you can force it to
stay on an actual line.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.740
And both of these
gadgets are useful.

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.680
Sometimes you want
things to stay in planes.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:18.030
Sometimes you want
things to stay on lines.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:19.990
And once you have this
construction, in fact,

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:22.160
you could build the
old Kempe construction,

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.120
and just put in a ton of
3D Peaucellier linkages

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.100
to force everything to
stay in the XY plane.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.600
And then anything you could do
in two dimensions you can now

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.190
do in three dimensions.

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:32.920
So that's observation one.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:41.520
You can do Kempe in the Z
equals 0 plane, the XY plane.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.770
And that's the
basic idea for 3D.

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:46.800
You do all the stuff we're
used to doing in there,

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:53.310
all the angle doubling, adding
new addition, all these things,

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:56.170
and then you just
have to translate.

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:57.650
You have some points in 3D.

00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:00.870
You need to measure their
coordinates or the angles

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:03.720
they form with
other edges in 3D.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.630
You just map all those
things into the XY plane,

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:09.230
do your computation on the XY
plane, and then map them back.

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:13.486
I won't talk about that
mapping, but it's not too hard.

00:20:13.486 --> 00:20:15.860
And once you can map anything
you want into the XY plane,

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.220
you could do your
computation, map it back,

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.600
and force your points
in three dimensions

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.260
to have whatever
properties you need.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:26.550
So you can write down any
polynomial now in X, Y, and Z

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:31.950
and set that equal to
0 just like before.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:35.680
Do all the trig
expansions you did before,

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:40.280
and you can force a point to
trace exactly that curve in 3D.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.330
So that's just a
sketch of how 3D works.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:47.140
Skipping some details
because there are messy.

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:50.140
The idea is very simple.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.068
3D Peaucellier.

00:20:52.068 --> 00:20:53.490
All right.

00:20:53.490 --> 00:21:00.800
Next question is
related to-- properties

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.250
is mentioned in
the lecture notes.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:06.370
So there's a couple
versions of this question.

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.190
They're asking the same things
at different levels of detail.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.557
So what about curves not
represented by a polynomial?

00:21:11.557 --> 00:21:13.390
I read this like, well,
that's not possible.

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:15.770
Everything you make
out of linkages

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:17.360
has to be represented
by a polynomial.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.600
That's true, but what about
piecewise polynomials?

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:23.120
That is possible.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.810
So you can do piecewise
cubic splines.

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:29.137
If you've ever drawn a curve
in a vector drawing program,

00:21:29.137 --> 00:21:29.970
you've used splines.

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:31.460
So those are
splines, and they're

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.600
made up of little polynomial
pieces, like maybe

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:39.180
of a parabola here, and then
you design it to transition say,

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:43.770
C2 into another parabola,
or then into some hyperbola,

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:44.570
whatever.

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:46.750
So these kinds of
general curves,

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:49.480
you can do great
things with splines.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:53.680
Pretty much every curve you've
seen on a computer is a spline.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.290
And this is much better than
the Weierstrass approximation

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:58.590
theorem which we talked
about before, which

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:03.130
says you design one
polynomial that approximates

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:05.390
an entire curve,
like your signature.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:07.650
But when it does that,
it'll be like this.

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:12.780
It's a very ugly-- if you use
various pieces of polynomials,

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.310
say all cubic
polynomials, you can

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.360
get some really
nice looking curves.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.220
So you can really
reproduce your signature.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:24.280
And there is a theorem
mentioned in the notes that

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:34.290
says you can trace any
semi algebraic set.

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.030
So I want to define
semi algebraic,

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:39.535
because this is actually
closely related to splines.

00:22:39.535 --> 00:22:40.660
It's a little more general.

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:47.840
So what's a semi algebraic set?

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.300
So here's an example of
a semi algebraic set.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:23:00.680
You have some polynomial,
let's say on XYZ,

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.446
and you want to say this is
greater than or equal to 0.

00:23:04.446 --> 00:23:05.570
So it's a little different.

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:09.210
Before, we could set
polynomials equal to 0.

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:11.520
Now I can set them greater
than or equal to 0.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.620
So that's the semi part
of-- if we just have this,

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:17.430
this is an algebraic
set, essentially.

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:21.850
Semi algebraic, you can have
half spaces in some sense.

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:28.530
And then you can also take
unions and intersections

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:30.490
to form an algebraic set.

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:33.760
Also compliments, but
it doesn't matter.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.330
So what does this mean?

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:36.740
It means I can
take all the stuff

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:43.760
on one side of a polynomial, and
then-- well, on one polynomial.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.510
Sorry, that's what I should do.

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:48.520
So here's, let's
say, my parabola.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.110
I can take this
region, and then I

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:54.225
could say, OK,
well, let's take--

00:23:54.225 --> 00:23:59.300
this gets messy to
do-- I could take also

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.190
all the stuff outside
this polynomial.

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:04.660
So that's some
bigger region here.

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.160
I could take the union of those.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.670
I could clip off parts.

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:11.510
Basically I can construct
a spline in particular,

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:13.510
but in general I can do
lots of different things

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:19.270
by unions and intersections of
these polynomial half spaces.

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:21.400
So this lets you
construct splines.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.320
It lets you piece
together components,

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:27.520
because, for example, I
could take this curve.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.640
And then on one
side intersect it

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.440
with the other side Greater
equal to 0 and lesser equal

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:36.320
to zero, then I get
exactly just this curve.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:41.690
And then I can, for example,
cut to the left of this line.

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:44.691
And then I'll have this curve,
but only if it stops here.

00:24:44.691 --> 00:24:46.440
I could do the same
thing with this piece,

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.630
end up with this
piece, and then take

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:48.970
the union of those two pieces.

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:50.710
So I can construct a spline.

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:52.890
I can have regions, of course.

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:54.890
Infinite area, finite
area, whatever.

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:57.000
So semi algebraic
sets are very general.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.690
It's fairly easy
to see that this

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:03.310
is the most you could hope
for, because in general, you

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:06.320
look at a linkage, it's defined
by polynomial equations.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.151
You say, well the
square distance from P

00:25:08.151 --> 00:25:11.000
to Q equals L for
various things.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.040
So you only have polynomial
equations to work with.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.200
Because you have flexibility,
you get inequations.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.700
Because we can do
things like this.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.700
I mean, this distance
is now less than

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.360
or equal to the sum
of these two lines.

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.820
So semi algebraic
sets are the best

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.850
you could hope for, a bunch
of polynomial inequalities.

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:38.680
And in fact, every such semi
algebraic set is possible.

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:39.780
So how do you prove that?

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.220
It's actually really easy.

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.120
We've essentially
already done P of XYZ

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:47.630
is greater or equal to 0,
because we saw in Kempe how

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:49.640
to set something equal to 0.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.590
To do that, we used the
Peaucellier linkage,

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:55.160
which I will draw
for the Nth time,

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.760
because I need to modify it.

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.640
So here's a Peaucellier linkage.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.810
It forces this point to
lie on a straight line.

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:11.850
If I add a joint here, and
basically let this length

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:16.150
get smaller if it wants to-- it
can do things like this now--

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:19.450
I should draw it more like that.

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:22.267
Maybe I should draw it
scale, so that's maybe

00:26:22.267 --> 00:26:23.100
something like this.

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:26.220
This point can now move
anywhere on the segment.

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:30.630
Then this guy will end up being
able to make, well not exactly

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:33.500
this half plane,
but a region of it.

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.080
A big enough region if
you set it up right.

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:38.000
And as you may recall,
the x-coordinate

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.210
here was the sum of
all my trig terms.

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:44.670
And I wanted that equal
to 0 for this to happen,

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.450
but if I wanted to make
greater than or equal to 0,

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:51.370
then I just needed to be to the
right of that vertical line.

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:54.140
And so that lets me
take any polynomial

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:55.670
and set it greater
or equal to 0.

00:26:55.670 --> 00:27:01.010
So that's basically Kempe,
except I used this modified

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:05.870
Peaucellier that let's things
go to the right a little bit.

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:07.130
OK.

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:08.362
Intersections are also easy.

00:27:08.362 --> 00:27:10.320
If I want to take the
intersection of two sets,

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:14.590
I just overlay those
linkages and let

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:18.330
them share the same point.

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:21.390
I call this P that
we're constraining.

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:24.000
So that will apply multiple
constraints to that same point,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.790
and so that is the intersection
of those two semi algebraic

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:28.470
sets.

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.900
The one tricky part
is unions, and this

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:33.350
is what the question
is asking about here.

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:37.380
Intersection gadgets are clear,
but what's the union gadget?

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:42.160
Union gadget turns out to
also be possible using Kempe.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.570
Kind of surprising.

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:45.590
Let me show you how.

00:27:54.850 --> 00:28:01.700
So suppose you have
linkage one constraining

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:04.340
some point I'll call it P1 here.

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:07.030
And you have
another linkage two,

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:10.210
constraining at some point P2.

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:12.495
And what you'd like to do
is build a new linkage that

00:28:12.495 --> 00:28:17.200
has some point P that either
follows P1 or follows P2,

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.630
so it takes the union
of those two sets.

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:23.140
So whatever L1 constructs for
P1, whatever L2 constructs

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:28.200
for P2, you want to be able
to trace P1 or trace P2.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:33.690
And what we're going to do
is build another box here,

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:36.422
another linkage, which
is going to be-- I

00:28:36.422 --> 00:28:38.680
won't write L. Got
some more room here.

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.142
It's going to be a
Kempe construction

00:29:04.142 --> 00:29:04.975
for this polynomial.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:12.235
So this polynomial,
it's a little different

00:29:12.235 --> 00:29:13.110
from what we've seen.

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:15.380
And over here it's going
to be point P. P here

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:22.560
is X comma Y. P2
is X2Y2 and so on.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.370
If you want, as X1Y1.

00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:28.380
So this is an equation
involving three points.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:31.530
In the past, we've only
had polynomial equations

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:33.020
involving one point.

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.835
This is another generalization
of Kempe which I may or may not

00:29:35.835 --> 00:29:38.970
have mentioned, but
it's really easy.

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:44.899
We had, what was it, a rhombus
to represent a single point.

00:29:44.899 --> 00:29:47.440
You just have three of them,
and now you've got three points.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.820
You could do the same trig
identities, and so on,

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:50.560
to expand out.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.070
You get, you might not
call it a polynomial,

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:55.120
you might call it a multinomial.

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.800
Well, I guess it was already
a multinomial in X and Y.

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:02.430
Now it's a polynomial
on XY, X1, Y1, X2.

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:03.170
Y2.

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:04.960
And that's exactly
what we have here,

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:09.260
various powers of
those six variables.

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:12.490
You expand them out just in the
way you did before with trig,

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:15.050
and you just need to be
able to add up angles now,

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:17.170
not just alpha and
beta, but now there's

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:21.180
six possible angles representing
each of the x- y-coordinates.

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:24.000
So I claim I can build
this thing of Kempe.

00:30:28.971 --> 00:30:29.470
OK.

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:31.070
And if I build this
thing, basically I

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:37.210
force X and Y to be
either X1, X2 or Y1, Y2,

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:41.390
and that lets you take the union
of link [? which ?] L1 and L2.

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:46.850
The new point P can either
live at P1 or can live at P2.

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:47.870
Questions about that?

00:30:50.856 --> 00:30:51.356
Yeah.

00:30:51.356 --> 00:30:53.064
AUDIENCE: Should some
of those be pluses?

00:30:53.064 --> 00:30:55.340
PROFESSOR: Should some
of those be pluses?

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.834
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
looks like X

00:30:56.834 --> 00:30:59.654
equals X1 is enough to
make that whole thing 0.

00:30:59.654 --> 00:31:00.320
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.156
I was curious about this.

00:31:02.156 --> 00:31:04.208
Do you see a way to fix this?

00:31:04.208 --> 00:31:09.328
The worry here is X could be X1,
and Y could be Y2 [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:09.328 --> 00:31:11.272
So you have--

00:31:11.272 --> 00:31:15.646
AUDIENCE: X minus X1
squared plus Y minus Y1

00:31:15.646 --> 00:31:18.562
squared all [INAUDIBLE]
X minus X2 squared plus Y

00:31:18.562 --> 00:31:19.415
minus Y2 squared.

00:31:19.415 --> 00:31:20.080
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:24.560
Plus-- this is extremely ugly.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.210
OK, let me maybe rewrite it.

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:29.736
Thanks.

00:31:29.736 --> 00:31:31.820
Yeah, as I was writing
this I was like--

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.180
AUDIENCE: Squared
in the wrong place.

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:38.930
PROFESSOR: Squared plus
Y minus Y1 squared.

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:44.760
And then this thing
times yeah, thanks.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.620
Same thing with 2's.

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:51.450
Equals 0.

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:53.640
So the product being
equal to 0 means

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.780
one of the two terms
better equal 0.

00:31:56.780 --> 00:32:00.530
And in this case, if this
equals 0, because of the squares

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:02.260
it forces it to be
non-negative, which

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:04.602
means the only time
the sum is equal to 0

00:32:04.602 --> 00:32:06.560
is when both of the terms
are equal to 0, which

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.510
means X equals X1
and Y equals Y1.

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:14.120
So this plays the
role of and here,

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:16.760
and the product
plays the role of or.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:22.180
So either XY equals
X1Y1, or XY equals X2Y2.

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:24.010
Thank you.

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:26.050
Good fix.

00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:29.458
Just make a quick note of that.

00:32:29.458 --> 00:32:30.372
Do I have a pen?

00:32:30.372 --> 00:32:32.200
I won't.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:36.210
OK, so that is how you do
intersection of two linkages,

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:38.470
is just Kempe again.

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:40.150
It's kind of cool.

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:42.120
Any questions about that?

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.890
Once you have
unions, we've already

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:45.520
done intersections
in half spaces,

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.549
then you can make any
semi algebraic set.

00:32:47.549 --> 00:32:49.340
So what I think would
be cool in particular

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:52.890
is to implement Kempe force
spline, say, quadratic splines.

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:54.515
Because Kempe for
quadratic polynomials

00:32:54.515 --> 00:32:56.950
is going to be
pretty reasonable.

00:32:56.950 --> 00:33:01.060
You have to implement this
union gadget to piece together

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:02.720
the pieces, which
is kind of messy,

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:07.326
but in principle, you can piece
together a bunch of polynomials

00:33:07.326 --> 00:33:08.700
and see what a
spline looks like.

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:10.090
You had a question.

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:14.794
AUDIENCE: So if the curves
you're taking in enough

00:33:14.794 --> 00:33:18.682
don't intersect to get
from point to the other--

00:33:18.682 --> 00:33:19.670
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:20.210
Yeah.

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:25.580
So you're asking about sort
of continuous crank ability

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:27.840
of Kempe constructions.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:31.090
And indeed, if you had two
sets that were disjoint,

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:34.980
there's no way to continuously
go from one spot to the other.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:37.800
What this is saying is that the
overall trace of this point--

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.480
if you look at all possible
configurations, the linkage,

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.970
and then just see
where P goes, it

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:46.810
will trace out both of
those connected components.

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:48.870
On the other hand,
if these do overlap

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:51.490
if there is a common point
between these two linkages,

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:53.800
then this will allow you
to transition from one

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:54.920
to the other.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.099
So right, if you're
building a spline,

00:33:57.099 --> 00:33:58.890
presumably you know
that they're connected,

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:01.720
and you want to be careful of
the way you union them together

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:04.850
to make them possible
by continuous motion.

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:06.210
I think that's always possible.

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:12.254
But you do have to be careful.

00:34:12.254 --> 00:34:12.920
Other questions?

00:34:16.455 --> 00:34:17.820
All right.

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:20.480
I want to get the hypar
gluing, but there's

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:24.580
one more topic some
people asked about,

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:26.679
which are these origami axioms.

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:30.900
I mentioned them very briefly
at the end of lecture 10,

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.599
and they sounded
amazingly powerful.

00:34:32.599 --> 00:34:34.520
They let you solve
all these things.

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.770
The setting here is something
called ruler and compass

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:37.807
constructions.

00:34:37.807 --> 00:34:40.182
How many people here have
heard of ruler or straight edge

00:34:40.182 --> 00:34:41.600
and compass?

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.080
Almost everyone.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.420
A compasses is this
gadget like this.

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:47.949
You can draw circles with it.

00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:50.630
And there's a standard
mathematical formulation

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:53.214
of a straight edge and compass
which is, if I have two points,

00:34:53.214 --> 00:34:54.880
I can draw a straight
line through them.

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:57.390
If I have two points, I can
draw a circle through them

00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:58.290
like that.

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:02.910
And if I have lines and circles,
I can take their intersections.

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:05.960
And if that's all
you're allowed to do,

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:09.610
then you can prove that if you
look at the coordinates of all

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:11.130
the points you
make-- and let's say

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:13.800
you start with one point
which I'll call 0 comma

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:16.970
0, another 0.1 comma 0.

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:18.561
So I have the number 0 in one.

00:35:18.561 --> 00:35:21.060
Then the numbers you can make,
the coordinates you can make,

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:22.940
are everything you
could make from 0 to 1

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:27.284
by plus, minus, times,
divide, and square root.

00:35:27.284 --> 00:35:28.700
You could do all
those operations,

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:30.296
and that's all you could do.

00:35:30.296 --> 00:35:31.670
And so what that
means basically,

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:35.630
is you could solve quadratic
polynomials, but nothing more.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:39.720
And that's an old result from
1800s and implies things like

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:42.042
you cannot trisect an angle.

00:35:42.042 --> 00:35:43.750
You can bisect an
angle because that only

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:45.520
involves quadratic stuff.

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:48.050
You can't trisect an angle,
for example, 60 degrees,

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:51.160
because that involves solving
subcubic, which is not

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:53.870
possible by straight
edge and compass.

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:56.280
You cannot compute
the cube root of 2.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.810
It's a cube doubling problem,
so all these great things.

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:04.950
Then came along Huzita in
1989, and at the same time,

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:08.270
Jacques Justin in
1989, who you remember

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:11.150
did Kawasaki's theorem
and Maekawa's theorem.

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:14.350
He also did this,
all independently.

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:17.760
So Huzita suggested
these axioms for folding.

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.930
If I have two points,
I can fold a crease

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:23.290
along those two
points, that line.

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:25.800
If I have two points, I can
fold a point onto a point.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.650
That constructs a
perpendicular bisector.

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:30.330
If I have two lines, I can
fold one line onto the other.

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:33.620
That is the angular bisector.

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:36.785
If I have a point and the line,
I can fold the line onto itself

00:36:36.785 --> 00:36:40.920
, which forces the crease to be
perpendicular and pass through

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:41.700
this point.

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:44.150
You see these in lots
of origami diagrams.

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:47.150
They let you find
interesting lines.

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:50.024
If I have two
points on a line, I

00:36:50.024 --> 00:36:51.440
can fold this point
onto this line

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.220
while also folding
through this point.

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:56.056
That's a tangent of a parabola
if you look at it correctly.

00:36:56.056 --> 00:36:57.680
And if I have two
points and two lines,

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:58.960
I can fold this
point onto this line

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:01.290
while simultaneously folding
this point onto this line.

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:03.206
There actually is four
or eight different ways

00:37:03.206 --> 00:37:05.180
to do it in general,
but you can find them

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:07.180
all by just
manipulating the paper.

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:08.400
That's the claim.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:12.970
There's one other that Huzita
missed, Justin saw, called,

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:14.490
these days, Hatori's
axiom, where

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:18.610
you fold a point onto a line.

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:22.450
And not shown here, I
believe, is another point

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:24.480
that you must fold through.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:27.010
No, that looks like this axiom.

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:30.790
So I've forgotten what the
differences is for Hatori.

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:35.134
Oh, not drawn here is,
there's an edge in the bottom.

00:37:35.134 --> 00:37:36.550
And you also want
to fold the line

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:37.924
onto itself, which
means you have

00:37:37.924 --> 00:37:41.180
to be perpendicular to
this black line down here.

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:45.927
So that's sort of
all you could imagine

00:37:45.927 --> 00:37:48.010
if you have these sort of
points onto lines, lines

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:50.210
onto points, lines onto lines.

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:52.630
Axioms, if you
enumerate them all,

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:54.880
this is all of them
for a single fold.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.650
And with these axioms
you could prove

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:58.500
you can solve any
cubic polynomials.

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.670
So basically you can
also take cube roots.

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:04.810
And so in particular, you can
do things like trisect an angle.

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:06.240
It's what's shown up here.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.940
Fairly small sequence.

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:10.180
This was discovered
in the 1970s.

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:12.910
You can trisect any angle,
divide it into thirds

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:14.200
just by these kinds of folds.

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.325
And the tricky operation
here is folding two points

00:38:16.325 --> 00:38:18.180
onto two lines simultaneously.

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:20.100
That's the third
degree operation.

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:23.560
Everything else you can
do with ruler and compass.

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:25.920
And you can also do
things like double a cube.

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:29.930
This is computing a
cube root of 2 ratio.

00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:31.770
First you bisect you
thing into thirds.

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:34.960
This is easy to do, because
we can divide by three.

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:39.660
Then you fold these two
points onto these two lines.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:43.260
And it turns out the ratio
here between this y-coordinate

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.290
and this y-coordinate
is cube root of 3.

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:47.560
A over B is cube root of 3.

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:54.250
This is by Peter Messer in 1985.

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:57.080
So that's kind of cool.

00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:58.920
But that's all you can
do with single folds.

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:02.100
The most you hope for is
solving cubic equations.

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:03.440
You can't quintisect an angle.

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.690
You can't divide
an angle in fifths.

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:08.810
You can't compute the
fifth root of 2, I assume.

00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:11.055
You can't do lots of things.

00:39:11.055 --> 00:39:13.680
But it's at least more powerful
than straight edge and compass,

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.770
which is cool.

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:17.550
So then this was just for
single fold operations.

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:19.190
You could look at
two fold operations,

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.689
three fold operations
where you make

00:39:20.689 --> 00:39:23.170
two folds and simultaneously
align lots of things.

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:26.980
With two folds you can-- oh,
sorry, before I get that.

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:29.810
There is a software called
ReferenceFinder by Robert Lang,

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:33.030
if you're curious about how
to construct various things.

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:36.070
So here is plugged in, I
want to compute a third.

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:37.920
And it just enumerates
all possible things

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.700
you could do with
five or six folds.

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.400
And if it finds
an exact solution,

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.540
it will put it at the top.

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.590
It also finds
approximate solutions

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:46.140
which are practically useful.

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:48.880
So this is a sequence of
operations that from a square,

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:55.460
you could find this point at
0 comma third, which is nice.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:58.010
When you have two folds,
you can quintisect an angle.

00:39:58.010 --> 00:40:01.230
These are Robert Lang's diagrams
for quintisecting a given

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:02.770
angle.

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:05.020
You can see at the very
end here we have an angle

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:08.560
and it's divided
evenly into fifths.

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:10.370
It's a bit complicated,
and at some point

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:12.750
it involves a two
fold operation.

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:13.584
It says here.

00:40:13.584 --> 00:40:14.750
Here's where it all happens.

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:18.050
Your fold here, and
simultaneously you fold here.

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:22.150
And you have to align all these
points and lines and things.

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:23.180
And that's cool.

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:27.190
I think with three folds, they
can solve any quintic equation.

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:29.970
That's Alperin and Lang.

00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:32.750
And then the culmination,
which I mentioned briefly

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:35.490
at the end of lecture 10,
is if you allow end folds

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:37.410
simultaneously,
then you can solve

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:39.490
a degree end
polynomial [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:43.520
order N. First you set
up your piece of paper

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.020
into all these independently
manipulatable limbs.

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:48.680
You mark off these
coordinates, which

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:51.125
are the lengths of the bars
in your Kempe construction.

00:40:51.125 --> 00:40:52.500
And then you say,
well you've got

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.810
to fold so that this
all these points align.

00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:56.830
That will construct
a linkage state,

00:40:56.830 --> 00:40:59.120
and if you set Kempe
up right, there

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.544
will only be one state,
which is the solution

00:41:01.544 --> 00:41:02.335
to your polynomial.

00:41:05.295 --> 00:41:06.420
So that's one way to do it.

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:08.045
There are actually
other ways to do it.

00:41:08.045 --> 00:41:09.890
Alperin and Lang have
another solution.

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:11.640
It's a little more
simple, but this is fun

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:13.630
because it uses Kempe.

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:19.590
And that is a brief
story of origami axioms.

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:21.160
Any questions about that?

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.080
There's a small
chapter in the book.

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:25.879
It's called Geometric
Construction.

00:41:25.879 --> 00:41:28.170
I didn't prove anything here,
because it's a little bit

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:28.878
tedious to prove.

00:41:28.878 --> 00:41:31.740
You can solve any cubic, you
can solve all these things.

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:33.550
That's the most you could solve.

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:36.110
But all these things have
been completely characterized.

00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:38.600
I guess there isn't a complete
characterization of, say,

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:40.750
two fold axioms, exactly
what you can make.

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:42.480
That's still open.

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:45.312
But the point is, as you add
more folds, you get more power.

00:41:45.312 --> 00:41:46.770
Eventually you get
all polynomials,

00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:48.090
which is the most
you could hope for,

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:49.715
for any kind of
geometric construction.

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:55.660
If there are no
more questions, we

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:58.180
resume our task of
building something out

00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.940
of hyperbolic paraboloids.

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:03.170
Remember this is the
hat construction.

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:06.800
If you have a square
in your polyhedron,

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.420
you take four
hyperbolic paraboloids

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.840
and join them together
like this picture.

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:13.137
And then this is going
to represent one edge.

00:42:13.137 --> 00:42:14.720
Those two edges of
the hypar are going

00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:17.540
to represent one
edge of the square.

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:19.750
And I was suggesting we
make this shape, which

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:21.020
we have enough hypars for.

00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:23.220
We just need to do some taping.

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:25.120
This is the truncated
tetrahedron.

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:28.290
It's got four triangles,
four hexagons.

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:29.700
So we've already
made-- last time

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.025
we made the four triangles.

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:37.990
These are the three hats, and
they can be joined together

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:40.700
to form a tetrahedron
by themselves.

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:44.747
We've got enough hypars
to make the four hexagons,

00:42:44.747 --> 00:42:46.580
and then we just need
to tape them together,

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:49.010
and we will get the
truncated tetrahedron.

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:50.320
Who would like to help?

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.110
Come on up.

00:42:55.164 --> 00:42:56.080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:59.559 --> 00:43:00.553
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:00.553 --> 00:43:01.136
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:06.977
PROFESSOR: It will be
something like this.

00:43:06.977 --> 00:43:07.518
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:12.906
PROFESSOR: I think we need
a whole other six, but.

00:43:12.906 --> 00:43:14.878
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Is there another roll

00:43:14.878 --> 00:43:16.357
of tape hidden somewhere?

00:43:33.605 --> 00:43:34.105
[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:42.753 --> 00:43:44.794
STUDENT: And the other
main thing is [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:44.794 --> 00:43:46.877
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] these
two on a triangle here.

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:53.060
It's like 36.

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.310
Sort of.
