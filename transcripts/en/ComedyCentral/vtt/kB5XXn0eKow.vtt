00:00:51.517 --> 00:00:53.419

00:00:53.452 --> 00:00:55.621
KONICHIWA, BITCHES!

00:00:55.654 --> 00:00:58.091

AND THAT'S
LEONARD WASHINGTON.

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:01.027
YOU KNOW THEY SAY,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.895
"PAPA DIDN'T
TAKE NO MESS."

00:01:02.928 --> 00:01:04.430
WELL, NEITHER DOES LEONARD.

00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:06.065
MY NAME'S

00:01:06.098 --> 00:01:07.567
WHERE I'M FROM?

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.868
A LITTLE TOWN CALLED

00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:11.204
"NONE OF YOUR
GOD DAMN BUSINESS."

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:12.672
LET'S PLAY
SOME DICE, BITCHES.

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:15.141
AND FINALLY,
FROM THESE VERY PROJECTS,

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:19.112
LOCAL LEGEND ASHY LARRY.

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:21.314
WHY DO THEY CALL HIM
ASHY LARRY?

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:24.050
WELL, THERE'S YOUR ANSWER.

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:25.618
ASHY LARRY.

00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:26.752
MARCY PROJECTS.

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:29.189
MARCY, SON.
WHAT.

00:01:30.456 --> 00:01:32.558
OKAY,
LARRY GETS FIRST ROLL.

00:01:32.591 --> 00:01:33.860
LET'S SEE HOW HE DOES.

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.600
THAT MAN IS DRIER
THAN KUNTA KINTE'S ANKLE.

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:42.602
COME ON, LET'S GO.

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:44.237
I STOLE THIS MONEY
OUT OF MY GIRL'S PURSE.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.741
SHE THINK I'M OUT
EMPTYING THE TRASH.

00:01:48.774 --> 00:01:51.244
COME ON, BABY,
I NEED THIS.

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:52.712
WHAT YOU NEED
IS SOME CHAPSTICK

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:53.946
AND A SET OF TROUSERS.

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.615
ROLL THE DICE,
YOU ASHY MOTHER FUCKER.

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:57.250
START THE GAME.

00:01:57.283 --> 00:02:00.186
ALL RIGHT, BUT I'M ABOUT
TO GO FROM ASHY TO CLASSY.

00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:04.323
[moaning]

00:02:04.356 --> 00:02:06.559
OOH, AND JUST LIKE THAT,
ASHY LARRY IS ELIMINATED.

00:02:06.592 --> 00:02:07.760
OUCH.

00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:10.997
SHE GONNA KILL ME.
KEISHA GONNA KILL ME.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.431
LARRY, WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING?

00:02:12.464 --> 00:02:14.467
I WAS--OKAY, REMEMBER,
I WAS EMPTYING THE TRASH--

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.768
AND THAT BETTER
NOT BE THE MONEY

00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:16.880
OUT MY GOD DAMN PURSE!

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.137
I WAS--OKAY, REMEMBER--

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.906
PICK THE SHIT UP
AND GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.507
THAT'S JUST WHAT I'M
TRYING TO TELL YOU!

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.742
I WAS JUST TAKING
THE TRASH OUT.

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:25.778
YOU HEAR ME?
I WAS JUST TAKING THE TRASH--

00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:27.647
SHE IS GONNA FUCK HIM UP.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.081
YOU SAID IT, BILL.

00:02:29.114 --> 00:02:31.684
OKAY, GRITS N' GRAVY
IS UP NEXT.

00:02:31.717 --> 00:02:33.986
NOW, GRITS IS
MOST KNOWN FOR ONCE ROLLING

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.057
77 SEVENS IN A ROW
AT A CASINO IN LAS VEGAS,

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.359
MAKING HIM
A MILLIONAIRE IN THE PROCESS.

00:02:40.392 --> 00:02:41.827
WELL, YOU KNOW, ROB,
EARLIER TODAY,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.362
WE ASKED HIM WHAT
HE DID WITH THE MONEY.

00:02:43.395 --> 00:02:44.730
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:46.399
I BOUGHT MY MAMA A CAR.

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:50.369
I SPENT THE REST ON PCP.

00:02:50.402 --> 00:02:51.737
OKAY, SIMPLE ENOUGH.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.738
I LIKE HIS STYLE.

00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:53.739
LOVES HIS MOTHER.

00:02:53.772 --> 00:02:55.208
LOVES PCP.

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:56.976
GRITS N' GRAVY
IS READY TO ROLL.

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:58.444
LET'S SEE HOW HE DOES.

00:02:58.477 --> 00:02:59.520
COME ON, PUT IN.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.146
ALL RIGHT.

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:01.247
PUT UP OR SHUT UP.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.248
ALL RIGHT.
JUST HOLD ON.

00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:03.249
TIME TO DOUBLE UP!

00:03:03.282 --> 00:03:06.419
HERE TO TAKE
EVERYBODY MONEY.

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:08.421
SEVEN!
SEVEN!

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:09.555
SEVEN!

00:03:09.588 --> 00:03:10.756
WHAT YOU ALL KNOW

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:11.824
PAY ME.

00:03:11.857 --> 00:03:14.193
BOY, YOU ARE
THE GODDAMN DEVIL.

00:03:14.226 --> 00:03:16.062
PUT IT DOWN THERE.
PUT IT DOWN THERE!

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:17.697
LET'S SPREAD THIS AROUND.
YES.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.298
HUBBA-HUBBA!

00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:21.801
A'IGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M TIRED.

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:23.002
I AIN'T GOT ALL DAY.

00:03:23.035 --> 00:03:25.104
I GOT BABIES TO KISS
AND BITCHES TO CATCH.

00:03:25.137 --> 00:03:26.772
ALL IN.

00:03:26.805 --> 00:03:29.875
ALL IN?

00:03:29.908 --> 00:03:31.044
I SEE YOU.

00:03:34.947 --> 00:03:36.716
[dramatic whistling]

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:38.884
AND LEONARD
LAYING IT ON THICK.

00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:40.486
AN INCREDIBLE STARE DOWN

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.188
BETWEEN LEONARD AND GRITS.

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:44.690
LOOK AT THE FLARING NOSTRILS.

00:03:44.723 --> 00:03:48.094
MAKES ME WANT TO THROW UP.

00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:49.095
OOH!

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:50.830
SNAKE EYES! 
DAMN!

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:53.633
AND JUST LIKE THAT,
GRITS IS ELIMINATED.

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:56.202
AND WHEN I LEAVE,
COME TOGETHER LIKE BUTT CHEEKS.

00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:59.005
AND IT COMES DOWN
TO THESE TWO MEN,

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:03.743
LEONARD WASHINGTON
AND PHYUCK YIU.

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:07.146
I WANT EVERYBODY IN HERE
TO GET BUTT-ASS NAKED!

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:08.848
GET YOUR GODDAMN
CLOTHES OFF!

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:10.449
THIS IS A ROBBERY!

00:04:10.482 --> 00:04:14.353
AND ALMOST ON CUE
THE GAME GETS ROBBED.

00:04:14.386 --> 00:04:17.223
LOCAL THUG
RODNEY "QUILLS" DINKINS,

00:04:17.256 --> 00:04:19.892
BREAKING INTO THE
MARCY PROJECTS HALLWAY HERE

00:04:19.925 --> 00:04:22.728
AND TELLING US ALL
TO GET BUTT NAKED.

00:04:22.761 --> 00:04:25.431
YOU KNOW, BILL,
DICE GAMES GET ROBBED.

00:04:25.464 --> 00:04:27.333
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

00:04:27.366 --> 00:04:31.203
THEY VERY RARELY COME
TO A REASONABLE END.

00:04:31.236 --> 00:04:33.773
TV IS NO DIFFERENT.

00:04:33.806 --> 00:04:35.207
WHAT YOU WAITING FOR,
COOL BREEZE?

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.309
GET BUTT NAKED
RIGHT NOW!

00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:37.710
GET IT OFF, SON!

00:04:37.743 --> 00:04:40.813
FIRST OF ALL, YOU BETTER
CHECK YOUR TONE WITH ME, MAN.

00:04:40.846 --> 00:04:42.948
I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW
WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO.

00:04:42.981 --> 00:04:45.284
I'M LEONARD WASHINGTON.

00:04:45.317 --> 00:04:48.688
I DON'T GET
BUTT NAKED FOR NOBODY.

00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:50.723
YOU WANT THIS ROLL, NIGGA,

00:04:50.756 --> 00:04:52.292
YOU GONNA HAVE TO
SHOOT ME.

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:55.762
OKAY.

00:04:57.162 --> 00:05:00.766
THIS MOTHER FUCKER
HAS LOST HIS MIND.

00:05:00.799 --> 00:05:02.368
GOD DAMN!

00:05:02.401 --> 00:05:04.904
AND LEONARD TAKES
A SLUG TO THE LEG.

00:05:04.937 --> 00:05:06.439
OH, BUT I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING, ROB,

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:08.441
YOU NOTICED HE SHOT HIM
BELOW THE WAIST,

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:09.975
SO IT'S NOT
ATTEMPTED MURDER.

00:05:10.008 --> 00:05:12.111
THAT WAS VERY INTELLIGENT
ON QUILLS' PART.

00:05:12.144 --> 00:05:14.780
QUILLS KNOWS THE LAW.

00:05:14.813 --> 00:05:16.949
THIS IS WHY BLACK PEOPLE
DON'T HAVE NOTHING.

00:05:16.982 --> 00:05:19.085
THIS IS JUST WHAT
THEY WANT US TO DO.

00:05:19.118 --> 00:05:21.187
YOUR MOTHER AIN'T SHIT.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.557
AND JUST IN TIME, HERE COMES
DUMB ASS ASHY LARRY.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.192
WHERE THE DICE?
WHERE THE DICE?

00:05:26.225 --> 00:05:27.226
WHERE THE DICE?

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:28.494
YO, GIVE ME THAT
MONEY, SON!

00:05:28.527 --> 00:05:32.064
GO UPSTAIRS AND PUT ON
SOME LOTION, RIGHT NOW!

00:05:32.097 --> 00:05:34.834
KEISHA TOLD ME
JUST TO EMPTY THE TRASH.

00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:36.135
WELL, ROB, I GOT TO ADMIT,

00:05:36.168 --> 00:05:38.304
I SAW THIS ROBBERY COMING
FROM A MILE AWAY,

00:05:38.337 --> 00:05:40.873
WHICH IS WHY I PUT
MY CAR KEYS UP MY ASS.

00:05:40.906 --> 00:05:42.475
QUICK THINKING.

00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:44.677
THAT'S RIGHT, BITCH.
GET THEM GODDAMN CLOTHES OFF.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.712
GET THAT MONEY UP.
GET THAT MONEY UP!

00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:48.280
OKAY, OKAY.

00:05:48.313 --> 00:05:50.683
SO ON BEHALF OF BILL BURR
AND QUILLS,

00:05:50.716 --> 00:05:51.851
I'M ROBERT PETCOFF SAYING--

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:53.519
GET THAT RING OFF.
GET THAT RING OFF, MAN!

00:05:53.552 --> 00:05:54.520
SORRY, HONEY.

00:05:54.553 --> 00:05:56.756
SO LONG FROM
THE MARCY PROJECTS

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:57.990
AND THE WORLD SERIES
OF DICE.

00:05:58.023 --> 00:05:59.258
HOPEFULLY, NEXT YEAR,

00:05:59.291 --> 00:06:00.993
WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET
ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT,

00:06:01.026 --> 00:06:02.194
BUT PROBABLY NOT.

00:06:02.227 --> 00:06:04.163
SHUT THE FUCK UP, MAN!

00:06:04.196 --> 00:06:05.431
PUT THEM CAMERAS IN A BOX!
