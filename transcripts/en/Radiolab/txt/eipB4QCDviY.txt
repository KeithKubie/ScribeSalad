Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radiolab. Very good to actually be back here talking to you. Yes, it's been awhile. Yes. Where have you killed? Tell those people who might have missed what you been doing, what you've been doing. Well, we just said we just finished our first mini season of our first spinoff called more perfect. When are you going to have part two? I believe part two is a coming soon. I don't know now. Not Tomorrow. Okay. But, but net but not long because we, yeah, there's there, there are definitely stories to tell for sure. And you know, and uh, if you, if you haven't checked it out, check it out at radiolab.org/more. Perfect. We're really proud of it. Let me rescue you from this awkward situation by being back to radio lab where I will, I'd like to begin by building a call, dark green forest makin towering trees to your left.

Speaker 1:          00:55          Okay. Right. And I, yeah, I need, I'm a bird. [inaudible] a lot of birds actually and a little [inaudible]. So just give me some background sound. Yeah, birds please. Birds. Why do like we haven't even started this, this is what you do. You give me w like I want wind birds. I'm not sure. I'm not like your sound puppet here, but I can't, how do I, all right, nevermind this story. You'll get your sound at some point begins with a woman or at the time actually, she was a very little girl who loved the outdoors. And I mean really, I love the outdoors. When I was a little kid, I would be in the forest and I just eat the forest floor. And I know lots of kids do that. But I was [inaudible] you mean you got down on all fours and just, yeah, I would just eat the dirt.

Speaker 1:          01:43          This is Suzanne Simard. And so my mom always talks about how she had to constantly be giving me warm medicine because I was, I always had worms. She's a forestry professor at the University of British Columbia and might as well start the story you back when she was a little girl. Well when I was a kid, I grew up in the rainforest of British Columbia and my family spent every summer, um, in the forest and her family included a dog named Jigs. And so in this particular summer when the event with jigs happened, um, what kind of jog is jigs by the way? He was a not a wiener dog. He was a, what was he a, you don't know what your dog, not a basset hound, but um, he was a Beagle Beagle. Yeah, he was a curious dog. And on this particular day, she's with the whole family. They're all out in the forest. It was summertime and Jigs at some point just runs off into the woods, just maybe to chase a rabbit, whatever.

Speaker 1:          02:47          Couple of minutes go by and all of a sudden we could hear this barking and yelping and we were all like, oh my goodness, jigs is in trouble. And so the whole family and uncles and aunts and cousins, we all rush up there. Do they follow the sound of the barking? And it leads them to an outer, and when they go in and there is jigs at the bottom of the road was probably six feet down at the bottom of the outhouse pit. Yeah. Where we've all been, you know, doing our daily business. Yeah. Fallen in, he's looking up at us, quite scared and very unhappy that he was covered in um oh and toilet paper. And of course we had to get jigs out. I mean, jigs was part of the family and Jen, she was so deep down in there, we had to dig from the sides to Sorta like widen the hole, basically expanding it from a kind of a column of a pit to something that's we could actually grab onto his front legs and pull them out.

Speaker 1:          03:53          And so we're digging away and jigs was, you know, looking up with his paws, you know, and looking at us waiting and they're digging and digging and digging them in. All of a sudden she says she looks down into the ground and she notices all around them where the soil has been cleared away. There are roots upon roots upon root in this thick, crazy tangle. We're sitting on the exposed root system, which has like, it is like a mat. It's like, um, it's just a mass of matter of intertwining exposed roots that you could walk across to never fall through. She says, it was like this moment where she realizes, oh my God, there's this whole other world right beneath my feet. Jakes had provided this incredible window for me, you know, and this digging exculpate to see how many different colors they were, how many different shapes there were, that they were so intertwined, as abundant, as what was going on above ground.

Speaker 1:          04:57          It was magic for me. Well, what's so what's the end of the story? Did jigs, um, did jigs emerge, emerge? We pulled cigs out and we threw them in the lake with a great deal of yelping and cursing and swearing and cigs was cleaned off. But that day with the roots is the day that she began thinking about the forest that exists underneath the florist. And now if you fast forward roughly 30 years, she then makes a discovery that I find kind of amazing. She's working in the timber industry at the time. This is by the way, what her entire family had done, her dad and her grandparents. And when I came on the scene in 19 the neat 1980s as a forester, we were into industrial, large scale, clear cutting in western Canada, huge machines, loaders and cats. She says a timber company would move in and clear, cut an entire patch of forest and then plant some new trees and you know, my job was to track how these new plantations would grow and she says she

Speaker 2:          05:58          began to notice things that, you know, one wouldn't really expect, like trees of different species are supposed to fight each other for sunshine. Right. When you've heard that. Yeah, absolutely. I may have to shade each other out. They shout and they fear, you know, they, they push each other away so they can get to the sky. But she was noticing that in a little patch of fires that she was studying. If she had, say a birch tree next to a first tree and she took out the birch, the Douglas for became diseased and, and died. There was some kind of benefit from the birch to the fur. There was a healthier community when they were mixed. And I wanted to figure out why. Well of course there could be a home, any number of reasons why, you know, one tree is affected by another, but she had a kind of maybe call it a a gypsy in recollection. Flashback. Yes. Cause she knew that scientists had proposed years before that maybe there's an underground economy that exists among trees that we can't see. And she wondered whether that was true. And so

Speaker 1:          06:56          I designed this experiment to figure that out. It was a simple little experiment. Here's what she did. She went into the forest, got some trees, Douglas for Birch and Cedar, and then I would cover them in plastic bags. So I'd feel the plant, the tree in a plastic bag. And then I would inject gas. So tagged with a, with an isotope, which is radioactive. So these trees were basically covered with bags that were then filled with radioactive gas. Yeah. Which the trees would just suck up through photosynthesis. So now they had the radioactive particles inside their trunks in their branches. We had a Geiger counter out there. As soon as we labeled them, we use the Geiger counter to in ran it up and down the trees and we could tell that they were hot. They were booboo poopoo right. And the idea was she wanted to know like once the radioactive particles were in the tree, what happens next? Where they stay in the tree or would they go down to the roots and then what happens? And what she discovered is

Speaker 2:          07:55          it all these trees, all these trees that were of totally different species, we're sharing their food underground. Like if you put a food into one treat over here, it would end up in another tree, maybe 30 feet away over there. And then a third tree over here and then a fourth tree over there and a fifth tree over there. Sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, 10th, 11th all in all turns out one tree was connected to 47 other trees all around it. It was like, it was like a huge network and we were able to map the network and what we found was that the trees that were the biggest and the oldest were the most highly connected. And so we, you know, we've identified these as kind of like hubs in the network and when you look at the map, would you see your circles sprouting lines and connecting to other circles? Also sprouting lines. And it begins to look a lot like an airline flight map, but even more, it's just this

Speaker 1:          08:56          incredible communications network that you know, people had no idea about in the past because we couldn't, didn't know how to look. It's definitely crazy. I mean, you're out there in the forest and you see all these trees and you think they're individuals just like animals, right? But no, they're all linked to each other. This is Jennifer Frazier. She's a science writer and I write a blog called the artful Amoeba at scientific American. I like your title. Thank you. I spoke to her with our producer letters, Nasser and she told us that this, this network has developed a kind of a nice, plenty sort sorta name, the Wood Wide Web, the the worldwide web. I mean like the worldwide man, but it's now the wood wide web. It sounds a little bit younger. Fid It would wade with. Yeah, so this would wind. Is this just like the roots, like what she saw in the outhouse? Oh No, no, no, no, no. It's far more exciting than that and sophisticated and interesting and astonishing. I mean it is, it involves a completely separate organism. I haven't mentioned yet. I mean this is going places.

Speaker 2:          10:04          What creature? Where are we going? I'm not going to tell you. I'm going to just go there. I on where we went and looked for ourselves. I don't know where you were that day. Annie McEwin. Stephanie Tam, our intern and he's our producer. We'd decided all to go to to check it out for ourselves. This thing I'm not telling you about. We went to the Bronx to the botanical gardens because we can get so far you have to travel here in New York to get to actual green rates. Actually, there was a beautiful green sward New York has. And when we went up there, we, there was this tall man waiting for us. An expert. Is that right? That is his name is Roy Howling at Roy. By the way. It comes out with the strange, it's like a rake, but it has like an expandable, uh, it's a truffle rake.

Speaker 2:          10:47          Bullish an extent. Oh, listen to that. Oh, that sounds dangerous. And so wet. So we're up there in this, in his old fires with this guy. So there's an oak tree right there. It should have some. And he starts digging with his rake at the base of the street. He shoves away the leaves, he shoves away the top soil. [inaudible] feel you ripping the reason I like that. And so now we're down here, pulled out of route of some story. It's just getting started. They're called feeder routes. We're carefully examining the roots of this oak tree on our knees with our noses in the ground. We can't see anything. I don't, I mean I see the dirt Rod. You shooting him white yet? You see anything? I say it's early in the season, so he says something about that's the wrong season. I thought, okay, so this is just stupid.

Speaker 2:          11:33          But then finally you have the Lens. She gives us a magnifying glass, you know one of those little jeweler's glasses handheld. Have a look here and he hands it to hand. Wow. You see again, wait, let me [inaudible]. Oh my gosh. I do see them. What do you say? Little white threads attached to the roots. Smaller than an eyelash. Maybe just a 10th the width of your eyelash, but white translucent and hairy sort of. And while it took us a while to see it, apparently these little threads in the soil, they're everywhere. And when you measure them, like one study we saw found up to seven miles of this little threading and a pinch of dirt.

Speaker 3:          12:20          What a pinch. What is thing? Is it like, is it a plant? What is it? What kind of creature is this thing? Yes. What is it? This

Speaker 2:          12:29          is the fungus, which by the way is definitely not a plant. There are some other kind of category, and for a long time they were thought of as plants, but now we know after having looked at their DNA, the fungi are actually very closely related to animals. They're one of our closest relatives. Actually now, back in the day, this all has a history. Of course, when people first began thinking about these things, we're talking in the 16 hundreds they had no idea what they were or what they did, but ultimately they figured out that these things were very ancient. Because if you look at 400 million year old fossils of some of the very first plants,

Speaker 3:          13:11          you can see even in the roots of these earliest land, Clinton's see those threads. This is a really ancient association.

Speaker 2:          13:20          And then later, scientists finally looked at these things under much more powerful microscopes and realized the threads weren't threads really. They were actually tubes hollow. These little tubes to tubes and the tubes branch, and sometimes they reconnect. So there's [inaudible] seem to be under the ground, this fungal freeway system connecting one tree to the next, to the next to the next. People speculated about this, but no one had actually proved it in nature in the woods until Suzanne shows up. And there was a lot of stuff,

Speaker 3:          13:52          skepticism at the time. But over the next two decades, we did experiment after experiment after experiment that verified that story. And what you're saying, what is this? Why is this network even? They're like, why would the trees need a freeway system underneath the ground to connect and why would, why would the fungi want to make this network? Why are they going to this trouble of creating this big network? Well, they do it because the tree has something, the fungus needs and the fungus has something that tree needs.

Speaker 2:          14:24          Let me just back up for a second so that you could, you can, to set the scene for me. Yeah. When you go into a forest, you see a tree, a tall tree. So what is the tree do? What's his job? What's his job? It's soaks in. Sunshine takes the CO2 out of the air. Carbon dioxide, which has of course carbon C in it. Yeah, oxygen. Yeah, and it keeps the sea carbon, which is science speak for food that turns that carbon into sugar, which it uses to make its trunk and its branches. Anything thick you on a tree is just basically a are made into stuff. Carbon and sugar, the same thing. Yeah. You can think of the carbon is basically the sugar that builds the tree. However, if that's all they had was carbon, it would only be this tall. Oh, that's Roy. Again. He's holding his hand. Maybe a foot off the ground would be a teeny tree. It would be smaller. So if all a tree could do is get carbon from the air, you'd have a tree the size of a tulip. A Floppy Tulip, Huh? A tree needs something else. And what a tree needs are mineral

Speaker 1:          15:27          minerals from the soil. Very similar to the sorts of vitamins and minerals that humans need. What kind of minerals does a tree need? Like nitrogen and phosphorus, magnesium, potassium and calcium and copper. Why? What do these do for the tree? I can a tree stand up straight without minerals or can it can't? No. So for example, Lignin is important for making a tree stand up straight and Lignin is full of nitrogen but also compounds like nitrogen is important in DNA, right? It's an integral part of DNA, like crucial. If I want to be a healthy tree and reach for the sky, then I need, I need rocks in me somehow. Liquid rock you do, you need the nutrients that are in the soil and that's where the fungus comes in. The fungus has this incredible network of tubes that's it's able to send out through the soil and drop water and mineral nutrients that the tree needs.

Speaker 1:          16:21          I thought I thought tree roots just sort of did like I thought I always imagined tree roots were kind of like straws, like the tree was like already doing that stuff by itself, but it's the fungus. It's doing that stuff. Yes. In a lot of cases it is the fungus because tree roots and a lot of plant roots are not actually very good at doing what you think they're doing. She says the tree can only suck up what it needs. Do these, you know, mostly through the teeny tips of its roots. And that's not enough bandwidth. So, okay, so the fungus is given the tree, the minerals. What is the tree given back to the fungus? Remember I told you how trees make sugar? Yeah. So that's what the tree gives the fungus sugar. The fungi need sugar to build their bodies the same way that we use our food to build our body.

Speaker 1:          17:02          So you can't photosynthesize, they can't take up CO2. And so they have this trading system with trees. She says, what'll happen under the ground is that the fungal tubes will stretch up toward the tree roots and then they'll tell the tree with their chemical language, I'm in the neighborhood. Um, can you, will you soften your roots so that I can invade your root system? And the tree gets the message and it sends a message back and says, yeah, I can do that. Like I can start softening up my cell walls and uh, and make room for you.

Speaker 2:          17:34          And then those little tubes will wrap themselves into place. The little white thread, you can see it, the white stuff is the fungus. And we saw this in the Bronx. The little threads just wrapping themselves around the tree roots and the kind of

Speaker 1:          17:50          part of the root intertangled just around the edge. Okay. And it's in that little space between them that they make the exchange. What exchange would that be, Robert? That would be sugar, mineral sugar, literally sugar, minerals, minerals, sugar, minerals, mineral sugar, minerals, sugar, minerals. And so on. What? I forgot to ask you something. Pardon? Yes. Um, if the, if the tube system is giving the trees the minerals, how is it getting it? The minerals? How's it getting them? Is it just pulling it from the soil? Well, that's a miracle. That's like, that is I got to say doing this story. This is the part that knocked me silly. We'll be right back. Hello. This is Ricardo from beautiful Monroe, New York. Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation, enhancing public understanding of science of technology in the modern world.

Speaker 4:          18:52          hi, I'm Bessie music. I have a new show remade in America, presented by cafe. I'm exploring what it's like to be an outsider in this country. I'm talking to people from all walks of life. People like me who came here from other countries and people who were born here but never felt like they totally fit in like our recent guests, Cameron Esposito. When I realized I was gay, I was at a college where you could be kicked out of school for being gay. Join us as we talk about the America from a totally different perspective.

Speaker 1:          19:26          I'm Jabil run. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab. And uh, so wait, what was the, what was the answer to my question about how does the fungus get the minerals? Oh, it's, it's a three pronged answer. What a fungus does, is it [inaudible] it hunts it mines, it fishes and it strangles. What, how the hell I'm not making this up. In 1997 a couple of scientists wrote a paper, which describes how fun guy have developed a system for mining. Jennifer says that what the tubes do is they work their way back and forth through the soil until they bump into some pebbles, these little soil particles, packets of minerals, and then

Speaker 3:          20:06          they secrete acid and these acids come out and they start to dissolve the rock like you're drilling and the fungus actually builds a tunnel inside the rock and it can reach these little packets of minerals and mined them. Why? If you look at these particles under the microscope, you can see the little tunnels they curve. Sometimes they branch, they look just like mining tunnels.

Speaker 1:          20:31          This is very like if you had a little helmet with a light on it, like I'm a human. Yeah. Maybe not with a helmet, but yeah, no whiteness. Seven tubes or something. Yeah. Wow. And that's just the beginning. Jennifer told a lot of an eye about another role that these fungi play and that's hunter hunter. What do you like? The plant is

Speaker 2:          20:48          hunting for water or I mean the fungus, the fungus is hunting the fungus on tap. Well, how do you meet? How do you mean? So they're the little insects that lives in the soil. He's just adorable little creatures called springtails. They're sort of flea sized and they spend lots of time munching leaves on the forest floor.

Speaker 3:          21:05          They're called springtails cause a lot of them have a little organ on the back that they actually can kind of like deploy and suddenly they spring way a pie in the air

Speaker 2:          21:14          in the David Attenborough version. And if you want to look on Youtube, he actually takes in nail. This pin will give you an idea, hooks it at this little sprinkle and the sprinkles, and I don't see it anywhere. It's gone into the air. Then of course, because it's the BBC, they take a picture of it. It's doing like a triple double axle back flip or something into the sky. It's the equivalent of a human being jumping over the Eiffel Tower. Anyhow, one of the things they eat is fungus, but then scientists did an experiment where they gave some springtails some fungus to eat. They sorta put them all together in a dish and then they walked away and then they came back and they found that

Speaker 3:          21:55          most of the springtails were dead. Instead of eating the fungus, it turns out the fungus ate them in the little spring tail bodies. There were little tubes growing inside those hoods, and this is what makes it even more gruesome. They somehow have a die and don't ask me how they know this or how they figured it out, but they have a little stain that they can put on the spring tells to tell if they're alive or dead. When they did this, they saw that a lot of the springtails that had the tubes inside them were still alive. Oh, that's cool. Yes.

Speaker 2:          22:29          The fungus were literally sucking the nitrogen out of the Springdale springtails and it was too late to get away. Nope pulling cake anymore

Speaker 3:          22:37          and then they did experiments with the same fungus that I'm telling you about that was capturing the springtails and they hooked it up to a tree to try to calculate how much spring kill nitrogen is traveling back to the tree. Well 25% of it ended up in the trees so they figured out who paid for the murder, right trees. Is there anyone whose job it is to draw a little chalk outlines around the spring inspected

Speaker 2:          23:07          tail is is the, is the only spring town with a trench coat and the head of the door? Yeah, I have even I can go better than even that. Huh? There is, they have found salmon in tree rings like the as in the fish in the tree in the tree. Well in a way, how would the hell apparently bears park themselves in places and grab fish out of the water and then you know, take a bite and then throw the carcass down on the ground. The phone guy, you don't have to. It's rained and snowed and the carcass is seeped down into the soil a bit. The fung, I then go and they drink the salmon carcass down and then send it off to the tree. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          23:46          sets evidence of it now, salmon consumption. I was like, wow, that's insane. Salmon rings in trees. That's, it's insane. I look and beyond that, there are forests that we are trees that the scientists have found. We're up to 75% of the nitrogen in the tree. Turns out to be fish food from just bears throwing fish on the ground. Yeah. So the you, if you would take away the fish, the, the trees would be like blitzed, hobbled really. And is it as dramatic in the opposite direction? Like the fungus seem to be given the, the trees, a lot of minerals at like from the truth for sake of how much of their sugar are they giving to the fungus. Ah, well I asked Suzanne about that like 2% or 0.001%

Speaker 1:          24:30          or no. Um, well, people have been measuring this in different forests and ecosystems around the world and the estimate is anywhere from 20 to 80% will go into the [inaudible]. What? Yeah, 20 to 80% I'll go into the below ground, goes down to the mushroom team, into the roots and then into the microbial community, which includes the mushroom team. Yeah. The point here is that the scale of this is so vast and we didn't know this until very, very recently. You have a forest, you have mushrooms now. It turns out the bear network and together they're capable of doing things of behaviors, forest, real behaviors that are deeply knew. We just learning about them now and they're so

Speaker 5:          25:12          interesting. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          25:19          let's say it's times are good. The tree has a lot of sugar. I don't really need it all right now. I'll put it down in my fungi and then when times are hard, the fungi will give me my sugar back and I can start growing again. What do you mean? Look, fungi will give me my sugar. It's like a, it's like it is a cute, it is like a bank. She says, we now know the trees give each other loans. Oh yeah. Back and forth. Seasonally. They can also send warning signals through the fungus. Yeah. So we've done experiments and other people in different labs around the world. They had been able to figure out that if a tree is injured,

Speaker 1:          25:56          it'll cry out in a kind of chemical way,

Speaker 5:          25:59          and those chemicals will then move through the network in warn neighboring trees or seedlings.

Speaker 1:          26:05          That's something bad is happening. I'm, I'm under attack. There is an enemy in the midst. So if a beetle were to invade the forest, the trees tell the next tree over, here come the Paul revere sort of. Yes. That seems to be what's what happens. So you can, you can see this as like a game of telephone. One tree goes, oh, the next one goes, oh, oh, oh. And then they do snuff. They start producing chemicals that taste really bad. So the beetles don't want to eat them. We'll go, eh, I don't want that.

Speaker 1:          26:36          What are the spookiest examples of this, as Suzanne mentioned, is an experiment that she and her team did where they discovered that a forest is warming up, but is it happening all over the world? Temperatures are rising. You have trees in this forest that are hurting. They don't do well in warm temperatures and their needles Turnell sickly yellow, they will send out, oh no, this is not so good signal through the network. But also the other important thing we figured out is that as those trees are injured and dying, they'll dump their carbon into their neighbors. So, so carbon will move from that dying tree. So its resources, its legacy. We'll move into the microrisal network into neighboring trees. Oh, so it says to the newer, the healthier trees, here's my food, take it, it's yours. Or it could be like, okay, I'm not doing so all, so I'm going to hide this down here and my, my seal.

Speaker 1:          27:28          I don't know if you're a bank or if you're in. So it's not necessarily saying give it to the new guy. Well we don't know. I mean again it's a tree. It doesn't, right. No, I know. I'm just trying to say, make sure I understand. I realized that none of these conversations are actually spoken. Give it to the new guy. Give it to the new. But that's what she's saying. Yes. Yes. Suzanne says she's not sure if the tree is running the show and saying like, you know, give it to the new guy, or maybe it's the fungus under the ground. It's kind of like a broker and decide who gets what. You know, I don't completely understand. She says, one of the weirdest parts of this though is when sick trees give up their food, the food doesn't usually go to their kids or even to trees of the same species.

Speaker 1:          28:08          What the team found is the food ends up very often with trees that are new in the forest and better at surviving global warming. It's as if the individual trees were somehow thinking ahead to the needs of the whole forest. So we know that Douglas Herb will take a dying Douglas for, we'll send carbon to the neighboring ponderosa pine. Um, and so why is that? Like so and I think that, you know, the whole forest, then there's an intelligence there that's beyond just the species. Wait a second. Wait a second. You just used a very interesting word. I know Robert. I have, you know what? It's 10 o'clock off to go. Oh, all writing. So interesting. But I unfortunately right at that point, Suzanne basically ran off to another meeting, but hello, Suzanne speaking. Oh, there you are. Hi Robert. Hi. We did catch up with her a few weeks later when we last left off. I'm just saying, you just said intelligence isn't, doesn't, don't professors begin to start falling out of chairs when that word gets used regarding plants? Yes. We don't normally ascribe intelligence to plants and plants are not thought to have brains, but when we look at the below ground structure, it looks so much like a brain physically and now that we're starting to understand how it works, we're going, wow, there's so many parallels.

Speaker 1:          29:36          I do find it magical. I think there is something like a nervous system

Speaker 5:          29:42          in the forest because it's the same sort of large network of nodes sending signals to one another. It's almost as if the forest is acting as an organism itself.

Speaker 6:          29:59          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          30:00          you know th they talk about how honeybee colonies are sort of super organisms because each individual bee is sort of acting like it's a cell in a larger body. Once you understand that the trees are all connected to each other, they're all signaling each other, sending food and resources to each other. It has the feel, the flavor of something very similar.

Speaker 6:          30:46          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          30:46          special thanks to Dr. Theresa Ryan of the University of British Columbia, uh, faculty forestry to our interns. Tiffany Tam, Roy Howling at the New York botanical garden. Stevenson Swanson there into any mcewen and Ben a feral who both produces peace. Thank you. Alright. College. Okay. It's time. Time for us to go and, and lie down on the soft forest floor. Yeah. And may hopefully not be liquified by the fungus and beneath us.

Speaker 5:          31:16          Yes.

Speaker 2:          31:16          Nice final thought. Bye everybody. Bye. I'm Robert Krulwich.
