00:00:00.676 --> 00:00:02.424
Voiceover: What I want to
do in this video is think

00:00:02.424 --> 00:00:06.758
about the electron
configuration for an atom

00:00:06.758 --> 00:00:10.576
whose highest energy electron
is not in the S block

00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:13.867
or the P block but the D block.

00:00:13.867 --> 00:00:15.764
And to help us think about that with

00:00:15.764 --> 00:00:17.455
the periodic table, I'm going to rearrange

00:00:17.455 --> 00:00:19.358
the periodic table a little bit.

00:00:19.358 --> 00:00:21.490
I'm gonna take Helium,
which it makes sense

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.294
that's it's right over
here in the top right

00:00:23.294 --> 00:00:26.331
because it's a noble gas,
it's inert like the other

00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:28.793
noble gases, has very similar properties.

00:00:28.793 --> 00:00:31.312
But for the purpose of
electron configurations,

00:00:31.312 --> 00:00:38.359
because Helium's highest
energy electron is in the

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:43.554
S sub-shell it's electron
configuration is essentially 1S2.

00:00:43.554 --> 00:00:45.698
I'm gonna put it over here
and then that allows us

00:00:45.698 --> 00:00:48.915
to construct, essentially, an S block.

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:51.825
So let me cut and paste that here.

00:00:51.825 --> 00:00:56.459
So what do I mean by an S block?

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:59.324
Well that means that
any of these, there are

00:00:59.324 --> 00:01:03.616
some exceptions, but
the general rule is that

00:01:03.616 --> 00:01:07.727
if an element is sitting
in this block it's highest

00:01:07.727 --> 00:01:15.570
energy electron is going
to be in an S sub-shell.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.029
So this is the S block right over there.

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:21.889
Now, for example,
Potassium's highest energy

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:26.619
electron is going to
be in the 4S sub-shell.

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.960
While Hydrogen's highest energy electron,

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.992
of course, is in the 1S sub-shell.

00:01:30.992 --> 00:01:34.056
But it's going to be in an S sub-shell.

00:01:34.056 --> 00:01:36.168
Now that allows us to divide the rest

00:01:36.168 --> 00:01:38.082
of the periodic table to other blocks.

00:01:38.082 --> 00:01:41.561
This right over here is
the P block, same idea.

00:01:41.561 --> 00:01:46.742
The general rule is that
the highest energy electron

00:01:46.742 --> 00:01:50.398
in the electron configuration
of these elements

00:01:50.398 --> 00:01:53.878
is going to be in a P sub-shell.

00:01:53.878 --> 00:01:56.561
So this is the P block right over there.

00:01:56.561 --> 00:01:58.856
And, as you might have guessed,

00:01:58.856 --> 00:02:03.900
this in the middle is the D block.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.320
This is the D block and we'll talk about

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.748
the F block in a future video.

00:02:07.748 --> 00:02:08.581
This is the F block.

00:02:08.581 --> 00:02:11.258
And you can actually place
it here and kind of push

00:02:11.258 --> 00:02:14.023
over the D and the P blocks
to make space for this.

00:02:14.023 --> 00:02:16.648
But we'll do that in a future video.

00:02:16.648 --> 00:02:21.138
So this right over here is the D block.

00:02:21.138 --> 00:02:23.001
Now why is this helpful?

00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:25.701
Well, if something is in
the D block we can say

00:02:25.701 --> 00:02:27.800
that it's highest energy
electron and there's

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.745
going to be some special
cases, but we can say,

00:02:29.745 --> 00:02:32.892
in general, the highest energy electron

00:02:32.892 --> 00:02:36.413
is going to be sitting in a D sub-shell.

00:02:36.413 --> 00:02:42.466
So, for example, if we
were to focus on Iron,

00:02:42.466 --> 00:02:44.240
it's highest energy electron is going

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.782
to be in a D sub-shell.

00:02:46.782 --> 00:02:50.563
Now the D sub-shell starts
to become interesting.

00:02:50.563 --> 00:02:53.688
For something like the S and P sub-shells,

00:02:53.688 --> 00:02:56.536
you can say look at
Oxygen, and you can say

00:02:56.536 --> 00:02:58.924
"OK, Oxygen's in the P block it's highest

00:02:58.924 --> 00:03:01.991
"energy electron is going
to be in a P sub-shell."

00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:03.646
And you can even look at
its period and you can say

00:03:03.646 --> 00:03:05.744
"OK, it's going to be
in the 2P sub-shell."

00:03:05.744 --> 00:03:07.171
You can actually figure
out its configuration.

00:03:07.171 --> 00:03:14.148
It's going to be 1S2, 2S2,
and then 1, 2, 3, 4, so 2P4.

00:03:14.148 --> 00:03:15.831
Actually let me just write
that down just for fun.

00:03:15.831 --> 00:03:20.099
Just for a review so we can compare them.

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.959
So Oxygen we have 1S2,
you fill that sub-shell.

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.531
Then you go to 2S2, you fill that up,

00:03:28.531 --> 00:03:30.320
you're in the second period.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.429
And now you're gonna
have 1, 2, 3, 4 electrons

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:37.242
in the 2P sub-shell.

00:03:37.242 --> 00:03:38.406
And how did I know it was 2P?

00:03:38.406 --> 00:03:41.325
I'm in the second period, 2P.

00:03:41.325 --> 00:03:44.063
So, 2 or the second row
I guess you could say

00:03:44.063 --> 00:03:48.450
of the Periodic Table, so 2P4.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.612
So 1S2, 2S2, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:03:53.612 --> 00:03:55.255
Now you might be tempted when you're doing

00:03:55.255 --> 00:03:57.258
the electron configuration
for, say, something

00:03:57.258 --> 00:04:00.878
like Iron, you fill all
these up, you got the 4S2,

00:04:00.878 --> 00:04:04.058
although you might
tempted to say 4D1, 4D2,

00:04:04.058 --> 00:04:07.905
4D3, so on and so forth,
but the D sub-shell

00:04:07.905 --> 00:04:12.596
you actually back fill
into the third shell.

00:04:12.596 --> 00:04:14.548
So the thing to remember
is when you're thinking

00:04:14.548 --> 00:04:19.580
about which sub-shell you're
filling, say, for Iron,

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.092
and you might say OK, Iron
is in the fourth period,

00:04:23.092 --> 00:04:25.314
but when you're thinking
about the D sub-shell

00:04:25.314 --> 00:04:27.364
you're gonna take that period minus one.

00:04:27.364 --> 00:04:30.019
So its highest energy
electron isn't going to be

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:33.415
in the 4, it's not going
to be in the 4D sub-shell,

00:04:33.415 --> 00:04:36.241
but it's going to be in the 3D sub-shell.

00:04:36.241 --> 00:04:37.740
But let's make that a little more concrete

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.500
by figuring out its entire
electron configuration.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.796
So this right over here is Iron.

00:04:46.796 --> 00:04:56.215
So let's see, 1S2, 2S2,
then we fill out the P block

00:04:56.215 --> 00:04:58.584
to get up to electron
configuration of Neon.

00:04:58.584 --> 00:05:01.964
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in the P block.

00:05:01.964 --> 00:05:08.991
So 2P6 and then we come
to the third shell.

00:05:08.991 --> 00:05:14.776
We're gonna have 3S2 again.

00:05:14.776 --> 00:05:17.517
And then we're gonna
fill up the P sub-shell

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:19.795
of the third shell so this is going

00:05:19.795 --> 00:05:22.108
to be 3P6 to get to the electron

00:05:22.108 --> 00:05:29.399
configuration of Argon, so 3P6.

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:36.444
And then we go to 4S2.

00:05:36.444 --> 00:05:40.356
And now we're going to
fill, not the 4D sub-shell,

00:05:40.356 --> 00:05:42.889
but the 3D sub-shell for the D block.

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:44.954
You take the period minus
one, where in the fourth

00:05:44.954 --> 00:05:47.176
period we're gonna take one less of that.

00:05:47.176 --> 00:05:51.409
So the general rule you
could think of it as 3D1

00:05:51.409 --> 00:06:06.191
3D2, 3D3, 3D4, 3D5, 3D6, so 3D6.

00:06:06.191 --> 00:06:08.610
And so that's its electron configuration.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:09.947
We've gotten to the D sub-shell.

00:06:09.947 --> 00:06:12.135
Now this is an interesting
thing because when

00:06:12.135 --> 00:06:15.328
you think about its outer most electrons,

00:06:15.328 --> 00:06:17.100
the outermost electrons are the ones that

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.550
are in the fourth shell.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.705
They're those right over there.

00:06:21.705 --> 00:06:23.390
But if you were to think
about its highest energy

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.891
electrons those are the
3D6, but they go back fill.

00:06:26.891 --> 00:06:28.641
One other way to think
about it is we've seen these

00:06:28.641 --> 00:06:33.033
kind of, 3D visualizations
of how orbitals look.

00:06:33.033 --> 00:06:35.087
They're these probability
distributions that these

00:06:35.087 --> 00:06:38.628
electrons fall into depending
on their energy state.

00:06:38.628 --> 00:06:41.322
And one way to think about
it is it starts to...

00:06:41.322 --> 00:06:43.157
These higher energy electrons are filling

00:06:43.157 --> 00:06:49.040
in kind of a three dimensional probability

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.662
distribution gap in the third shell.

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:55.541
So the outermost electrons are in this

00:06:55.541 --> 00:06:59.753
4S sub-shell but the highest energy ones,

00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:05.166
one way to think about it,
are in the 3D sub-shell.
