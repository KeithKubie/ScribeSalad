00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
[Guitar riff]

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.580
I've been looking to  to sampling beats and and being able to curate music with those beats

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.560
♪ take it away ♪

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.080
♪ take it away ♪

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.220
It was a new experience, too, I'd never been in a studio before

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.920
♪ take me away♪

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.480
Yes! Yes, Rachel!

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.760
♪ take me away♪

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.420
♪ take me away♪

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.160
Through the workshop the mentors taught us how to produce music

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.100
on the computer and how to like work with sounds.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.140
It felt like very inviting that they actually acknowledged like women of color.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.200
[Applause]

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:48.180
It's so important to insure that the industry that I'm in reflects the world
that I live in. So for me it was very

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.060
important to take part in the Daughters
of Harlem Project

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:59.100
[music plays]

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.420
the project is called "For the Daughters
of Harlem: Working in Sound" and it

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.100
invites young women of color from New
York City's public schools to come to

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.310
Columbia and discuss, make, learn how to record, and produce their own music under

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.680
the guidance of workshop leaders

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.900
so the students are in the studio working with

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.040
professional equipment working with
professionals and it's collaborative

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.450
with each other so we have small groups
of students instead of one-on-ones they

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.070
rotate through the four instructors
throughout the day so everyone gets to

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.159
work with everyone else and in terms of
the second part it's a humanities based

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.560
workshop in which we want to bring some
ideas from scholarship to these young

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.520
women in a very real-life way so we were
inspired by a book called "Music in Everyday Life"

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.280
by Tia Donora who's a
sociologist so in that book she talks

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.149
about the uses of music and music as a
technology, music as a way that very

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.720
deeply intersects with one's idea of who
they are and who they can be

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.300
music to me is basically like how people express how they're feeling and like their emotions

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:14.750
but here is more about like sounds of
like everywhere so like music is like in

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.160
your daily life and you don't like
really know it so that's how I'm like

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.060
thinking about it differently here
that's what they've taught me

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.360
these instructors are amazing I'm really
interested in the music that they made

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.060
and the projects that they made as well. I  feel that's very creative and the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.599
aspects that they have is very
intriguing and it's also making me

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.640
question what I'm trying to do with
those musical aspects so taking their

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.900
ideas is pretty unique

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.160
[ music plays] right so that's kind of what happens when it

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.640
when sampling is like brought into a musical session.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.970
I kind of feel like because

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.420
Columbia is in Harlem I think that's why
this program is so necessary to be able

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.420
to reach out to the people of this
community and we've reached out a little

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.989
bit wider as well but it's it's super
rare and it's super needed I mean I'm

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.370
I'm well beyond their age but I feel
like I'm living through them and being

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.819
like yes there there are people like me
who do this and I do have a space in in

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.620
this industry so it's a great platform
it's it's confidence and it's that and

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.760
mindset that anything is possible, right? that, and not that anything is possible

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.040
that you are possible.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.700
Yes Rachel!

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.800
There you go!

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.600
Yeah you just gotta listen to yourself. I know that like feeling, yeah.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.120
I really love music so it was really encouraging to

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.780
work with someone who has experience and
it gave me an idea of how I want to be

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.000
creative and like the process and going
into producing and working with music

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.640
the scope and aim of the project was
sort of defined by a grant that we

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:56.450
applied for in mid-2017 and the granting
organization is an initiative that came

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.109
out of the Obama White House called
CATER, "the collaborative to advance

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:05.090
equity through research" and so the
mission of CATER really sort of fit what

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.650
professor in sama and I had been talking
about for a long time inequities and

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.720
barriers faced by women, by people of
color and particularly women of color

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.299
when it comes to particular kinds of
musical spaces, university spaces and

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.920
technologized spaces

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.520
I feel like it's
unique working with women especially

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.440
like if they look like you and they you
know they come from the same background

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.560
as you you can relate to other people
because of their backgrounds and because of what they listen to

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.880
it's really important I 
think, early on, as early as possible for

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.700
children to see themselves represented
so it's really wonderful to have an

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.190
opportunity where the students can come
to Columbia University as high school

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.539
students and actually sit face-to-face
with one of the top-notch producers

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.080
engineers and songwriters in the country,
Ebony Smith, to be able to say, 'hey wait a

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.200
minute, she's doing this. I can do this'

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.770
I think it it enriches our industry to have
diversity along those lines to have

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.590
women in every facet of the business not
just in production engineering but also

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.560
in an AR and marketing and development
business development in legal-- it's so

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.800
important to ensure that the industry
that I'm in reflects the world that I

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:26.380
live in so for me it was very important
to take part in the Daughters of Harlem Project

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.080
Everybody knows what Columbia is
so for them to open up their doors for

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.300
us and to give us a chance, a chance that
we don't really get outside of here, is a

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.760
great and it makes me feel really
accepted and just comfortable and I know

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.920
the other women here can also agree

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.760
[Applause]
