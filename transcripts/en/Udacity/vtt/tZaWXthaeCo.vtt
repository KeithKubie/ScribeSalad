00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The last thing I want to talk about before we move on to our next potential source of error

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
is quantifying how much this angular error affected our measurement

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
or our calculated circumference as a percentage.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We know that if there's no angular error,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
our circumference that we calculate is 46,250 kilometers.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We already did that. That's the calculation that Eratosthenes made.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What about when there's error involved?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Well, we've made these 2 calculations as well.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And I just want you to tell me percentage-wise how much different is this number

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
from 46,250 and likewise for this one.

00:00:37.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You can enter your answers here and just round to 1 decimal place.
