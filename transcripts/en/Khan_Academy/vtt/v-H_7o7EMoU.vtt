00:00:00.395 --> 00:00:04.621
Part C, write but do not evaluate an integral expression

00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:07.733
for the volume of the solid generated when R -

00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.868
- so that's this region right over here -

00:00:09.868 --> 00:00:14.884
when R is rotated about the horizontal line y=1.

00:00:14.884 --> 00:00:18.228
So y=1 is right over there.

00:00:18.228 --> 00:00:20.933
So, the way I like to think about it - let's think about

00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:24.265
the volume if I were to just take the bottom function - if I were

00:00:24.265 --> 00:00:28.026
to just take f(x) - if I were to just take f(x) - and if I were

00:00:28.026 --> 00:00:32.400
to rotate that function around y=x - if I were to rotate

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.525
this thing around - sorry, around y=1 - what would

00:00:36.525 --> 00:00:39.636
the volume of that be, and then I'm going to subtract

00:00:39.636 --> 00:00:42.516
from that the volume if I were to take the top function - if

00:00:42.516 --> 00:00:44.652
I were to take g(x) and rotate it around.

00:00:44.652 --> 00:00:47.345
So let's first of all think about what volume I would get -

00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:49.342
and this is really the disk method, and I go into it

00:00:49.342 --> 00:00:51.525
in much more detail earlier in the calculus playlist, but

00:00:51.525 --> 00:00:54.265
let's think about the volume if f(x) is rotated around

00:00:54.265 --> 00:00:58.677
that axis. And to do that, let's imagine each of - each

00:00:58.677 --> 00:01:03.599
sliver of that volume. So this is - let me draw a little thing

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:06.711
right over here - and you could imagine once this little

00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:11.216
silver is rotated it forms the bo- it forms the or you should -

00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:13.863
you could imagine - you could imagine - this length is

00:01:13.863 --> 00:01:17.733
the radius of a disk. And so - and just to imagine that

00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:19.807
let me draw the entire disk.

00:01:19.807 --> 00:01:22.361
So if this is rotated around - if this is rotated around

00:01:22.361 --> 00:01:27.655
it will become a disk - it will become a disk - it will

00:01:27.655 --> 00:01:31.278
become a disk that looks something like that, and

00:01:31.278 --> 00:01:36.340
I'll just call the depth of the disk - so the disk if you

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.337
imagine it a coin this is kind of the side of the coin,

00:01:38.337 --> 00:01:42.330
the depth of the coin - the depth of the coin right over there.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.021
I know I can draw that better than that. So the depth

00:01:47.021 --> 00:01:51.990
of the coin is just like that. It's a fixed depth, and I'm going

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.008
to call that dx - so it's just this distance right over here

00:01:55.008 --> 00:01:59.095
it is the dx - and what is going to be the area of that coin?

00:01:59.095 --> 00:02:02.346
Well the area of the surface of this is coin - so let me -

00:02:02.346 --> 00:02:07.083
let me do it like this... in a different color. So I want to

00:02:07.083 --> 00:02:11.355
do it in blue - the area of this coin is just pi times the radius

00:02:11.355 --> 00:02:15.024
of that coin, squared. And what is the radius of the coin?

00:02:15.024 --> 00:02:18.089
Well, the radius of the coin is this height - is this

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:20.467
height right over here. And what is that height?

00:02:20.467 --> 00:02:26.123
Well it is 1-f(x). So that is equal to the radius.

00:02:26.123 --> 00:02:30.495
So the area - the surf- the area - the kind of the face

00:02:30.495 --> 00:02:32.795
of this coin is going to be pi - the area of the face of this

00:02:35.086 --> 00:02:39.033
coin is going to be pi times the radius squared,

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:46.092
which is equal to pi times one minus f of x - one minus f of x squared -

00:02:46.092 --> 00:02:49.111
that's this blue area right over here, and if I want to

00:02:49.111 --> 00:02:52.269
find the volume of this coin I would multiply it by -

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.913
by the depth of the coin. So times - so times dx.

00:02:56.913 --> 00:03:00.767
And if I wanted to find the volume of this entire solid -

00:03:00.767 --> 00:03:04.761
this entire rotated, i would want to find the sum of

00:03:04.761 --> 00:03:06.467
all of these volumes. So this is just the disk right

00:03:06.467 --> 00:03:09.359
over here but I can have another disk, a similar

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.749
disk that I do right over here, I could have another

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:15.133
disk right over here, and I want to take the sum

00:03:15.133 --> 00:03:19.668
of ALL of those disks. So I want to take - I want to

00:03:19.668 --> 00:03:22.594
take - so the volume is going to be the sum over all

00:03:22.594 --> 00:03:26.495
of those disks - so x goes from 0 - which is this bounding

00:03:26.495 --> 00:03:35.272
point - to x is equal to 1/2, times pi(1-f(x))^2 - this is

00:03:35.272 --> 00:03:39.266
the area of e- the fa- the area of the face of each of those disks

00:03:39.266 --> 00:03:41.774
and then I multiply time the depth of each of those disks -

00:03:41.774 --> 00:03:44.282
no this gives the volume of each of those disks, and

00:03:44.282 --> 00:03:46.418
I'm taking the sum of all of them.

00:03:46.418 --> 00:03:49.436
So this is the volume - this is the volume if I were to just

00:03:49.436 --> 00:03:54.034
rotate f(x) around y=1 - actually I should just write

00:03:54.034 --> 00:03:57.424
dx here - and so this right over here - this expression -

00:03:57.424 --> 00:04:00.721
I just did that so they really are equal - this is

00:04:00.721 --> 00:04:02.733
obviously just the volume of each of those disks.

00:04:02.733 --> 00:04:07.037
So this is the volume if I were to take f(x) around y=1.

00:04:07.037 --> 00:04:10.752
Let's figure out - so let me call this volume of f(x) -

00:04:10.752 --> 00:04:14.096
and by the same logic - the same exact logic - we can

00:04:14.096 --> 00:04:18.200
figure out the volume if we take g(x) - if we rotate g(x)

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.268
around - if we rotate g(x) - if we construct disks like this

00:04:23.268 --> 00:04:27.819
and rotate them around y=1. And so the volume -

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:33.438
if I take g(x) around y=1 would be 0 to 1/2 times

00:04:33.438 --> 00:04:39.011
pi(1-g(x) - cause 1-g(x) is each of these radius' right

00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:44.166
over here - each of these radius' - that squared, dx.

00:04:44.166 --> 00:04:47.138
And so the volume of what they're asking us - the

00:04:47.138 --> 00:04:50.389
volume of the solid generated when R is rotated - well

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.872
R is kind of the space in between f(x) and g(x) - so

00:04:53.872 --> 00:04:56.449
so what's going to be - is g- the volume is going

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.771
to be the difference between these volumes - it's

00:04:58.771 --> 00:05:01.093
going to be this volume - this is kind of the outer

00:05:01.093 --> 00:05:03.183
volume, and we're going to take out its hollow core -

00:05:03.183 --> 00:05:05.459
we're going to hollow it out be subtracting this volume.

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:08.524
So the volume of that region is going to be the integral -

00:05:08.524 --> 00:05:13.028
I'll do this in a new color - integral from 0 to 1/2 of

00:05:13.028 --> 00:05:25.149
pi(1-f(x))^2 dx MINUS the integral from 0 to 1/2 of pi(1-g(x))^2 dx

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:28.200
and this is completely valid answer but you might want to simplify it

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.022
we have the same bounds of integration - we have the same

00:05:32.022 --> 00:05:34.530
variable of integration - and actually we have this pi over here

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.805
so we could just factor that out - and so this is

00:05:36.805 --> 00:05:40.196
the same thing as pi times the integral from 0 to 1/2

00:05:40.196 --> 00:05:49.994
of (1-f(x))^2 MINUS (1-g(x))^2 -

00:05:49.994 --> 00:05:55.428
and then all of that dx. And then - and actually you probably

00:05:55.428 --> 00:05:57.146
would want to do the - you probably would want to do

00:05:57.146 --> 00:06:00.258
this while taking the AP Exam, not just leaving it in

00:06:00.258 --> 00:06:02.200
terms of f(x) and g(x) - you would actually want to write

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.388
the expression for what f(x)... f(x) and g(x) are.

00:06:06.388 --> 00:06:08.803
So really the best answer would probably be:

00:06:08.803 --> 00:06:12.843
pi times the integral from 0 to 1/2, times

00:06:12.843 --> 00:06:18.694
[1(1-... well f(x) is 8x to the third power - 8x to the

00:06:18.694 --> 00:06:23.152
third power, squared. Minus, (1-g(x)... and g(x) is

00:06:23.152 --> 00:06:30.165
sin of pi x. That squared - that squared times dx.

00:06:30.165 --> 00:06:33.137
And that would be our answer and you could see why

00:06:33.137 --> 00:06:34.670
they didn't want us to go through the trouble

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.434
of evaluating it - they just wanted us to set up

00:06:36.434 --> 99:59:59.999
this integral.
