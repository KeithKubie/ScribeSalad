00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.840
Do you carry around
one phone for work

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.039
and another phone
for personal use?

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.220
Do you wish you
could just carry one?

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.080
The desire to have one device
for both work and personal use

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.150
is a common one, but often
due to very valid reasons

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.390
like security, it isn't
possible for many people.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.400
With Android for
Work, IT Management

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.360
can set up your personal
device for secure use at work

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.320
while you maintain
control of your device

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.480
and your personal information.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.090
I'm Gene Trinks, and I'm going
to run through our solution

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.240
for using Android devices
for both work and play.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.620
Android has evolved to add
secure management of data

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.520
and apps that can be
consistently applied

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.770
across devices, be it the
traditional premium devices

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.150
used today in many companies,
or the lower cost, high volume

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.930
devices used by over a billion
people around the world,

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.050
or the many single use corporate
or kiosk type applications.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.370
All of these variations
can be work enabled,

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.540
and best of all they remain
easy to use by the end user.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.530
Introduced in early
2015, Android for Work

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.160
brings the best
features of Android

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.560
to the enterprise, including
our focus on Android innovation,

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.150
our great device ecosystem,
app development, and device

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.560
management capabilities.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.520
Android for Work comprises
features in two areas,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.070
enhancements to the
Android device experience,

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.770
and new tools for our partners
to add value in the enterprise.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.300
Devices get enhancements to
Android and Lollipop and newer

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.590
to support work profiles, an app
that allows for the same user

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.240
experience on older devices,
Google Play for work

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.260
for securely distributing
apps, and built-in productivity

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.470
tools to make sure everyone has
a consistent user experience

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.170
no matter what
device they choose.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.800
For our partners,
the main features

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.930
are new interfaces for
enterprise mobility management

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.960
partners to control
and administer

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.780
every aspect of this enterprise
experience, new interfaces

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.600
for app developers that allow
EMM partners to remotely

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.330
configure enterprise
apps for end users,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.680
and of course Android remains an
open platform where our device

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.860
partners can continue
to innovate and add

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.998
additional features.

00:02:08.998 --> 00:02:10.539
Let's dig a little
deeper into what's

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.060
new in Android for Work devices.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.840
As we mentioned earlier,
Android for Work and Lollipop,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.700
which is Android 5.0,
introduces the concept

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.100
of work profiles, the ability
to securely separate work

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.420
data from personal data, and
allow the enterprise to control

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.170
only the work profile.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.440
This allows you to still
maintain your privacy

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.840
on the device that you bring
into work, known as BYOD.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.440
Built right into Android,
this data separation

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.440
is achieved through a
combination of full device

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.590
encryption, coupled
with multi-user support.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.030
Picture a work user
and a personal user

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.980
running simultaneously
on one device.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.260
In addition to separating
data on the device,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.910
it also allows IT
admins to control which

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.720
apps can communicate
with each other,

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.210
and allows for the optional
obfuscation of notifications,

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.580
to protect company data
when your device is locked

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.950
and you receive a new
work email, for example.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.450
For the end user, the
experience is seamless.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.640
Work apps live
alongside personal apps

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.040
and are denoted by the Android
for Work briefcase badge.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.920
And our EMM partners
have integrated

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.930
all these capabilities
into the mobile device

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.590
management consoles that your
IT department is using today.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.010
For devices that are not running
Android version 5.0 or newer,

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.100
and some Lollipop devices
that don't support profiles,

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.600
we've provided the
Android for Work app.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.550
It offers backwards
compatibility going back

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.990
to Android version 4.0,
Ice Cream Sandwich.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.160
This app can be downloaded
from the Play Store,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.110
and uses container technology
to provide a very similar user

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.760
experience as those
newer devices.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.460
Things like badged work
apps, separation of data,

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.140
restriction of intents, which
is data sharing across apps,

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.360
and it allows management
through that same console

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.670
that your IT department
is already using.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.330
One of the most important
features of Android for Work

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.280
is its use of
Google Play for work

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.060
as the method for distributing
and managing applications

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.930
for the work profile.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.630
Enterprises can choose
any app, free or paid,

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.750
from the Google Play
Store and whitelist it

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.730
for optional installation
into the work profile.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.270
They can also silently push
apps into the work profile.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.459
Bulk purchasing is now
supported for paid apps,

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.529
and custom apps can
also be deployed

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.830
utilizing a private
channel on Google

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.290
Play for restricted
access to only users

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.990
in your organization.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.410
The Android for Work app
supports a more limited set

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.580
of apps from the
Google Play Store,

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.870
but the experience is the same,
whitelisting apps and deploying

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.540
them via Google Play.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.460
It's important to note
that only apps that

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.440
have been approved ahead of
time and whitelisted by IT

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.530
can be installed into
the work profile,

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.580
and they must come from
the Google Play Store,

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.230
so there's no risk of
any unapproved apps.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.840
And again, all of
this is controlled

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.660
by your EMM via policy
through the management tools

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.490
that you use today.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.110
All of this control applies
to the work profile,

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.350
or the Android for Work app.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.750
If it's a BYOD device,
the user can still

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.840
use their own apps
on the personal side,

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.150
and the data never
gets combined.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.230
And if it's a BYOD
device, the company

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.550
can't wipe your personal data.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.360
To make the user
experience consistent

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.220
across all different devices
on different OS versions

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.730
from different manufacturers,
Android for Work

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.290
provides a full suite of
optional productivity tools.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.480
There's a PIM suite, email,
contacts, calendar, tasks,

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.090
that supports Exchange and
Lotus Notes via Activesync,

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.520
with Advanced
Enterprise features

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.140
like S/MIME encrypted email,
and free/busy look up.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.400
Doc sheets and slides are
provided for the editing

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.120
of email attachments.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.990
These work in office
compatibility mode

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.590
and provide the ability to edit
and save and attach to emails.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.140
There's a PDF viewer, and Chrome
is provided as the browser.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.510
Google Apps users would use
Gmail instead of the PIM suite,

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.370
but they also get access to the
additional online collaborative

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.260
features of doc
sheets and slides.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.910
All of these apps
can be configured

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.670
remotely by the enterprise
to reduce complexity

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:05.890
for the end user.

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.290
For example, pre-populating
server settings, or proxies,

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.550
or bookmarks in
Chrome, et cetera.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.080
In fact, any ISV can make use of
these new remote configuration

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.710
capabilities to make their
apps easier to deploy

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.980
in the enterprise too.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.550
We've talked a bit about some
of the new features in Android

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.504
for Work and the
end user experience,

00:06:24.504 --> 00:06:26.920
but it's critical to note that
there's a lot more going on

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.840
behind the scenes, and we
rely on our partner ecosystem

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.240
to put the whole
package together.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.700
On the devices side we've
built these new features

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.110
into the Android platform
and have worked closely

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.360
with the device OEM's
to implement them

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.020
in devices running Lollipop
and newer versions of Android.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.850
On the applications front,
we've discussed new capabilities

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.330
in remote management that our
ISV partners are adopting,

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.885
and there's also
new VPN capabilities

00:06:51.885 --> 00:06:55.730
in Android for Work that
allow for either per profile,

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.590
or per app VPN.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.340
All of these new
capabilities rely

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.040
on the EMM partners that have
utilized the Android for Work

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.590
API's to build in
the capabilities

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.810
to manage the work profile,
Android for Work app, app

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:13.850
configuration, and per app VPN,
all from that single management

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.480
console.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.387
So just to review.

00:07:16.387 --> 00:07:18.220
We've talked a little
bit about the end user

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.090
features and the features
that are important to IT,

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:25.560
and how you can use your device
for both work and personal use.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.020
Thank you for your
time, and I hope

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.603
you've learned some
more about Android

00:07:28.603 --> 00:07:30.960
for Work and the capabilities
that will make it easier

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.530
to manage and secure corporate
data on Android devices,

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:37.780
while still allowing you to
maintain control of your device

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.680
and protect your privacy.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.030
