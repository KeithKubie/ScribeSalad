00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.040
&gt;&gt; Ramon Miro: It is my
great pleasure this evening

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.940
to introduce Louise Borden.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.590
Louise is a native of Cincinnati
where she grew up with two sisters

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.140
in what she describes as
an old house near the crest

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.790
of a steep hill, which
apparently made

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.000
for some interesting childhood
bicycle riding experiences.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.900
Louise grew up fascinated by
stories of ordinary people

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.440
and their relationship
to historical events.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.480
Louise caught the reading
bug in elementary school

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.360
when she discovered that her school
library contained a treasure trove

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.020
of chapter books, biographies and
stories that took her far away

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.290
to other countries and cultures.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.900 position:56%
Her school library and those shelves
of books were her happy place.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.530
An avid reader of non-fiction and
historical fiction Louise majored

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.310
in history at Dennison University.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.560
She worked as a teaching
assistant and later was a teacher

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.720
for young children and
realized a lifelong dream

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.840
when she became co-owner
of the Book Shelf.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.220
A bookstore in her
hometown of Cincinnati.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.060
In 1971, Louise married Peter
Borden in what was then,

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.140 position:56%
and it was when the younger of their
two daughters started elementary

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.640
school that Louise began work
on her first children's book,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.580
Caps, Hats, Socks and Mittens.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.690
A book about the four seasons.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.950
Her love of history has come
into play in many of the more

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.410
than 30 books for young readers
both fiction and non-fiction

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.300
that have followed including
His Name Was Raoul Wallenberg,

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.960
The Little Ships: The Historic
Rescue at Dunkirk, Fly High:

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.860
The Story of Bessie Coleman,
and her most recent book,

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.000
Across the Blue Pacific:
A World War II Story.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.950
Among Louise's recent
non-fiction books is The Journey

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.900
That Saved Curious George:
The True Wartime Escape

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.500
of Margret and H.A. Rey.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.500
A book that describes the
remarkable partnership of the Reys

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.900
and their dramatic escape
from war torn Europe

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.000
to build a new life in America.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.040
This book is especially timely

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.950
because this September marks the
75th birthday of Curious George,

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.060
and I believe this evening Louise
will be discussing the story

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.680
of the Reys and how her
research during her travels led

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.310
to her writing The Journey
That Saved Curious George.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.510
So now please join me in
welcoming Louise Borden.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.430
[ Applause ]

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.730 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Louise Borden: Thank you so much.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.750
Thank you so much, Ramon.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.050
Thank you.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.350
What a nice introduction.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.290
I wish my mom were here, you know,

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.650
because all of my life
wasn't like that.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.600
[Laughter] But anyway thank you.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.250
So, gosh, we've got bright
lights here and everything.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.290 position:56%
And I'm kind of a casual speaker so
I'll be walking around a little bit,

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.970
and I'm going to show you some
visuals, but it's a real thrill

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.130
to be at this amazing place
of books, so many readers,

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.390
and I just met a woman from
California who came all the way

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.600
to attend the Book Festival.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.880
My husband and I lived in the
DC area for 5 years between 2007

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.520
and 2013, and I was a big fan
of the Library of Congress.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.820
I lived there.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.870
While my husband would go
to work, I would go to work

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.530
at a desk at the Library.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.820
So, it's a thrill to be part
of this great organization

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.980
that is sponsoring
the Book Festival.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.630
So I think we'll turn my slide,
okay, the slides are on, and yes,

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.210
I have written many books,
but I feel like The Journey

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.390
That Saved Curious George is
one of my most important books

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.650
because I was a path finder and
had to show you where the Reys went

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.050
when they escaped during World
War II and came to America

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.240
as immigrants, which is
really a telling story,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.660
it's an American story, and we
have so many immigrants coming now

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.180
with energy and hope and creativity
just like Margret and Hans.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.370
So I'm going to step away from this
and kind of walk around down here.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.370
And we have this beautiful poster
that was designed and the theme

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.020
of this year's festival is
Journey Into the Unknown,

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.800
and I'm going to take you
on two journeys tonight.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.380
Thank you, Library of Congress.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.230
Oh, there's George as a reader.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.460
Even George is our reader isn't he?

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.570
He's 75 years old this year.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.870
Isn't that just remarkable?

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.300
So, Curious George, Allan Drummond,
the illustrator of the book,

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.500
and I all welcome you to the story
behind George's publication 75

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.130
years ago.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.550
Here's our team, readers,
writers, artists

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.870
and detectives from
all across the US.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.820
Indeed, George inspires all
of us to celebrate curiosity.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.550
So, join two journeys with us.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:35.070
Now remember today is
September 24, 2016.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.780
So I want you to become
detectives as we learn

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.360 position:56%
where George was 76 years ago today.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.250
Was he in France?

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.240
Was he in Spain?

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.970
Was he in Portugal?

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.680
Was he in Brazil?

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.570
Was he in the United States?

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.270
Let's find out.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.000
So as Ramon told you, I
grew up in Cincinnati.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.270
I was the middle of three
girls, no boys in our family,

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.660
but we were very curious kids.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.870
And I went off to elementary
school and I was familiar

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.760
with the Curious George books.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.140 position:56%
You can tell I went to school in the
50s when the pictures were in black

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.830
and white and one of my classmates
is here today, Beth Fatheringill.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.140
I didn't show our first
grade picture, Beth,

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.510
but we went to the
same elementary school,

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:29.870
and she is a wonderful librarian
here in DC at John Eaton School.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.690
So when we were little girls,
we were reading Curious George,

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.750
Curious George Rides a Bike,
but I had no clue what the H

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.560
and the A stood for in H.A. Rey.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.350
I got older, went to high
school, went to college

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:48.740
and once summer I took a bicycle
trip as part of a study group.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.290
I was in Europe for six weeks
and notice what my notice,

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.080
who was also on the trip,
and a friend are wearing.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.170
They're not wearing sneakers,
they're not wearing Nikes,

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.780
they're not wearing athletic gear,
you know, we're wearing skirts,

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.640
flats and just had a few
belongings on our bicycles.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.530
And during college, I was
studying World War II.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.910
I was especially interested
in resistance movements,

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:19.570
the European response to Hitler in
various countries including France.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:25.020
So I knew that millions of refugees
had been displaced during World

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.320
War II.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.150
My life unfolded, I got
married, we had kids,

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.040
I began writing children's
books and here I am

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.700
in my office typing probably
an email to one of my editors.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.570
And these are the subjects
I like to write about,

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:44.110
but World War II is
obviously one of my favorites.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.960
I've written six books
about the war.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:53.050
So people say how did you find
the story that Curious George was

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.390
in a manuscript on a bicycle and
when the Reys' escaped from Paris?

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:03.240
I said, well, in 1995, I read
an article in Publisher's Weekly

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.150
and it was about famous
children's book authors

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:10.770
and illustrators including the
Reys and Margret Rey stated

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.710
that she had escaped with her
husband on a bicycle in June

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:17.520
of 1940 carrying the
manuscript for George.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.010
I said, wow.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:23.690
So I looked at a map of France and
I said which road did they follow

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:25.760
from Paris down to the border?

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.940
They must have been on
a train part of the way.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.240
Were they in danger?

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.100
What happened to their belongings?

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.110
What were they doing in France?

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:40.720
And I had this image of them
in a sea of refugees, unknown,

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:46.200
not wealthy, not famous, but just
on, working artists on the road

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.590
to safety getting out of
the way of the German Army.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:54.940
At the same time that I learned
about the Reys' escape from Paris,

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:58.720
I was working on a book called
The Little Ships about the rescue

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.540
at Dunkirk, again, June 1940.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:05.890
So, I had done a lot of
background reading on that.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:10.110
In 1998, Houghton Mifflin, the
publisher of Curious George,

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:14.620
published the original Watercolors,
and when I saw this book

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:19.230
and I saw right here it
says H.A. Rey, Paris,

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.270
January 1940, I said bingo.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:26.610
He was in Paris, but the Curious
George copies that you've read

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.220
in your libraries don't have
that little signature on it.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:34.310
Just the original Watercolor.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:38.810
So, sometimes you're a path finder
when you're telling a true story

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:41.440
because no one has
been there before you.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.920
No book had been written
about the Reys.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.560
They were no longer living,
they didn't have children,

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.850
so I embarked on my journey of
research going to the University

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:54.150
of Southern Mississippi
where there's a collection

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:58.810
of children's literature and after
the Reys died every photograph,

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:04.230
royalty statement, letter went
down to this special archive.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.580
It had not been cataloged
when I got there.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:10.930
Now if you go, it's online,
it's in boxes, but I just kind

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:16.390
of started going through stacks
of these newly arrived materials

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:19.160
as an amateur detective, and I had

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.500
to piece together the facts
of this wartime escape.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.760
I learned about H.A.'s life.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.050
Hmm. As a detective,
he's smoking a pipe.

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:34.430
Doesn't the man with a
yellow hat smoke a pipe?

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:39.060
I learned that H is for
Hans, that A is for Augusto.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:45.430 position:56%
I learned that Margret Rey was a
photographer and an artist, and hmm,

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:48.450
looks like she's standing
on a balcony.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.750
Are there any kids in
the audience what season

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.840
of the year do you think
that picture was taken?

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.650
Do you think it was
taken in the summer?

00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:02.870
Yeah. In winter, why
do you think that?

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.670
Because there's now on the balcony.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:08.150
So as a research detective,
we use our eyes looking

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:09.450
at these old photographs.

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:14.860
I learned that they were
both born in Hamburg, German.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:19.840
It's a northern city in Germany,
lots of boats, lots of bridges,

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:25.220
and that both families,
Margret's and Han's, were Jewish.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.230
I learned that after World
War I Hans left Germany

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:32.820
because of inflation and the
terrible economy, went to Brazil

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:37.220
and he was there for 10 years
and them Margret left Germany

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:42.050 position:56%
because of the rise of Hitler and
she knew that Hans, a family friend,

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:45.960
was in Rio, and he was a
brilliant artist as she was.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.090
So she went over and
connected with Hans there

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:53.010
and they became Brazilian
citizens because in Germany

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.810
if you were Jewish, you
lost your citizenship.

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:59.680
So it was very important to
have those Brazilian passports.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.740
They got married in 1935
and then in 1936 they went

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.310
to Paris on a belated honeymoon.

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:12.890
In the archive, I found tiny
little calendar books the size

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:17.540
of those yellow Post-Its that
we use that Hans wrote and many

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:22.650
of these were written in
French, many of the pages.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:26.920
I also looked at letters written
in French to and from his editor.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.220
I looked at addresses.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.510
Here it says monsieur, that
means mister, H.A. Rey,

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:33.390
Chateau Forgau [phonetic].

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.510
And I looked at the
date, October 1939.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:37.910
A chateau.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:40.090
Were they staying in a
chateau on their honeymoon?

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.770
I thought they were staying
in a hotel on their honeymoon.

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:48.730
Hmm. Maybe I could call up my
old high school French teacher,

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:53.110
who had been born in Paris and
lived during the occupation

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:56.140
in Saint-Tropez in
the south of France.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.390
She was still alive, still
speaking English and French.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:01.400
Maybe I could call
up Rene Lauder people

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:05.810
and she could help me translate
some of these documents.

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:09.670
Then I found French identity
cards in the archive.

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.260
Well, look at this.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.470
It's kind of like a
driver's license isn't it?

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:15.980
Hans had to sign his name.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:20.040
Hans Augusto Reyersbach.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.340
Reyersbach.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:27.230
Hmm. I thought the
guy's name was H.A. Rey.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:30.430
When did he change his
name from Reyesbach to Rey

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:33.010
and why did he change his name?

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.930
I learned that their first
book that Margret and Hans did

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:39.810
in Paris was called Raffy and
the Nine Monkeys in French

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:44.270
and it was also published
in London in English.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:48.840
More letters I had to
go through detailing all

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.760
of their book work while
they were living in Paris.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:56.140
And then I found this
photograph of Hans.

00:13:56.140 --> 00:14:04.050
Hmm. Looks like he's losing
his hair like my husband.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.340
All the archives are
black and white photos,

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.540
but the color that I saw
was Hans's art and then

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:15.280 position:56%
when I saw this painting that he had
done at the age of 8 titled Horses

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.670
In The Park, I thought bingo.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:21.360
I'm going to use that to bring
the reader into the story

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.490
and start the book with Hans

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:28.490
as a little boy growing
up in Hamburg, Germany.

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:33.040
Here's a telegram, have had a very
narrow escape, baggage all lost.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.340
Signed Rey.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.470
Amazing no one had
dusted off the history

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:42.210
until I was curious
about their escape.

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:45.640
I realized that in those
little calendar books

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:50.610
if I could enlarge them on a
Xerox machine and translate them,

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:55.200
that Hans was going to tell
me day by day where he went

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.770
on their escape from Paris.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:02.830
Here it says this is June 12
left Paris at 5:30 by bicycle

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:09.890
to ETomp [phonetic] a town
about 25 miles south of Paris.

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:12.110
So a working title
was where I began.

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:15.370
My titles usually change
and the True Escape

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.430
of Curious George is still kind

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:20.980
of the title I think
of this book as having.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:24.160
I went to the Terrass Hotel where
the Reys spent their honeymoon

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.780
and then ended up living
in the hotel

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:31.640
for four years using
my passport, of course.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:37.910 position:56%
As the writer, you want to find the
best details to draw the readers in.

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:41.060
A young reader and
also adult readers

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:45.030
because the Reys' story
is for all of us.

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:49.130
You listen for a word or phrase
from people you meet along the way.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:50.840
People who were there.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.270
You listen to their story.

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:57.450
This is Jean-Max Hurand, who was
the owner of the Terrass Hotel.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:00.940
He was 10 years old when
the Nazis came into Paris,

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:04.490
and told me about his
family's story.

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:07.010
As a detective, you
rent a car in Paris

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:09.720
and you head south on narrow roads.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.320
Sometimes you're gripping
the steering wheel.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:18.180
So I took a car whereas
the Reys were on bicycles,

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.560
but I was looking for that chateau.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:26.140 position:56%
You take a train to the same
station that Hans noted in his diary

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.860
to follow in the Reys'
traveled footsteps.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:32.240
You write to your own
editor from those places

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:36.430
as you piece together the
quilt of an unknown story.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:42.810
You uncover the roads and the
history a kilometer at a time.

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:46.640
You finally arrive in
your second rental car.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.160
Oh, it looks a little
shabby doesn't it?

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:53.110
I drove up the road and found
this amazingly beautiful chateau

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:58.720 position:56%
where the Reys spent three months in
the fall of 1939 working on a book

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:02.680
about a curious little monkey
named Fifi who had a friend,

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.400
the man with the yellow hat.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:11.300
The window there is a room in one
of the three towers of the chateau.

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:15.340
It's the only room in the tower
and the owner told me that,

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:19.540
that there were no other rooms and
Hans noted in his, in the archives

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:23.240
that he set up a studio in
the tower of this chateau.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:29.220
So, as a detective, sometimes
I live my life in color

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:33.560
and sometimes I live my
life in black and white.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:38.310
But, of course, I'm writing
a book in the 21st Century.

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:41.460
This is a kid who lives in
Laktour [phonetic], the little town

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:45.110
where Hans noted in his
diary that he bought paint

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:48.150
and paper for his art work.

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:54.610
In the section of the Reys' escape
leaving the country of France going

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:58.650
over the border into
Spain, here are these,

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:02.880
these are 21st Century readers and
fishermen on the coastal towns.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:08.170
I wasn't able to go but I sent a
friend of mine and he connected

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:11.880
with two Spaniards, a France
translator and driver.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:17.000
They explored the border towns
in their car with the man

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.630
with the orange hat, my
husband, Pete Borden.

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.910
So he was my detective,
my research detective.

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.500
So on these two journeys
into the unknown,

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:30.410
the Reys had help along the way
during their escape and I, too,

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.220
had help along the
way in my research.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:38.610 position:56%
So when I signed a contract for this
book, I signed a two book contract,

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:43.190
which was unusual for me and fun,

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:46.950
and the other book was called
Across the Blue Pacific.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:51.020
So I had finished the text for the
Journey that Saved Curious George

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:54.650
so I was then working
on Blue Pacific

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:57.930
and it was the illustrator's
turn to work on the Journey

00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:59.230
That Saved Curious George.

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:01.420
Allan Drummond, who
lives in England.

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:06.820
So the book was finally
published in 2005 in hard cover;

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:10.980
it came out in 2010 in paperback.

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.870
And I loved opening the book and
my favorite part is the end paper

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:18.730
with the map and I was able
to draw the line and show you

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:22.380
where they went from
Paris down through Spain

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:26.560
and Portugal to get to Lisbon.

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.850
So back to being detectives
and we're looking

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:30.760
for September 24th aren't we?

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.870
Remember that, 1940?

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:39.050
The first part of the book is
two artists, the childhood,

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:41.190
the Hamburg years and
then we're going

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:44.220
to fast forward to
escape from Paris.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:48.570
They left Paris on June
12, 1940, on two bicycles

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:53.390
that Hans cobbled together
from spare parts because all

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:56.410
of the bicycles had been
sold out in the store.

00:19:56.410 --> 00:20:00.510
And that image I had in my head
Allan just drew beautifully of them

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:03.820
on the long road with
all of these refugees.

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:09.360
Sometimes you don't need words;
an image conveys that story.

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:15.790
So, June 13 they were
sleeping in a farm.

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:19.700
June 18 to 20 they were on the road
carrying those Brazilian passports

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.620
with them.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:26.550
They arrived in Lisbon, the
capital of Portugal, on June 23.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:33.030
And I got this address from one of
their letters and my friend, Beth,

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:35.810
my good friend the librarian
from John Eaton School,

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:39.750
was in Portugal recently and I
asked her to go to that address

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:42.720
and take a picture for me.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:48.470
So on July 21, they board a ship,
the Angola, they leave Lisbon,

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:55.200 position:56%
on August 4 they arrive in Rio
where they lived that August and all

00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:02.510
of September waiting for a visa.

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:08.600
They leave Rio on October 3, 1940,
and I found the ship manifest

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:14.710
and they arrived in New York on
October 14, 1940, in New York City.

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:19.360
So where were they on September 24?

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.570
Do you remember?

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:26.780
They were in Rio, Brazil,
where we just had the Olympics.

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:28.240
Oops. Sorry.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:32.990
I hit the wrong button there.

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:37.770
Okay. So they were in Rio.

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:41.230
Imagine a world without
Curious George

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.300
or the wonderful art of H.A. Rey.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:52.250 position:56%
In late September 1940, three months
after the Reys escaped from Paris

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:54.340
and while they were waiting in Rio,

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:57.470
a Nazi ordinance required
all foreign Jews living

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:01.110
in the occupied zone to
register at police stations.

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:07.350
Beginning in June 1941, thousands
of foreign Jews were deported

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:11.450 position:56%
from France to Hitler's death camps.

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:15.550
On August 17, 1941, in America,

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:18.550
Curious George was
published by Houghton Mifflin.

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:25.450 position:56%
Margret and Hans were lucky and they
left Europe before the full horror

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:29.260
and tragic events of
the Holocaust unfolded.

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:33.290
So Houghton Mifflin, Allan

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:36.090
and I have made this new
young reader's edition.

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:41.650
It's smaller than the original
book, as a birthday gift to George

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:49.060
with a new become a detective
section at the end of the book

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.420
so we can share kind of
the excitement of research

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.440 position:56%
and get kids excited about that too.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:58.770 position:56%
In October, the complete adventures,
the seven original books,

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:04.020
will be published including a
scrap book 20-page retrospective

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:08.100
that I wrote for kids
at the end of that book.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.530
What would Margret and Hans say

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:13.020
about their remarkable
legacy to all of us?

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:16.150
I think they would just be
thrilled at what has happened

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:20.940
in the last 75 years with
their curious little monkey.

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:24.140
George is certainly our ambassador
for reading around the world

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:27.390
and I really love, this is one
of my favorite illustrations,

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:32.670
because they're coming down that
gang plank holding those important

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:35.090
travel documents, those passports.

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:40.180 position:56%
So I've made passports with kids in
schools and put visa stamps in them.

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:41.480
I think of all the people coming

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.540
to our country now
with those passports.

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:47.200
And here these readers
are at the beginning

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.940
of wonderful book journeys.

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:54.470
Some day they will be coming to
this wonderful Book Festival.

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:58.690
New work is an unknown
journey for me.

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:03.840
Each book always has its own voice,
but writing about kindergarten

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:08.360
and baseball is different
from writing about war.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:14.410
So, I kind of have to plant my pole
and right now I'm back on a story

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:18.800
about World War II, and I
did a lot of that research

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:23.350
at this beautiful Library of
Congress where we were last night.

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:27.730
And when I get a little
discouraged, I think of Hans.

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:31.350
I look at his sketches, I
look at their identity cards,

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:36.660
and I go back to Paris and hang
out with Jean-Max at the Terrass.

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:41.840
His hotel will always hold
echoes of long ago years.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.130
Indeed, the courage of the Reys
and George is always with me

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:48.550
on my new writing adventures.

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:51.940
And now I'm sure Margret and Hans
would agree it's time to head

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:56.620
to dinner and George is
telling us that it's the end.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.820
So, we might have time
for a question or two.

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.950
Where is my timekeeper?

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:02.350
Oh, right there.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:04.510
Okay. So, there we go.

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:09.040
[ Applause ]

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.340
So, does anyone have a question
or I've been yammering at you

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:14.850
and it's late in the day and you've
been listening to 50 other authors.

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:18.150
So, any questions?

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:19.450
Here we go.

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:23.100
&gt;&gt; Well, the last time
we connected was an email

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.740
that I sent to you as you were --

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.040
&gt;&gt; Louise Borden: Are you James?

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.340
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:29.640
&gt;&gt; Louise Borden: Nice
to meet you, James.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.940
Thank you.

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:32.240
Dr. James Hughes.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.540
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:38.530
Just a beautiful tapestry and
just the amount of enormous effort

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:41.780 position:56%
on your part is just so appreciated.

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.080
So, thank you.

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.380
&gt;&gt; Louise Borden: Thank
you very much.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.680
And go Nats.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:49.090
You've got your Nats cap on.

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:50.900
Yeah. Okay.

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.200
&gt;&gt; I have one question.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.500
&gt;&gt; Louise Borden: Oh, sure.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:56.320
&gt;&gt; Was anything on this long
journey that shocked you

00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:00.840
and actually maybe even
upset you that you found out?

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.870 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Louise Borden: Uhm, I don't think
anything shocked me or upset me,

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:08.660
but I learned some things about
Margret and Hans and I just fell

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.980
in love with them, but Hans
was a man of great habit

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:16.090
and Margret was very
energetic and kind

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:17.940
of the rambunctious one of the two.

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:21.030
And I notice that in
their handwriting too.

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:23.740
And so I would look at
little details like that.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:27.240
Also when I'm looking at the
research, it's all black and white,

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:31.870
but you know, people were living
this in color and I think when kids

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:34.940
and even adults when we
look at those old photos,

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:39.320
we just see this black and white
world, but that great exodus

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:43.160
of 5 million people on the road,
it was in living full color.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:48.180
And so, you know, I
think about that a lot.

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.780
And, yes, I had some
connections too,

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:52.950
you know, they lost my suitcase.

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:55.020
I only had my backpack,
it was pouring rain,

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:58.070
it was 5 in the morning and I
said, oh, I'm in total Rey mode.

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:02.060 position:56%
So I had a lot of kind of fun, and I
lost a few things along the way too.

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.030
&gt;&gt; I'm curious because
obviously they've done

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:07.330
such a wonderful children's
book you mentioned

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:08.750
that the Reys didn't have children.

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:10.050
&gt;&gt; Louise Borden: Right, right.

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:11.530
&gt;&gt; Did you find anything in your
research that indicated why?

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:13.140
&gt;&gt; Louise Borden: They
didn't have children.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:17.530
Okay, so in 1940, Hans
is 42 years old

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:19.890
and they're just beginning
World War II.

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:21.800
Margret was younger.

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.800
They just, I don't know if
it's because they didn't want

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.400
to have children or they couldn't
have children, but they didn't

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:34.470 position:56%
but they certainly have the
children of the world and, you know,

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:37.260
there's a lot of working
artists/writers

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:42.260
who don't have children and they
devote themselves to their art so.

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:45.900
But they saved everything and it's
all at the [inaudible] Collections.

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:51.540
So, you know, maps and
pottery that Margret made.

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:57.720
And so artifacts are so
important for us now looking back.

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.320
So, that's why these
libraries are just,

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.840
you know, living treasures for us.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.140
Well, thank you very much.

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.440
I've got two minutes left.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.430
So I'll let you guys
take that two minutes

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:08.730
and go buy a book, all right?

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:10.030
[Laughter] Thank you very much.

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:11.330
Thank you.

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:12.630
Thank you.

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:13.930
Thank you, Iris.

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:15.230
