00:00:06.414 --> 00:00:08.748
The DNA in just one of your cells

00:00:08.748 --> 00:00:12.997
gets damaged tens of thousands 
of times per day.

00:00:12.997 --> 00:00:16.465
Multiply that by your body's
hundred trillion or so cells,

00:00:16.465 --> 00:00:21.575
and you've got a quintillion 
DNA errors everyday.

00:00:21.575 --> 00:00:23.826
And because DNA provides the blueprint

00:00:23.826 --> 00:00:26.431
for the proteins 
your cells need to function,

00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:30.574
damage causes serious problems,
such as cancer.

00:00:30.574 --> 00:00:32.634
The errors come in different forms.

00:00:32.634 --> 00:00:37.905
Sometimes nucleotides, 
DNA's building blocks, get damaged,

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:41.092
other times nucleotides 
get matched up incorrectly,

00:00:41.092 --> 00:00:43.049
causing mutations,

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:48.257
and nicks in one or both strands
can interfere with DNA replication,

00:00:48.257 --> 00:00:52.083
or even cause sections 
of DNA to get mixed up.

00:00:52.083 --> 00:00:56.409
Fortunately, your cells have ways
of fixing most of these problems

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:58.119
most of the time.

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:01.908
These repair pathways 
all rely on specialized enzymes.

00:01:01.908 --> 00:01:05.313
Different ones respond 
to different types of damage.

00:01:05.313 --> 00:01:07.882
One common error is base mismatches.

00:01:07.882 --> 00:01:10.232
Each nucleotide contains a base,

00:01:10.232 --> 00:01:12.262
and during DNA replication,

00:01:12.262 --> 00:01:16.633
the enzyme DNA polymerase
is supposed to bring in the right partner

00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:20.582
to pair with every base 
on each template strand.

00:01:20.582 --> 00:01:24.217
Adenine with thymine,
and guanine with cytosine.

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:27.169
But about once every 
hundred thousand additions,

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:28.976
it makes a mistake.

00:01:28.976 --> 00:01:31.286
The enzyme catches 
most of these right away,

00:01:31.286 --> 00:01:35.940
and cuts off a few nucleotides
and replaces them with the correct ones.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.810
And just in case it missed a few,

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.369
a second set of proteins 
comes behind it to check.

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.848
If they find a mismatch,

00:01:42.848 --> 00:01:46.257
they cut out the incorrect nucleotide
and replace it.

00:01:46.257 --> 00:01:48.478
This is called mismatch repair.

00:01:48.478 --> 00:01:52.238
Together, these two systems reduce
the number of base mismatch errors

00:01:52.238 --> 00:01:55.482
to about one in one billion.

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:59.149
But DNA can get damaged
after replication, too.

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.900
Lots of different molecules
can cause chemical changes to nucleotides.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.245
Some of these come 
from environmental exposure,

00:02:06.245 --> 00:02:09.202
like certain compounds in tobacco smoke.

00:02:09.202 --> 00:02:12.349
But others are molecules that are found
in cells naturally,

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.917
like hydrogen peroxide.

00:02:14.917 --> 00:02:17.143
Certain chemical changes are so common

00:02:17.143 --> 00:02:21.348
that they have specific enzymes assigned
to reverse the damage.

00:02:21.348 --> 00:02:24.885
But the cell also has more general
repair pathways.

00:02:24.885 --> 00:02:27.231
If just one base is damaged,

00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:32.143
it can usually be fixed by a process
called base excision repair.

00:02:32.143 --> 00:02:34.528
One enzyme snips out the damaged base,

00:02:34.528 --> 00:02:40.410
and other enzymes come in to trim around
the site and replace the nucleotides.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.290
UV light can cause damage 
that's a little harder to fix.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.274
Sometimes, it causes two adjacent
nucleotides to stick together,

00:02:49.274 --> 00:02:52.394
distorting the DNA's double helix shape.

00:02:52.394 --> 00:02:55.567
Damage like this requires 
a more complex process

00:02:55.567 --> 00:02:58.975
called nucleotide excision repair.

00:02:58.975 --> 00:03:04.015
A team of proteins removes a long strand
of 24 or so nucleotides,

00:03:04.015 --> 00:03:06.745
and replaces them with fresh ones.

00:03:06.745 --> 00:03:10.700
Very high frequency radiation,
like gamma rays and x-rays,

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.101
cause a different kind of damage.

00:03:13.101 --> 00:03:18.285
They can actually sever one 
or both strands of the DNA backbone.

00:03:18.285 --> 00:03:21.303
Double strand breaks
are the most dangerous.

00:03:21.303 --> 00:03:24.066
Even one can cause cell death.

00:03:24.066 --> 00:03:27.503
The two most common pathways
for repairing double strand breaks

00:03:27.503 --> 00:03:33.081
are called homologous recombination
and non-homologous end joining.

00:03:33.081 --> 00:03:39.186
Homologous recombination uses an undamaged
section of similar DNA as a template.

00:03:39.186 --> 00:03:43.850
Enzymes interlace the damaged
and undamgaed strands,

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.449
get them to exchange sequences
of nucleotides,

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:49.244
and finally fill in the missing gaps

00:03:49.244 --> 00:03:53.229
to end up with two complete
double-stranded segments.

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:55.891
Non-homologous end joining,
on the other hand,

00:03:55.891 --> 00:03:58.108
doesn't rely on a template.

00:03:58.108 --> 00:04:02.540
Instead, a series of proteins
trims off a few nucleotides

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.565
and then fuses the broken ends 
back together.

00:04:06.565 --> 00:04:08.554
This process isn't as accurate.

00:04:08.554 --> 00:04:12.187
It can cause genes to get mixed up,
or moved around.

00:04:12.187 --> 00:04:16.332
But it's useful when 
sister DNA isn't available.

00:04:16.332 --> 00:04:20.149
Of course, changes to DNA 
aren't always bad.

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:23.751
Beneficial mutations 
can allow a species to evolve.

00:04:23.751 --> 00:04:27.663
But most of the time, 
we want DNA to stay the same.

00:04:27.663 --> 00:04:31.776
Defects in DNA repair are associated
with premature aging

00:04:31.776 --> 00:04:34.010
and many kinds of cancer.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.224
So if you're looking for 
a fountain of youth,

00:04:36.224 --> 00:04:39.160
it's already operating in your cells,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.719
billions and billions of times a day.
