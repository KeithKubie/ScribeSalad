00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.950
Let us see what we learn about
the patterns that emerge.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.180
We will show that the
clusters are interpretable

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.990
and reveal unique patterns
of diagnostic history

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.670
among the population.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.350
We selected six patterns to
present in this lecture--

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.860
Cluster 1, 6, and
7, in Cost Bucket 2,

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.930
and Clusters 4, 5, and
10, in Cost Bucket 3.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.310
The first pattern shows the
occurrence of chest pain

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.890
three months before
the heart attack.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.420
Note that the red dots depict
the visits per diagnosis

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.720
for patients in Cluster
1-- this is, we think,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.350
Bucket 2-- and the blue
dots depict the visits

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.260
per diagnosis for patients
in Bucket 2 throughout.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.430
Note the very
significant increase

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.850
for visits related
to chest pains

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.290
three months before the event.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.910
About 17, three months
before for the red patients,

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.460
and about 1 and 1/2 visits
for the blue patients.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.650
The next pattern reveals
an increasing occurrence

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.570
of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, COPD, for short.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.240
Patients from
Cluster 7 in Bucket 2

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.640
have regular doctor
visits for COPD.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.030
Note that nine months
before, we have

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.160
4 and 1/2 visits
versus 0.5 visits.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.110
Six months before, we have
almost 7 visits versus 1/2

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.680
a visit, and three
months before, we

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.509
have 9 visits versus
1/2 a visit for COPD,

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.190
so a clear increasing pattern.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.910
The next pattern shows
gradually increasing occurrence

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.350
of anemia.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.500
The red line shows the
patient's in Cluster 4

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.530
increasingly visit the doctor
for anemia from nine months

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.389
on before the event.

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.600
Nine months before, members
have an average of 9 visits

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.740
to the doctor for anemia.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.620
This increases to an average
of 11 visits six months

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.970
before the event, and
then an average of 15

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.600
visits three months before
the event, a clear increasing

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.100
pattern.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.370
The final pattern shows
the occurrence of diabetes

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.210
as a pattern for heart attacks.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.320
It is well known that
both types 1 and 2

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.170
diabetes are associated with
accelerated atherosclerosis,

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.250
one of the main causes of
myocardial infarction-- heart

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.800
attacks, that is.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.180
Well known diagnoses
associated with heart attacks,

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.430
such as diabetes, hypertension,
and hyperlipidemia,

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.700
characterize many of the
patterns of the consistency

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.730
of care throughout all of the
cost buckets and clustering

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:09.230
models.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.970
You observe a difference,
here, of the number

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.480
of visits for diabetes
for the population

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.090
that had the event versus
the other population.
