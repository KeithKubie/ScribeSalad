00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.130
Hello there,
Mr Ruben [inaudible].

2
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.890
<v 1>All right,
Jp January one we got anything good for the people?</v>

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.870
<v 0>Well,
I don't know how good it is.
Um,</v>

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.180
I guess we're going to find out how good it is.
I,

5
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.410
it's not something I'm thrilled about by any stretch of the imagination.

6
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.770
So you and I have been talking for a couple of weeks now ever since this scandal

7
00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:26.310
around Carl Benjamin or Sargon of the cod broken.

8
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.163
We decided,

9
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.820
well a while back that we were going to while do a variety of things,
right?

10
00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:36.510
We were going to announce our departure from Patrion,

11
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.850
which is what we're doing in this video.

12
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.330
I'm going to leave Patriot on January 15th

13
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.860
<v 1>I also am going to leave Patrion on January 15th which by the way,</v>

14
00:00:47.861 --> 00:00:52.060
we should just be clear.
This is not something that we wanted to do.

15
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.840
We were both perfectly happy on Patriot and Patriot on,
at least for me,

16
00:00:55.841 --> 00:00:58.600
it's been the backbone of my show.

17
00:00:58.601 --> 00:01:03.440
I mean that's somewhere between 60 and 70% of our funding is through Patrion.

18
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.290
So this is not something we wanted to do.

19
00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:08.870
I know we're going to talk about a whole bunch of things in this reporting.
Uh,

20
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.730
but that New York Times article that came out,
the implication was,
oh,

21
00:01:12.731 --> 00:01:13.960
we're doing this for money.

22
00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:18.190
It's like we're taking a major hit right now and opening ourselves up to all

23
00:01:18.191 --> 00:01:19.024
sorts of risks.

24
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.460
So I'm going ahead and doing that because I believe we can do something better.

25
00:01:23.461 --> 00:01:26.500
We've got to figure out exactly what that is and that's what we're working on.

26
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.300
<v 0>So we can say two things.
I mean,
I,</v>

27
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.580
I'd also like to thank the patron people for what they did in the past because

28
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.660
they provided me with a tremendous amount of,
or the ability,

29
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.720
the opportunity to generate a tremendous amount of financial support at a time.

30
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:45.650
I really needed it.
And so I'm not happy in the least with what has happened.

31
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.250
I have thought about it a lot and believe that given patrons proclivity to

32
00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:53.210
sensor and the reasons that they're doing it,

33
00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:57.040
especially as I've looked more and more deeply into the reasons,
um,

34
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.770
particularly with regards to my discovery of the website changed the terms,

35
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.530
I've become increasingly convinced that it's unethical to continue my

36
00:02:10.221 --> 00:02:12.560
association with the company.
And I also agree,

37
00:02:12.561 --> 00:02:16.220
Jack Conti said in that New York Times article trying to justify,

38
00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:18.800
say Sam Harris's departure and are threatened departure,

39
00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:23.480
that it was motivated primarily by financial gain and like,

40
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.540
look,
I've got nothing against financial gain.
You know,

41
00:02:26.541 --> 00:02:28.940
I've said that from the beginning.
I,
and if,

42
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.150
if things that I'm doing generate an honest amount of money that I can put two

43
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.430
reasonable use than so much the better,

44
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.410
but mmm [inaudible] this is a major financial blow.

45
00:02:42.411 --> 00:02:44.810
I'm using the patron money for a variety of reasons.

46
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.470
Most particularly to support this educational endeavor that I've talked to

47
00:02:48.471 --> 00:02:51.830
people about.
Right.
Our attempt to build an online education system.

48
00:02:51.831 --> 00:02:53.780
And so like it's a major hit.

49
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.060
<v 1>Yeah.
And of course,
you know,
just to be clear,
it's like when,</v>

50
00:02:56.061 --> 00:02:57.580
when we're doing my show,

51
00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.490
I mean I don't have to tell about youtube demonetization,

52
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.550
but for example in my show a week or two ago with your mom too,

53
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:08.551
ed was demonetized by the algorithm then demonetized further after manual review

54
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:12.540
by a human,
so it's patriot,
it's the,
it's the supporters,

55
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.540
the individual people that allow us to go ahead and do more of these

56
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.170
controversial so to speak episodes.
So yeah,

57
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.260
just nothing that we're doing right now is against the people that have

58
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:25.560
supported us or our patrons or anything like that.
This is,

59
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.580
this is about making a stand against this ever moving encroachments on free

60
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:32.500
speech on free expression and the rest of it,

61
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:36.370
and it's like this is one that we just feel is the right one to make the move
on.

62
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.560
<v 0>And the reason that we jointly decided on January 15th while there was a couple</v>

63
00:03:40.561 --> 00:03:42.350
of reasons,
the first wisdom,

64
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.370
we thought that we might have something approximating an alternative potentially

65
00:03:47.371 --> 00:03:49.440
available for preliminary launch at that date.

66
00:03:49.441 --> 00:03:53.880
Although we've decided to delay that because the user interface needs work

67
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.010
because that's the other thing,
right?

68
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.050
Is that their needs perhaps to be a replacement for patron,

69
00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.460
if that's a possibility,

70
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.880
like it's not obvious to me that corporations can run platforms for untrammeled

71
00:04:06.551 --> 00:04:11.340
communication successfully on the net in today's climate and that food,

72
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.640
anything I might design,

73
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.600
<v 1>well let's not,
let's not gloss over that.</v>

74
00:04:14.601 --> 00:04:19.280
I mean it might be possible that the patrion method is not what's needed exactly

75
00:04:19.281 --> 00:04:20.450
for the future of the Internet.

76
00:04:20.451 --> 00:04:22.730
I mean this is what we're trying to figure out right now,

77
00:04:22.731 --> 00:04:25.160
which is why we've got every engineer,

78
00:04:25.161 --> 00:04:28.340
I mean people from Google and Facebook and Yahoo and everybody reaching out to

79
00:04:28.341 --> 00:04:32.270
us because it's like everyone's trying to solve this problem and it's still,

80
00:04:32.271 --> 00:04:34.760
I mean one of the things we've been talking about now for the last,

81
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.230
well it's really for the last year,

82
00:04:36.231 --> 00:04:41.231
but in intensely in the last month is what actually is the problem itself

83
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.440
because until we really figure out what the problem is.

84
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.050
<v 0>Well,
I think,
I think the problem is</v>

85
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.120
how to regulate an incredibly diverse range of opinions.

86
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.550
If such regulation needs to be instantiated,
we could take a limit case,

87
00:04:58.551 --> 00:05:01.940
for example,
the desire of companies like Facebook,

88
00:05:01.941 --> 00:05:05.210
not to have their platforms used for recruitment for Isis.

89
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.860
It's hard to make a case that that's not a reasonable restriction.
Right.

90
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.680
But then,
but then the next issue is

91
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.290
I think you could make an exception there because maybe you consider that a war

92
00:05:19.291 --> 00:05:21.080
time exception or something like that.

93
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.950
But then the fundamental problem to me seems to be,

94
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.500
and I'll return again to that change the terms website that a whole variety of

95
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.950
companies and organizations spearheaded in not least by the southern poverty law

96
00:05:36.231 --> 00:05:38.390
center,
that hateful organization

97
00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.700
that has decided that they're going to uh,

98
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.430
compel encourage.
Uh,
what

99
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.820
if fame,

100
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.820
perhaps companies that don't band together to what they see as hate speech.

101
00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.320
<v 1>Yeah.
And this is where,
well,</v>

102
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.980
this is where the moving line is the key part of this,

103
00:06:02.981 --> 00:06:07.180
because you can always find the free,
the most fringe cases.

104
00:06:07.181 --> 00:06:10.360
You can always find isis on one side and you know,

105
00:06:10.361 --> 00:06:12.280
the most fringe KKK,

106
00:06:12.281 --> 00:06:15.670
white supremacist group or whatever you want to call it on the other side.

107
00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.920
But let's not forget southern poverty law center.

108
00:06:17.921 --> 00:06:20.320
They've written things about you.
They've read things about me.

109
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.500
I on Hirsi Ali and marginalize and Sam Harris and I and a litany of Majid sued

110
00:06:27.611 --> 00:06:31.600
them to,
to actually want.
So there,
there is a push back,

111
00:06:31.601 --> 00:06:33.520
but this is just another level of the stand.

112
00:06:33.521 --> 00:06:38.521
It's like they cannot be trusted to be on the boards of any of these

113
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.480
organizations that are deciding what terms of service they are should have

114
00:06:42.481 --> 00:06:45.310
access.
It's really who should have access to the Internet.

115
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.790
<v 0>It's just,
it's worse than that,
Dave,</v>

116
00:06:49.791 --> 00:06:52.790
because when they start to pressure the credit card companies,

117
00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:56.360
and I would consider this a warning to everyone who's listening.
It's like,
okay,

118
00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.770
let's see,
let's think this through.

119
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.820
So the New York Times last week wrote an article about the credit cards.

120
00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:06.821
Complicity in loaning money to that terrible tiny minority of people who engaged

121
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:08.450
in mass shootings,
right?

122
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.560
Stating that it was the responsibility of the credit card companies to monitor

123
00:07:12.561 --> 00:07:15.990
and potentially prevent that activities.
Like,
okay,
so what's the,

124
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.090
what's the idea here?

125
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.600
The idea is that the companies to whom we have in trusted our monetary system in

126
00:07:24.261 --> 00:07:24.981
large parts,

127
00:07:24.981 --> 00:07:29.300
that would be the credit card companies now get to review our spending patterns

128
00:07:29.301 --> 00:07:32.480
to determine if what we purchase is in accordance with that,

129
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.780
with what they regard as morally acceptable.
Okay.
And,
and,

130
00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.900
and we think that's a good idea that that's where we're headed.

131
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:43.390
And Mastercard and visa and paypal are already starting to block people like

132
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:43.910
they brought,

133
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:48.690
mastercard was instrumental in blocking Spencer Roberts Benzer right.

134
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.180
<v 1>It's Robert Spencer not retreated spans here.</v>

135
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.310
<v 0>Yes.
It's the best selling author.
And the guy who runs,</v>

136
00:07:54.311 --> 00:07:59.080
she had watched mastercard required patron two d plot form him.

137
00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:02.550
<v 1>And just to be very clear,
they sent out a tweet,
which everyone can find.</v>

138
00:08:02.551 --> 00:08:05.970
I'm shocked that they haven't deleted it yet where they said that they,

139
00:08:05.971 --> 00:08:08.850
and they use this word,
which I think is the key to the whole thing.

140
00:08:08.851 --> 00:08:13.851
They said that they unfortunately had to delete his patrion because of

141
00:08:14.371 --> 00:08:18.450
mastercard.
So what are they actually saying?
There are these patriot and saying,

142
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.800
oh,
we didn't want to delete your page,
but mastercard forced our hand.

143
00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.570
I mean,
that is some deeply scary stuff.

144
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:29.170
<v 0>Yeah.
Well,
and we have to talk about hate speech because you know,</v>

145
00:08:29.171 --> 00:08:31.360
I think the whole concept of,
look,

146
00:08:31.361 --> 00:08:36.070
obviously there is people can be very nasty when they communicate,

147
00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:42.480
but the idea that there's an identifiable category and you can put boundaries

148
00:08:44.771 --> 00:08:46.510
around it and it hate speech,

149
00:08:46.511 --> 00:08:51.100
and then you can produce committees or deal with people on a one to one basis as

150
00:08:51.101 --> 00:08:55.030
patron is doing without any central policy or let's,

151
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.400
despite their central policy or that you could turn that into an algorithm that

152
00:08:59.401 --> 00:09:03.990
could validly identify hate speech without producing false positives,
right.

153
00:09:03.991 --> 00:09:06.720
Without accusing people who shouldn't be accused of violating.

154
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:11.420
All of that is just completely,
it's just bakers,
the imagination as far as that.

155
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:12.651
<v 1>Oh,
of course.</v>

156
00:09:12.651 --> 00:09:16.700
And you're also just opening a Pandora's box from hell because just in the last

157
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:17.540
couple of days,
I don't know if you saw this,

158
00:09:17.541 --> 00:09:21.440
but the women's march in California canceled their rally because they felt that

159
00:09:21.441 --> 00:09:22.460
it was too white.

160
00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:26.870
Now imagine if they canceled their rally because it was too black or too

161
00:09:26.871 --> 00:09:29.780
anything else.
It's like,
so is that now count as,
hey,

162
00:09:29.781 --> 00:09:31.950
are you guys now being racist against white people?

163
00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.820
Now we know that that wouldn't be a problem for these guys.

164
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.880
<v 0>One of the things that I can't fathom in some senses the lack of imagination on</v>

165
00:09:40.281 --> 00:09:44.930
the part of the people who are engaging in censorship of what they regard as

166
00:09:44.931 --> 00:09:47.720
hate speech.
Like there's an old military adage,

167
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:51.770
which is that if you intend to weapon it will be used by your enemy within 15

168
00:09:51.771 --> 00:09:55.960
years.
Okay.
So why,
what makes the people on the,

169
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.610
on the left?
Because they're the ones who are doing this.

170
00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:04.070
As you can clearly see in the,
uh,
change the terms website,

171
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:09.350
what makes them so sure that exactly the same tactics won't be used against
them.

172
00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.450
Like at the drop of a hat once,

173
00:10:11.451 --> 00:10:14.420
once the tactics have been validated and put in place.

174
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.620
<v 1>I think it's either,</v>

175
00:10:15.621 --> 00:10:19.250
it's either just very short sightedness on their hand or they think that they

176
00:10:19.251 --> 00:10:24.050
can actually stamp out enough hate within that very small window before it would

177
00:10:24.051 --> 00:10:26.780
turn on them.
Or they just don't think these things fully through.

178
00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:30.040
<v 0>Yeah.
Or,
or there's another,
there's another possibility too,</v>

179
00:10:30.041 --> 00:10:34.270
which is that there are so opposed to the fundamental structures of the West

180
00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:38.820
that let's say in regard to Ms,
so patriarchal,
oppressive,

181
00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:42.670
that they'd be willing to take the risk of sacrificing their own free speech

182
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:46.900
just to have there what have their destructive way,

183
00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.040
something like that.

184
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.470
<v 1>We should also acknowledge that in the New York Times piece that was written,</v>

185
00:10:52.471 --> 00:10:53.820
which was written by Nellie Bowles,

186
00:10:53.821 --> 00:10:57.930
who wrote the now infamous piece about you and enforcement alchemy,

187
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.960
that the quote that Jacqueline Hart,

188
00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:04.050
who is the head of trust and safety over patrion.

189
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:05.010
<v 0>Right,
good.</v>

190
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:08.310
And there's no hidden who has no grounding in philosophy or any of the

191
00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.750
background training that might be necessary to even remotely begin to

192
00:11:12.751 --> 00:11:14.670
participate properly in such a thing.

193
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:15.571
<v 1>No,
of course not.</v>

194
00:11:15.571 --> 00:11:20.571
But so the quote that she gave Nellie in the article said that you can't say

195
00:11:20.611 --> 00:11:25.110
these what loosely quoting this now you can't say these words on our platform

196
00:11:25.111 --> 00:11:29.490
referring to Carl,
referring to him saying the n word in that video,
which we,

197
00:11:29.491 --> 00:11:31.620
which we know they were using out of context and all that.

198
00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:33.720
But he never set it on their platform.

199
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.990
He never said it on Patrion and he didn't even say it on his own channel.

200
00:11:36.991 --> 00:11:40.750
That was you,
you know,
using Patrion for the funding.
So there was a,

201
00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.970
it's almost the entire story was built on quicksand that tried to put out there

202
00:11:45.971 --> 00:11:46.681
on the New York Times.
Now,

203
00:11:46.681 --> 00:11:51.030
of course myself and many other people tweet the hell out of it and gets

204
00:11:51.031 --> 00:11:55.720
hundreds and thousands probably of and comments to Nellie and she doesn't

205
00:11:55.721 --> 00:12:00.430
respond,
nor does the New York Times issue any sort of correction about the most

206
00:12:00.431 --> 00:12:04.630
fundamental piece of the story was alive and they don't.

207
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.370
They don't have a problem doing that.

208
00:12:06.371 --> 00:12:09.850
So that's why this is so layered about speech and finance.

209
00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:15.080
<v 0>And John was so amazing to see journalists take the journals.</v>

210
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.450
One of the things that happened in Canada to me was that,
you know,

211
00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:25.610
after I made the initial videos that caused such a political furor was that once

212
00:12:25.681 --> 00:12:28.860
the main journalists in Canada sort of figured out what I was doing,

213
00:12:28.861 --> 00:12:32.160
they all came out in my support.
Like the post media group,

214
00:12:32.161 --> 00:12:35.970
which is 200 newspapers all came out to support what I was doing because they

215
00:12:35.971 --> 00:12:38.580
realize that,
oh,
they're journalists.

216
00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.070
Apart from Comedians,

217
00:12:41.071 --> 00:12:46.071
there isn't anybody who relies more on the principle of free speech to justify

218
00:12:46.231 --> 00:12:50.370
and allow their occupation even to exist for the New York Times.

219
00:12:50.371 --> 00:12:55.371
Not Too understand that this threat is that also a threat to everything upon

220
00:12:56.331 --> 00:13:00.530
which their entire organization has been predicated is also an indication of

221
00:13:00.531 --> 00:13:04.040
that same kind of willful blindness that we've already been discussing.

222
00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.630
But having said that,

223
00:13:05.631 --> 00:13:09.400
I would still like to say that I think the biggest danger here I really,

224
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:14.440
and it's just made my jaw drop over the last couple of weeks thinking about it,

225
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:19.120
is the fact that the credit card companies are now taking it upon themselves to

226
00:13:19.121 --> 00:13:23.890
potentially police the activities of their users.
He's like,
my God.

227
00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:28.030
Is that really,
I just,
I just can't believe that we,

228
00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:33.490
any sensible person would think that through and then want to live in a society

229
00:13:33.491 --> 00:13:38.491
where your spending habits are being monitored by the company that basically

230
00:13:38.861 --> 00:13:43.560
produces your money.
Think of anything more totalitarian than that.

231
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:46.440
<v 1>So loosely quote our friend Eric Weinstein.</v>

232
00:13:46.441 --> 00:13:49.110
Should Republicans be allowed to use roads that,

233
00:13:49.111 --> 00:13:51.180
that sort of where we're headed here,

234
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:55.530
that every public good will be eventually decided,

235
00:13:55.531 --> 00:13:58.650
can you access to it?
Will you have access to water?
It should,
uh,

236
00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.420
should an avowed white supremacist right now that is potentially watching this

237
00:14:03.421 --> 00:14:06.240
or lives in America somewhere.
She's one of the 50 of the,

238
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:12.750
one of the 42 of them should,
should they have access to water at their home?

239
00:14:12.751 --> 00:14:16.650
Should they allow it to be able to get electricity at their home or phone lines

240
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:20.160
or all of these things?
I mean,
this is where we're headed.

241
00:14:20.161 --> 00:14:24.540
Especially when you ever expand the definition of who that person is.

242
00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:26.150
<v 0>Yeah.
They won't in China.</v>

243
00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:30.280
<v 1>Right?
Well,
that's where they're going.
Right?
So is that the test case?</v>

244
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.500
<v 0>Well,
I think it's,</v>

245
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:37.210
it's an indication that the fact that the Chinese have been tempted into this is

246
00:14:37.211 --> 00:14:41.380
also an indication of the temptation.
It's intrinsic in the technological power.

247
00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.090
The credit card companies are in a weird situation as far as I'm concerned,

248
00:14:45.091 --> 00:14:50.091
because the only reason they work at all is because people actually trust them

249
00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:55.130
completely,
right?
It's like,
oh,
you're just a proxy for money.

250
00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.080
Like you're a proxy for cash.
In fact,

251
00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.350
that's basically how the mastercard advertises itself,
right?

252
00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:05.580
So you're a proxy for cash and the government doesn't watch what you spend your

253
00:15:05.581 --> 00:15:10.370
money on except in extraordinary,
it's extraordinarily limited cases.
I mean,

254
00:15:10.371 --> 00:15:12.440
there are money laundering laws and so forth,

255
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.270
but that's a direct violation of a law,
right?

256
00:15:15.271 --> 00:15:19.290
That's part of tracking down criminal activity that has nothing to do so far

257
00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:24.390
with,
with hate speech,
which by the way,
is protected by the first amendment.

258
00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:28.770
So,
or which means in some sense that it doesn't exist,
you know,
as,

259
00:15:28.771 --> 00:15:32.570
as illegal as illegal,
uh,
uh,
concept.

260
00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:34.470
But this is my Canada,

261
00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:37.770
<v 1>which is,
we shouldn't go over that fact too because you know,
Jordan,</v>

262
00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:42.750
we just did however many countries in Europe and we're going to go back this

263
00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:47.750
spring and it's like everybody that we met was jealous of the freedoms that we

264
00:15:47.881 --> 00:15:51.720
have in the United States relative to speech.
You know what I mean?

265
00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:54.420
Everybody that would come up to us after the show,
holy cow,

266
00:15:54.421 --> 00:15:57.810
I wish we could say that and I wish we didn't worry about this or that or jokes

267
00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:58.771
or the rest of it.

268
00:15:58.771 --> 00:16:02.790
And we did that video in Oslo where you talked about Yankila and it's like

269
00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.950
they're jealous of our freedom.

270
00:16:04.951 --> 00:16:07.650
So we should be very clear here that though you're right,

271
00:16:07.651 --> 00:16:11.340
because we now have a payment processor issue,

272
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:16.640
which is in indirect connection to whatever it is that we're trying to build out

273
00:16:17.071 --> 00:16:20.450
here.
And we're still,
it's a little amorphous at the moment.
Um,

274
00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:23.640
is that it's changing because a lot of people are saying,
all right,

275
00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:26.430
you guys really want to solve this,
then you have to go full.

276
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.480
Crypto video has to be hosted crypto.
Yeah.

277
00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:34.270
The finances have to be hosted or have to be done via critical.

278
00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.840
All of these things,
these are,
these are major,

279
00:16:36.841 --> 00:16:39.540
major things that we're trying to figure out on every front.

280
00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:43.530
Certain payment processors are a little more willing to stand up to the mob than

281
00:16:43.531 --> 00:16:45.240
others.
So we're talking to different people.

282
00:16:45.241 --> 00:16:47.080
I mean we'll really go on on everything.

283
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:48.301
<v 0>That's right.
Well,</v>

284
00:16:48.301 --> 00:16:51.870
the tentative platform that we're trying to build and to build carefully,

285
00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:57.590
we'll provide the possibility of multiple payment portals in the hope that they

286
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:03.800
creators will be less susceptible to being rapidly shutdown or perhaps shutdown

287
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.750
at all.
But you know,

288
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:10.870
only a fool would say that that problem is going to be definitively solve.

289
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:15.660
I have some real increasing sympathy for the crypto currency types.
No,

290
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:19.080
but the problem there is that as far as I can tell,

291
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:24.360
their solution is still sufficiently technically complex to keep it out of the

292
00:17:24.361 --> 00:17:29.361
mainstream use and also not sufficiently liquid to actually constitute a

293
00:17:30.881 --> 00:17:34.210
realistic current replacement even for credit cards.

294
00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:34.991
<v 1>Right.</v>

295
00:17:34.991 --> 00:17:38.680
So one of the things we've been discussing is that it's almost like we have to

296
00:17:38.681 --> 00:17:42.880
have several markers down the road to figure out what the real solution is

297
00:17:42.881 --> 00:17:47.881
because not everything can be solved in terms of terms of service tomorrow

298
00:17:48.311 --> 00:17:50.040
related to everyone that exists.

299
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.870
Not Everything can be solved tomorrow related to the payment processors may be

300
00:17:54.871 --> 00:17:57.000
crypto really is the ultimate answer,

301
00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:01.140
but it's not the answer tomorrow for everything.
So we're,
we're really,

302
00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.250
we're plotting out a lot here,

303
00:18:03.251 --> 00:18:08.020
but it seems like a fresh and sort of fitting way to start the year.
I think

304
00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:12.880
<v 0>so.
And so for January 15th I mean,
part of the reason that we picked that date,</v>

305
00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:14.261
as I said before,

306
00:18:14.261 --> 00:18:17.500
it was because we thought we might have something to announce with regards to an

307
00:18:17.501 --> 00:18:22.320
alternative platform,
but no saner heads have prevailed in that,
in that

308
00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:24.523
<v 1>calmer heads.</v>

309
00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:25.820
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

310
00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:29.930
And also we wanted to give people an opportunity to decide what they wanted to

311
00:18:29.931 --> 00:18:31.880
do without just springing it on them.
I mean,

312
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:36.440
I have some real admiration for Harris for acting so immediately and

313
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:37.620
definitively.

314
00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:41.300
<v 1>Yeah.
And it's funny,
you know,
I saw some criticism,
it's like,
all right,</v>

315
00:18:41.301 --> 00:18:44.510
well Sam dropped immediately and look you and Peter said you're still there and

316
00:18:44.511 --> 00:18:45.650
you're talking about this whole thing.

317
00:18:45.651 --> 00:18:48.350
And it's like we all have different things to consider.

318
00:18:48.351 --> 00:18:51.470
We all have different family situations,
different business situations,

319
00:18:51.471 --> 00:18:53.270
different livelihoods situations,
everything.

320
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.410
So it's like we were really trying to just plot this thing out properly and to

321
00:18:57.411 --> 00:19:01.250
be very clear,
we're still in the process of that.
So for any,

322
00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:03.260
so for anyone watching this right now,

323
00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:07.520
if you're supporting Jordan on Patrion or you're supporting me on Patrion or

324
00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:11.990
both of us or whatever it is,
it's like now we're trying to shift people

325
00:19:11.991 --> 00:19:16.991
because@leastbygettingoffpatrionatthemomentweremoveoneofthemiddlemenandyoucannowgodirectlygotodirectlytojordanbpetersondotcomororgavereuben.com

326
00:19:21.921 --> 00:19:24.620
and you can at least if you want to donate,

327
00:19:24.621 --> 00:19:28.130
you can do that for now while we figure out everything else.

328
00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:31.940
And that way we removed one of the pieces here because there's just too many

329
00:19:31.941 --> 00:19:34.970
pieces here that,
that are creating this mess.

330
00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:40.060
<v 0>I think it's too much to hope for a perfect solution to a very complex problem.</v>

331
00:19:40.061 --> 00:19:41.310
And um,

332
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:46.470
we're muddling through the best we can and hopefully people will regard our

333
00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:49.780
decision joint decision too.

334
00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:54.080
Leave Patrion as a step in the right direction,

335
00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:57.730
however imperfectly taken.
Yeah.

336
00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:01.240
<v 1>Well look,
I think I said it before,
but I really think that,</v>

337
00:20:01.241 --> 00:20:04.420
and maybe this will be the defining,
uh,

338
00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:10.170
idea of 2019 is that I think we're basically at the point where people have to

339
00:20:10.961 --> 00:20:15.460
decide what sort of internet they want.
And it's not only what sort of internet,

340
00:20:15.461 --> 00:20:20.461
it's really what sort of freedom do you want in a digital world and either

341
00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:22.900
aren't,
do you want any or do you want any,

342
00:20:22.901 --> 00:20:25.860
and maybe maybe you don't or you don't want to think about it and you just want

343
00:20:25.861 --> 00:20:28.690
to play fortnight and watch porn and never think it through

344
00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.620
<v 0>assuming that you'll be allowed to watch porn.
Right?</v>

345
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:37.020
So that now you really are playing or played for that matter.
Right.

346
00:20:37.021 --> 00:20:41.100
So the the games of violence should be allowed.

347
00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.870
What makes you think that credit card companies should allow you to use their,

348
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.690
their funds to purchase first shoot,
first person shooter games for example,
or,

349
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:51.490
or any game where anyone is killed.

350
00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:53.550
<v 1>No,
you're totally right.
That's,</v>

351
00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:57.540
I mean that sounds completely dystopian and yet it seems like that would just be

352
00:20:57.541 --> 00:21:00.450
the next encroachment that we would see here.
So the point at the end,

353
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:05.010
at the end of this is I think everyone for 2019 since it's the first day of the

354
00:21:05.011 --> 00:21:08.880
year,
it's like you have to think about what type of Internet do you want,

355
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.990
what type of ability to communicate with other people do you want?

356
00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.530
And if you want something that's a little better than what we've got right now,

357
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.090
we better stand up quick because this window,
we know it's closing slowly,

358
00:21:21.091 --> 00:21:24.460
but we never know when it's going to really slap shot quick.
So,

359
00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:28.110
so we're working on it and,
and I think people are ready to stand up with us.

360
00:21:28.111 --> 00:21:28.660
I really do.

361
00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:30.820
<v 0>We might also suggest to people,</v>

362
00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:35.110
and this is of course up to everyone who's viewing this to decide,
but you know,

363
00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:41.160
couple of thousand letters to mastercard and paypal and visa indicating

364
00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:47.610
pronounced displeasure at their plans to become a custodians of the monetary

365
00:21:48.881 --> 00:21:52.510
supply for ethical reasons might also be an order.
You know,

366
00:21:52.511 --> 00:21:55.660
these companies are responsive to public pressure,

367
00:21:55.661 --> 00:21:59.710
which is perhaps partly why they're determining to play the role of censor to

368
00:21:59.711 --> 00:22:02.920
begin with.
You know,
there they are facing pressure from these,

369
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:07.940
let's call them activist interest groups who again are outlined on changed the

370
00:22:07.941 --> 00:22:09.380
terms on the website,

371
00:22:09.381 --> 00:22:14.150
change the terms and they're responding to public pressure and too,

372
00:22:14.151 --> 00:22:16.990
so that's understandable.
MMM.

373
00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:22.200
It's understandable,
but
yeah,

374
00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:27.380
but inexcusable in certain in a certain regard,

375
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:32.470
but the right way perhaps to begin to push back is to let the credit card

376
00:22:32.601 --> 00:22:37.601
companies know that there's a constituency on the other side that I s I suspect

377
00:22:38.721 --> 00:22:42.140
constitutes the vast majority of credit card users.

378
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:46.100
The silent middle majority of let's say,

379
00:22:46.101 --> 00:22:49.850
Western society who are neither radically right nor radically left,

380
00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:53.990
who would just assume not have their spending habits monitored by giant

381
00:22:53.991 --> 00:22:54.920
corporations.

382
00:22:55.730 --> 00:23:00.730
It's funny too that the left is so opposed to corporate entities,

383
00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:05.690
you know,
on principle,
especially to sizable ones and you know,

384
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:10.750
have a certain justification for being skeptical about the moral direction of

385
00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.170
very large organizations,
um,

386
00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:18.790
are so eager to hand over the reigns of social control to precisely the

387
00:23:19.221 --> 00:23:23.180
companies you'd think they would be least likely to crawl into bed with.
I mean,

388
00:23:23.181 --> 00:23:25.610
really mastercard visa.
It's like right.

389
00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.110
<v 1>Or at the same time though,</v>

390
00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:30.380
they want to hand over more control to the government to handle these things.

391
00:23:30.381 --> 00:23:34.040
And we should be pretty clear that in the last couple of weeks that we've been

392
00:23:34.041 --> 00:23:38.100
discussing this,
every single discussion that we've had about this,

393
00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:40.800
I don't think once did we entertain the idea of,
Oh,

394
00:23:40.801 --> 00:23:44.270
we've got to get the government involved to fix this thing.
I mean there,

395
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:49.160
there could be,
as you,
as you referenced earlier,
there could be specific legal,

396
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:54.230
uh,
issues that pop up related to collusion and signed a couple of other things.

397
00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:59.120
Cartel develop car t yeah.
Like that sort of thing.
Yeah.
But the beauty of this,

398
00:23:59.121 --> 00:24:01.600
and again,
why I'm so I'm,
I'm watching my,

399
00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:04.180
my monthly rev of my company go down even though we're,

400
00:24:04.181 --> 00:24:06.530
we're making some of it back,
but as I'm watching that happen,

401
00:24:06.531 --> 00:24:08.330
as I said to you last time,
I'm,

402
00:24:08.331 --> 00:24:13.331
I'm incredibly inspired right now because literally thousands of emails are

403
00:24:13.431 --> 00:24:16.940
pouring in from people that want to work with us,
that want to help us,

404
00:24:16.941 --> 00:24:21.370
that want to figure out how to fund things or that want to work as engineers in

405
00:24:21.371 --> 00:24:25.310
the rest of it.
And that tells you that,
that people are,

406
00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:29.420
people are afraid and they see this problem and they just want some solutions

407
00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:32.690
and,
and maybe there isn't an easy solution.
As you said

408
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:33.610
<v 0>there.</v>

409
00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:37.520
I've also been talking with you online with a whole bunch of the people who've

410
00:24:37.521 --> 00:24:41.350
been loosely aggregated under the ages of the intellectual dark web.

411
00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:45.080
And that's probably 30 people that,
that we've been communicating with,

412
00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:47.060
with a variety of peripheral people.

413
00:24:47.061 --> 00:24:52.061
And it's also useful to let people know that every one of those people is

414
00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:57.730
unbelievably concerned about what happened to Carl Benjamin to start,
start,

415
00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.330
go on.
And even more so

416
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:05.830
dumbstruck by the collusion of the payment processing companies and,

417
00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:11.530
and the emergence of this activists infrastructure online that's devoted

418
00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:15.750
specifically to the suppression of free speech.

419
00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:20.460
<v 1>Yeah.
So,
and also we should also note that within that group of say 30 or so,</v>

420
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:23.550
my people,
we all sort of w look,

421
00:25:23.551 --> 00:25:26.880
we agree on basic fundamental principles related to free speech and things like

422
00:25:26.881 --> 00:25:30.270
that,
but there's a lot of disagreement on how to move forward with this.
I mean,

423
00:25:30.271 --> 00:25:33.480
we're talking it out respectfully as we always do,
but some people are saying,

424
00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.300
stay in fight on Patrion because this is how,
you know,

425
00:25:36.301 --> 00:25:38.970
they're small enough say that you might get them to change.

426
00:25:38.971 --> 00:25:42.690
Some people are saying you got to go when people are saying some version of,

427
00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:43.960
you know,
mixing those

428
00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:47.150
<v 0>and nobody's clear about the proper pathway forward.</v>

429
00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:49.610
<v 1>Yeah.
But that's again,</v>

430
00:25:49.611 --> 00:25:53.330
I mean I think this is what the brilliance of human ingenuity is all about.

431
00:25:53.331 --> 00:25:56.660
It's like where they're going to be some pitfalls in front of us and staying

432
00:25:56.661 --> 00:25:58.530
would have its risks and leaving would habits,

433
00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.470
risks and we're all going to do what we think

434
00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:04.080
<v 0>we've already discussed that too,
right,
is that there's,
there's no,</v>

435
00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:09.170
there's no known risk option here and like and so we're taking the risk of

436
00:26:10.121 --> 00:26:12.790
leaving and then we're going to make the best of it.

437
00:26:12.791 --> 00:26:15.430
I mean often when you take a risk often in life,

438
00:26:15.431 --> 00:26:19.360
all you have is a choice between two different risks and sometimes neither of

439
00:26:19.361 --> 00:26:24.190
them are risks you would like to take.
Then in the aftermath of the decision,

440
00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:28.120
a new field of possibility opens up in front of you too and whether or not you

441
00:26:28.121 --> 00:26:29.170
made the right decision,

442
00:26:29.171 --> 00:26:33.490
he's actually a consequence of how well you manage the aftermath of the
decision.

443
00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:35.020
So we'll,

444
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:39.580
we'll keep talking over the next couple of months in on like I've got good

445
00:26:39.581 --> 00:26:43.840
people working on this alternative,
you know,
which,

446
00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:47.770
which was as I mentioned in other places,

447
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:53.140
started seven months ago or so.
And good people supervising it,

448
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:57.180
whether it'll turn out to be a viable product and whether or not we can figure

449
00:26:57.181 --> 00:27:00.990
out how to implement it in a sustainable way that actually addresses these

450
00:27:00.991 --> 00:27:03.880
issues in a reasonable manner remains to be seen.

451
00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:07.370
<v 1>Yeah.
On a,
on a personal note,
just because,
uh,
you know,</v>

452
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:10.920
I got to see you a couple of days before Christmas in West Palm Beach and we had

453
00:27:10.921 --> 00:27:13.830
dinner with that with your family and your kids and everything hasn't,

454
00:27:13.831 --> 00:27:16.230
it's sorta been nice cause I did a week with uh,

455
00:27:16.231 --> 00:27:18.960
with my brother and sister and nieces and nephews over Christmas.

456
00:27:18.961 --> 00:27:22.710
Also sort of circling back to family on some of this.

457
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.760
It's given me a lot of perspective.
You know,
it it mean cause I'm getting,

458
00:27:26.761 --> 00:27:29.790
I'm getting reached out by so many different people on all different fronts.

459
00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:33.990
But then to have sort of a close knit group of people that really do have your

460
00:27:33.991 --> 00:27:38.550
interests in mind and all those things
with your kids at dinner,

461
00:27:38.551 --> 00:27:41.430
it was like,
oh these are good people to

462
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:46.000
<v 0>well there's unanimity on the part of the people around me that the proper thing</v>

463
00:27:46.001 --> 00:27:47.370
to do is twofold.

464
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:52.470
One is to separate myself from patron in accordance with our discussions in the

465
00:27:52.601 --> 00:27:57.601
second is to proceed with exceeding caution and not over promise,

466
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.390
um,
or try to deliver to quickly a solution.

467
00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:06.860
Although to work on that carefully.
So that's what we've decided to do.

468
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.970
<v 1>Yeah.
So let's just be crystal clear on that latter,
latter part.</v>

469
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.930
We are working on this.
We're going to be deliberate.
We're going to be cautious.

470
00:28:13.931 --> 00:28:17.080
We understand that it can't be solved tomorrow.

471
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:20.530
We understand that there's a financial part of free speech part and everything

472
00:28:20.531 --> 00:28:23.700
else and we're just going to lay these things out in front of us and we're going

473
00:28:23.701 --> 00:28:26.740
to keep working through it with a lot of the people that you guys know and trust

474
00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:30.280
and,
and,
and with,
with some other people.
And,

475
00:28:30.281 --> 00:28:32.500
and hearing from random people that had given us ideas.

476
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:35.200
I mean I've been forwarding you emails left and right where people are like,

477
00:28:35.201 --> 00:28:38.760
you know,
this might be the pet the pressure point you might want to go after.

478
00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:40.210
So we're just going to keep going.

479
00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:45.850
<v 0>Yup,
Yup.
Okay.
Well I got a couple of things to end this.</v>

480
00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:47.410
I guess let's summarize it then.

481
00:28:47.411 --> 00:28:50.910
I've got a couple of things just to let people know about.
Sure.
So,
um,

482
00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:54.130
uh,
well the first is,

483
00:28:54.131 --> 00:28:57.690
so we're both leaving on January 15th in a second is we're working on this

484
00:28:57.691 --> 00:29:02.190
platform and the third is a warning to people to keep a close eye on what the

485
00:29:02.191 --> 00:29:05.280
credit card companies are up to because that's a really bad thing in my

486
00:29:05.281 --> 00:29:08.920
estimation.
I guess that's probably it on my front.

487
00:29:08.921 --> 00:29:10.660
I have a talk coming up in Zurich.

488
00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:15.640
I have a couple of talks in California in January.
I'll be with you on those.

489
00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:16.330
Yup.

490
00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:20.980
And the tickets to those are available on my website@jordanbpeterson.com and the

491
00:29:20.981 --> 00:29:25.610
final thing is I also set up with my partners as a new year's,
uh,

492
00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:30.780
token,
let's say that future authoring program from the self authoring suite.

493
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:36.130
And we put it up at 50% off with the code and why 2019.

494
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:40.410
And so if anybody's out there wants to make some personal,

495
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:43.510
what do you call those resolutions for the new year,

496
00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:46.270
then this program is an ideal way of doing that.

497
00:29:46.271 --> 00:29:50.350
And so that's also partly a thank you to everyone who,
um,

498
00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:54.420
has been so supportive and interested in the last year.

499
00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:59.740
And so I think that's basically,
I think that's basically that.

500
00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.780
<v 1>No,
I think that's basically it.
So I'll just quickly,
uh,
you know,</v>

501
00:30:04.781 --> 00:30:07.930
give a shout out to Dave rubin.com/donate and what we're,

502
00:30:07.931 --> 00:30:10.510
what we're trying to do,
and I know you're trying to do this as well,

503
00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:13.870
is that for whoever signs up now and we're,
we're taking,
it's one time,

504
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:15.790
monthly donations that you can do.

505
00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:19.900
There are going to be ways that we think once we build out whatever it is we're

506
00:30:19.901 --> 00:30:23.110
working on that uh,
that it'll all be able to be flipped into that.

507
00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:26.560
So it's not like we're going to have people constantly having to start new

508
00:30:26.561 --> 00:30:30.340
accounts or,
or you know,
sign up for new things or anything like that.

509
00:30:30.341 --> 00:30:33.520
We're trying to make this as easy as possible for everybody and they'll look,

510
00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:34.960
there's going to be some bumps,
but

511
00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:36.860
<v 0>yeah,
this is it.</v>

512
00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:41.130
That's one to say about 2019 there's going to bed.

513
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.610
<v 1>There's going to be some bumps.
Well,
I don't know if you know this Jordan,</v>

514
00:30:44.611 --> 00:30:47.280
but we got an American election come and they year after that.
So

515
00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:52.340
<v 0>Mr Ruben,
happy new year.</v>

516
00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:53.910
<v 1>All right,
happy new year,
brother.</v>

517
00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.010
I'll see you in a in Cali and a couple of weeks.

518
00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:58.320
<v 0>Bye for now.</v>
