00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.776
Vanessa Garrison: I am Vanessa,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.416
daughter of Annette,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.216
daughter of Olympia,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.776
daughter of Melvina,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.096
daughter of Katie, born 1878,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.880
Parish County, Louisiana.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.496
T. Morgan Dixon: And my name is Morgan,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.256
daughter of Carol,
daughter of Letha, daughter of Willie,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.656
daughter of Sarah,
born 1849 in Bardstown, Kentucky.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.696
VG: And in the tradition of our families,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.016
the great oral tradition
of almost every Black church we know

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.936
honoring the culture
from which we draw so much power,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.416
we're gonna start the way our mommas
and grandmas would want us to start.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.096
TMD: In prayer. Let the words of my mouth,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.256
the meditation of our hearts,
be acceptable in thy sight,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.680
oh Lord, my strength and my redeemer.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.496
VG: We call the names and rituals
of our ancestors into this room today

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.976
because from them we received
a powerful blueprint for survival,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.576
strategies and tactics for healing
carried across oceans by African women,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.936
passed down to generations
of Black women in America

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.296
who used those skills
to navigate institutions of slavery

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.216
and state-sponsored discrimination

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.536
in order that we might
stand on this stage.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.296
We walk in the footsteps of those women,

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.616
our foremothers, legends

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.576
like Ella Baker, Septima Clark,
Fannie Lou Hamer,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.496
from whom we learned
the power of organizing

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.456
after she would had
single-handedly registered

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.280
60,000 voters in Jim Crow Mississippi.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.336
TMD: 60,000 is a lot of people,
so if you can imagine

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.816
me and Vanessa inspiring
60,000 women to walk with us last year,

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.320
we were fired up.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.776
But today, 100,000 Black women and girls
stand on this stage with us.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.456
We are committed to healing ourselves,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.256
to lacing up our sneakers,
to walking out of our front door

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.816
every single day for total healing
and transformation in our communities,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.456
because we understand

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.976
that we are in the footsteps
of a civil rights legacy

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.096
like no other time before,

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.056
and that we are facing a health crisis
like never ever before.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.096
And so we've had
a lot of moments, great moments,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.576
including the time we had on our pajamas,
we were working on our computer

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.656
and Michelle Obama emailed us
and invited us to the White House,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.056
and we thought it was spam.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.496
But this moment here is an opportunity.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.256
It is an opportunity
that we don't take for granted,

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.016
and so we thought long and hard
about how we would use it.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.736
Would we talk to the women
we hope to inspire,

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.496
a million in the next year,

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.160
or would we talk to you?

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.560
We decided to talk to you,

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.040
and to talk to you about a question
that we get all the time,

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.656
so that the millions of women
who hopefully will watch this

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.360
will never have to answer it again.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.136
It is: Why are Black women dying

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.096
faster and at higher rates

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.576
than any other group of people in America

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.840
from preventable,
obesity-related diseases?

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.176
The question hurts me.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.616
I'm shaking a little bit.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.296
It feels value-laden.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.160
It hurts my body because the weight
represents so much.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.856
But we're going to talk about it

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.136
and invite you into
an inside conversation today

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.360
because it is necessary,
and because we need you.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.336
VG: Each night,
before the first day of school,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.016
my grandmother
would sit me next to the stove

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.856
and with expert precision
use a hot comb to press my hair.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.376
My grandmother was legendary, big, loud.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.336
She filled up a room with laughter
and oftentimes curse words.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.336
She cooked a mean peach cobbler,

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.896
had 11 children,
a house full of grandchildren,

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.376
and like every Black woman I know,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.136
like most all women I know,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.496
she had prioritized the care of others
over caring for herself.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.256
We measured her strength by her capacity
to endure pain and suffering.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.136
We celebrated her for it,
and our choice would prove to be deadly.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.496
One night after pressing my hair
before the first day of eighth grade,

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.336
my grandmother went to bed
and never woke up,

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.696
dead at 66 years old from a heart attack.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.576
By the time I would graduate college,

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.096
I would lose two more beloved
family members to chronic disease:

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.456
my aunt Diane, dead at 55,
my aunt Tricia, dead at 63.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.296
After living with these losses,
the hole that they left,

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.815
I decided to calculate the life expectancy
of the women in my family.

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:31.720
Staring back at me, the number 65.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.896
I knew I could not sit by

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.136
and watch another woman I loved
die an early death.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.856
TMD: So we don't usually
put our business in the streets.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.336
Let's just put that out there.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.296
But I have to tell you the statistics.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.096
Black women are dying at alarming rates,

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.976
and I used to be a classroom teacher,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.896
and I was at South Atlanta High School,

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.256
and I remember standing
in front of my classroom,

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.976
and I remember a statistic
that half of Black girls will get diabetes

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.120
unless diet and levels of activity change.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.760
Half of the girls in my classroom.
So I couldn't teach anymore.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.616
So I started taking girls hiking,
which is why we're called GirlTrek,

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.856
but Vanessa was like,

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.056
that is not going to move the dial
on the health crisis; it's cute.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.936
She was like, it's a cute hiking club.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.616
So what we thought

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.800
is if we could rally
a million of their mothers ...

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.865
82 percent of Black women
are over a healthy weight right now.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.600
53 percent of us are obese.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.840
But the number that I cannot,

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.416
that I cannot get out of my head

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.816
is that every single day in America,

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.376
137 Black women

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.496
die from a preventable disease,

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.736
heart disease.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.960
That's every 11 minutes.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.136
137 is more than gun violence,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.656
cigarette smoking and HIV combined,

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.016
every day.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.696
It is roughly the amount of people

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.120
that were on my plane
from New Jersey to Vancouver.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.856
Can you imagine that?

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.336
A plane filled with Black women
crashing to the ground every day,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.840
and no one is talking about it.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.936
VG: So the question that you're all
asking yourselves right now is why?

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.056
Why are Black women dying?
We asked ourselves that same question.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.496
Why is what's out there
not working for them?

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.176
Private weight loss companies,
government interventions,

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.536
public health campaigns.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.016
I'm going to tell you why:

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.656
because they focus on weight loss

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.176
or looking good in skinny jeans

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.216
without acknowledging the trauma

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.136
that Black women
hold in our bellies and bones,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.976
that has been embedded in our very DNA.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.336
The best advice
from hospitals and doctors,

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.856
the best medications
from pharmaceutical companies

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.256
to treat the congestive heart failure
of my grandmother didn't work

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.896
because they didn't acknowledge
the systemic racism

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.656
that she had dealt with since birth.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.696
(Applause)

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.056
A divestment in schools,
discriminatory housing practices,

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.136
predatory lending,
a crack cocaine epidemic,

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.536
mass incarceration putting
more Black bodies behind bars

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.776
than were owned at the height of slavery.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.576
But GirlTrek does.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.336
For Black women whose bodies
are buckling under the weight

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.056
of systems never designed to support them,

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.136
GirlTrek is a lifeline.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.736
August 16, 2015, Danita Kimball,
a member of GirlTrek in Detroit,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.016
received the news that too many
Black mothers have received.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.416
Her son Norman, 23 years old,
a father of two,

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.920
was gunned down
while on an afternoon drive.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.136
Imagine the grief

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.576
that overcomes your body in that moment,

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.320
the immobilizing fear.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.416
Now, know this, that just days
after laying her son to rest,

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.176
Danita Kimball posted online,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.936
"I don't know what to do
or how to move forward,

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.976
but my sisters keep telling me
I need to walk, so I will."

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.536
And then just days after that,

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.816
"I got my steps in today for my baby Norm.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.240
It felt good to be out there, to walk."

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.016
TMD: Walking through pain
is what we have always done.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.320
My mom, she's in the middle right there,

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.576
my mom desegregated
her high school in 1955.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.336
Her mom walked down the steps
of an abandoned school bus

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.256
where she raised 11 kids
as a sharecropper.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.456
And her mom stepped onto Indian territory

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.520
fleeing the terrors of the Jim Crow South.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.136
And her mom walked her man to the door

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.840
as he went off to fight
in the Kentucky Colored Regiment,

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.840
the Civil War.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.776
They were born slaves
but they wouldn't die slaves.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.696
Change-making, it's in my blood.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.976
It's what I do,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.560
and this health crisis ain't nothing
compared to the road we have traveled.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.560
(Applause)

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.336
So it's like James Cleveland.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.896
I don't feel no ways tired,
so we got to work.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.976
We started looking at models of change.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.416
We looked all over the world.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.656
We needed something

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.816
not only that was a part
of our cultural inheritance like walking,

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.895
but something that was scalable,
something that was high-impact,

00:08:47.919 --> 00:08:50.496
something that we could replicate
across this country.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.936
So we studied models like Wangari Maathai,
who won the Nobel Peace Prize

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.576
for inspiring women
to plant 50 million trees in Kenya.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.776
She brought Kenya back from the brink
of environmental devastation.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:04.176
We studied these systems of change,
and we looked at walking scientifically.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.256
And what we learned
is that walking just 30 minutes a day

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:12.536
can single-handedly decrease
50 percent of your risk of diabetes,

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.000
heart disease, stroke,
even Alzheimer's and dementia.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.616
We know that walking
is the single most powerful thing

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.776
that a woman can do for her health,

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.576
so we knew we were on to something,

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.216
because from Harriet Tubman
to the women in Montgomery,

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.056
when Black women walk, things change.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.096
(Applause)

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.656
VG: So how did we take
this simple idea of walking

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.856
and start a revolution
that would catch a fire

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.816
in neighborhoods across America?

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.736
We used the best practices
of the Civil Rights Movement.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.416
We huddled up in church basements.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.336
We did grapevine information sharing
through beauty salons.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.256
We empowered and trained mothers
to stand on the front lines.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.776
We took our message
directly to the streets,

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.216
and women responded.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.576
Women like LaKeisha in Chattanooga,

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.816
Chrysantha in Detroit,

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.376
Onika in New Orleans,

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.336
women with difficult names
and difficult stories

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:05.256
join GirlTrek every day and commit
to walking as a practice of self-care.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.736
Once walking, those women
get to organizing,

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.896
first their families,
then their communities,

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.736
to walk and talk
and solve problems together.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.856
They walk and notice
the abandoned building.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.896
They walk and notice
the lack of sidewalks,

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.176
the lack of green space,

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.456
and they say, "No more."

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.376
Women like Susie Paige in Philadelphia,

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.896
who after walking daily past
an abandoned building in her neighborhood,

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.376
decided, "I'm not waiting.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.736
Let me rally my team.
Let me grab some supplies.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:33.120
Let me do what no one else has done
for me and my community."

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.856
TMD: We know one woman
can make a difference,

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.136
because one woman
has already changed the world,

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.696
and her name is Harriet Tubman.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.096
And trust me, I love Harriet Tubman.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.856
I'm obsessed with her,
and I used to be a history teacher.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.736
I will not tell you the whole history.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.136
I will tell you four things.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.176
So I used to have an old Saab --

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.176
the kind of canvas top that drips
on your head when it rains --

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.105
and I drove all the way down
to the eastern shore of Maryland,

00:10:56.129 --> 00:10:57.576
and when I stepped on the dirt

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.536
that Harriet Tubman made her first escape,

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.656
I knew she was a woman just like we are

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.576
and that we could do what she had done,

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.896
and we learned four things
from Harriet Tubman.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.696
The first one: do not wait.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:14.216
Walk right now in the direction
of your healthiest, most fulfilled life,

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.976
because self-care is a revolutionary act.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.336
Number two:

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.576
when you learn the way forward,
come back and get a sister.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.936
So in our case,
start a team with your friends --

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.856
your friends, your family, your church.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.496
Number three:

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.960
rally your allies.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.856
Every single person in this room

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.976
is complicit in
a Tubman-inspired takeover.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.856
And number four:

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.160
find joy.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.176
The most underreported
fact of Harriet Tubman

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.736
is that she lived to be 93 years old,

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.096
and she didn't live
just an ordinary life; uh-uh.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.216
She was standing up for the good guys.
She married a younger man.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.456
She adopted a child.
I'm not kidding. She lived.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.296
And I drove up to her house
of freedom in upstate New York,

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.216
and she had planted apple trees,

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.896
and when I was there on a Sunday,
they were blooming.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.496
Do you call it -- do they bloom?

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.216
The apples were in season,

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.800
and I was thinking, she left fruit for us,

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.920
the legacy of Harriet Tubman,
every single year.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.376
And we know that we are Harriet,

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.880
and we know that there is a Harriet
in every community in America.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:22.216
VG: We also know that there's a Harriet
in every community across the globe,

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.016
and that they could learn
from our Tubman Doctrine,

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.496
as we call it, the four steps.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.216
Imagine the possibilities

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.936
beyond the neighborhoods
of Oakland and Newark,

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.096
to the women working
rice fields in Vietnam,

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.696
tea fields in Sri Lanka,

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.056
the women on the
mountainsides in Guatemala,

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.896
the indigenous reservations
throughout the vast plains of the Dakotas.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.456
We believe that women walking

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.896
and talking together
to solve their problems

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.520
is a global solution.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.216
TMD: And I'll leave you with this,

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.896
because we also believe it can become
the center of social justice again.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.776
Vanessa and I were in Fort Lauderdale.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.216
We had an organizer training,

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.856
and I was leaving
and I got on the airplane,

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.696
and I saw someone I knew, so I waved,

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.376
and as I'm waiting in that long line
that you guys know,

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.416
waiting for people
to put their stuff away,

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:10.136
I looked back and I realized I didn't
know the woman but I recognized her.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.936
And so I blew her a kiss
because it was Sybrina Fulton,

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.176
Trayvon Martin's mom,

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.440
and she whispered "thank you" back to me.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.496
And I can't help but wonder
what would happen

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.376
if there were groups of women
walking on Trayvon's block that day,

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.536
or what would happen
in the South Side of Chicago every day

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.216
if there were groups of women
and mothers and aunts and cousins

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.456
walking,

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.200
or along the polluted rivers
of Flint, Michigan.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.016
I believe that walking
can transform our communities,

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.640
because it's already starting to.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.736
VG: We believe that
the personal is political.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.536
Our walking is for healing,
for joy, for fresh air,

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.800
quiet time, to connect
and disconnect, to worship.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.456
But it's also walking
so we can be healthy enough

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.616
to stand on the front lines
for change in our communities,

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:02.296
and it is our call to action
to every Black woman listening,

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.616
every Black woman in earshot of our voice,

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.176
every Black woman who you know.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.376
Think about it: the woman working
front desk reception at your job,

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.776
the woman who delivers
your mail, your neighbor --

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.256
our call to action to them,
to join us on the front lines

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.040
for change in your community.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.976
TMD: And I'll bring us back to this moment

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.176
and why it's so important
for my dear, dear friend Vanessa and I.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.176
It's because it's not always easy for us,

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.280
and in fact, we have both seen
really, really dark days,

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.976
from the hate speech to the summer
of police brutality and violence

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.400
that we saw last year,

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.976
to even losing one of our walkers,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.200
Sandy Bland, who died in police custody.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:45.416
But the most courageous thing
we do every day is we practice faith

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.776
that goes beyond the facts,

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.616
and we put feet to our prayers
every single day,

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.296
and when we get overwhelmed,

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.696
we think of the words of people
like Sonia Sanchez, a poet laureate,

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.096
who says, "Morgan, where is your fire?

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.736
Where is the fire that burned
holes through slave ships

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:01.976
to make us breathe?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.336
Where is the fire
that turned guts into chitlins,

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.136
that took rhythms and make jazz,

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.816
that took sit-ins and marches
and made us jump boundaries and barriers?

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.496
You've got to find it and pass it on."

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.896
So this is us finding our fire
and passing it on to you.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.256
So please, stand with us,

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.896
walk with us as we rally a million women

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.816
to reclaim the streets
of the 50 highest need communities

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.216
in this country.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.616
We thank you so much for this opportunity.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.560
(Applause)
