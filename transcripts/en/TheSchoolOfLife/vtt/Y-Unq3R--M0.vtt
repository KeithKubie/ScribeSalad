00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.760
For most of history,  the overwhelming majority of the Earth's inhabitants have owned, more or less, nothing.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.800
The clothes they stood up in, some bowls, a pot and a pan, perhaps a broom and, if things were going really well, a few farming implements.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.560
Nations and peoples remained consistently poor.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:37.380
Global GDP did not grow at all from year to year: the world was an aggregate as hard up in 1800 as it had been at the beginning of time.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.800
However, starting in the early 18th century, in the countries of north-western Europe, a remarkable phenomenon occurred.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.080
Economies began to expand and wages to rise.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.820
Families who'd never before had any money beyond what they needed just to survive

00:00:52.820 --> 00:01:00.200
found they could go shopping for small luxuries: a comb or a mirror, a spare set of underwear, a pillow, some thicker boots or a towel.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.760
Their expenditure created a virtuous economic cycle.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.300
The more they spent, the more business grew, the more wages rose.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.160
By the middle of the 18th century, observers recognised that they were living through a period of epochal change

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.840
that historians have since described as the world's first consumer revolution.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:26.480
It was in Britain where the changes were most marked: enormous new industries sprang up to cater for the widespread demand for goods

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.500
that had once been the preserve of the very rich alone.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.740
In England's cities you could buy furniture from Chip 'n' Dale, Hepplewhite and Sheraton

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.740
pottery from Wedgewood and Derby,
cutlery from the smitheries of Sheffield

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.660
and hats, shoes and dressed featured in the best selling magazines like 
The Gallery of Fashion and The Ladies Magazine.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.420
Styles for clothes and hair which had formerly gone unchanged for decades now altered every year

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.680
often in extremely theatrical and impractical directions.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.480
In the early 1770s, there was a craze for decorating wigs so tall that their tops could only be accessed by standing on a chair.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.360
It was fun for the cartoonists. So vivid and numerous were the consumer novelties that the austere

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:14.420
Dr. Johnsons Riley wondered whether prisoners were also soon to be hanged in a new way.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.280
The Christian Church looked on and did not approve.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.720
Up and down England, clergymen delivered bitter sermons against the new materialism.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.320
They called it vanity, which was a sin. 
Sons and daughters ought to be kept away from shops

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.300
God would not look kindly on those who paid more attention to household decoration than the state of their souls.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:41.180
But there now emerged an intellectual revolution that sharply altered the understanding of the role of vanity in an economy.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:49.060
In 1723, a London physician called Bernand Mandeville published an economic tract titled "The Fable of the Bees"

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.480
which proposed that contrary to centuries of religious and moral thinking, what made countries rich

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.700
and therefore safe, honest, generous, spirited and strong

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.320
was a very minor, unelevated and apparently undignified activity:

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.640
shopping for pleasure.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.220
It was the consumption of what Mandeville called fripperies: hats, bonnets, gloves, butter dishes,

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.380
soup tureens, shoehorns and hair clips that provided the engine for national prosperity

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.680
and allowed the government to do in practice what the church only knew how to sermonise about in theory:

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.120
make a genuine difference to the lives of the weak and the poor.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.540
The only way to generate wealth, argued Mandeville, was to ensure high demand for absurd and unnecessary things.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.700
Of course no one needed embroidered handbags, silk lined slippers or ice creams

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.180
but it was a blessing that they could be prompted by fashion to want them, for on the back of demand

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.440
for such trifles, workshops could be built, apprentices trained and hospitals funded.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.180
Mandeville shocked the audience with the starkness of the choice he placed before them: a nation could either be very

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:02.240
high-minded, spiritually elevated, intelectually refined and dirt poor or a slave to luxury and idle consumption

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.180
and very rich.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.580
Mandeville's dark thesis went on to convince almost all great Anglophone economists and political thinkers

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.180
of the 18th century.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.020
There were, nevertheless, some occasional departures from the new economic orthodoxy.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.480
One of the most spirited and impassioned voices was that of Switzerland's greatest philosopher, Jean Jacques Rousseau.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.220
Shocked by the impact of the consumer revolution on the manners and atmosphere of his native Geneva,

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.860
he called for a return to a simpler, older way of life.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:37.620
of the sort he had experienced in the alpine villages or read about in the travellers' accounts of the native tribes of North America.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.320
In the remote corners of Appenzell or the vast forests of Missouri

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.520
there was, blessedly, no concern for fashion and no one upmanship around hair extensions.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.420
Rousseau recommended closing Geneva's borders and imposing crippling taxes on luxury goods

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.680
so that people's energy could be redirected towards non-material values.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.660
He looked back with fondness to the austere, martial spirit of Sparta.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:07.860
However, even if Rousseau disagreed with Mandeville, he did not seek to deny the basic premise behind his analysis.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:16.320
It truly appeared to be a choice between decadent consumption and wealth on one hand and virtuous restraint and poverty on the other.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.360
It was simply that Rousseau, unusually, preffered virtue to wealth.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.840
The parameters of this debate have continued to dominate the economic thinking ever since.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.960
We re-encounter them in ideological arguments between capitalists and communists and free marketeers and environmentalists.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:38.860
But for most of us, the debate is no longer pertinent: we simlply accept that we will live in consumer economies,

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.060
with some very unfortunate side effects to them:

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:47.520
crass advertising, foodstuffs that are unhealthy for us, products that are disconnected from any reasonable assessment of our needs.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:55.520
All this in exchange for economic growth and high  employment. 
We have chosen wealth over virtue.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:03.400
an irony laden acceptance of this dichotomy is what underpins the approach of many pop artists in mid 20th century America.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.180
For example,  Claes Oldenburg developed a reputation for taking modern consumer items, many of them food related

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:16.160
and reproducing them at enormous scale, usually in outdoor settings in vibrant polyester vinyl.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.340
In city squares, where one once might have expected to find statues in honour of political leaders

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:29.800
or religious saints, one now came across outside hamburgers, giant cheesecakes, fries decked with ketchup or perhaps Oldenburg's most famous work

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.640
a 12 meter high stainless steel, inverted ice cream cone.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:39.920
Oldenburg's vast versions of small things playfully directed our attention to the peculiar dependence of

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:46.780
modern economies on the mass consumption of what are, in human terms, some deeply negligible products.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.420
Yet the scale of Oldenburg's objects was only superficially absurd.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:56.640
because it rather precisely reflected their actual importance in our collective economic destinies.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.980
Nevertheless, as Oldenburg seemed to concede,

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:07.600
it was peculiar to be living in a civilisation founded on the back of buns and sweetened tomato paste, a benthos hinted at by the

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.700
deflated appearance of many of the giant burgers, hotdogs and pizzas.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:19.080
The one question that's rarely been asked is whether there might be a way to attenuate the dispiriting choice,

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:26.980
to draw on the best aspects of consumerism on one hand and high-mindedness on the other, without suffering their worst sides:

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.100
moral decadence and profound poverty.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:36.100
Might it be possible for a society to develop that allows for consumers spending and therefore provides employment and welfare

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.480
yet of a kind directed at something other than vanities and superfluities?

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.980
Might we shop for something other than nonsense?

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:50.460
In other words, might we have wealth and a degree of virtue? 
It is this possibility of which we find some

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.240
intriguing hints in the work of Adam Smith

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.500
an 18th century economist, too often read as a blunt apologist

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.980
for all aspects of consumerism.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.200
but in fact, one of its more subtle and visionary analysts.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.180
In his book The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776,

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:12.380
Adam Smith seems at points willing to concede to key aspects of Mandeville's argument:

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:18.560
consumer societies do help the poor by providing employment based around satisfying what are often rather

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.240
sub-optimal purchases. 
Smith was as ready as other economists

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:28.540
to mock the triviality of some consumer choices while admiring their consequences.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:34.660
All those embroidered lace handkerchiefs, jewel snuff boxes and miniature temples made of cream for dessert

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:41.180
they were flippant, he conceded, but they encouraged trade, created employment and generated immense wealth

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:44.580
and could be therefore firmly defended on this score alone.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:49.520
However, Smith held out some fascinating hopes for the future. 
He pointed out that

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.500
consumption didn't invariably have to involve the trading of frivolous things.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:09:00.880
He had seen the expansion of the Edinburgh book trade and knew how large a market higher education might become.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:07.080
He understood how much wealth was being accumulated through the construction of the Edinburgh's extremely handsome and noble New Town

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:14.240
He understood that humans have many higher needs that require a lot of labour, intelligence and work to fulfill

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:20.660
but they lie outside of capitalist enterprise as conceived off by realists like Bernard Mandeville.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:26.860
Among these are need for education, for self understanding, for beautiful cities and for rewarding social lives.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:33.580
The ultimate goal of capitalism, in Adam Smith's view, was to tackle happiness in all its complexities

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:37.160
psychological and not just merely material.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:45.240
The capitalism of our times still hasn't entirely come around to resolving the awkward choices that Bernard Mandeville and Jean Jacques Rousseau

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:52.900
circled. But the crucial hope for the future is that we may not forever need to be making money off rather exploititive, silly or vain

00:09:52.900 --> 00:10:02.980
consumer appetites. That we may also learn to generate enormous profits from helping people as consumers and producers in the truly important and ambitious

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.900
aspects of their lives.
The reform of capitalism hinges

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:11.860
on an odd sounding but critical task: a new kind of consumerism.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:19.040
The conception of an economy focused around buying and selling services and goods focused on our higher needs.
