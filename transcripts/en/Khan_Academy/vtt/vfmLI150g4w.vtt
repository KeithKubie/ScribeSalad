00:00:00.238 --> 00:00:01.232
- [Instructor] Let's
talk a little bit about

00:00:01.232 --> 00:00:04.634
the conservation of angular momentum.

00:00:04.634 --> 00:00:06.506
And this is going to be really useful,

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:10.005
because it explains diverse
phenomena in the universe.

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:14.271
From why an ice skater's
angular speed goes up

00:00:14.271 --> 00:00:18.573
when they tuck their arms or
their legs in, all the way to

00:00:18.573 --> 00:00:22.115
when you have something
orbiting around a star,

00:00:22.115 --> 00:00:24.446
and the closer and closer it spirals in,

00:00:24.446 --> 00:00:27.830
it seems like its rotational
velocity's angular speed

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.107
is picking up.

00:00:29.107 --> 00:00:31.762
And it starts to rotate faster
and faster around the body.

00:00:31.762 --> 00:00:33.242
You'll see that if you see simulations

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:35.409
of astronomical phenomena.

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:37.878
So the big picture here is,

00:00:37.878 --> 00:00:41.761
is if we have our initial angular momentum

00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:45.827
for a system, and we'll think
about that a little bit.

00:00:45.827 --> 00:00:50.311
As long as the system has no
external torque applied to it,

00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:54.037
then your final angular
momentum is going to be

00:00:54.037 --> 00:00:55.787
the exact same thing.

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:59.215
And so, one way to think about it,

00:00:59.215 --> 00:01:01.788
let's imagine that I have some type of

00:01:01.788 --> 00:01:04.174
spinning thing over here.

00:01:04.174 --> 00:01:06.648
I have some type of mass,
let's say it's on a table,

00:01:06.648 --> 00:01:09.644
I'm looking from above, and a point on

00:01:09.644 --> 00:01:13.290
the outside of this disk is
spinning in this direction,

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.873
with a velocity of magnitude v.

00:01:16.839 --> 00:01:20.717
And let's say that there's a
clump of clay, of orange...

00:01:20.717 --> 00:01:23.318
Maybe it's Play Doh, or clay or something.

00:01:23.318 --> 00:01:26.929
And it has a velocity
going in this direction.

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:29.574
It's on a collision
course with this object.

00:01:29.574 --> 00:01:32.741
And let's say it has a velocity of 5v.

00:01:33.912 --> 00:01:38.912
And so, if we think about
this disk-clay clump system,

00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:40.850
and so you always have
to specify what system

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.631
you are talking about,

00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:45.438
so if you think about this entire system,

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:49.092
how does the angular momentum change

00:01:49.092 --> 00:01:51.331
before these two things collide,

00:01:51.331 --> 00:01:53.341
and then after these two things collide?

00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:55.822
So actually, let me draw the
after the collision scenario.

00:01:55.822 --> 00:01:57.565
So the after the collision scenario,

00:01:57.565 --> 00:01:59.275
it looks something like this,

00:01:59.275 --> 00:02:02.973
where the clay has now clumped onto this,

00:02:02.973 --> 00:02:06.115
and now they are going
to be rotating together.

00:02:06.115 --> 00:02:08.454
And I haven't even told
you the mass of this disk,

00:02:08.454 --> 00:02:10.264
or the mass of this clay,

00:02:10.264 --> 00:02:12.923
so it would be unclear in which direction

00:02:12.923 --> 00:02:15.318
they would now be rotating.

00:02:15.318 --> 00:02:17.857
But how is the angular
momentum going to change

00:02:17.857 --> 00:02:20.540
from this state, from the initial state,

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.123
to the final state?

00:02:23.621 --> 00:02:26.140
Pause this video and
try to think about it.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.687
Well, you might have guessed.

00:02:27.687 --> 00:02:30.100
Since we said, look, we
have this whole system,

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.264
and we're not applying any
external torque to the system,

00:02:34.264 --> 00:02:38.820
our angular momentum is going
to stay exactly the same.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.150
Now, we have to be careful.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.506
If I told you the system
was just this disk,

00:02:44.506 --> 00:02:48.590
not the clay clump that's on
a collision course with it,

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.497
then the angular momentum
for the disk would change,

00:02:52.497 --> 00:02:53.891
but why is that?

00:02:53.891 --> 00:02:56.483
Does that defy the conservation
of angular momentum?

00:02:56.483 --> 00:02:57.316
No.

00:02:57.316 --> 00:02:59.263
Because this clay clump, when it collides,

00:02:59.263 --> 00:03:02.620
would be providing an
external torque to the system,

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.517
if we defined the system
to just be the disk.

00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:08.188
But since it's the disk
plus the clay clump,

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:11.718
and we have no external torque
to that combined system,

00:03:11.718 --> 00:03:15.801
then our angular momentum
is not going to change.

00:03:16.766 --> 00:03:17.769
Now that we can appreciate

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.613
that angular momentum is constant

00:03:19.613 --> 00:03:22.365
as long as that there is no net torque

00:03:22.365 --> 00:03:24.776
applied to the system,

00:03:24.776 --> 00:03:28.242
let's think about the famous
situation where an ice skater's

00:03:28.242 --> 00:03:32.326
angular speed goes up as
they tuck in their arms.

00:03:32.326 --> 00:03:34.583
And you can do a less
graceful version of this

00:03:34.583 --> 00:03:35.888
on an office chair,

00:03:35.888 --> 00:03:39.875
where if you sit on the office
chair and you begin spinning,

00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:43.223
this is my office chair, and
if you stick your legs out,

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.152
at first you're going to spin slowly,

00:03:45.152 --> 00:03:46.501
but then if you tuck your legs in,

00:03:46.501 --> 00:03:48.309
you're gonna start spinning faster.

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:51.108
You're gonna have a higher angular speed.

00:03:51.108 --> 00:03:52.688
Now, why is that?

00:03:52.688 --> 00:03:54.842
Well, to appreciate
that, we can think about

00:03:54.842 --> 00:03:57.898
the formula for angular momentum.

00:03:57.898 --> 00:04:00.926
So the formula for angular momentum, L,

00:04:00.926 --> 00:04:02.256
there's a couple of ways we can,

00:04:02.256 --> 00:04:04.209
or several ways that we can write that.

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.700
We can write that as our
moment of inertia, I,

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.700
times our angular speed.

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:12.819
Times omega.

00:04:14.134 --> 00:04:16.498
And this might look a little
bit foreign at first to you,

00:04:16.498 --> 00:04:18.697
but it has a complete analog

00:04:18.697 --> 00:04:20.496
when we're dealing in the linear world.

00:04:20.496 --> 00:04:21.620
Here we're rotating.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.822
In the linear world, we
say that linear momentum

00:04:25.822 --> 00:04:27.239
is equal to mass,

00:04:28.347 --> 00:04:31.014
is equal to mass times velocity.

00:04:32.885 --> 00:04:34.752
And the reason why we have an analog here,

00:04:34.752 --> 00:04:38.511
is mass can tell you about
inertia of an object.

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:40.503
How much force do you need to apply

00:04:40.503 --> 00:04:42.479
to accelerate that object?

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:43.775
f equals ma.

00:04:43.775 --> 00:04:45.022
Well, moment of inertia,

00:04:45.022 --> 00:04:46.782
you have something similar going on.

00:04:46.782 --> 00:04:47.615
But instead of thinking

00:04:47.615 --> 00:04:50.101
about how to just linearly
accelerate something,

00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:53.682
this tells you how hard is it
to get angular acceleration,

00:04:53.682 --> 00:04:56.157
how much torque do you need to apply?

00:04:56.157 --> 00:04:57.750
Instead of just how much linear force

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:58.849
you need to apply.

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.494
And instead of velocity,
you have angular speed,

00:05:01.494 --> 00:05:04.344
and sometimes this is called
angular velocity as well.

00:05:04.344 --> 00:05:05.345
But this by itself, you might say,

00:05:05.345 --> 00:05:08.061
well this doesn't help
me on tucking in my knees

00:05:08.061 --> 00:05:09.565
when I'm on an office chair,

00:05:09.565 --> 00:05:12.031
or the ice skater tucking in her arms.

00:05:12.031 --> 00:05:14.675
Well, to think about that,
we just have to appreciate

00:05:14.675 --> 00:05:18.866
that the moment of inertia
can be expressed as

00:05:18.866 --> 00:05:21.866
m times radius squared, m r squared.

00:05:23.441 --> 00:05:26.974
And then we still have
our omega right over here.

00:05:26.974 --> 00:05:31.058
So this is another way of
writing angular momentum.

00:05:31.058 --> 00:05:35.083
And so, when a skater tucks in her arms,

00:05:35.083 --> 00:05:38.270
her mass is not changing,
that is staying constant.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.633
But remember, the radius,
one way to think about it,

00:05:40.633 --> 00:05:42.037
it's a little complicated
when you're thinking about

00:05:42.037 --> 00:05:43.634
a human body system.

00:05:43.634 --> 00:05:47.000
In a simple sense you
just have a point mass

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.341
rotating around a point like that,

00:05:49.341 --> 00:05:51.102
then this is the radius.

00:05:51.102 --> 00:05:53.775
But if we're dealing with a
more complicated structure,

00:05:53.775 --> 00:05:54.917
like a human body,

00:05:54.917 --> 00:05:57.862
you can imagine the
radius as being indicative

00:05:57.862 --> 00:06:01.270
of the average distance of the mass,

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.700
from the center of rotation.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.633
So when the figure
skater tucks in her arms,

00:06:06.633 --> 00:06:08.660
that average distance goes down.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.988
And so when she tucks in
her arm, this goes down,

00:06:11.988 --> 00:06:15.099
but if this part goes down,
but our angular momentum

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:17.964
stays constant, because we have no torque

00:06:17.964 --> 00:06:19.240
being applied to the system,

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.949
no net torque being applied to the system,

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:23.947
well then, this needs to
go up in order to keep

00:06:23.947 --> 00:06:26.215
that angular momentum constant.

00:06:26.215 --> 00:06:27.978
And that's exactly what's happening.

00:06:27.978 --> 00:06:32.728
The angular speed picks up,
just as the radius goes down.

00:06:34.475 --> 00:06:38.226
Now, this also explains why if you have,

00:06:38.226 --> 00:06:41.098
let's say that's some type of planet,

00:06:41.098 --> 00:06:44.715
and you have a rock, or
something orbiting it.

00:06:44.715 --> 00:06:48.545
As this gets closer and
closer to the planet,

00:06:48.545 --> 00:06:50.920
it's angular speed is going to go higher,

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.358
and higher, and higher.

00:06:52.358 --> 00:06:53.438
Why is that?

00:06:53.438 --> 00:06:55.445
Well, because when you have a high radius,

00:06:55.445 --> 00:06:57.613
so here your radius is higher,

00:06:57.613 --> 00:07:00.826
and so your angular speed
might be a little bit lower,

00:07:00.826 --> 00:07:05.826
but then when you're closer
in, your radius has gone down.

00:07:05.937 --> 00:07:10.687
And so your angular speed has
to go up to make up for it.

00:07:11.942 --> 00:07:13.332
I'll leave you there.

00:07:13.332 --> 00:07:16.229
I encourage you to have fun
spinning on office chairs.
