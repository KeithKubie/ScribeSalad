00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.360
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.430
kind of give a back
of the envelope way

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.610
for thinking about a
conundrum that the Khan

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.040
Academy is facing right now.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.456
And you could do
a little bit more

00:00:10.456 --> 00:00:12.930
of a precise way with present
valuing and all of that.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.680
But this will give you
a pretty good sense

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.949
of how to make this decision.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.740
So we're seriously
looking at office space.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.600
I've changed these numbers to
simplify things a little bit.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.760
But there's a nice
office, and it's

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.862
going for $2,000 per month.

00:00:25.862 --> 00:00:27.320
And then there's
this dingy office.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.470
It's really too dingy.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.636
It's a converted nightclub
and it's really too dingy

00:00:30.636 --> 00:00:35.810
to be a respectable place to
work, but it's going for $1,000

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:36.630
a month.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.980
And I talked to a contractor.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.897
And once again, I'm
simplifying these numbers.

00:00:39.897 --> 00:00:41.521
These numbers aren't
the exact numbers,

00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:43.410
but it makes the math
a little bit simpler.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.400
The contractor says it
would cost us about $10,000

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.290
to get this dingy office to the
condition of the nice office.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.360
And in either situation, we
are thinking about a 24 month

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.960
lease, so a two year lease.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.860
And the contractor said it
would take one month of work

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.650
to get the dingy office
space up to speed.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.470
So the nice office
space landlord he says,

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.239
look, it'll be a 24 month lease.

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:18.280
You could just occupy it.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.370
It's ready to go.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.010
The dingy office
space, I talked him

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.250
about this idea of us investing
money in repairing it.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.660
He's like, OK, if you
need to repair it--

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.600
he's kind not the easiest
person to deal with-- he says,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.730
I'm going to charge you
an extra month of rent.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.260
So even while I'm repairing
it, I have to pay rent.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.380
So he'll say, I'm willing
to do a 25 month contract,

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.420
a 25 month lease with you.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.740
So you could still, once
you repair it, you still

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.569
get two years of service
from the dingy office.

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:49.610
So which one should I do?

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.660
And I'll tell you
my emotions, I want

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.360
to do the nice one because I
don't want to spend $10,000

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.770
and make this all nice and then
two years later, the landlord

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.212
could raise the rent.

00:01:59.212 --> 00:02:00.920
But let's just think
about it rationally.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.055
Which one makes sense?

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:03.680
And the easiest way
to think about that

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.540
is, what is the
effective amount of rent,

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.150
in a very back of
the envelope way,

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.639
that we're paying
for the dingy office?

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:17.690
So if you think about it
over the entire lease,

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.590
we're going to have 25 months.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.900
We're going to pay
$1,000 per month.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.850
So it's going to be $25,000
plus $10,000 to repair it.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.110
So plus $10,000.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.300
I'll just write 10k
like I did before.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.780
Plus 10k.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.347
And in terms of the useful
life, because over here

00:02:36.347 --> 00:02:38.680
when we're saying per month,
every month here is useful.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.259
So how many useful
months are here?

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:42.300
Well we're going to spend
one month to repair it.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.660
We only get 24 useful months.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.340
So we only get 24 useful months.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.860
So if you view it this way,
not doing any fancy present

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.810
valuing, just back
of the envelope,

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:02.730
it is $35,000 over 24 months.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.219
And so let's get
our calculator out.

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:07.010
I guess it's not pure
back of the envelope,

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.590
but pretty close to pure
back of the envelope.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:18.680
35,000 divided by 24
is equal to 1,458.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:26.430
So this is equal to
approximately $1,458 per month.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.664
So even though I don't want
to invest in this property,

00:03:29.664 --> 00:03:31.580
and I'm only going to
be able to use two years

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.371
and this person's going
to be able to raise

00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:37.500
the rent after that, it actually
still makes a lot of sense.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.335
It still makes actually
almost $500 a month of sense

00:03:40.335 --> 00:03:42.200
or more than $500
a month of sense

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.290
in this kind of back
of the envelope way

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.850
to get the dingy
office and repair it.
