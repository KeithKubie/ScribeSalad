00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.580
Did you know that you have a whole new organ?

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:03.979
I know, it just popped up overnight!

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:06.399
I don’t think I felt mine grow in, did you?

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:09.800
No, I’m just kidding, this structure was
actually always there, but we’re only just

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.530
now recognizing what it is and how it really
works.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.950
And it’s a pretty big deal--it changes the
way we see not only our bodies and how they

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.039
work, but also a whole host of important diseases.

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:22.222
Does that really make it a new organ, though?

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:25.770
An organ is a group of tissues that perform
a specific function.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.240
There’s a thing in our body called the interstitium,
also known as the interstitial space*, which

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.780
is a layer of tissue we’ve known about for
a long time.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.609
It sits beneath our skin, surrounding all
of our organs and arteries and veins and muscles,

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:41.469
blanketing them on the inside just like our
skin covers our body on the outside.

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.600
But a few months ago, researchers were looking
at a patient’s bile duct for signs of cancer

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.819
when they saw something in the interstitium
that didn’t match up with any known human

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:50.819
anatomy.

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:54.760
See, the way we typically study human tissues
in a lab is to take an extremely thin slice

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.089
and look at it on a slide under a microscope,
maybe dying it different colors to enable

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.609
us to see certain structures.

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:03.329
But doing this removes all the fluid from
that tissue sample.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.970
And this means we’ve been missing something
big.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.719
Up until now, we’ve thought that the interstitium
was just plain ol’ connective tissue.

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:13.759
We have connective tissue all over our bodies,
connecting bones to one another, connecting

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.060
our muscles to our bones, and generally just
holding us together.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.200
It’s important, but pretty ubiquitous and
typically not very specialized.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.100
But these researchers saw something new because
they were looking at tissue samples in a new

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.100
way.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.070
Using a technique called confocal laser endomicroscopy,
they could see the TRUE nature of the interstitium..this

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.909
visualization method uses a low-powered laser
to scan an area of the body and create a digital

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.409
3D reconstruction.

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.259
Using this technique, researchers could now
observe a whole network of fluid-filled sacs--structures

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.241
that got drained and therefore essentially
disappeared when we’d looked at interstitium

00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:50.170
samples with the more traditional slice and
‘scope method.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.950
We’ve now observed that the interstitium
is actually a complex network of interconnected

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.009
fluid-filled compartments, supported by connective
tissue proteins like collagen and elastin.

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.020
It may act as a shock absorber, twisting and
bending with our bodies as we move, keeping

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.120
our organs in place and keeping them from
tearing or otherwise flopping or floating

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.450
about in our bodies.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.660
Perhaps even more importantly, the fluid in
the interstitium is connected to our lymphatic

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.850
system, draining to our lymph nodes, and it
may actually be a source of lymph.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.980
Which is HUGE because lymphatic fluid is an
essential part of our immune system, carrying

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.920
cells that fight infection...but it also plays
a major role in the spread of cancer.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.690
When cancer metastasizes, it spreads from
its tissue of origin to other parts of the

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.610
body through the blood or the lymph.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.500
So understanding the interstitium as a new
key player in the lymphatic system could give

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.010
us a better understanding of cancer, and why
and how it spreads.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.010
But.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.570
The million dollar question.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.980
Is the interstitium truly an organ?

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.120
No.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.120
Not yet, at least.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.500
For it to be classified as such it’ll take
lots of follow-up research and verification.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.340
I mean the mesentary, which we talked about
last year, still isn’t an official organ,

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.740
so it takes some serious doing to get on that
list.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.770
Really, calling something an organ is mostly
a semantic distinction.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.540
It could help direct research toward this
structure, but the significance of this work

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.230
is pretty independent of whether call the
interstitium a new organ or not.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.560
This study not only revealed brand new information
about the way our bodies work, but also made

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.380
us call into question the way we’ve been
looking at them.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.100
And last but not least, this discovery has
sparked conversation once again about what

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.710
organs are and how we classify them and what
counts as one...a discussion that’s constantly

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.770
evolving in the scientific field.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.820
I love that science is always changing and
learning from itself.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.840
What else do you think we haven’t known
about our bodies this whole time?

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.270
Let us know in the comments, and check out
Sam’s video here to learn about a part of

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.030
the brain that’s been hiding from us.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.570
Thanks for watching!
