00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.570
Let's get some exposure
to the derivatives

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:03.920
of some of the most
common functions.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.753
We're not going to prove
them in this video,

00:00:05.753 --> 00:00:07.920
but at least understand
what the derivatives are.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.836
So first, let's start
with the trig functions.

00:00:09.836 --> 00:00:15.530
If I want to take the derivative
with respect to x of sine of x,

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.571
this is going to be
equal to cosine of x.

00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:21.070
And if you look at their graphs,
it'll make intuitive sense.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.760
Once again I have
not proved it here,

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.135
but this is a good
thing to know,

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:26.810
that the derivative of
sine of x is cosine of x.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.370
Now what about the
derivative of cosine of x?

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.460
What about the derivative with
respect to x of cosine of x?

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.330
Well, this one's going
to be negative sine of x.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.000
So the derivative
of sine is cosine,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.640
and the derivative
cosine is negative sine.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.810
And then finally, the
derivative of tangent

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:56.670
of x is equal to 1
over cosine squared

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.800
of x, which is equal to
the secant squared of x.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.220
Once again, these are all
very good things to know.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.570
Now let's talk a little
bit about exponentials

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.897
and logarithms.

00:01:08.897 --> 00:01:10.480
So the derivative--
and actually, this

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.770
is one of the coolest
results, and it once again

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.590
speaks to how cool e is as
a number, the derivative

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.886
with respect to
x of e to the x--

00:01:19.886 --> 00:01:21.260
we need a drum
roll for this one.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.520
This is one of the coolest
things in mathematics.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.505
The derivative of e to
the x is e to the x.

00:01:27.505 --> 00:01:28.630
Now what does that tell us?

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.255
And I have to take
a little pause here,

00:01:30.255 --> 00:01:31.680
because this is
just so exciting.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.520
So let me graph e to the x.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.480
So that's my y-axis.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.620
Let's say that this right
over here is my x-axis.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.270
So if I have very
negative values of x,

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.720
e to a very negative value,
we are approaching zero.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.330
And then e to the
0 is 1, so that's

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.670
going to be 1 right over there.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.210
So it's going to look
something like this.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.460
And then it's an exponential.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.940
It's going to go, it's going
to start increasing really,

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.900
really, really,
really, really fast.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.940
So let's say that's the graph
of y is equal to e to the x.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.510
What this tells us is that
at any point-- so let's

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.210
say I go right over here.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.570
I say when x is equal
to 0, e to the 0

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.230
is 1, what's the slope
of the tangent line here?

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.380
Turns out that is also 1.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.260
Amazing.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.020
If I go to x is equal
to 1 right over here,

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.406
the function evaluated here gets
us e to the 1 power or just e.

00:02:30.406 --> 00:02:32.780
And what's the slope of the
tangent line right over here?

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.200
It is also e.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.920
At any point right over here,
the slope of the tangent line

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.780
is equal to the value of
the function at that point.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.660
This is amazing.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.870
This is what is so cool about e.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.730
Anyway, that's not the
point of this video.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.060
This video is to give
you a catalog of all

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.860
of the derivatives that
you might really need.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.050
So then finally,
if we're thinking

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.940
about the derivative
with respect

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.890
to x of the natural log of x,
this is going to be equal to--

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.670
and this is also fascinating.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.450
This is equal to 1 over
x or x to the negative 1.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.440
So somehow, we have
our natural log

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.690
has kind of inserted
itself into-- when

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.670
you take the derivative,
as filling in the gap

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.915
that the power rule
left vacant, which is,

00:03:19.915 --> 00:03:22.010
is there some function
whose derivative is

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.650
equal to x to the negative 1?

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.000
The power rule gave us
functions whose derivatives

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.160
might be x to the negative
2, x to the negative 3,

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.330
or x to the squared
or x to the fifth.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.010
But it left the x to
the negative 1 vacant,

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.940
and it's filled by
the natural log of x.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.250
Now I haven't proved it here.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.000
I've just catalogued
these for you.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.525
And then we can use
these in future videos,

00:03:40.525 --> 00:03:43.390
and we'll prove them
in future videos.
