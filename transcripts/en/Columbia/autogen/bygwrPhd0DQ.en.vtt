00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.030
what I think of as sort of a second
revolution the SCADA communication so

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040
revolution the SCADA communication so
 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.780
revolution the SCADA communication so
I'm gonna talk a little bit about

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790
I'm gonna talk a little bit about
 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.150
I'm gonna talk a little bit about
history about how we got here then I'm

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160
history about how we got here then I'm
 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.760
history about how we got here then I'm
gonna try and move on to talk about new

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770
gonna try and move on to talk about new
 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.100
gonna try and move on to talk about new
ways of communicating new ways of

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110
ways of communicating new ways of
 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.110
ways of communicating new ways of
measuring and finally how that could

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120
measuring and finally how that could
 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.490
measuring and finally how that could
affect maybe what I think of it like I

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500
affect maybe what I think of it like I
 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.699
affect maybe what I think of it like I
said is a second revolution so in the

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709
said is a second revolution so in the
 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.200
said is a second revolution so in the
beginning of SCADA communication was all

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210
beginning of SCADA communication was all
 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.940

based on letters or any mean in fact you

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950
based on letters or any mean in fact you
 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.050
based on letters or any mean in fact you
know there's this the idea of a republic

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060
know there's this the idea of a republic
 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.990
know there's this the idea of a republic
of letters you know people at that time

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000
of letters you know people at that time
 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.250

called men of science would sort of

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260
called men of science would sort of
 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.050
called men of science would sort of
exchange letters from one to another and

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060
exchange letters from one to another and
 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.130
exchange letters from one to another and
that was sort of what scotty

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140
that was sort of what scotty
 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.380
that was sort of what scotty
communication was built on you used the

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390
communication was built on you used the
 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.850
communication was built on you used the
available technology but of course i had

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860
available technology but of course i had
 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.530
available technology but of course i had
a lot of problems right slow costly a

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540
a lot of problems right slow costly a
 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.920

lot of duplication so in 1665 Oldenburg

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930
lot of duplication so in 1665 Oldenburg
 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.420

why don't we should gather all these

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840
why don't we should gather all these
 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.659
why don't we should gather all these
letters together let's put them all in

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669
letters together let's put them all in
 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.490
letters together let's put them all in
one place and then I'll just publish

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500
one place and then I'll just publish
 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.630
one place and then I'll just publish
them all together it's a lot less

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640
them all together it's a lot less
 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.850
them all together it's a lot less
duplication it's really handy um and

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860
duplication it's really handy um and
 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.530
duplication it's really handy um and
then I say about this was again it sort

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540
then I say about this was again it sort
 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.300

this revolution in scientific

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980
this revolution in scientific
 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.680

communication promoted homogeneity of

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690
communication promoted homogeneity of
 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.440
communication promoted homogeneity of
outputs by which I mean the same sorts

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450
outputs by which I mean the same sorts
 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.090

and if you're running everything through

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210
and if you're running everything through
 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.960
and if you're running everything through
a printing press and you know you want

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970
a printing press and you know you want
 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.490
a printing press and you know you want
to bind it in a journal and distribute

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500
to bind it in a journal and distribute
 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.600
to bind it in a journal and distribute
it all over the place you want kind of

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610
it all over the place you want kind of
 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.430

sort of as terrorization or forward

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300
sort of as terrorization or forward
 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.820

model right it's like industrial outputs

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830
model right it's like industrial outputs
 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.240
model right it's like industrial outputs
particularly after World War Two but the

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250
particularly after World War Two but the
 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.200
particularly after World War Two but the
second revolution

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210
second revolution
 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.330
second revolution
I suggest will promote a diversity of

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340
I suggest will promote a diversity of
 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.120
I suggest will promote a diversity of
outputs right it's not hard to publish

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130
outputs right it's not hard to publish
 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.170
outputs right it's not hard to publish
these and more it's not expensive to

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180
these and more it's not expensive to
 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.760
these and more it's not expensive to
publishing anything anymore and so we

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770
publishing anything anymore and so we
 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:33.870
publishing anything anymore and so we
don't have to kind of press everything

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880
don't have to kind of press everything
 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.130
don't have to kind of press everything
into a cookie cutter sort of mold right

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140
into a cookie cutter sort of mold right
 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.930
into a cookie cutter sort of mold right
because we can sort of publish whatever

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940
because we can sort of publish whatever
 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.240

all that stuff right so for example

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500
all that stuff right so for example
 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.960
all that stuff right so for example
conversation stuff we're talking about

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970
conversation stuff we're talking about
 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.190

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.570
internet for better or worse stories
right we we write a paper that's sort of

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580
right we we write a paper that's sort of
 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.550
right we we write a paper that's sort of
a story about an experiment right we

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560
a story about an experiment right we
 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.960
a story about an experiment right we
didn't experiment Lu the story about it

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970
didn't experiment Lu the story about it
 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.300
didn't experiment Lu the story about it
the analysis we can publish so I I do

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310
the analysis we can publish so I I do
 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.240
the analysis we can publish so I I do
studies now where all of my analysis is

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250
studies now where all of my analysis is
 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:04.469
studies now where all of my analysis is
in our code right so I got my

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479
in our code right so I got my
 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:06.480
in our code right so I got my
statistical analysis I published out on

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490
statistical analysis I published out on
 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.100
statistical analysis I published out on
github if someone wants to fork my code

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110
github if someone wants to fork my code
 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.110

and run my analysis run all my

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120
and run my analysis run all my
 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.210

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:13.980
pie right
and then find the data the data is

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990
and then find the data the data is
 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.150
and then find the data the data is
actually at the you know at the bottom

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160
actually at the you know at the bottom

no point right so we can even publish

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090
no point right so we can even publish
 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.520

about the scientific literature than a

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:41.740
about the scientific literature than a
 

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.680
about the scientific literature than a
guy who just wrote a literature review

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:43.690
guy who just wrote a literature review
 

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:46.050
guy who just wrote a literature review
about that field right I mean that's

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:46.060
about that field right I mean that's
 

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.660
about that field right I mean that's
sort of a you know you wouldn't have to

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:48.670
sort of a you know you wouldn't have to
 

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:50.820
sort of a you know you wouldn't have to
go ask you could just look you could say

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:50.830
go ask you could just look you could say
 

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:52.470
go ask you could just look you could say
what sorts of things did this person

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:52.480
what sorts of things did this person
 

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.690
what sorts of things did this person
cite and from that information you could

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:54.700
cite and from that information you could
 

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.030
cite and from that information you could
say this is this is the important stuff

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040
say this is this is the important stuff
 

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.640
say this is this is the important stuff
in this field so we started so Garfield

00:09:59.640 --> 00:09:59.650
in this field so we started so Garfield
 

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:00.930
in this field so we started so Garfield
started this idea of mining the

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:00.940
started this idea of mining the
 

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.460
started this idea of mining the
literature of mining the kind of

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:02.470
literature of mining the kind of
 

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:03.810
literature of mining the kind of
interactions people were already having

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:03.820
interactions people were already having
 

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.840
interactions people were already having
and using that to try and get a better

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:06.850
and using that to try and get a better
 

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:08.840
and using that to try and get a better
picture of the flow of ideas right

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:08.850
picture of the flow of ideas right
 

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.740
picture of the flow of ideas right
ultimately citation money is about

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:10.750
ultimately citation money is about
 

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.840
ultimately citation money is about
tracing the flow of ideas and ideas an

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:12.850
tracing the flow of ideas and ideas an
 

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:14.670
tracing the flow of ideas and ideas an
ephemeral thing right it doesn't it

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:14.680
ephemeral thing right it doesn't it
 

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.950
ephemeral thing right it doesn't it
doesn't have physical sort of you know

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:16.960
doesn't have physical sort of you know
 

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.410
doesn't have physical sort of you know
reality but we can we can measure its

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:19.420
reality but we can we can measure its
 

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.080
reality but we can we can measure its
tracks and that's a really cool idea the

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:22.090
tracks and that's a really cool idea the
 

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:23.700
tracks and that's a really cool idea the
bad thing about this is that it's only

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:23.710
bad thing about this is that it's only
 

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:25.050
bad thing about this is that it's only
part of the picture so you only really

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:25.060
part of the picture so you only really
 

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.290
part of the picture so you only really
track one person's influence or the

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:28.300
track one person's influence or the
 

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.240
track one person's influence or the
influence on one sort of person you're

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:30.250
influence on one sort of person you're
 

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.430
influence on one sort of person you're
only tracking influence on academics

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:32.440
only tracking influence on academics
 

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.990
only tracking influence on academics
because the only people who cite you

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000
because the only people who cite you
 

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.040
because the only people who cite you
only really track the influence of one

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:35.050
only really track the influence of one
 

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:36.810
only really track the influence of one
kind of resource scholarly articles

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:36.820
kind of resource scholarly articles
 

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.720
kind of resource scholarly articles
because by and large scale er

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:39.730
because by and large scale er
 

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:41.160
because by and large scale er
are the only things that are cited and

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:41.170
are the only things that are cited and
 

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.480
are the only things that are cited and
then finally on the track one kind of

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:42.490
then finally on the track one kind of
 

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:44.129
then finally on the track one kind of
use using it to support a scholarly

00:10:44.129 --> 00:10:44.139
use using it to support a scholarly
 

00:10:44.139 --> 00:10:45.569
use using it to support a scholarly

article you're ignoring a lot of other
 

00:10:45.579 --> 00:10:47.129

even not only that but there's a whole
 

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.800
even not only that but there's a whole
school of criticism of biglan metrics

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:04.810
school of criticism of biglan metrics
 

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:09.420
school of criticism of biglan metrics
that focuses on the the fact that it's

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:09.430
that focuses on the the fact that it's
 

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:10.740
that focuses on the the fact that it's
called the social constructivist school

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:10.750
called the social constructivist school
 

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.060
called the social constructivist school
in fact focus on the fact that these are

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:12.070
in fact focus on the fact that these are
 

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.040
in fact focus on the fact that these are
for these formal indications of impact

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:14.050
for these formal indications of impact
 

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:16.290
for these formal indications of impact
they're very intentional and because of

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:16.300
they're very intentional and because of
 

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.879
they're very intentional and because of
that they can also be used as a

00:11:17.879 --> 00:11:17.889
that they can also be used as a
 

00:11:17.889 --> 00:11:20.000
that they can also be used as a
rhetorical strategy so people often cite

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:20.010
rhetorical strategy so people often cite
 

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:23.280
rhetorical strategy so people often cite
to add credence to their own views right

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:23.290
to add credence to their own views right
 

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:24.720

like if I cite Einstein right after what

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:24.730
like if I cite Einstein right after what
 

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.430
like if I cite Einstein right after what
I say like maybe you know it gives it a

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:26.440
I say like maybe you know it gives it a
 

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.560
I say like maybe you know it gives it a
little bit of a Polish honor right or a

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:28.570
little bit of a Polish honor right or a
 

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.360
little bit of a Polish honor right or a
lot of times even worse if I know that

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:30.370
lot of times even worse if I know that
 

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.400
lot of times even worse if I know that
my advisor wrote something in a very

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:32.410
my advisor wrote something in a very
 

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:34.860
my advisor wrote something in a very
slightly related field I kind of have to

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:34.870
slightly related field I kind of have to
 

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.180
slightly related field I kind of have to
cite him right it's like sort of an

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:36.190
cite him right it's like sort of an
 

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:37.410
cite him right it's like sort of an
expected thing so there's this whole

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:37.420
expected thing so there's this whole
 

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:41.660
expected thing so there's this whole
network of formal relationships there

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:41.670
network of formal relationships there
 

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.309
network of formal relationships there
this is a known problem and since the

00:11:44.309 --> 00:11:44.319
this is a known problem and since the
 

00:11:44.319 --> 00:11:45.870
this is a known problem and since the
very early days have been metrics this

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:45.880
very early days have been metrics this
 

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.460

was a known problem so Garthim says that

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:47.470
was a known problem so Garthim says that
 

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:49.379
was a known problem so Garthim says that
Garfield himself said there's a lot of

00:11:49.379 --> 00:11:49.389
Garfield himself said there's a lot of
 

00:11:49.389 --> 00:11:51.090
Garfield himself said there's a lot of
useful journals that aren't being

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:51.100
useful journals that aren't being
 

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.160

great historian science really

00:11:54.329 --> 00:11:54.339

interesting said science communication

00:11:56.939 --> 00:11:56.949
interesting said science communication
 

00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:58.470
interesting said science communication
scientific communication is really about

00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480
scientific communication is really about
 

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.300
scientific communication is really about
the personal stuff the underground stuff

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:00.310
the personal stuff the underground stuff
 

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:02.670
the personal stuff the underground stuff
the things what I sometimes called the

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:02.680
the things what I sometimes called the
 

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.949
the things what I sometimes called the
shadow system of scholarly communication

and then finally you know Combe who

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:06.220
and then finally you know Combe who
 

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.069

now it's not gonna be enough to just

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:11.110
now it's not gonna be enough to just
 

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:12.600
now it's not gonna be enough to just
look at the formal literature because

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:12.610
look at the formal literature because
 

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:13.829
look at the formal literature because
that's the stuff that rises to the top

00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839
that's the stuff that rises to the top
 

00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:16.430
that's the stuff that rises to the top

contributions have been made so what's
 

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:25.370
contributions have been made so what's
concerning to me about the citation you

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:25.380
concerning to me about the citation you

the approach of citing citation mining

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720
the approach of citing citation mining
 

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.329
the approach of citing citation mining
for all its awesomeness and I think it's

00:12:30.329 --> 00:12:30.339
for all its awesomeness and I think it's
 

00:12:30.339 --> 00:12:32.009
for all its awesomeness and I think it's
very awesome is very beautiful is we can

00:12:32.009 --> 00:12:32.019
very awesome is very beautiful is we can
 

00:12:32.019 --> 00:12:33.509
very awesome is very beautiful is we can
start to confuse the kind of use we can

00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:33.519
start to confuse the kind of use we can
 

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:35.610
start to confuse the kind of use we can
track with use and we can start to

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:35.620
track with use and we can start to
 

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:38.250
track with use and we can start to
confuse citation impact with impact I

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:38.260
confuse citation impact with impact I
 

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.949
confuse citation impact with impact I
think that could be a really bad thing

00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:39.959
think that could be a really bad thing
 

00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:42.389
think that could be a really bad thing
so my suggestion is that we start

00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399
so my suggestion is that we start
 

00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:43.980
so my suggestion is that we start
looking a little bit more broadly so

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:43.990
looking a little bit more broadly so
 

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.170
looking a little bit more broadly so

talking about about tracking and why

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:01.750
talking about about tracking and why
 

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.240
talking about about tracking and why
would we want to track them so this

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:03.250
would we want to track them so this
 

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:05.580
would we want to track them so this
framework separates things into first of

framework separates things into first of
 

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:07.170
framework separates things into first of
all two different audiences so we could

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:07.180
all two different audiences so we could
 

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.329
all two different audiences so we could
have impact on both scholarly audiences

00:13:09.329 --> 00:13:09.339
have impact on both scholarly audiences
 

00:13:09.339 --> 00:13:10.680

which citations do an okay job of
 

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.060
which citations do an okay job of
tracking right now but also on the

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:12.070
tracking right now but also on the
 

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:13.710
tracking right now but also on the
public and then we could also think of

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:13.720
public and then we could also think of
 

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.810
public and then we could also think of
impact in terms of levels of engagement

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:15.820
impact in terms of levels of engagement
 

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.870

still interesting idea right and then we
 

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:39.150
still interesting idea right and then we
could kind of move up to Sade right like

I think it was good enough to save in my
 

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.210

right not only do I want to talk about
it but I actually think it kind of

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:50.440
it but I actually think it kind of
 

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.930
it but I actually think it kind of
underlies the kind of work that I'm

there's a couple things you notice by

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:42.010
there's a couple things you notice by
 

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:43.649
there's a couple things you notice by
this first of all notice the articles

00:17:43.649 --> 00:17:43.659
this first of all notice the articles
 

00:17:43.659 --> 00:17:45.779
this first of all notice the articles
data set slides software and web pages

00:17:45.779 --> 00:17:45.789
data set slides software and web pages
 

00:17:45.789 --> 00:17:46.980
data set slides software and web pages
are all appear as first-class citizens

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:46.990
are all appear as first-class citizens
 

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:49.289
are all appear as first-class citizens
right I think in the future we're gonna

00:17:49.289 --> 00:17:49.299
right I think in the future we're gonna
 

00:17:49.299 --> 00:17:51.120
right I think in the future we're gonna
stop fetishize in the article as the

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:51.130
stop fetishize in the article as the
 

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:53.340
stop fetishize in the article as the
only legitimate means of scholarly you

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:53.350
only legitimate means of scholarly you
 

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:54.779
only legitimate means of scholarly you
know communication we're gonna start

00:17:54.779 --> 00:17:54.789
know communication we're gonna start
 

00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:56.340
know communication we're gonna start
saying this is one way to tell a story

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:56.350
saying this is one way to tell a story
 

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:58.169
saying this is one way to tell a story
about our scholarship there's a lot of

00:17:58.169 --> 00:17:58.179
about our scholarship there's a lot of
 

00:17:58.179 --> 00:17:59.549
about our scholarship there's a lot of
ways we do this we can do a dayss we do

00:17:59.549 --> 00:17:59.559
ways we do this we can do a dayss we do
 

00:17:59.559 --> 00:18:00.810
ways we do this we can do a dayss we do
slides all sorts of different things

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:00.820
slides all sorts of different things
 

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.610
slides all sorts of different things
obviously articles are better in some

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:02.620
obviously articles are better in some
 

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.259
obviously articles are better in some
contexts blog posts are better in other

00:18:04.259 --> 00:18:04.269
contexts blog posts are better in other
 

00:18:04.269 --> 00:18:06.149
contexts blog posts are better in other
contexts but eventually I think when you

00:18:06.149 --> 00:18:06.159
contexts but eventually I think when you
 

00:18:06.159 --> 00:18:07.680
contexts but eventually I think when you
start saying this is the medium the

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:07.690
start saying this is the medium the
 

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:08.820
start saying this is the medium the
message is what we should be caring

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:08.830
message is what we should be caring
 

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:11.070
message is what we should be caring
about so the other thing to notice is

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:11.080
about so the other thing to notice is
 

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.480
about so the other thing to notice is
that we've got these sort of badges up

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:12.490
that we've got these sort of badges up
 

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.370
that we've got these sort of badges up
here so this one looks like it's got a

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:14.380
here so this one looks like it's got a
 

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:15.750
here so this one looks like it's got a
lot of badges this one just looks like

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:15.760
lot of badges this one just looks like
 

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.039
lot of badges this one just looks like
it has a couple so let's investigate

is you want to compare it to a
 

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:56.850
is you want to compare it to a
meaningful reference set for readers on

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:56.860
meaningful reference set for readers on
 

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.009

do that so let's say for instance tweets

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:03.950
do that so let's say for instance tweets
 

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.249
do that so let's say for instance tweets
who tweeted this I need some context

00:20:06.249 --> 00:20:06.259
who tweeted this I need some context
 

00:20:06.259 --> 00:20:07.509

right - tweets is good it puts me in the

00:20:07.509 --> 00:20:07.519
right - tweets is good it puts me in the
 

00:20:07.519 --> 00:20:09.070
right - tweets is good it puts me in the
97th percentile because very few

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:09.080
97th percentile because very few

people are talking about got a
 

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:43.300
people are talking about got a
conversation right and so you can start

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:43.310
conversation right and so you can start
 

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:45.400

like the journal impact factor so that's

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:48.560
like the journal impact factor so that's
 

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.440
like the journal impact factor so that's
the gist of impact story and I can show

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:50.450
the gist of impact story and I can show
 

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:51.970
the gist of impact story and I can show
a lot of other stuff but um that's the

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:51.980
a lot of other stuff but um that's the
 

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:52.540
a lot of other stuff but um that's the
basic idea

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:52.550
basic idea
 

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:54.010

eventually oh yeah one other thing I

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:54.020
eventually oh yeah one other thing I
 

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:54.880
eventually oh yeah one other thing I
forgot to mention which i think is

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:54.890

comparing to just web of science we

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:10.070
comparing to just web of science we
 

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:11.830
comparing to just web of science we
compared to let's say a mesh term right

00:30:40.679 --> 00:30:44.509
dollars that are coming in things like
patents and then citations citations for

00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:44.519
patents and then citations citations for
 

00:30:44.519 --> 00:30:47.149
patents and then citations citations for
published articles are a significant

00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:47.159
published articles are a significant
 

00:30:47.159 --> 00:30:50.149
published articles are a significant
output and they're very easy to count

00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159
output and they're very easy to count
 

00:30:50.159 --> 00:30:52.399
output and they're very easy to count
and so a lot of what we do has been

00:30:52.399 --> 00:30:52.409
and so a lot of what we do has been
 

00:30:52.409 --> 00:30:56.090
and so a lot of what we do has been
built around that however I think that

00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:56.100
built around that however I think that
 

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:57.950
built around that however I think that
it probably goes without saying that

00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:57.960
it probably goes without saying that
 

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.810
it probably goes without saying that
that may not be the best indicator of

that may not be the best indicator of
 

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:01.369
that may not be the best indicator of

the kinds of things that are really
 

00:31:01.379 --> 00:31:03.349
the kinds of things that are really
happening and where the most impactful

00:31:03.349 --> 00:31:03.359
happening and where the most impactful
 

00:31:03.359 --> 00:31:06.289
happening and where the most impactful
work is happening things like papers end

think it's very tempting to use these

00:31:39.529 --> 00:31:39.539
think it's very tempting to use these
 

00:31:39.539 --> 00:31:41.060
think it's very tempting to use these
metrics as a straightforward way to

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:41.070
metrics as a straightforward way to
 

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:43.340
metrics as a straightforward way to
assign value or worth to a researcher

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:43.350
assign value or worth to a researcher
 

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:46.519

for scholarly efforts or even trying to
 

00:31:46.529 --> 00:31:48.830
for scholarly efforts or even trying to
rank journals and I think that these

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.840
rank journals and I think that these
 

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.940
rank journals and I think that these
metrics are very helpful in

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:49.950
metrics are very helpful in
 

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:51.739
metrics are very helpful in
understanding research efforts or

00:31:51.739 --> 00:31:51.749
understanding research efforts or
 

00:31:51.749 --> 00:31:54.649
understanding research efforts or
understanding the relative worth of

00:31:54.649 --> 00:31:54.659
understanding the relative worth of
 

00:31:54.659 --> 00:31:56.690
understanding the relative worth of
certain kinds of research outputs they

00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:56.700
certain kinds of research outputs they
 

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.460
certain kinds of research outputs they
absolutely cannot be considered in a

will demonstrate a high citation count
 

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:52.700
will demonstrate a high citation count
but I think it's fair to say that these

but I think it's fair to say that these
 

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:55.640
but I think it's fair to say that these

enough to measure what we can we need to

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:26.370
enough to measure what we can we need to
 

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:28.820
enough to measure what we can we need to
measure what matters but the you know

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:28.830
measure what matters but the you know
 

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:31.550
measure what matters but the you know
the the here's the important part how do

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.560
the the here's the important part how do
 

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.170
the the here's the important part how do
we measure what matters how do we

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:33.180
we measure what matters how do we
 

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:34.940
we measure what matters how do we
determine that and how do we find it and

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:34.950
determine that and how do we find it and
 

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:37.730
determine that and how do we find it and
it is by no means an easy task

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:37.740
it is by no means an easy task
 

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:41.300
it is by no means an easy task
so we pas we put forward a hybrid

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:41.310
so we pas we put forward a hybrid
 

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:43.910
so we pas we put forward a hybrid
solution so we're looking at something

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920
solution so we're looking at something
 

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.640
solution so we're looking at something
that takes two into account citation

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:46.650
that takes two into account citation
 

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:48.440
that takes two into account citation
analysis and moves it forward

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:48.450
analysis and moves it forward
 

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:51.770
analysis and moves it forward
so this Becker model involves tracking

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:51.780
so this Becker model involves tracking
 

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.690
so this Becker model involves tracking
research outputs that have been

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:53.700
research outputs that have been
 

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.820
research outputs that have been
disseminated and fused to locate

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:55.830
disseminated and fused to locate
 

00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:57.800
disseminated and fused to locate
indicators that demonstrate evidence of

00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:57.810
indicators that demonstrate evidence of
 

00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:01.640
indicators that demonstrate evidence of
research impact so the Becker model is a

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:01.650
research impact so the Becker model is a
 

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:04.520
research impact so the Becker model is a
logic model it we focus on outcomes

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:04.530
logic model it we focus on outcomes
 

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:06.860
logic model it we focus on outcomes
specific to biomedical research bench

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:06.870
specific to biomedical research bench
 

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:08.720
specific to biomedical research bench
and clinical as I mentioned we do have a

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:08.730
and clinical as I mentioned we do have a
 

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:10.580
and clinical as I mentioned we do have a
number of people who are using the model

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:10.590
number of people who are using the model
 

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:12.200
number of people who are using the model
in their own environments and in their

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:12.210
in their own environments and in their
 

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:13.730
in their own environments and in their
own disciplines and they're making

00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:13.740

differences the outcomes are grouped

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440
differences the outcomes are grouped
 

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.380
differences the outcomes are grouped
into pathways based on stages of the

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:21.390
into pathways based on stages of the
 

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:22.820
into pathways based on stages of the
research process and we'll take a look

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:22.830
research process and we'll take a look
 

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:25.040
research process and we'll take a look
at that in a minute and if the indicator

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:25.050
at that in a minute and if the indicator
 

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:27.680
at that in a minute and if the indicator
service specific examples or indicators

service specific examples or indicators
 

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:29.450
service specific examples or indicators
that service specific examples of impact

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:29.460
that service specific examples of impact
 

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:31.970

are noted with outcomes this is an

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:31.980
are noted with outcomes this is an
 

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:35.780
are noted with outcomes this is an
outcome evaluation and if we focus on

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:35.790
outcome evaluation and if we focus on
 

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:39.140
outcome evaluation and if we focus on
outputs and outcomes and we if we think

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:39.150
outputs and outcomes and we if we think
 

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:40.310
outputs and outcomes and we if we think
it's especially important that we

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:40.320
it's especially important that we
 

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.380
it's especially important that we
include unintended effects to judge

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:42.390
include unintended effects to judge
 

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:44.570
include unintended effects to judge
program effectiveness because I think we

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:44.580
program effectiveness because I think we
 

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:47.180
program effectiveness because I think we
are all familiar with the idea that

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:47.190
are all familiar with the idea that
 

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:50.090
are all familiar with the idea that
sometimes the most wonderful outputs are

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:50.100
sometimes the most wonderful outputs are
 

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.020
sometimes the most wonderful outputs are
those that are the most unintended

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:52.030
those that are the most unintended
 

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:56.340
those that are the most unintended
so I mentioned pathways we do have some

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:56.350
so I mentioned pathways we do have some
 

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:59.010
so I mentioned pathways we do have some
specific pathways now this is highly

00:36:59.010 --> 00:36:59.020
specific pathways now this is highly
 

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:01.230
specific pathways now this is highly
relevant to our particular environment

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:01.240
relevant to our particular environment
 

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:03.390
relevant to our particular environment
but I would encourage you to think about

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:03.400
but I would encourage you to think about
 

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:06.420
but I would encourage you to think about
your own environment so advancement of

activity you know we're excited to have
 

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:50.040
activity you know we're excited to have
something that's based in the library

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:50.050
something that's based in the library
 

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:51.690
something that's based in the library
when we feel very strongly that the

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:51.700
when we feel very strongly that the
 

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:54.240
when we feel very strongly that the
library has a number of good resources

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:54.250
library has a number of good resources
 

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:56.700
library has a number of good resources
and also a good perspective of an

00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:56.710
and also a good perspective of an
 

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:59.670
and also a good perspective of an
understanding of of information and

00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680
understanding of of information and
 

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.820
understanding of of information and
information structure and also we I

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:02.830
information structure and also we I
 

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:05.460
information structure and also we I
think by our nature most of us who are

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:05.470
think by our nature most of us who are
 

00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:09.210
think by our nature most of us who are
in the library world really enjoy a good

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:09.220
in the library world really enjoy a good
 

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.940
in the library world really enjoy a good
puzzle and finding things and so it

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:11.950
puzzle and finding things and so it
 

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:13.710
puzzle and finding things and so it
seems like a wonderful marriage of

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:13.720
seems like a wonderful marriage of
 

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:17.400
seems like a wonderful marriage of
skills talents and resources so the

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:17.410
skills talents and resources so the
 

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:19.290
skills talents and resources so the
record model as I mentioned it where we

implementation a good way to know if if

00:40:46.329 --> 00:40:46.339
implementation a good way to know if if
 

00:40:46.339 --> 00:40:47.859
implementation a good way to know if if
something is being used in the clinical

00:40:47.859 --> 00:40:47.869
something is being used in the clinical
 

00:40:47.869 --> 00:40:50.979
something is being used in the clinical
environment is is if it there is a way

00:40:50.979 --> 00:40:50.989
environment is is if it there is a way
 

00:40:50.989 --> 00:40:53.199
environment is is if it there is a way
of documenting that it's happening in

00:40:53.199 --> 00:40:53.209
of documenting that it's happening in
 

00:40:53.209 --> 00:40:55.149
of documenting that it's happening in
the clinical environment so these CPT

00:40:55.149 --> 00:40:55.159
the clinical environment so these CPT
 

00:40:55.159 --> 00:40:57.449
the clinical environment so these CPT
codes are a good indicator of that

00:40:57.449 --> 00:40:57.459
codes are a good indicator of that
 

00:40:57.459 --> 00:40:59.919
codes are a good indicator of that
certainly in medicine if there's a way

00:40:59.919 --> 00:40:59.929
certainly in medicine if there's a way
 

00:40:59.929 --> 00:41:03.129
certainly in medicine if there's a way
of indicating that something needs to be

00:41:03.129 --> 00:41:03.139
of indicating that something needs to be
 

00:41:03.139 --> 00:41:05.649
of indicating that something needs to be
paid for so if there are billing codes

00:41:05.649 --> 00:41:05.659
paid for so if there are billing codes
 

00:41:05.659 --> 00:41:07.959
paid for so if there are billing codes
that's a really good indicator that it's

00:41:07.959 --> 00:41:07.969
that's a really good indicator that it's
 

00:41:07.969 --> 00:41:10.349
that's a really good indicator that it's
happening in the clinical environment

00:41:10.349 --> 00:41:10.359
happening in the clinical environment
 

00:41:10.359 --> 00:41:12.579

be difficult to see from the back of the
 

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:20.330
be difficult to see from the back of the
room but what we've done is we've

room but what we've done is we've
 

00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:22.880
room but what we've done is we've
actually mapped research processes and

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:22.890
actually mapped research processes and

um so we're looking at outputs you know

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:29.250
um so we're looking at outputs you know
 

00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:30.830
um so we're looking at outputs you know
that are very common so yes we do have

00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:30.840
that are very common so yes we do have
 

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:33.110
that are very common so yes we do have
peer-reviewed articles but we also have

00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:33.120
peer-reviewed articles but we also have
 

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:35.360
peer-reviewed articles but we also have
things like software and datasets and

frustrating at times because you do need
 

00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:27.850
frustrating at times because you do need
to go beyond the biomedical research

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:27.860
to go beyond the biomedical research
 

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:31.580
to go beyond the biomedical research
beyond those indices there is a time lag

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:31.590
beyond those indices there is a time lag
 

00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:32.930
beyond those indices there is a time lag
between research discovery and

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:32.940
between research discovery and
 

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:34.640
between research discovery and
translational applications which is

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:34.650
translational applications which is
 

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:36.530
translational applications which is
something this translational application

00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:36.540
something this translational application
 

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:38.690
something this translational application
is we're very interested in how long is

00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:38.700
is we're very interested in how long is
 

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:40.450
is we're very interested in how long is
that time lag well it kind of depends

00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:40.460
that time lag well it kind of depends

things that we can reduce things to
numbers and of course we miss things

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:32.410
numbers and of course we miss things
 

01:13:32.410 --> 01:13:33.780

01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:03.430
might as well do it well and the current
 

01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:05.880
might as well do it well and the current
status is basically you know I'm we're

01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:05.890
status is basically you know I'm we're
 

01:14:05.890 --> 01:14:07.860
status is basically you know I'm we're
doing astronomy with with our eyeballs

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:07.870
doing astronomy with with our eyeballs
 

01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:10.110
doing astronomy with with our eyeballs
right that's the impact factor what we

01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:10.120
right that's the impact factor what we
 

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:11.700
right that's the impact factor what we
need to do is create telescope so I'd

01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:11.710
need to do is create telescope so I'd
 

01:14:11.710 --> 01:14:14.010
need to do is create telescope so I'd
create these sort of tools the equipment

01:14:14.010 --> 01:14:14.020
create these sort of tools the equipment
 

01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:16.020
create these sort of tools the equipment
that we can use to do actually really

01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:16.030
that we can use to do actually really
 

01:14:16.030 --> 01:14:18.630
that we can use to do actually really
precise exact useful broad nuanced

01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:18.640
precise exact useful broad nuanced
 

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.370
precise exact useful broad nuanced
measurements I think we're at the very

01:14:20.370 --> 01:14:20.380
measurements I think we're at the very
 

01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:22.560
measurements I think we're at the very
very beginnings of that but it has a lot

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:22.570
very beginnings of that but it has a lot
 

01:14:22.570 --> 01:14:31.140
very beginnings of that but it has a lot
of potential

01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:31.150
 
 

01:14:31.150 --> 01:14:48.310
 
was that what you're measuring is

01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320
was that what you're measuring is
 

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:51.010
was that what you're measuring is
actually a lot of discussion was

01:14:51.010 --> 01:14:51.020
actually a lot of discussion was
 

01:14:51.020 --> 01:15:02.350
actually a lot of discussion was
happening on that grad student yeah it's

01:15:02.350 --> 01:15:02.360
happening on that grad student yeah it's
 

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:03.460
happening on that grad student yeah it's
a great comment and it's something that

01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:03.470
a great comment and it's something that
 

01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:06.430
a great comment and it's something that
we wondered a lot like you know when we

01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:06.440
we wondered a lot like you know when we
 

01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:07.720
we wondered a lot like you know when we
started doing this so we thought well

01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:07.730
started doing this so we thought well
 

01:15:07.730 --> 01:15:10.260
started doing this so we thought well
let's do a study for it so we did a

01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:10.270
let's do a study for it so we did a
 

01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:13.570
let's do a study for it so we did a
sample of five sort of representative

01:15:13.570 --> 01:15:13.580
sample of five sort of representative
 

01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:15.970
sample of five sort of representative
universities in the US and UK got all of

01:15:15.970 --> 01:15:15.980
universities in the US and UK got all of
 

01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:18.130
universities in the US and UK got all of
the people who all the grad students

01:15:18.130 --> 01:15:18.140
the people who all the grad students
 

01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:19.720
the people who all the grad students
faculty and postdocs who are associate

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:19.730
faculty and postdocs who are associate
 

01:15:19.730 --> 01:15:20.980
faculty and postdocs who are associate
with those universities so at about ten

01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:20.990
with those universities so at about ten
 

01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:23.080
with those universities so at about ten
thousand people and then we searched for

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:23.090
thousand people and then we searched for
 

01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:24.130
thousand people and then we searched for
all of them on Twitter we said well

01:15:24.130 --> 01:15:24.140
all of them on Twitter we said well
 

01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:26.370
all of them on Twitter we said well
let's see how many people are tweeting

01:15:26.370 --> 01:15:26.380
let's see how many people are tweeting
 

01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:28.180
let's see how many people are tweeting
and what what are they tweet about

01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:28.190
and what what are they tweet about
 

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:29.680
and what what are they tweet about
sweded content Alice's in a sample of

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:29.690
sweded content Alice's in a sample of
 

01:15:29.690 --> 01:15:32.050
sweded content Alice's in a sample of
the tweets and we found the generational

01:15:32.050 --> 01:15:32.060
the tweets and we found the generational
 

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:35.820
the tweets and we found the generational
gap is not what one might expect in fact

01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:35.830
gap is not what one might expect in fact
 

01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:38.560
gap is not what one might expect in fact
grad students or we bumped grad students

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:38.570
grad students or we bumped grad students
 

01:15:38.570 --> 01:15:40.660
grad students or we bumped grad students
postdocs and one non faculty active

01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:40.670
postdocs and one non faculty active
 

01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:42.190
postdocs and one non faculty active
category and not in fact they were not

01:15:42.190 --> 01:15:42.200
category and not in fact they were not
 

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:45.850
category and not in fact they were not
any more likely to to tweet than faculty

01:15:45.850 --> 01:15:45.860
any more likely to to tweet than faculty
 

01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:47.380
any more likely to to tweet than faculty
were the only actually the big

01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:47.390
were the only actually the big
 

01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:48.490
were the only actually the big
difference that we found was that

01:15:48.490 --> 01:15:48.500
difference that we found was that
 

01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:50.710
difference that we found was that
faculty were rather more likely to tweet

01:15:50.710 --> 01:15:50.720
faculty were rather more likely to tweet
 

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.990
faculty were rather more likely to tweet
about scholarly things so tweet about

01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:53.000
about scholarly things so tweet about
 

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.540
about scholarly things so tweet about
their work we bought papers that sort of

01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:55.550
their work we bought papers that sort of
 

01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:59.620
their work we bought papers that sort of
thing so about 30 percent of mean and

01:15:59.620 --> 01:15:59.630
thing so about 30 percent of mean and
 

01:15:59.630 --> 01:16:02.080
thing so about 30 percent of mean and
quite a lot variance but the mean about

01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:02.090
quite a lot variance but the mean about
 

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:05.560
quite a lot variance but the mean about
30 percent of scholars sweets were scott

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:05.570
30 percent of scholars sweets were scott
 

01:16:05.570 --> 01:16:07.870
30 percent of scholars sweets were scott
of sorry faculty tweets were scholarly

01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:07.880
of sorry faculty tweets were scholarly
 

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:09.850
of sorry faculty tweets were scholarly
and then only about 15% of graduate

01:16:09.850 --> 01:16:09.860
and then only about 15% of graduate
 

01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:12.580
and then only about 15% of graduate
students tweets were were scholarly so

01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:12.590
students tweets were were scholarly so
 

01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:14.080
students tweets were were scholarly so
actually fact they're a little bit

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:14.090
actually fact they're a little bit
 

01:16:14.090 --> 01:16:16.690
actually fact they're a little bit
over-represented we didn't have data on

01:16:16.690 --> 01:16:16.700
over-represented we didn't have data on
 

01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:18.400
over-represented we didn't have data on
the age of the faculty so that's tough

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:18.410
the age of the faculty so that's tough
 

01:16:18.410 --> 01:16:19.900
the age of the faculty so that's tough
to say but we were encouraged that we

01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:19.910
to say but we were encouraged that we
 

01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:21.400
to say but we were encouraged that we
also looked disciplines we saw there in

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:21.410
also looked disciplines we saw there in
 

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:23.320
also looked disciplines we saw there in
five sort of super disciplinary

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:23.330
five sort of super disciplinary
 

01:16:23.330 --> 01:16:24.490
five sort of super disciplinary
categories there were not major

01:16:24.490 --> 01:16:24.500
categories there were not major
 

01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:27.190
categories there were not major
differences and the usage or how Twitter

01:16:27.190 --> 01:16:27.200
differences and the usage or how Twitter
 

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:29.020
differences and the usage or how Twitter
was used so it's a really good question

01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:29.030
was used so it's a really good question
 

01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:31.240
was used so it's a really good question
at least in case of Twitter I found

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:31.250
at least in case of Twitter I found
 

01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:32.530
at least in case of Twitter I found
those results encouraging the system

01:16:32.530 --> 01:16:32.540
those results encouraging the system
 

01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:33.400
those results encouraging the system
might be getting sort of a broader

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:33.410
might be getting sort of a broader
 

01:16:33.410 --> 01:16:34.810
might be getting sort of a broader
across sample of the scholarly public

01:16:34.810 --> 01:16:34.820
across sample of the scholarly public
 

01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:41.530
across sample of the scholarly public
population yeah no no it's interesting

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:41.540
 
 

01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:44.750

01:20:58.810 --> 01:21:01.170
powerful about it mmm-hmm and so I also
wanted to follow up so I think you know

01:21:01.170 --> 01:21:01.180
wanted to follow up so I think you know
 

01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:03.510
wanted to follow up so I think you know
when we're looking at the various modes

01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:03.520
when we're looking at the various modes
 

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:04.020
when we're looking at the various modes
of

01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:04.030

work I mean there are a lot of things

01:21:08.250 --> 01:21:08.260
work I mean there are a lot of things
 

01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:10.110
work I mean there are a lot of things
there coming into play that you know

01:21:10.110 --> 01:21:10.120
there coming into play that you know
 

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:13.260
there coming into play that you know
weren't around five years ago so you

01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:13.270
weren't around five years ago so you
 

01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:16.440
weren't around five years ago so you
know this is but one tool in our arsenal

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:16.450
know this is but one tool in our arsenal
 

01:21:16.450 --> 01:21:20.850
know this is but one tool in our arsenal
I think you know your question that you

01:21:20.850 --> 01:21:20.860
I think you know your question that you
 

01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:22.650
I think you know your question that you
asked earlier about engaging your

01:21:22.650 --> 01:21:22.660
asked earlier about engaging your
 

01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:25.860
asked earlier about engaging your
faculty members you know I think it is

01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:25.870
faculty members you know I think it is
 

01:21:25.870 --> 01:21:28.200
faculty members you know I think it is
probably safe to say that the majority

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:28.210
probably safe to say that the majority
 

01:21:28.210 --> 01:21:30.420
probably safe to say that the majority
of faculty faculty members do feel

01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:30.430
of faculty faculty members do feel
 

01:21:30.430 --> 01:21:33.000
of faculty faculty members do feel
pressure to try and put their best foot

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:33.010
pressure to try and put their best foot
 

01:21:33.010 --> 01:21:35.010
pressure to try and put their best foot
forward and that's motivated by a number

01:21:35.010 --> 01:21:35.020
forward and that's motivated by a number
 

01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:36.870
forward and that's motivated by a number
of different things so it can be

01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:36.880
of different things so it can be
 

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:38.820
of different things so it can be
internal pressures from the institution

01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:38.830
internal pressures from the institution
 

01:21:38.830 --> 01:21:41.520
internal pressures from the institution
or it can be external pressures from the

01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:41.530
or it can be external pressures from the
 

01:21:41.530 --> 01:21:43.350
or it can be external pressures from the
field and so if you can take advantage

01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:43.360
field and so if you can take advantage
 

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:45.150
field and so if you can take advantage
of some of these things in order to

01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:45.160
of some of these things in order to
 

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:48.240
of some of these things in order to
optimize who you are and itemize how

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:48.250
optimize who you are and itemize how
 

01:21:48.250 --> 01:21:49.560
optimize who you are and itemize how
you're presenting yourself I think it

01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:49.570
you're presenting yourself I think it
 

01:21:49.570 --> 01:21:50.940
you're presenting yourself I think it
makes a big difference

01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:50.950
makes a big difference
 

01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:52.950
makes a big difference

know and there are things that you can

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:01.510
know and there are things that you can
 

01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:03.420
know and there are things that you can
get started with that aren't necessarily

01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:03.430
get started with that aren't necessarily
 

01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:07.350
get started with that aren't necessarily

databases that can provide really
 

01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:19.470
databases that can provide really
meaningful information so if you look at

from a hundred and they picked their
their advisors article for example and

their advisors article for example and
 

01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:17.770
their advisors article for example and
it's a psychology journal so sometimes

01:24:17.770 --> 01:24:17.780
it's a psychology journal so sometimes

the legal system does it so when a case

the legal system does it so when a case

I would imagine that in the legal
 

01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:09.150
I would imagine that in the legal
context it's very common for something

to be disputed or overruled but I would

01:25:11.910 --> 01:25:11.920
to be disputed or overruled but I would

the vast majority of citations would be

there's lots of times when you come up

01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:29.440
there's lots of times when you come up
 

01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:32.880
there's lots of times when you come up
with with data that is it that are

research and and in fact I think part of
 

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:39.990

our problem right now is that that gets

01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:40.000
our problem right now is that that gets
 

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.280
our problem right now is that that gets
ignored too much and not aggregated so I

01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:44.290
ignored too much and not aggregated so I
 

01:25:44.290 --> 01:25:46.560
ignored too much and not aggregated so I
think it's really important to keep

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:46.570
think it's really important to keep
 

01:25:46.570 --> 01:25:48.990
think it's really important to keep
track of that even though in some

01:25:48.990 --> 01:25:49.000
track of that even though in some
 

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.150
track of that even though in some
science is it's smaller than it is in

01:25:51.150 --> 01:25:51.160
science is it's smaller than it is in
 

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:53.340
science is it's smaller than it is in
other sciences and some science is it's

01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:53.350
other sciences and some science is it's
 

01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:54.960

greater but I think it's important to

greater but I think it's important to
 

01:25:54.970 --> 01:26:01.800
greater but I think it's important to
keep track of what's going on yes so

01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:01.810
keep track of what's going on yes so

about just trying to ascertain the

60s let's answer just those sorts of

01:26:20.910 --> 01:26:20.920
60s let's answer just those sorts of
 

01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:22.020
60s let's answer just those sorts of
questions and so you had sort of a

01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:22.030
questions and so you had sort of a
 

01:26:22.030 --> 01:26:23.100
questions and so you had sort of a
typology you know that people have made

01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:23.110
typology you know that people have made
 

01:26:23.110 --> 01:26:26.010
typology you know that people have made
topologies and typically you know it's

01:26:26.010 --> 01:26:26.020
topologies and typically you know it's
 

01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:28.980
topologies and typically you know it's
like five to me at the most 15 percent

01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:28.990
like five to me at the most 15 percent
 

01:26:28.990 --> 01:26:30.630
like five to me at the most 15 percent
sort of negative citations the rest are

01:26:30.630 --> 01:26:30.640
sort of negative citations the rest are
 

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:32.490
sort of negative citations the rest are
generally positive but as you say

01:26:32.490 --> 01:26:32.500
generally positive but as you say
 

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:34.020
generally positive but as you say
there's also sort of things even where

01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:34.030
there's also sort of things even where
 

01:26:34.030 --> 01:26:35.520
there's also sort of things even where
it's cited something cite in the methods

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:35.530

really interesting so there's two sort

01:26:38.370 --> 01:26:38.380
really interesting so there's two sort
 

01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:39.930
really interesting so there's two sort
of approaches to that right one of them

01:26:39.930 --> 01:26:39.940
of approaches to that right one of them
 

01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:41.460

sort of say let's actually type the

01:26:43.230 --> 01:26:43.240
sort of say let's actually type the
 

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:45.990
sort of say let's actually type the
citation let's say this is agrees with

01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:46.000
citation let's say this is agrees with
 

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.050
citation let's say this is agrees with
disagrees with etc so there's really

01:26:49.050 --> 01:26:49.060
disagrees with etc so there's really
 

01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:51.450
disagrees with etc so there's really
cool work called the citation typing

01:26:51.450 --> 01:26:51.460

it's great great question yeah I think

01:28:00.190 --> 01:28:00.200
it's great great question yeah I think
 

01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:04.930
it's great great question yeah I think
that it's it's even even with open good

01:28:04.930 --> 01:28:04.940
that it's it's even even with open good
 

01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:08.010
that it's it's even even with open good

think really at this stage it we don't

01:28:18.790 --> 01:28:18.800
think really at this stage it we don't
 

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:21.910
think really at this stage it we don't
have the technology we don't have the BI

01:28:21.910 --> 01:28:21.920

I do a lot of text mining my team does a

01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:28.900
I do a lot of text mining my team does a
lot of text mining and things that you

01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:28.910
lot of text mining and things that you
 

01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:30.910

would think are solved we struggle with

01:28:30.910 --> 01:28:30.920

problem so I think that I think we will

01:28:40.090 --> 01:28:40.100
problem so I think that I think we will
 

01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:42.100

get there but I think we're fairly far

01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:42.110

at this point it really does come back

01:28:55.630 --> 01:28:55.640
at this point it really does come back
 

01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:59.080
at this point it really does come back

group it's very difficult to pull out I

01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480
group it's very difficult to pull out I
 

01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:16.080
group it's very difficult to pull out I
mean it is it's very difficult

01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:16.090
mean it is it's very difficult
 

01:34:16.090 --> 01:34:18.790
mean it is it's very difficult
yeah I'd echo that that a lot of it's

01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:18.800
yeah I'd echo that that a lot of it's
 

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:21.750
yeah I'd echo that that a lot of it's
probably about the drivers and that

01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:21.760
probably about the drivers and that
 

01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:24.760
probably about the drivers and that
faculty members that are pre-tenure have

01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:24.770
faculty members that are pre-tenure have
 

01:34:24.770 --> 01:34:29.109
faculty members that are pre-tenure have
a very specific driver and so their

01:34:29.109 --> 01:34:29.119
a very specific driver and so their
 

01:34:29.119 --> 01:34:33.040
a very specific driver and so their
behavior is going to largely be is going

01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:33.050

set forth and and those are moving at a

01:34:43.089 --> 01:34:43.099

01:34:43.099 --> 01:34:45.430

glacial it's a very conservative set of

criteria and so I think that you could
 

01:35:01.130 --> 01:35:06.959

argue that universities could do more to

things physics you know it's a highly
 

01:36:01.350 --> 01:36:03.890
things physics you know it's a highly
collaborative field so that's something

01:36:03.890 --> 01:36:03.900
collaborative field so that's something
 

01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:08.330
collaborative field so that's something
that we're seeing and I think you know I

01:36:08.330 --> 01:36:08.340
that we're seeing and I think you know I
 

01:36:08.340 --> 01:36:09.740
that we're seeing and I think you know I
think that that's good there's

01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:09.750
think that that's good there's
 

01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:11.479
think that that's good there's
definitely been an influence on team

01:36:11.479 --> 01:36:11.489
definitely been an influence on team
 

01:36:11.489 --> 01:36:13.280
definitely been an influence on team
science you're seeing it coming from

01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:13.290
science you're seeing it coming from
 

01:36:13.290 --> 01:36:15.229
science you're seeing it coming from
many of the larger funding agencies

01:36:15.229 --> 01:36:15.239
many of the larger funding agencies
 

01:36:15.239 --> 01:36:16.700
many of the larger funding agencies
trying to support that kind of

01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:16.710
trying to support that kind of
 

01:36:16.710 --> 01:36:18.680
trying to support that kind of
collaborative approach and putting in

01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:18.690
collaborative approach and putting in
 

01:36:18.690 --> 01:36:20.750
collaborative approach and putting in
place education and training efforts

01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:20.760
place education and training efforts
 

01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:27.220
place education and training efforts
around those ideas so I'm optimistic oh

01:36:27.220 --> 01:36:27.230
 
 

01:36:27.230 --> 01:36:32.720
