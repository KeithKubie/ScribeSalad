00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.400
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich,

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.660
Radiolab and we're going to go back now to the final segment in our show about

3
00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:11.360
endings recorded live at the paramount theater in Seattle. All right,

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.970
we're going to close the show at, we're going to shift the mood a bit.

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.800
We're going to close out this show and our tour with a very different kind of

6
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:20.140
ending.

7
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.450
<v 1>Yeah, cause unlike dinosaurs, you know,</v>

8
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.550
dinosaurs have no idea what's ever going to happen to them.

9
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.960
But in this story we have an ending in which the enders can see what's coming.

10
00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:33.190
It's coming right at them. Not Fast, but in this case very slowly.

11
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.430
<v 0>So can you guys hear me easily? Easily. Okay, good.</v>

12
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.580
We'll introduce you to two guys. Chris Jones and Dan Moran.

13
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.420
They both actors in Manhattan both been doing it 30 40 years,

14
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.780
<v 2>30 40 years. Plays movies, you name it,</v>

15
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.300
<v 1>five woody on arms body gassers pantomime circus, two in season on Broadway.</v>

16
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.430
Dentelle moonstruck the share moving a lot of Shakespeare, a lot of comedies.

17
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.050
They worked pretty much everywhere there is to work as it happens.

18
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:07.350
I know this story because Chris, one of the actors is an old friend.

19
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:11.970
We met in a high school musical actually many years ago. Oklahoma.

20
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.930
You think everything is Oklahoma? I didn't,

21
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.730
I don't know anything goes [inaudible]

22
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.580
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

23
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.550
<v 0>our story for both Chris and Dan begins 10 years ago.</v>

24
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.020
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

25
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.820
<v 0>Dan was on stage, big stage, Washington DC. I was doing</v>

26
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.310
<v 1>the street car as in streetcar named desire and he was playing the lead role.</v>

27
00:01:33.311 --> 00:01:37.120
Stanley Kowalski. You're the guy that Marlon Brando made famous for yelling,

28
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.073
Hey,

29
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.193
<v 3>that guy,</v>

30
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.190
<v 1>the a woman playing Stella said it's really sexy how your left arm doesn't swing</v>

31
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.360
when you walk. It's kind of like animalistic.

32
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.790
<v 0>I said, well that's cool. So you used it, you thought, alright,</v>

33
00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:58.840
if it works it works.

34
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.950
I'll just play the character that way is the guy whose arm doesn't swing. But

35
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.860
<v 4>I, after the show ended, I was walking down the street in Manhattan. I thought,</v>

36
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.090
why isn't my left arm swinging? What's going on?

37
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.553
<v 1>Well, Chris,</v>

38
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.620
so right out of around the same time he was in Delaware shooting a film movie by

39
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.770
m night Shambhala, kind of a great movie fiesta.

40
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.060
Me called the village

41
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.163
<v 0>marks.</v>

42
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.050
<v 1>I played Adrian Brody's father and while getting ready in wardrobe one day he</v>

43
00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:31.850
noticed that

44
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.640
<v 4>I had a slight tremor,</v>

45
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.890
occasionally difficult time buttoning buttons with my right hand.

46
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.500
I thought I had a pinched nerve in my neck.

47
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.550
I went to see an orthopedic guy and he said, you should see a neurologist.

48
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.700
I went to a doctor and he said,

49
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.230
very gleefully, I think you've got Parkinson's

50
00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.810
<v 1>and he hasn't run a deficit in the Parkinsonian and pleased he is able to help</v>

51
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:03.190
me out. He nailed it.

52
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.260
<v 0>Now Parkinson's,</v>

53
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.320
<v 2>if you ask an expert, which we did, Cheryl Waters, Columbia know</v>

54
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.120
<v 6>firstly medical center. Parkinson's is a very mysterious disease.</v>

55
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.410
I'm not sure what to think about it now because it keeps evolving and changing.

56
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.970
Some people go to Dr. Waters when they get the disease and nothing happens,

57
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.360
nothing.

58
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.480
They come with tremor and they die with a little bit of tremor and nothing else

59
00:03:29.481 --> 00:03:33.290
ever happens. But in other cases, for some reason it could wreak havoc

60
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.660
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

61
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.200
<v 6>because sometimes, and doctors really don't know why this is the case,</v>

62
00:03:39.201 --> 00:03:42.320
sometimes the disease will just start to march through the brain.

63
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.480
It'll begin deep down, low

64
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.180
<v 2>down in the brainstem, and then it will gradually inches weight upward.</v>

65
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.840
First of all, detect this little cluster of cells in the middle of the brain,

66
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:56.080
that control movement and that's when you start to do this shakes and then

67
00:03:56.081 --> 00:04:01.081
little by little there's a progression progression up a migration to the surface

68
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:06.760
to other areas of the brain that control thinking, memory,

69
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.770
concentration.

70
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.850
And in those cases the disease is an extra bleak progressive.

71
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.210
So you got these different kinds of Parkinson's one that sleeps,

72
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.480
<v 0>it goes on the rampage.</v>

73
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.000
The problem is when you're diagnosed you can never quite be sure which kind you

74
00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:24.360
got because for the people in whom it spreads,

75
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.040
it can take decades.

76
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.990
<v 3>Ooh.</v>

77
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.700
<v 1>When he said you have Parkinson's,</v>

78
00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:32.720
did you feel like you were in trouble at the time? I know it was a joke.

79
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.280
It was a joke. This is nothing. I'm fine. In the beginning,

80
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.580
Dan and Chris didn't really worry a whole lot about this cause they didn't have

81
00:04:40.581 --> 00:04:44.600
to. In fact, Chris, when I first was diagnosed and was performing,

82
00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.680
he was doing a lot of Shakespeare and you'll,

83
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.310
if his hand ever started to shake a bit,

84
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.990
it was always nice to have a nice big cloaker Cape for me to wear it and hide my

85
00:04:53.991 --> 00:04:56.900
hand behind so that the audience wouldn't see the tremor.

86
00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.380
Truth is it didn't happen. All that often wasn't much of a deal.

87
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:01.760
Chris kept acting.

88
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.470
Dan kept acting and in both of them their Parkinson's seemed to be the kind that

89
00:05:06.471 --> 00:05:08.570
stays asleep for

90
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.610
<v 0>two years, three years, five years,</v>

91
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.980
seven years. But then after eight years

92
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.510
<v 3>the</v>

93
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.720
<v 2>just woke up. I just found out that he got hurt and a hundred a moon.</v>

94
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.570
Dan says it's not quite sure when it happened,

95
00:05:29.571 --> 00:05:32.090
but suddenly his limbs were aching all the time.

96
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.480
And that easy control that you have over your body as you're walking down the

97
00:05:36.481 --> 00:05:39.330
street where all the limbs are moving together and you don't have to think about

98
00:05:39.331 --> 00:05:40.100
it.

99
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.800
<v 7>For him to disappear,</v>

100
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.340
<v 2>you'd have to think about each leg, each foot, independently,</v>

101
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.710
<v 5>left foot, right foot,</v>

102
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.590
<v 2>left heel, right heel to Chris.</v>

103
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.850
He would actually have these moments where he would to move his arm where his

104
00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:01.040
brain would basically say to his arm, whooo,

105
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.250
<v 1>but his arm would just sit there and stuck like it wanted to move.</v>

106
00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.610
It just somehow couldn't. I would freeze on stage.

107
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.280
It was a nightmare

108
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:15.040
<v 2>and as things progressed,</v>

109
00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:19.390
Dan would have these moments in rehearsals where suddenly he would just go

110
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:20.583
blank.

111
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.940
<v 1>I had done this TV show on FX.</v>

112
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.480
I had the one scene where I couldn't remember five lines. I just couldn't.

113
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.990
We were five lines. We'd shot all night on this

114
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.280
<v 2>[inaudible] two lines and come back out. I love it.</v>

115
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:38.240
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

116
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.360
<v 2>now this isn't an easy situation for anybody, but if you're an actor,</v>

117
00:06:41.361 --> 00:06:43.790
if you're somebody who has to inhabit a character,

118
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.330
the different rhythm than yours and different flow, use your body to do that,

119
00:06:47.331 --> 00:06:49.560
which is how you pay the rent for that.

120
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.010
<v 1>Sure. His Parkinson's is just awful because it kills their craft.</v>

121
00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.940
While your face becomes a mask too,

122
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.550
you haven't got your face and without face you don't have flow.

123
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.410
<v 4>The way I liken it, if you take a pebble and you throw it into a pool of water,</v>

124
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.750
it goes and there's a ripple that goes.

125
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.230
Just concentric circles go out from the impact.

126
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.720
If you take me my body,

127
00:07:15.721 --> 00:07:20.721
my self as an actor and you throw a pebble into my pool,

128
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:25.780
it goes thud. There's no fluidity.

129
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:30.200
There's new. It just stops. I mean, once I,

130
00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:33.970
I opened up to the, uh, acting world, I had Parkinson's,

131
00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.540
my agents dropped me. The, uh,

132
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.410
cause pretty much stopped calling and that was that.

133
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.040
But then one night something happened.

134
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.780
<v 2>How did this idea come up? Well,</v>

135
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:55.730
it was my first idea in, I guess your brilliant idea. Thank you buddy.

136
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.040
And we should say that these two guys, Chris and Dan,

137
00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.990
they've actually known each other for years.

138
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:04.040
The two of you met doing what among within country,

139
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.340
which is a classic plague on Broadway and Dan explains,

140
00:08:07.341 --> 00:08:09.740
it was late one night he was having insomnia,

141
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.670
which is a usual side effect of the medication he has to take and he was just

142
00:08:13.671 --> 00:08:17.420
looking around for something to read and he grabs this play off the shelf and

143
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:21.110
just picked it up. It was a play by Samuel Beckett and game

144
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:27.230
<v 1>play in one act and he starts reading characters and Hammond clove.</v>

145
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.410
<v 2>I mean this was a play that he knew he had read it before,</v>

146
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:34.550
but that night it seemed to talk to him in a way that was totally new

147
00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.700
<v 1>there. Interior gray light right from the start.</v>

148
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.310
It started off in the Guy Shuffling onstage.

149
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:45.230
Clove goes and stands under the window, left, stiff, staggering walk,

150
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.720
shuffling around. He looks up in the window left.

151
00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.980
He turned to look out the window right and I, yeah, I know shuffling.

152
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.950
He thought, I feel this guy

153
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.010
<v 2>can sit, can't get comfortable. Seem familiar to him.</v>

154
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:04.290
And then on the next page I am stirs another guy. Interested seem very red face,

155
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:08.430
black glasses also in bad shape. This guy stuck in this wheelchair,

156
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:12.830
can't walk anymore. He takes off his glasses, likes his face and the glasses.

157
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.990
Put some on again. So here you got these two guys. One can't sit,

158
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.520
one can't stand.

159
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:21.320
They're stuck in this little room with these two windows that look out and

160
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:25.110
outside those windows either due to an asteroid,

161
00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:30.090
a nuclear holocaust. What used to be green is now gray,

162
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:36.940
like a wasteland. Is there anyone alive out there,

163
00:09:36.941 --> 00:09:38.800
do you think? Oh No, no.

164
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:40.000
<v 3>Okay.</v>

165
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.340
<v 2>Outside their window, they can see the ocean,</v>

166
00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.670
but it seems to have stopped moving. There are no waves

167
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:48.683
<v 1>now in game.</v>

168
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:51.120
<v 3>Hm.</v>

169
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.780
<v 2>That's a term that comes from the chest and it refers to that moment in the game</v>

170
00:09:54.781 --> 00:09:57.990
when they're just a few pieces and just a few moves left.

171
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.670
The last few moves before the inevitable outcome. It's not the end.

172
00:10:02.671 --> 00:10:04.830
It's the point right before the ad.

173
00:10:04.831 --> 00:10:08.010
And it's the place where you become aware of the end for the first time.

174
00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:11.160
The dinosaur can't do that, but these two characters,

175
00:10:11.161 --> 00:10:13.530
they've run out of everything out of painkiller,

176
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:19.190
painkillers are gone out of biscuits and they have that awful awareness and now

177
00:10:19.651 --> 00:10:22.860
they have to deal with it. Like here we are. Where do we do?

178
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:29.420
<v 1>How do we fill up the time on this rock hurtling through space.</v>

179
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.593
The more I read it,

180
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:35.850
it just felt like Parkinson's to me being locked in a room was my body.

181
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:39.450
Am I getting out? There's no killer. I'm not getting out of this room.

182
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:43.320
And then on page three, one of the characters,

183
00:10:43.321 --> 00:10:47.370
a guy named Pam stops what he's doing and he says, enough.

184
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.780
It's time it ended and yet

185
00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:54.750
they hesitate.

186
00:10:55.710 --> 00:11:00.710
I hesitate too to end and dance has something about the line and yet I hesitate.

187
00:11:02.521 --> 00:11:06.390
I hesitate too to end just flipped a switch for him.

188
00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.010
Screw these people that won't hire me.

189
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.390
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

190
00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:16.040
<v 2>because I've got this fucking little disease that makes me shake or talk funny.</v>

191
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:19.580
I don't need those people. No. The next morning he calls Chris.

192
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:22.720
Chris described the call, you're sitting there and one day the phone rings.

193
00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:23.960
Is that what's happening? He says,

194
00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.680
how'd you like to get together and take a look at in game Christian members

195
00:11:27.681 --> 00:11:32.450
thinking, I dunno, I'm not sure if I'm up to it. It's a 70 minute long play.

196
00:11:32.451 --> 00:11:36.940
It's gotten 12,000 words and material is monumental, I think. I know that.

197
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:40.460
Let's just, no pressure. Let's just, let's just meet at each other's apartments.

198
00:11:40.461 --> 00:11:42.920
So one day Dan would read one part, Chris, the other part,

199
00:11:42.921 --> 00:11:45.350
the next day they'd switch. And they did this for almost a year,

200
00:11:45.351 --> 00:11:47.270
the two of them each other's living rooms,

201
00:11:47.271 --> 00:11:52.100
reading the play back and forth until finally they contacted the beck of the

202
00:11:52.101 --> 00:11:54.400
state and got to put on one

203
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.040
<v 4>live performance in New York.</v>

204
00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:02.140
We decided Chris is having more trouble with his movement than I am.

205
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:05.620
I'm more trouble with my speech and Chris's. So I thought,

206
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.810
well why don't I dig on the part with all the speech?

207
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.780
And you got all the moving. So when you do the pilot, the whole movement.

208
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:14.110
That makes sense. So you both leaned into your weaknesses. Yes.

209
00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:15.550
We'll show the [inaudible].

210
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:20.550
The obvious question is why would two people in danger and in more danger over

211
00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:21.700
time,

212
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:26.700
why would you decide to spend time staring at that danger straight in the eye?

213
00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.670
Like that's just a weird thing to do [inaudible] and do it.

214
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:34.570
That's the only way to do it. I can't like go through my list,

215
00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:37.570
my life being afraid of this fucking disease.

216
00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:42.430
When he said that I didn't quite understand what he was saying cause if you are

217
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.350
legitimately afraid of something,

218
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:48.850
why would it make you less afraid to stare at it's details?

219
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.350
That would make me more afraid.

220
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:53.110
<v 0>I don't know if it's about fear really. I think it's about knowing,</v>

221
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:58.060
knowing what, knowing. Just knowing where you are, like where you really are.

222
00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.940
You know? It's like a kind of journalism in a way.

223
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:04.810
Like I can imagine if you've got this thing that's been stealing from you for 10

224
00:13:04.811 --> 00:13:09.010
years, right? Stealing your body. It's steering your craft at a certain way.

225
00:13:09.011 --> 00:13:11.250
You want to know like where am I at? Am I in my past? It is,

226
00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:12.700
the end already happened for me.

227
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:16.450
Am I broken or do I have something left?

228
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.150
I mean it's sorta like in one of the back of plays, not this one,

229
00:13:19.151 --> 00:13:19.871
but an earlier one.

230
00:13:19.871 --> 00:13:23.290
Their character waltz is on the stage and he says the following two sentences,

231
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:28.390
I can't go on. I will go on. It's like there's two sentences. Contradiction,

232
00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:29.980
right. I can't go on. I will go on.

233
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.890
It's almost as if Dan is trying to figure out which sentence is he.

234
00:13:32.891 --> 00:13:35.650
Is he the I can't. Is it done or is he the,

235
00:13:35.651 --> 00:13:38.500
I will like he's got something left and the only way to know that is to look at

236
00:13:38.501 --> 00:13:41.090
the thing that's posing the question. Yep.

237
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.200
<v 4>What if you put on the play and you find that you get the wrong answer,</v>

238
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:48.490
you find out I can't. This is what Chris was worried about.

239
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:53.700
The big issue for me was what happens to my sense of myself if we get to the

240
00:13:54.641 --> 00:13:58.840
performance stage of this project and it turns out,

241
00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:01.300
<v 3>mm,</v>

242
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.930
<v 4>can I, I couldn't cut it.</v>

243
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:06.970
<v 0>And yet they go on</v>

244
00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:12.690
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

245
00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.540
<v 6>after a year of reading this play back and forth in their living rooms.</v>

246
00:14:15.541 --> 00:14:18.900
Chris and Dan decide, okay, it's time to find a performance space.

247
00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:20.970
Time to hire a director.

248
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.210
Oh they used to come dragging their asses into rehearsal,

249
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:28.890
looking like these guys are going to be able to go from here to there.

250
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.140
That's yoga. Fozzy Chris and dance director.

251
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.020
Shaky and wiggly as I used to call him. He's known him for years.

252
00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.710
You did not call him back cause that's what they were doing.

253
00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.250
It just says Dan and Chris for two of the best actors he has ever worked with.

254
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:45.510
And oddly enough, in this case, their disease could be an asset.

255
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.840
I believe that because they're halfway home,

256
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:53.000
they could feel what Beckett's characters in play were feeling better than

257
00:14:53.001 --> 00:14:55.730
anyone. I never felt for a moment this wasn't gonna make the play better.

258
00:14:55.790 --> 00:15:00.020
If they could get through rehearsals, easier said than done.

259
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:04.550
Take the problem with the medication. No, both of them.

260
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:08.100
When they're peaking on their meds, they are sharp. They're clear focus.

261
00:15:08.101 --> 00:15:11.550
But when the med start to taper away, they get cloudy.

262
00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.720
So the hope was if they were going to rehearse together, they some have to,

263
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:19.130
they'd have to time it just right so that they pop their pills at the right time

264
00:15:19.131 --> 00:15:21.920
and rise together, get clear,

265
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.720
and then taper off together at the same time.

266
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:29.510
<v 2>The medication gives you about an hour and a half window.</v>

267
00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:33.290
Might be just enough time to run a few seeds. Problem was,

268
00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.470
it wouldn't always work. I'd somebody I'd walk in and Dan says,

269
00:15:36.471 --> 00:15:39.800
even when it's time to chest, right. Sometimes the medication wouldn't take,

270
00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.680
I would be completely locked up and Chris would be right in the middle of the

271
00:15:42.681 --> 00:15:46.330
scene doing really well and then gets so tired he'd have to sit down.

272
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:49.470
Didn't have much stamina, so it's like that's just turn on,

273
00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.480
go home or break out the mattresses. Sometimes Joe says they actually did.

274
00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:56.510
We lay around on the floor or we just do something like you'd lay around on the

275
00:15:56.511 --> 00:15:58.460
floor. Yeah. I said, let's lay down. Let's,

276
00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:00.620
why don't we lay down and do the lines laying down.

277
00:16:00.621 --> 00:16:04.010
That's actually a great exercise point is that a lot of times rehearsals were a

278
00:16:04.011 --> 00:16:07.810
bust and as they got closer and closer to the performance day, Dan would say,

279
00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:12.320
take me aside and say, you know, I gotta tell you Joe, this is okay,

280
00:16:12.321 --> 00:16:16.160
but I'm scared out of my mind, you know, scared out of my mind.

281
00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:20.580
So it became terrifying and I said,

282
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.680
well that's good if you know who are since when shouldn't we be scared right

283
00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:27.980
there. And then he'd remind Dan of a basic law of the theater.

284
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:32.180
Terrible rehearsals make great performances most of the time.

285
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:35.990
But they knew this was a very different situation.

286
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:41.380
<v 0>Very different at 15 oh,</v>

287
00:16:41.381 --> 00:16:45.130
thank you baby. Then came July 13th last year,

288
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.250
the people are coming the night of the performance.

289
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:55.450
Rosie, you got an understudies couple of minutes before the show.

290
00:16:55.451 --> 00:17:00.310
Dan Calls for the so-called understudies and then runs to the back door to smoke

291
00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:01.050
a cigarette.

292
00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:04.650
<v 4>I'm looking up this door and having shit y looked out and hash through it many</v>

293
00:17:04.651 --> 00:17:08.700
times before. Everything's seems familiar,

294
00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.513
<v 1>but</v>

295
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:17.100
<v 4>I don't belong there. I feel like, I feel like I'm [inaudible]</v>

296
00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:19.403
<v 1>Huh?</v>

297
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:24.600
<v 4>Like, what am I doing here? He says, he kept thinking,</v>

298
00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.230
how did I think I could do this? I mean, I'm going to fuck it up.

299
00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:32.850
I'm going to forget lines. I'm not the character. I'm not,

300
00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:35.490
I'm not fully the character. I haven't rehearsed enough.

301
00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:37.140
I haven't had enough rehearsal time.

302
00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:39.360
<v 0>And he says he actually walked out the door,</v>

303
00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:44.070
got about halfway out cause he's at that moment he was thinking, you know that,

304
00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.600
I mean that question, can I or can I?

305
00:17:45.601 --> 00:17:49.440
I've got my answer and I'm about to go out in front of hundreds of people and

306
00:17:49.441 --> 00:17:54.210
show them nakedly. Then I am broken that I can't do this.

307
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:58.640
Does the end has already happened. Then he thought,

308
00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.680
I've started this ball rolling.

309
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:07.060
I couldn't stop it. So no,

310
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:10.360
just do what you have to do. Just start at the beginning.

311
00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.430
Go until the end and then the stop

312
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.090
<v 1>[inaudible]. Okay, so the play begins with Dan in the middle of the stage.</v>

313
00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:27.980
He's asleep in a wheelchair, covered by a sheet. Chris Paces around behind him,

314
00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:31.480
sort of shuffles about, looks out those windows. Mumbles,

315
00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:38.820
it started off okay. Chris was very good where you're not getting a laugh.

316
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:44.440
[inaudible] Huh?

317
00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:50.770
For sound. He makes, he gets a laugh right from the start.

318
00:18:50.771 --> 00:18:52.510
The audience got back his humor.

319
00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.730
That was a great, great relief.

320
00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:03.000
<v 0>But then the thing Dan feared most happened in one of the big speeches of the</v>

321
00:19:03.001 --> 00:19:07.470
play. You went blank. Oh my God. What's my next line?

322
00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.260
I lost a line.

323
00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:18.060
He says he stared down at his feet for 20 seconds and then his wife Ruth Fed him

324
00:19:18.061 --> 00:19:22.140
a line and he went on. That was one moment,

325
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.530
but there was another moment,

326
00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:31.050
a series of moments actually that were entirely different.

327
00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:36.670
It began finish this finish just after Chris's opening monologue,

328
00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:41.480
Stan begins to speak John de be misery

329
00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.900
<v 1>loftier than mine.</v>

330
00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:50.140
If I tried my damnedest to just stay with the story moment by moment enough,

331
00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:53.391
it's time.

332
00:19:53.391 --> 00:19:58.391
It ended in the shelter too and yet I hesitate.

333
00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:03.410
I hesitate to to N.

334
00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:04.490
Yes,

335
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:07.220
<v 0>there it is. It's time and under acetate.</v>

336
00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.800
Dan says as he was up there making that speech,

337
00:20:09.801 --> 00:20:12.650
that speech about how it's time to end and yet he hesitates.

338
00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:14.630
A funny thing happened.

339
00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.650
You know how my performance muscles started to take over his body,

340
00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.320
loosened up his legs, his arms, his mouth.

341
00:20:21.321 --> 00:20:24.860
Suddenly they were under his control in a way they hadn't been for months.

342
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.630
He can move them without thinking.

343
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:31.090
<v 1>Let's was acquiring Michael Cole. Yes. Have you not had enough?</v>

344
00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:33.413
Yes.

345
00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:37.720
We were able to do things on stage of what,

346
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.660
that's huge.

347
00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.520
<v 0>Just stretching the plate. It was like the disease was gone.</v>

348
00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.760
<v 1>That's always the lay at the end of the day, isn't it closed? Always.</v>

349
00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:47.980
It's the end of the day. Like

350
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.630
<v 8>any other day isn't even close. Login. What's happening? What is happening?</v>

351
00:20:52.631 --> 00:20:54.730
Something is taking its course

352
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.140
<v 3>and then there we are. Good. I am. That's enough.</v>

353
00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:04.653
It was over

354
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:26.463
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

355
00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:39.893
<v 1>it was amazing.</v>

356
00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.480
And then I remember walking back stage and Chris and I just burst into tears.

357
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.300
Well you just don't cry.

358
00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:57.180
It was not so much about the release of doing it,

359
00:21:57.181 --> 00:21:59.700
but I think and more to do with family,

360
00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:10.010
our kids and our why and some really good friends could see that

361
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:21.390
there's still some kind of possibility and I do believe that it was mixed with

362
00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:25.750
feeling like, Oh God, I'm going to miss this.

363
00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:32.230
<v 4>For me, a lot of times when I commit to a project,</v>

364
00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:38.040
one of the things that I'm sort of curious about is who will I meet in the

365
00:22:40.091 --> 00:22:44.050
person of me in this project?

366
00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:50.020
Ooh, who will I find in the room when I, when I work on the material,

367
00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:55.220
I was pretty proud of

368
00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.173
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

369
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:02.470
<v 4>who I found on this one.</v>

370
00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.310
<v 3>There's something in this story that</v>

371
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:16.000
it speaks to all the things we feel about endings.

372
00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.580
I mean obviously it hurts. It hurts to end.

373
00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:26.440
This is Dan says, and this is the line that gets me every night. Oh God,

374
00:23:26.441 --> 00:23:27.310
I'm going to miss this.

375
00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:33.550
But there's also something in with Chris says that if you stare unblinkingly at

376
00:23:33.761 --> 00:23:38.200
the truth, you sometimes find something in yourself that you hadn't seen before,

377
00:23:38.201 --> 00:23:40.750
which is in its way a new beginning.

378
00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:45.680
So it's time. Yeah, it's time end.

379
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:47.451
<v 2>You know,</v>

380
00:23:47.451 --> 00:23:52.100
we've never quite figured out how to end this show about endings except maybe to

381
00:23:52.101 --> 00:23:55.790
follow Dan's simple advice and start at the beginning. Go until the end,

382
00:23:55.820 --> 00:24:00.410
then stop. Yeah. So Ladies and gentlemen, we've started at the beginning.

383
00:24:00.411 --> 00:24:03.590
We've gone to the end and now we will stop.

384
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.780
I'd like to go on a little bit longer. Just a little bit. All right.

385
00:24:11.781 --> 00:24:13.730
Then Reggie, take us out.

386
00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:32.043
<v 3>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

387
00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:02.983
[inaudible] [inaudible]

388
00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:14.530
[inaudible]

389
00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:16.360
<v 0>this moment right here, this moment,</v>

390
00:25:16.361 --> 00:25:20.080
no one had a better view of this moment than me because I'm sitting there behind

391
00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:23.320
the desk. You get out from the desk, walk to the side of the stage,

392
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:27.100
get the hyper-realistic T-rex, dinosaur,

393
00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:30.100
masterfully puppeteered by Mr Myron Cuso,

394
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:33.880
and you guys have like a break dance dance off in the middle of the stage.

395
00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:37.900
2,500 people just do not know what they're looking at because they're seeing

396
00:25:37.901 --> 00:25:41.790
Robert Krulwich bust a move. I mean like busted moving that like, you know,

397
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:46.180
Young Mc like 1995 way busting move. It's like, it's amazing.

398
00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.480
It's so amazing in fact that you have to go to the website right now,

399
00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.700
radiolab.org/live and watch it.

400
00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:57.030
I also shot multiple videos from the behind the stage cause I was like

401
00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.460
[inaudible], I can't do this. It was so,

402
00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:06.910
it was the most joyful thing I've ever seen.

403
00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.940
And I want to thank you for that, Robert,

404
