00:00:00.604 --> 00:00:03.086
In our planned expenditure
remodel we've been

00:00:03.086 --> 00:00:05.939
assuming that planned investment is fixed.

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.204
What I want to do in
this video is think about

00:00:08.204 --> 00:00:15.093
how real interest rates
drive planned investment.

00:00:15.093 --> 00:00:18.205
Think about the function investment as a

00:00:18.205 --> 00:00:20.754
function of real interest
rates. Planned investment as

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:24.337
a function of real interest rates.

00:00:24.337 --> 00:00:27.426
Talking about real
interest rates, I'm really

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:29.668
just talking about nominal interest rates

00:00:29.668 --> 00:00:32.920
factoring out or
discounting what's going on

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.270
with inflation. There's
other videos where we

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.937
go into more depth about
that. Another thing

00:00:35.937 --> 00:00:37.874
if there were no
inflation real and nominal

00:00:37.874 --> 00:00:39.822
rates would be the same thing.

00:00:39.822 --> 00:00:43.010
I want to tackle it with
a very tangible example.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.339
Let's say this up coming
year there's a bunch

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:47.476
of potential planned projects.

00:00:47.476 --> 00:00:52.807
Let's call this projects.
Theses are potential

00:00:52.807 --> 00:00:56.871
investments. You have
projects, and then you have

00:00:56.871 --> 00:00:58.934
some level of expected return.

00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:00.942
Each of the people who are thinking about

00:01:00.942 --> 00:01:02.678
these projects, they all
have their spreadsheets

00:01:02.678 --> 00:01:04.868
out, and they've taken
in risk and probabilities

00:01:04.868 --> 00:01:06.874
and all of the rest. They've come up with

00:01:06.874 --> 00:01:09.937
their expected return numbers.

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:12.937
Let's say project A has
an expected return of

00:01:12.937 --> 00:01:20.136
20%, B 18%, C 16%. I'll do a couple more.

00:01:20.136 --> 00:01:32.141
D is 10% , E is 5% and F is 2%.
Let's say initially in one state

00:01:32.141 --> 00:01:34.538
of affairs interest rates
are relatively high.

00:01:34.538 --> 00:01:40.202
Let's R1 is equal to 19% interest rates.

00:01:40.202 --> 00:01:44.668
We have 19% real interest
rates. These are the

00:01:44.668 --> 00:01:47.201
real expected returns.
Which of these projects

00:01:47.201 --> 00:01:49.139
will actually be invested in?

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:51.205
Which of the ones will people actually do?

00:01:51.205 --> 00:01:53.274
If someone has the cash, they say well,

00:01:53.274 --> 00:01:56.512
I could either lend my money out for 19%,

00:01:56.512 --> 00:01:58.800
or I could do this project and get 20%.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.403
If they have the cash
they would definitely

00:02:00.403 --> 00:02:02.530
do this. If they don't
have the cash, they could

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.788
say, well, I could
borrow the money for 19%,

00:02:04.788 --> 00:02:07.611
and I could invest it at 20%.
I'll make money off of that.

00:02:07.611 --> 00:02:12.027
Project A will definitely be done.

00:02:12.027 --> 00:02:13.585
What about project B?

00:02:13.585 --> 00:02:15.949
Project B, if the person
actually has the cash

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:17.728
on hand to do project
B, they say I could do

00:02:17.728 --> 00:02:20.286
project B and get an 18% real return,

00:02:20.286 --> 00:02:22.656
or I could lend that
money out and get a 19%

00:02:22.656 --> 00:02:25.194
in real return. Actually, I would not do

00:02:25.194 --> 00:02:27.121
project B. I'll just say
I would not do anything

00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:29.120
that has a even a lower real return.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.197
If I could potentially
do project B, but I had

00:02:32.197 --> 00:02:34.619
to borrow the money,
if I have to borrow the

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:37.456
money at 19% real interest, and I'm only

00:02:37.456 --> 00:02:40.370
getting 18% on it, that's a
money loosing proposition.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.327
I wouldn't do B, and I
definitely wouldn't do

00:02:42.327 --> 00:02:44.535
all these things that get a lower return.

00:02:44.535 --> 00:02:47.541
When I have high interest
rates right over here

00:02:47.541 --> 00:02:49.984
the only thing I would do is project A.

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:54.606
Let's think about what
would happen if interest

00:02:54.606 --> 00:02:56.545
rates went down.

00:02:56.545 --> 00:02:59.267
If real interest rates went down.

00:02:59.267 --> 00:03:02.332
Let's say real interest
... let's call that R2.

00:03:04.532 --> 00:03:07.670
Real interest rates go
down to ... let's say

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.402
they go down to 3%. Once
again, project A you

00:03:12.402 --> 00:03:14.743
are definitely going
to do. If you have the

00:03:14.743 --> 00:03:17.261
money on hand, you get
20% doing project A.

00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:19.139
You definitely don't want
to lend it out at 3%.

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:20.884
If you don't have the
money on hand, you can

00:03:20.884 --> 00:03:23.546
borrow at 3% and invest at 20%.

00:03:23.546 --> 00:03:27.221
By the same logic, people
would do project B.

00:03:27.221 --> 00:03:31.265
You could borrow at 3% and make 18%.

00:03:31.265 --> 00:03:34.340
If you have the money,
you get 18% verses 3% on

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.305
your money, so you definitely do this.

00:03:36.305 --> 00:03:40.217
You do all of these up to project E.

00:03:40.217 --> 00:03:43.065
If you have the money,
you would rather put that

00:03:43.065 --> 00:03:45.553
money and get 5% then lend
it out and only get 3%.

00:03:45.553 --> 00:03:47.738
You'll even do project
E if you need to borrow

00:03:47.738 --> 00:03:49.665
it and still makes sense.
Borrow money at 3%,

00:03:49.665 --> 00:03:52.882
invest it at 5%, your
making some real return.

00:03:52.882 --> 00:03:56.666
The only one that you would not
do is project F right over here.

00:03:56.666 --> 00:03:59.810
Here you aren't actually
covering your cost of

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.996
borrowing. If you have to borrow at 3% and

00:04:01.996 --> 00:04:04.140
invest at 2%, doesn't make sense.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.334
If you have the money,
you would rather lend

00:04:06.334 --> 00:04:08.553
your money at 3% then
do project F. So, your

00:04:08.553 --> 00:04:13.404
definitely not going to
do F in this scenario.

00:04:13.404 --> 00:04:15.606
Obviously do it in neither scenario.

00:04:15.606 --> 00:04:19.529
Right over here, you'd
do all of the above.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:25.606
You would do A, B, C,
D, not all of the above.

00:04:25.606 --> 00:04:30.667
All of the above except
for F. A, B, C, D, and E.

00:04:30.667 --> 00:04:33.478
Let's just think about the
rough level of investments.

00:04:33.478 --> 00:04:38.558
If we were to plot on
this axis right over here,

00:04:38.558 --> 00:04:43.529
if we were to plot the
investments as a function

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:46.473
of real interest rate,
and over here we actually

00:04:46.473 --> 00:04:51.478
have the ... independent
variables are real

00:04:51.478 --> 00:04:54.314
interest rate. At a high
real interest we had

00:04:54.314 --> 00:04:56.643
a low level investment.
We only did project A.

00:04:56.643 --> 00:05:00.671
That's right over there. That's A only.

00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:02.734
This is when we were at R1.

00:05:02.734 --> 00:05:06.068
When we lowered interest
rates to R2, we had a

00:05:06.068 --> 00:05:08.148
much higher level of investment.

00:05:08.148 --> 00:05:10.484
We did all of these
projects right over here.

00:05:10.484 --> 00:05:13.465
You had a much higher level of investment.

00:05:13.465 --> 00:05:20.598
This is A, B, C, D, and
E. You see that you have

00:05:20.598 --> 00:05:23.070
an inverse relationship.
The lower the real

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.565
interest rate, the more
investment that's going

00:05:25.565 --> 00:05:27.598
to go on. The higher the
interest rate, the less

00:05:27.598 --> 00:05:29.405
investment that goes on.

00:05:29.405 --> 00:05:31.600
You can debate whether
it's a curve or a line,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.074
bur for the sake of
simplicity, we'll assume

00:05:34.074 --> 00:05:38.398
that it looks something
like ... I'll draw a

00:05:38.398 --> 00:05:40.606
dotted line it's easier for me do that.

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:42.670
It might look something like that.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.338
Now, we can use this
insight to start thinking

00:05:45.338 --> 00:05:47.906
about how a change in
real interest rate might

00:05:47.906 --> 00:05:49.999
shift our plan expenditures on our

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:52.128
[unintelligible 05:50]
and from that we can

00:05:52.128 --> 00:05:54.128
start to think about the IS curve.

00:05:54.128 --> 00:05:57.256
The famous IS curve and the ISLM model.
