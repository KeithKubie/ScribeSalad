1
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.140
You are listening to radiolab radio from

2
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.673
W. N. Y. S. T. E. N. N. P. R.

3
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.920
I thought we would begin by looking backwards at a,

4
00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:17.230
at a wonderful moment in the history cinematically of parasites.

5
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.240
He's the cinematic history of parasites. Okay, so do you remember that movie?

6
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.920
I'm not going to tell you the name of it. Yeah. Starts out. In fact,

7
00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:31.480
I have the script right here. Setting space.

8
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.140
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

9
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.440
<v 0>Okay. That just empty space</v>

10
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.973
script continues.

11
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.510
The stars shine cold and remote like the love of God. Ooh,

12
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.870
you imagining this? Yes.

13
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.780
Now floating in that vast nothingness as a tiny dot of a ship.

14
00:00:50.781 --> 00:00:51.850
You can barely see it. Hmm.

15
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.570
<v 1>Cut to the interior of the ship.</v>

16
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.740
Here we are in a ship full of astronauts who are tired and dirty.

17
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.240
Renee will tell you, look there, no

18
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:02.900
<v 0>palling around and you just get the feeling.</v>

19
00:01:02.901 --> 00:01:07.901
This is a normal day in their astronauts lie until what they're on the computer

20
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.210
radar is a disturbance, some kind of distress.

21
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.670
CIC transmission out here. Yeah.

22
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.520
Do you think we got to check this out so they trace the signal,

23
00:01:18.521 --> 00:01:20.340
eventually get into a pod and short,

24
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.520
and they find themselves at this abandoned ship.

25
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.180
<v 1>[inaudible] totally abandoned second ghost ship.</v>

26
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.420
I never seen anything like that. I knew what happened. The,

27
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.820
it's empty except for these weird eggs in the astronauts for like looking at the

28
00:01:40.821 --> 00:01:42.430
eggs and touching the eggs and going,

29
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:44.743
<v 2>oh,</v>

30
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.220
<v 0>okay. Now fast forward. We're back into the first ship. Okay.</v>

31
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.230
Everything's fine for the most part,

32
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.200
and then something happens and I want you to,

33
00:01:56.201 --> 00:01:58.120
I've got the computer there in front of you. Okay.

34
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.720
We'll push this push to space bar space bar.

35
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.440
<v 1>All right, well you're at the table.</v>

36
00:02:05.441 --> 00:02:06.440
Everyone's dressed in white.

37
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.410
The first thing that I get to do when I get back is to get some decent food.

38
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.000
Indigo. I'm talking, chatting. They're all having like salad too. Yeah,

39
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.600
they're just eating. Talking. One of the guys gets a little weird, right? Oh,

40
00:02:19.601 --> 00:02:23.330
he's not feeling so good. One of the guys. Oh no, he's coughing.

41
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.580
Coughing. Oh, don't tell me trouble breathing.

42
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.720
He's falling back onto the table. Chest is heaving. His wrist. Oh my God,

43
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.150
he's kicking his head wildly and he's like flexing all over the table and

44
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.560
something. He's like, Oh,

45
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.220
oh God.

46
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.510
So there's a red thing. I read the horrible sneaky thing. This is of course,

47
00:02:56.511 --> 00:02:59.980
the classic scene from the original alien movie scene where

48
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.330
<v 3>the little thing bursts out of the guy's chest and like hisses why did,</v>

49
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.180
cause I think I figured out why that scene as scary. I mean,

50
00:03:08.181 --> 00:03:12.500
when I first saw this movie, that scene went over and over and over in my mind,

51
00:03:12.501 --> 00:03:15.980
and it's had this effect on a lot of people and I think I know why. What are,

52
00:03:15.981 --> 00:03:19.640
you know, it's not that the little creature is disgusting, which it is.

53
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.160
It's that it was there all along. Sitting there. Yeah,

54
00:03:25.161 --> 00:03:27.320
inside him, like incubating,

55
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.090
waiting to think that you sitting in that seat right there could have in your

56
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.020
gut these little worms that are wriggling around doing more or less what that

57
00:03:36.021 --> 00:03:38.210
alien was doing. And I can't even see them in, you

58
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.550
can't even talk about it. So it's not,

59
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.580
today's subject on radio lab will be flowers. Even meadows coming up after this

60
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.233
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

61
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.500
<v 3>no, we're not doing that. We're doing, we're doing that an hour on parasites.</v>

62
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.120
These little creatures that live inside us invisibly and yet can have a huge

63
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.320
influence over who we think we are. What is a parasite?

64
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:15.610
Precisely a moocher. And just to sort of slide us in, get us into the mood.

65
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.940
I'm already not in the mood. We thought we would get things started.

66
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.380
Maybe I'll just move this over here.

67
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.180
Well there really is no other way to start a show on parasites except with this

68
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:27.760
guy. You should introduce yourself. My name is Carl Zimmer.

69
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.470
Carl's a science writer and parasites have been on his radar ever since.

70
00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:33.460
He was a little boy.

71
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.700
I grew up on a little farm and my mother would raise tomatoes sometimes in her

72
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.400
pensionable garden and uh,

73
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.170
sometimes there would be these caterpillars feeding on them and my mom would be

74
00:04:44.171 --> 00:04:48.010
very annoyed and every now and then I would notice that some of them didn't look

75
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:52.120
very well and they had this little sort of fuzzy white bumps on them and I

76
00:04:52.121 --> 00:04:56.650
didn't really know what they were. Well, it turned out that they had been, um,

77
00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.470
attacked by a parasitic wasp,

78
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.080
which had laid its eggs inside of it.

79
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.780
Those eggs that hatched and had become larvae.

80
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.990
And those larvae were swimming around inside that Caterpillar while I was eating

81
00:05:07.991 --> 00:05:11.500
my mother's tomatoes. And they were growing,

82
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.090
growing inside the Caterpillar. And then finally when they were ready, they,

83
00:05:15.091 --> 00:05:17.800
they came out and only then did their host die.

84
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.880
And when he finally found out that that is what was happening inside those fuzzy

85
00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:24.040
white bumps, profound situation,

86
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:27.970
this whole universe of a baby's growing into adolescence,

87
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.400
that's when I guess I sort of got very hooked,

88
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.060
which is probably an understatement because you are sort of like capital p

89
00:05:34.061 --> 00:05:34.894
parasite man.

90
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.880
And if you look in the New York Times or science magazine or any of the places,

91
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.953
Carl writes,

92
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.490
a suspicious number of his articles are pretty flattering to parasites.

93
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.120
People have been dismissing parasites for a long time. Calling them degenerates.

94
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.970
No, I would argue that parasites are not degenerate.

95
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.760
They have gained the ability to live inside three, four, five,

96
00:05:55.761 --> 00:05:58.250
six different species. Should you find that you sort of,

97
00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:02.720
you're a lawyer for them. Hey Sir, you call this degenerate. How dare you, sir?

98
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:03.980
Say That I look,

99
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:08.210
I'm a defender of all on the collected and put upon species out there.

100
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.360
Why wouldn't a parasite the what?

101
00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:14.390
I think you mean when you say degenerate because the title thing,

102
00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.510
it infects something else. It sucks. Whatever. That it's not independent. Right?

103
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.050
So when you say it's not degenerate, what did y, what do you say that? Well,

104
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.490
let's start with saying it's not independent irony.

105
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.210
Any of us independent Kit Carson,

106
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.060
have you stripped all the bacteria out of Kit Carson?

107
00:06:30.061 --> 00:06:32.910
Kit Carson would get very sick. Daniel Boone on the other hand,

108
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.620
now there's a guy in the panel alone in the woods. Daniel Boone eat,

109
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.830
I guess Daniel boot eats pigeon like the rest of us. What's your point, Carl?

110
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.750
In right point is the Daniel Boone eats meat. He ate bread,

111
00:06:45.751 --> 00:06:48.210
which came from plants. Liz, the question of degrees though,

112
00:06:48.211 --> 00:06:51.820
we're not living inside the intestinal track with some other creature,

113
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.250
so why does living inside seem like it's a degenerate thing as opposed to us?

114
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.550
Yeah. We can't even synthesize a lot of our own vitamins anymore.

115
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.910
Where the degenerates in a lot of ways, no car, no car.

116
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.120
If you are a creature that lives off someone else's vitality cheaters,

117
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.340
she would be another way of putting it. But listen, can you appreciate it?

118
00:07:11.341 --> 00:07:14.400
I'm just gonna cut this short right here. Carl says, no, no, no.

119
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.670
There are amazing time and time again. He says, no, no, no.

120
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:20.520
The argument went on. Still waiting to hear about how you,

121
00:07:20.521 --> 00:07:24.690
how you are able to photosynthesize your tell you to do it for me,

122
00:07:24.691 --> 00:07:28.320
but I go about it in a mental way. You can't even do it yourself. Like I said,

123
00:07:28.321 --> 00:07:32.220
the argument went on and on with Robert saying one thing and Carl firing back

124
00:07:32.221 --> 00:07:35.700
and me adding another and here's what we're going to do just to be fair and

125
00:07:35.701 --> 00:07:38.670
square about this. We're going to bring in an independent moderator.

126
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:43.470
Lolo yourself. Yeah. Com you're going to be the monitor. Yeah.

127
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:46.470
You get them like right. You're going to be the moderator and uh,

128
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.560
you listening right now. We will leave it to you,

129
00:07:49.561 --> 00:07:54.210
your decision and this one lightning round. Go ahead. Shall I do that? Okay.

130
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.730
Yeah. [inaudible] parasites.

131
00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:01.800
Are they evil or are they awesome? Starting with number one,

132
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.140
that a parasitic wasp,

133
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:09.480
there are probably 200,000 species of parasitic wasps out there.

134
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.130
Big Wasp, small wasp.

135
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:14.200
They're generally pretty tiny and they go after all sorts of things.

136
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.950
Some will lay them in columns. Caterpillars.

137
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.970
Spiders are the one Carl's going to tell us about this.

138
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.660
This particular wasp is called [inaudible]. Compressor goes after a cockroach.

139
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:25.450
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

140
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:28.090
<v 3>and for those of you who never thought you'd feel sorry for a coffee,</v>

141
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:29.343
<v 4>great.</v>

142
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.920
<v 3>Keep listening. So what it does is it [inaudible]</v>

143
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.850
<v 5>flies around and it looks for a cockroach.</v>

144
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.490
And once it finds that [inaudible]

145
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.920
<v 3>approach shit land and then</v>

146
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.720
<v 5>the fight begins, they tumbled back and forth around,</v>

147
00:08:46.721 --> 00:08:51.580
around until finally the wasps somehow manages to arch its back around the body

148
00:08:51.581 --> 00:08:54.350
of the cockroach and uh, stings it

149
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.040
<v 3>right in the belly. The cockroach twitches for a second</v>

150
00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:06.050
and then false. The cockroach is paralyzed. Now the wasp takes its time.

151
00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:10.160
Repositions itself puts its button up right near the cockroaches head

152
00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.790
and delivers a second sting.

153
00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:18.730
The Stinger actually threads its way to a particular spot in the brain.

154
00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:20.620
And this does something odd.

155
00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:25.840
Moments later the cockroach recovers. Started, stands up. I can walk again,

156
00:09:25.841 --> 00:09:29.170
but something is wrong. Very wrong. It just stands there

157
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.500
<v 6>like a week. But the cat run away. Yeah.</v>

158
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.890
<v 3>Mu It has essentially lost its will. What does that mean? Uh, it's [inaudible].</v>

159
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.530
<v 5>Yes, it is a puppet. It's become a Zombie basically.</v>

160
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:50.170
And so now the wasp will literally grab onto the cockroaches antenna and start

161
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.290
pulling on it. How does it grab with, what does it grant?

162
00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.550
I believe with its mouth.

163
00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:01.060
Imagine tiny wasp guiding a cockroach across the desert floor like a dog on a

164
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:06.230
lead and so it leads it down,

165
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:11.380
down, down, down into a little borough it's made and the cockroach says,

166
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.410
okay, whenever you want to go. Then

167
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.880
<v 3>once the wasp has the Roach in the borough,</v>

168
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.600
it lays its eggs on the underside of the cockroach to now you've got this

169
00:10:21.601 --> 00:10:26.130
drugged roach sitting on top of some wasp bags and then the wasp goes out and it

170
00:10:26.131 --> 00:10:31.020
seals the borough. It berries the cockroach alive. Well,

171
00:10:31.021 --> 00:10:33.600
it's two minutes shell. It's in a little chamber.

172
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.200
It doesn't want to kill the cockroach because this cockroach is going to feed

173
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:41.190
its, you know it's young. Yeah, so then the eggs hatch

174
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:46.650
and then they drill inside the cockroach. You're still just sitting there.

175
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:51.230
How's it staying alive at this point? What parasites are very careful, you know,

176
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.020
they won't eat vital organs that will kill it. Instead,

177
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.120
Carl says they just feast on the extra stuff.

178
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.760
There's a lot of stuff inside of a cockroach,

179
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:04.230
a lot of fluid just floating around. It's of Wonderbread essence of skin,

180
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:08.160
old hair, and you can just feed on any, the host stays alive. Wow.

181
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:09.203
And then what happens?

182
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:14.210
Eventually the little baby wasp larva grows up inside the cockroach and develops

183
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.490
into an adult. And then one day the watch

184
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.360
eats its way up a little hole out of the,

185
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:26.400
out of the cockroaches body shakes off its wings and flies off,

186
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:32.160
and then the roach dies. Then the roach dies. Why? Normally then? Yeah.

187
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:35.700
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

188
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:40.700
<v 3>that to me sounds like of the purest description in nature of evil that I can</v>

189
00:11:41.341 --> 00:11:43.800
imagine. Wouldn't you agree? Well,

190
00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:48.801
Darwin certainly said that God should not be personally blamed for having

191
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:51.300
created parasitic wasps.

192
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.520
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

193
00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.550
<v 3>but if you ask Carl, he'll have you think about that moment,</v>

194
00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.470
the moment where the wasp stings,

195
00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:06.580
that brain parasitic wasp can attack a cockroach and inserted Stinger into one

196
00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:11.601
specific part of the cockroaches brain and inject a precise little cocktail of

197
00:12:11.701 --> 00:12:16.680
drugs that then turns the cockroach into its slave.

198
00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.270
I know that that was,

199
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:23.330
didn't get a phd in neurobiology and yet it has performed a kind of brain

200
00:12:23.761 --> 00:12:27.750
surgery very precisely in a very elegant way. Uh,

201
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.230
or evil might be the other way. Okay, let's go. Go ahead.

202
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.690
But there is a complexity there that you can't deny

203
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.633
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

204
00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:37.573
<v 7>or can you,</v>

205
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:42.990
<v 3>we leave it to you bringing us to example number two,</v>

206
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:46.980
parasitic name to food. I mean, here's,

207
00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:50.970
here's a another example that I actually was looking at today because you're

208
00:12:50.971 --> 00:12:55.971
holding your computer up to the glass and on the screen is a big black and it

209
00:12:55.981 --> 00:12:58.330
looks like it's carrying a cherry, right?

210
00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:01.080
A Cherry that's about twice the size of the ant.

211
00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:06.140
That Red Cherry is actually parasites inside of the aunt making it look like a

212
00:13:06.481 --> 00:13:10.140
red cherry. What part of the aunt is that? Is that it's, but essentially, yeah.

213
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.120
Wait a second. Is it,

214
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:15.720
it looks like it's sticking its big red button up into the air. Yeah.

215
00:13:15.721 --> 00:13:18.660
Their behavior is changed or they waggle around their, their,

216
00:13:18.661 --> 00:13:20.160
their tail as it were. Nope.

217
00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:24.510
Why on earth would a parasite turn on ants but red and then make it stick.

218
00:13:24.511 --> 00:13:27.450
It's bought up into the air. Well,

219
00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:29.940
let's say you put an ant down,

220
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:34.020
it has this bright red from your end and an ordinary and in front of a bird,

221
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.850
birds can go for that red and very quickly because it thinks it's a berry. Yeah.

222
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.630
And then what?

223
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:44.400
It's going to swallow this little package full of nematode eggs.

224
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.120
So that's the way the nematode eggs get into the sky.

225
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:52.570
They buy their airplane tickets by advertising themselves as berries. Yes.

226
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:54.610
What's the benefit of being in the air? Well, the,

227
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:59.340
the only place that this parasite can, uh, reproduce is inside the bird.

228
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:04.110
And how better to spread your seed far and wide than to drop from the sky

229
00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:09.760
<v 7>with the birch droppings. That is brilliant. That's brilliant.</v>

230
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:13.840
I mean, look at the, that it's red. It's up in the air.

231
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:15.300
<v 3>Yeah, it's amazing.</v>

232
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:20.540
It's like how can a stupid little thing be so brilliant because they're not

233
00:14:21.241 --> 00:14:26.160
degenerates, but they're still cheating.

234
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:30.150
And then just to bring this point home, just to pick a common one,

235
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.930
Carl offered up his third and final example. Number three,

236
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:35.430
blood flukes.

237
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:39.870
Blood flukes are related to flatworms tapeworms.

238
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.080
So their eggs start out in the water,

239
00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:48.820
fresh water in Africa, Asia, parts of South America.

240
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:49.750
And the first part of their life,

241
00:14:49.751 --> 00:14:53.180
they go into a snail and they come back out into the water and they're swimming

242
00:14:53.181 --> 00:14:57.110
around and they start looking for a human.

243
00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.860
So imagine a foot going into the shallow end of the pot.

244
00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:04.670
I see toes, I see bottom of foot, I see ankle. Well,

245
00:15:04.671 --> 00:15:08.290
if you're a blood fluke, you don't see anything. You don't advise. Oh sorry.

246
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:12.350
But eventually you find a foot, secrete a little enzyme,

247
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:16.930
basically turn a little bit of skin into butter. Wow.

248
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.430
And you slip into the vein and now

249
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.880
<v 5>you're going to swim my circulatory system. Sure.</v>

250
00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.420
Which ones you're going to ride along in the blood.

251
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:33.410
And now it's time to find a mate, a mate.

252
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.110
So there's sex. So there's a male and female. So what you're saying? Sure.

253
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:39.080
They're animals. They're animals. I would have never called them animals.

254
00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.930
It's interesting you say that. That's a whole nother topic I guess so.

255
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.090
All right, so we'll, the female is very thin,

256
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:47.210
each service standard issue where I'm kind of thing,

257
00:15:47.211 --> 00:15:50.720
but the male is very strange. It's, it's Kinda like, like a canoe.

258
00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.320
It's gotta be trough down the middle. Uh,

259
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.670
and at one end it's got a giant sucker.

260
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:58.640
Should we urge some of our listeners to tune away at this point because,

261
00:15:58.641 --> 00:16:02.720
but it's about to happen. May Not be acceptable. And family, our, um,

262
00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:07.740
actually blood flukes are, are fairly, uh, monogamous and loyal. So you know,

263
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:11.990
if you're looking for or for animals to reinforce your family values,

264
00:16:11.991 --> 00:16:13.910
blood flukes pretty good.

265
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:19.040
And eventually two blood flukes find their way toward each other and the male

266
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:23.240
does this sort of court ship or whatever reason the female says, yes,

267
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:27.480
I accept your courtship. The female joins the male,

268
00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.020
so fits in the trough. Oh, so it's like a groove.

269
00:16:30.021 --> 00:16:33.500
The female goes and occupies the groove right now this isn't just,

270
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.560
this isn't mating. This is way beyond meeting.

271
00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.010
The males will feed the female for starters.

272
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:45.230
And they will stay this way for a long, long time. Really? Yeah.

273
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:49.430
Like days, years, years, years. Yeah. Oh my God.

274
00:16:49.431 --> 00:16:54.080
Years in human time. A years to them. Just years, years, years. Years. Years.

275
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:56.990
Like the earth going around the sun kind of years. Yes. In fact,

276
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:59.120
there've been cases where people show up at their, yeah,

277
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:03.180
the doctors feeling awful. The doctor does some tests and says, oh,

278
00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:06.180
you've got blood flukes. No.

279
00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.640
You had to have been in Africa to get this disease.

280
00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:13.170
When have you been in Africa? And the person said 40 years ago,

281
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:18.690
44 zero 40 years ago. Yeah. And,

282
00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:22.980
and the reason that they're getting sick is that these male and female blood

283
00:17:22.981 --> 00:17:25.920
flukes are still together making eggs.

284
00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:31.170
And Carl's literally glowing when he says this. I have to admit,

285
00:17:31.171 --> 00:17:33.640
I do love the thought that, um,

286
00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.830
parasites are among the most monogamous animals on the planet.

287
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:42.420
It's heaven. I mean, you're going to spend the rest of your life together.

288
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:49.310
And so our story concludes the image of two blood flukes in

289
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.920
<v 3>your veins for nearly half a century.</v>

290
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.710
Got handed to him. He's good, Carl, you mean? Yeah, yeah.

291
00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:10.080
And there is a species of take farmers can be named after me. No kidding. Marie.

292
00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.780
Yeah. Wow. It's not quite as much of an honors do you think?

293
00:18:13.781 --> 00:18:18.781
At first I was talking with the Paris fetologist and she was telling her fellow

294
00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:22.240
expert about how she was gonna name one for me and then they got into a

295
00:18:22.241 --> 00:18:23.710
conversation about, you know,

296
00:18:23.711 --> 00:18:26.800
that was good that you named that particular tape parm for him because he's

297
00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.070
Kinda thin and it's kind of a thin day for him. You know, my aunt is, she's,

298
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:33.610
she's a little round and it's a kind of a round table and I named her after and

299
00:18:33.611 --> 00:18:36.400
you suddenly discover there are a lot of tape wants to be named.

300
00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:41.290
How many is a lot? I mean tens of thousands of species of tapeworms. Wow.

301
00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.480
So they got us beat many times over.

302
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:47.860
I once a estimates that if you took all the viruses in the ocean and you stuck

303
00:18:47.861 --> 00:18:51.490
them into to end, how far would it go? And, um,

304
00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:55.840
it was many light years, way beyond our galactic neighborhood.

305
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:58.780
In other words there more cheats than there are honest people.

306
00:18:58.781 --> 00:19:00.400
Honest creatures on earth. Oh yeah.

<v 0>Hello, I'm Janna Boomerang and I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab. Our topic today,</v>

335
00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:13.750
parasite parasites.

336
00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:17.440
Now we've met them there are nice and we've met them when they're not so nice.

337
00:21:17.441 --> 00:21:20.410
I don't know that we've met any nice ones. Really are we having, I thought,

338
00:21:20.411 --> 00:21:24.910
I thought that was pretty nice. Yeah, they were nice. So,

339
00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:27.850
but now the question is, let's just talk about the scale. I mean,

340
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:32.170
for the most part they're irritating and Ludo and they seemed kind of invisible

341
00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.270
and visible in sort of off stage. Yeah.

342
00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:37.900
But when you back off a little bit and consider them, you know,

343
00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:40.090
in the effects that they have on the world,

344
00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:44.920
there are actually these powerful sculptors of monumental narrative.

345
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:48.790
In other words, these are little guys telling very big stories.

346
00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:50.680
In fact, here's an example.

347
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:54.070
Recently I went to visit a guy named Dickson Despommier,

348
00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:59.300
but Columbia University, he's eight. There's Telegist and well,

349
00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:04.510
there's a bunch of different things and we ended up talking about, um, you know,

350
00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:07.660
he told me this crazy story. The story I love telling the most. Oh,

351
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.370
and before we start, I just want to say one thing.

352
00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:13.870
The following two stories contain moments that are a little bit gross.

353
00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:15.370
Just want to make sure you've been warned.

354
00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.580
The story I love telling the most is how we eradicated hookworm.

355
00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.560
The story begins in 1908 John D Rockefeller,

356
00:22:23.561 --> 00:22:27.610
Sr really rich guy's sitting in his New York office and he's thinking,

357
00:22:27.611 --> 00:22:31.620
how can I make more money selling something to the south? Yeah,

358
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:33.880
I've got all this money. We've got all these resources.

359
00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.190
I just need a new market. In terms of new markets.

360
00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.530
The South was pretty much untapped

361
00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.960
<v 10>if only those damn southerners just get off their butts and get going.</v>

362
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:46.560
Problem was they weren't, they weren't getting off their butts.

363
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:50.940
The forms were not operational. The economic engine was turned off.

364
00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:54.870
The economy was in the toilet. And so John D Rockefeller wanted to know why,

365
00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:58.770
why aren't they producing more? Yep. What's happened to their economic engine?

366
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.760
So he thought, I know all form of commission. Yeah.

367
00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:05.460
So will you send out a bunch of economists and sociologists and people like that

368
00:23:05.461 --> 00:23:09.030
on the original Rockefeller Commission? They did.

369
00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:14.280
Every single commission could possibly do to try to find out why these southern

370
00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:18.480
gentlemen were not rising to the occasion and they came back with the following

371
00:23:18.481 --> 00:23:21.870
conclusion. Well, we, we don't exactly know what's wrong,

372
00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.230
but we think that these people are sick from something cause they don't,

373
00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:29.700
they don't behave like we do. What does that mean? They are slow?

374
00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:35.130
Not Mentally. They're slow. Physically. They're Pale. I'll give you an example.

375
00:23:35.131 --> 00:23:38.340
You remember the movie deliverance? Sure. Okay.

376
00:23:38.341 --> 00:23:40.170
Remember that little guy that played the Banjo?

377
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.510
I remember the other scene that we all know,

378
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:45.950
we're not gonna talk about that and we're doing it. No, we're not.

379
00:23:45.951 --> 00:23:46.761
But if I got mind you,

380
00:23:46.761 --> 00:23:49.670
if you can recall what that little badge old player looked like,

381
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.950
<v 5>Ooh, why are we looking guy? But he looked old sickly pants, sickly Pale,</v>

382
00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.060
and yet an adult. Well, Lena said wizard wasn't,

383
00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:01.140
that is not a description of all southerners. No description.

384
00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:03.070
One teeny corner in that. No.

385
00:24:03.071 --> 00:24:06.070
But with the commission did say about a lot of these southern people they

386
00:24:06.071 --> 00:24:09.370
encountered is that a lot of them may just don't look right.

387
00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:14.110
They look weakly look when they look kind of [inaudible] one why they would want

388
00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:18.050
hale lethargic. It's interesting [inaudible] or one one future.

389
00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.160
So the thought was that maybe these southerners had some kind of laziness

390
00:24:21.161 --> 00:24:23.860
disease. This is really what a lot of folks thought.

391
00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:26.380
The one member on the committee suggested a Rockefeller like, you know what?

392
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:27.303
Perhaps

393
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:32.780
<v 10>these people are anemic, anemic. They're, they're anemic to your say, yeah,</v>

394
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:35.750
they're anemic. Sounds like a medical problem.

395
00:24:35.751 --> 00:24:37.910
Then maybe they're not lazy after all.

396
00:24:37.911 --> 00:24:40.610
Maybe they're anemic and maybe they're just weak. Next thing you know,

397
00:24:40.611 --> 00:24:43.520
Rockefeller puts together another commission, this one with doctors,

398
00:24:43.521 --> 00:24:47.030
and he sends them back down to the south to find out what the basis for the

399
00:24:47.031 --> 00:24:49.970
anemia was. And not only did they find anemia,

400
00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:54.650
but they found a correlation of the anemia was soil types. That's bizarre.

401
00:24:55.550 --> 00:25:00.110
Sandy Loam, soils, anemia, hardpack clay soils. Hmm.

402
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:04.670
No anemia. Sandy loamy soils, good farmland, hardpack clay soils,

403
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:05.780
not such good farmland.

404
00:25:05.781 --> 00:25:10.280
So all the rich farmers were anemic and all the poor farmers were doing okay.

405
00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:11.330
And this seemed to be a clue.

406
00:25:11.331 --> 00:25:15.200
The incidence of anemia was linked somehow to the soil.

407
00:25:15.201 --> 00:25:20.180
Maybe bump a bum. Yeah, something was in the soil. That's correct.

408
00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:23.650
So somehow they hit upon this idea of looking for Hook

409
00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:26.440
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

410
00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:27.273
<v 5>the hook one</v>

411
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.930
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

412
00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:35.160
<v 10>this is that. All right, let's run some tests. And when they did, big time,</v>

413
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:36.870
they discovered hookworm big time.

414
00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:39.510
<v 2>Okay.</v>

415
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:40.890
<v 5>So the anemia is due to hook.</v>

416
00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:43.500
<v 0>Now the question became,</v>

417
00:25:43.501 --> 00:25:47.430
how are these southerners getting the hookworm and giving it to one another and

418
00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:50.160
a pretty good place to start to look for an answer.

419
00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:55.260
Was there a feces because of these hookworms are in you.

420
00:25:55.261 --> 00:25:56.820
They're going to come out at you when you go to the bathroom.

421
00:25:56.821 --> 00:25:59.370
So they asked these southerners, when you guys [inaudible],

422
00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:03.220
<v 10>where do you do it? Most of them said something like this, right?</v>

423
00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.440
I came over there. You see a tree over there? That's right, deprecate.

424
00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:10.130
So I deprecate it over there, but I live over here. Okay,

425
00:26:10.131 --> 00:26:11.780
so then the investigators ask the next question,

426
00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:15.890
when you go to that tree and do it, do you, do you wear any shoes?

427
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:20.240
Most of them said no barefoot, just like everybody else. He goes,

428
00:26:20.241 --> 00:26:21.074
it's comfortable.

429
00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.670
<v 0>So clearly these worms are in the feces that are landing near the tree that are</v>

430
00:26:26.671 --> 00:26:29.790
somehow getting into people's feet the next time they come to use the tree.

431
00:26:29.791 --> 00:26:34.140
But no one intentionally steps in their own, you know,

432
00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:37.140
no one does that, which meant,

433
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:39.600
<v 10>oh my goodness, oh my goodness, it can crawl,</v>

434
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:44.670
right? So let's find out how far it can crawl.

435
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:48.780
So what they did these researchers is they built a sandbox and then they took

436
00:26:48.781 --> 00:26:51.450
some hookworm infested stool and put it right in the middle.

437
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:57.200
Then every day we'll sample from the stool sample out in the sand in all

438
00:26:57.511 --> 00:27:00.390
directions and find larvae and find out how far they can travel.

439
00:27:00.391 --> 00:27:01.224
How's that sound?

440
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:05.970
So now we have larvae in the stool and they begin to crawl away from the stool

441
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:09.150
seeking a victim. On Day one,

442
00:27:09.151 --> 00:27:14.130
they crawled an entire foot in all directions, but they weren't a two feet.

443
00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:18.630
On Day two, my God, they're at two feet.

444
00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:23.890
At Day three they're in three feet. I can't believe it.

445
00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:28.650
They're crawling all day four they crawl to four feet.

446
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:34.170
What about day five? No, I am allowed to ask that. And what about day five?

447
00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:39.570
Five feet? No, no. Four feet.

448
00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.670
That's it. So after four feet there,

449
00:27:41.671 --> 00:27:46.671
what exhausted one would assume on day six there were still at four feet.

450
00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.560
And on day seven they were dead.

451
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:50.663
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

452
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:55.410
[inaudible]

453
00:27:55.410 --> 00:28:00.410
<v 10>so how in the world could you deal with this problem when these worms can crawl,</v>

454
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.930
they can crawl four feet. It doesn't matter where your difficult,

455
00:28:03.931 --> 00:28:05.040
they're going to crawl away from that.

456
00:28:05.041 --> 00:28:08.820
And within a four foot radius of that stool sample, you're going to get hookworm

457
00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.890
unless you do something radical that's never been done before.

458
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:19.640
They devised a scheme for burying the stool sample into the ground six feet deep

459
00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:27.580
<v 0>because the worms can only make it four feet.</v>

460
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.850
Well then that's two feet past the point where they die. We call that the owl.

461
00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:41.580
<v 10>So the outhouse was invented by exploring the life cycle of hookworm and in</v>

462
00:28:42.671 --> 00:28:47.140
fact, Rockefeller got his wish the south did rise again.

463
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:50.900
<v 0>That sounds too easy to me though. You're telling me that that uh,</v>

464
00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:54.530
an understanding of Hookworm, which created the outhouse, removed the quote,

465
00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:58.110
southern laziness disease and they did rise with the, and you,

466
00:28:58.111 --> 00:29:00.980
you bring that all back to the hookworm. I do. Really, I,

467
00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:03.350
I'd bring it back to sanitation now to be fair,

468
00:29:03.351 --> 00:29:05.900
you can find plenty of other reasons why the south rose again,

469
00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:09.470
air conditioning and highways and university, right, and stuff like that.

470
00:29:09.471 --> 00:29:10.490
So the oak room had some help.

471
00:29:10.491 --> 00:29:14.600
But what is clear is that when we as a country began to distance ourselves from

472
00:29:14.601 --> 00:29:19.430
our own excrement, to put it bluntly, when we stop walking around in our own,

473
00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:22.600
there were all of these unintended concepts.

474
00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:27.240
<v 11>Salmonella disappeared is the Lyrica disappeared, Shigella disappeared,</v>

475
00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.090
cholera disappeared. GRD had disappeared.

476
00:29:30.091 --> 00:29:35.091
Cryptosporidium anything that's associated with parasites in feces disappeared.

477
00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:40.620
Every time we built out houses and people use them religiously,

478
00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:41.980
guess what?

479
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:46.030
<v 0>Their kids can stay in school. They could learn more. They got ahead faster.</v>

480
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:09.290
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

481
00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:09.440
<v 0>Dixon,</v>

482
00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:14.000
this momma is a professor of public health and Environmental Health Sciences and

483
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.410
Microbiology at Columbia University.

484
00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:19.730
Can they make longer titles at that university? He literally wrote [inaudible]

485
00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:23.020
<v 12>the book on parasites. The book is called Parasitic Diseases.</v>

486
00:30:23.021 --> 00:30:26.660
You know it very well and seemed to be a major motion picture. You know,

487
00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:28.690
it's fourth edition in its fourth edition.

488
00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:33.010
And while we're on the subject of hookworms and the glorious campaign to Deworm

489
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:33.700
America,

490
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:38.700
because this has been a very carefully crafted and intentionally fair program,

491
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.850
you have heard the case against hookworms.

492
00:30:42.851 --> 00:30:46.940
Now let's turn the coin and say something nice about hookworms.

493
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.220
And to begin that discussion, let's go to our reporter Patrick Walters. Okay.

494
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:53.710
So Pat, are you there? Are you there? Yeah, I'm here. Robert.

495
00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:56.800
So tell us a little bit about this fellow. What's his name exactly?

496
00:30:57.310 --> 00:31:01.630
His name is Jasper Lawrence, right? Jasper Lawrence. So where's he from?

497
00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:05.290
He actually grew up in England and he grew up in this little farm in the

498
00:31:05.291 --> 00:31:07.900
southwest corner of England. And it's important to know,

499
00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:12.190
I think before hearing any part of his story that Jasper has had allergies for

500
00:31:12.191 --> 00:31:13.090
pretty much his whole life

501
00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.310
<v 13>on really bad days.</v>

502
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:19.430
My eyes would swell up so much from Poland or airborne allergens that they would

503
00:31:19.561 --> 00:31:24.270
feel like there was swelling shut. I could feel my eyes squeaking in my sockets.

504
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.970
It was an enormously uncomfortable feeling, but it was nothing debilitating.

505
00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:31.970
They were just allergies. And so, you know, he's just like,

506
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:34.560
like most other people have allergies. Just learn to deal with it, you know,

507
00:31:34.561 --> 00:31:35.340
you live with it.

508
00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:39.600
But what changed for me in my late twenties early thirties was my asthma.

509
00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:44.280
And in that time I was living in Santa Cruz. I was relatively recently married.

510
00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:48.870
We had three cats that had been grandfathered in with the relationship.

511
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.520
And I started a landscaping business. I really didn't want to work for this.

512
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:56.160
<v 12>I think someone with allergies starting a landscaping business that seems kind</v>

513
00:31:56.161 --> 00:31:59.970
of unexpected, unexpected stupid is actually the word for it.

514
00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:04.880
<v 13>And uh, within six months or a year,</v>

515
00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:08.900
he starts to notice this really weird barking cough.

516
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:11.780
Was there anything particular that brought this on? Like, no,

517
00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:17.080
it was just sitting and breathing. Um, cat certainly didn't help. Right. And uh,

518
00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:22.010
during that period my asthma got much worse very, very quickly.

519
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:24.950
By the time it was 1996, 1997,

520
00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:30.170
I was seeing specialists having skin allergen tests and cycling through

521
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:31.460
emergency inhalers,

522
00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:34.220
trying Singulair and all these other drugs that were coming on the market.

523
00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:38.020
I was being hospitalized, um, at least a couple of times a year. I mean, I,

524
00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:41.690
I looked terrible, had dark eyes and Pale, waxy skin.

525
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:46.160
I had that allergic look. It was a really bad time.

526
00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:51.250
<v 12>And he decides in that summer of 2004 to take a vacation,</v>

527
00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:53.320
he made this visit to England. Yeah.

528
00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:58.540
<v 13>I took my two daughters back to see my aunt who had raised me very early in the</v>

529
00:32:58.791 --> 00:33:03.620
visit. I was sitting at her kitchen table and she asked me if I'd seen a BBC

530
00:33:03.621 --> 00:33:08.300
documentary about parasites in their connection with things like asthma and

531
00:33:08.301 --> 00:33:10.760
allergies and multiple sclerosis, and of course I hadn't,

532
00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:12.710
but I went upstairs and got on the Internet

533
00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.560
after lunch and I stayed on the Internet until perhaps two in the morning.

534
00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.660
<v 14>I did.</v>

535
00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:26.420
I was reading and reading and the work of all these researchers have been steady

536
00:33:26.421 --> 00:33:30.680
after the neck in Japan and epidemiological studies and African animal models of

537
00:33:30.681 --> 00:33:32.750
multiple sclerosis. This enormous weight

538
00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:38.030
of evidence that in the developing world,

539
00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:41.960
people don't really have asthma or allergies.

540
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:46.010
And what he discovers is that behind all of this,

541
00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:49.010
to his shock is

542
00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:53.870
<v 12>hookworms hookworm. Yeah. Hookworms yeah.</v>

543
00:33:53.871 --> 00:33:58.871
I learned that asthma was 50% less likely in someone who had a hookworm

544
00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:02.030
infections. So this sort of just like hits you. Oh yeah.

545
00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:04.340
What'd you think when you, when you read that?

546
00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:09.650
<v 13>Oh, immediately was determined to obtain hookworm immediately. I couldn't wait.</v>

547
00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:15.230
<v 12>So hookworms are these very tiny worms,</v>

548
00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:16.700
the size of a little hair.

549
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:21.020
But if you take a microscope and you zoom way in,

550
00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:25.360
they have this big circular mouth brimming full of pointy teeth.

551
00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.410
Very scary to look at.

552
00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:32.380
They have these toothy mouths so that they can burrow up through your feet,

553
00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:33.671
Grad through your blood,

554
00:34:33.671 --> 00:34:38.560
and eventually end up down in your gut and start chewing on the inside of your

555
00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:43.910
intestine. This guy wants hookworms in his intestines. Absolutely.

556
00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:46.880
And so you, you just Google it. Yeah. Hook Hook Worms

557
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:51.290
<v 13>for sale. I mean, you know, someone's got to be selling them, but not nothing.</v>

558
00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:55.550
I contacted every laboratory supply company in the world and Paris etology

559
00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:58.370
research centers and they all said the same thing.

560
00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:00.860
No various flavors of no.

561
00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:04.580
And so I came to the conclusion that I was going to have to go to the tropics.

562
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:09.420
<v 12>So fast forward a little jasper is in Cameroon along the coast,</v>

563
00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:11.460
quite literally and figuratively.

564
00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:16.380
The armpit of Africa is 200 miles north of the equator. It's extremely hot.

565
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:21.660
He finds a guy to drive him around and so he and his driver would go to a

566
00:35:21.661 --> 00:35:23.130
village. You'd get out of the car,

567
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:28.190
walk up to these villagers and ask them if they could see the latrine.

568
00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:30.400
<v 13>Just an open area of ground,</v>

569
00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:34.840
usually with bushes so people can have a little bit of privacy and I would go

570
00:35:34.841 --> 00:35:39.300
over to the area, remove my shoes and start walking.

571
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:44.100
The first time I did that, I uh, I almost couldn't do it.

572
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:49.680
It was, it must've been 110 degrees that day. 100% humidity

573
00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:55.880
and the stench and the noise from the insects,

574
00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:01.880
it was so repulsive and so disgusting.

575
00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:13.820
<v 12>How many villages of the trains do you think you've visited? Between 30 and 40.</v>

576
00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:20.480
Jasper spent two weeks there walking around in the village,

577
00:36:20.481 --> 00:36:23.570
latrines and then he flew home.

578
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:26.610
<v 13>Yeah, I got back from Africa in early February.</v>

579
00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:32.180
So I was looking at allergy season coming up and the day I realized that I no

580
00:36:32.401 --> 00:36:35.490
longer had allergies. I was such a good day.

581
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:40.910
I got into my car and I started driving and I had the window down and I felt the

582
00:36:41.971 --> 00:36:44.340
breeze blowing across my face in the past.

583
00:36:44.341 --> 00:36:48.510
What that meant was that very quickly my eyes would be itching uncontrollably,

584
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:53.430
snot and phlegm was going to be pouring out of every orifice in my face and it

585
00:36:53.431 --> 00:36:54.264
didn't happen.

586
00:36:56.030 --> 00:37:00.920
<v 14>It didn't happen. I just started screaming in the car.</v>

587
00:37:00.921 --> 00:37:02.960
I was so, so happy

588
00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:11.990
and I haven't had an asthma attack since I went to Africa.

589
00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:16.280
I no longer have allergies.

590
00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:26.480
<v 13>The vast majority of the benefits that I've experienced has come from hookworm.</v>

591
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.840
Yep.

592
00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.960
<v 12>What, what is the hookworm doing, do you know? Well,</v>

593
00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:33.160
so the immune system that we learned about in elementary school is all about

594
00:37:33.161 --> 00:37:38.070
like these attacks, cells that go after foreign invaders and destroy them.

595
00:37:38.071 --> 00:37:40.470
Right. And that's a big important part of the immune system.

596
00:37:40.471 --> 00:37:44.770
But if the immune system were allowed to attack and destroy things unchecked,

597
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:45.783
it could kill you.

598
00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:49.210
And there are lots of diseases where the primary symptoms are caused by the

599
00:37:49.211 --> 00:37:52.330
immune system attacking the body that it's really designed to protect.

600
00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.410
Allergies and asthma are just two of these.

601
00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:59.210
Some of the more serious ones are like type one diabetes, multiple sclerosis,

602
00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:02.960
Crohn's disease in which the immune system actually starts attacking the inside

603
00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:06.710
of the intestines. They're like 80 FDA's disease, 80 of them.

604
00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:11.740
And so what scientists have found in lots and lots of mouse studies and in some

605
00:38:11.781 --> 00:38:13.310
human studies to this point too,

606
00:38:13.311 --> 00:38:18.140
is that once the hookworms get inside the gut and the immune system actually

607
00:38:18.141 --> 00:38:19.100
starts attacking,

608
00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:23.450
somehow hookworms actually stimulate these cells,

609
00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:27.050
which just quiet things down

610
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:32.630
and tell the attack cells to stop attacking.

611
00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:39.970
So these are like lullaby sells Zackly what lots and lots of scientists think

612
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:41.830
Joel Weinstock,

613
00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:46.860
Tufts Medical Center and dozens of others is that over thousands and thousands

614
00:38:46.871 --> 00:38:51.871
of years hookworms almost developed in tandem with the human immune system

615
00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:56.620
co-evolution parasites living within your body, your immune system changes.

616
00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:00.500
You've got to a point where the hookworms could survive safely.

617
00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:01.930
Worm gets a home,

618
00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:06.880
there's food coming down the food pipe and in return the human immune system

619
00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:12.220
gain some kind of some form of positive regulatory advantage.

620
00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:15.570
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

621
00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:20.570
<v 12>so that if you had this glitch where your immune systems started attacking your</v>

622
00:39:21.211 --> 00:39:26.130
own body, the presence of the hookworms would keep things controlled.

623
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:30.180
That's the gift. You do something for the worm. The worm does something for you.

624
00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:32.790
So then by that logic,

625
00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:36.750
what we in the West and the richer countries have done stupidly is we have

626
00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:40.850
cleaned ourselves up too much and we don't have enough worm EEZ in us. Yeah.

627
00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:43.440
This is called, they call it the hygiene hypothesis,

628
00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:47.250
the hygiene IPOs that we are not dirty enough to clean.

629
00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:52.320
<v 13>We function like rainforests where ecosystems and we've entirely eliminated a</v>

630
00:39:52.741 --> 00:39:57.630
class of organism that co-evolved with us and or genetic predecessors for

631
00:39:57.631 --> 00:39:58.470
millions of years.

632
00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:03.260
<v 12>Now, I don't want to leave the impression that hygiene is bad for you.</v>

633
00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:05.540
People can't go back to living in filth,

634
00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:09.800
kids playing and sewage by the river bank. But in improving our hygiene,

635
00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:14.630
we are also excluding organisms that may be important for making a swell.

636
00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:16.810
<v 13>So then what does Jasper do about all this?</v>

637
00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:20.530
He decides to start a business selling hookworm to people.

638
00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:25.590
What you can call him up and he will literally FedEx a dose of hookworms to your

639
00:40:26.411 --> 00:40:29.110
door. How side? Raking for a second, Pat.

640
00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:32.320
I Jad where does he get the hook and from, this is weird.

641
00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:36.310
Jasper gets the hookworm from himself.

642
00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:41.340
Could you describe how you go about getting hookworm from,

643
00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:47.650
uh, your stool into, uh, one of your patients?

644
00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:51.310
Well, that's um, very easy organism to work with it, it just,

645
00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:55.210
it gets up when it walks out of it so it doesn't take an enormous amount of work

646
00:40:55.211 --> 00:40:58.210
to separate it from the feces. And then I haven't done that.

647
00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:02.200
I repeatedly wash them in solutions of antibiotics to make sure that,

648
00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:06.040
and I think that could live on them is killed. People contact us,

649
00:41:06.041 --> 00:41:08.950
we'll have them complete a questionnaire, submit a recent blood test,

650
00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.340
then we'll ship them a dose and all the materials and equipment and the

651
00:41:12.341 --> 00:41:14.140
instructions necessary to inflict themselves.

652
00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.840
Twitches does this the safe thing to do? Jasper?

653
00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:20.620
Jasper has done tons and tons of research, but he's not a doctor.

654
00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:23.770
The treatment is not approved by the FDA in general.

655
00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:28.300
I wonder is there any serious sort of double blind study trying to figure out

656
00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:32.350
whether some safe delivery of hookworm might make sense? Yes.

657
00:41:32.351 --> 00:41:34.250
And so one of the guys who

658
00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:39.410
<v 12>was sort of a pioneer in this hookworm room research is David Pritchard.</v>

659
00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:42.470
I'm professor David [inaudible] ologist in Paris,

660
00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:47.150
otologist of the University of Nottingham where I study parasites and the wound

661
00:41:47.151 --> 00:41:48.500
healing properties of maggots.

662
00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:51.350
So we've now got two safety trials and drive belts,

663
00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:56.590
but we've yet to conduct the trials to show that therapeutic benefit results

664
00:41:56.961 --> 00:41:58.010
from infection with words.

665
00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:01.700
So Prichard infected himself pretty much just to make sure that it was safe.

666
00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:06.290
What we did was 10 of us in the lab took worms at different doses.

667
00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:11.270
We were either given 10 25 50 or a hundred worms and then we had to report on

668
00:42:11.271 --> 00:42:13.340
the symptoms along the back of that study,

669
00:42:13.341 --> 00:42:17.890
we determined the 10 wounds were tolerated. But Richard,

670
00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:22.840
when he did this proof of safety study actually gave himself 50 hookworms. Oh.

671
00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:27.460
Which put him out of commission for Awhile. I felt pretty bad.

672
00:42:27.461 --> 00:42:28.930
I mean pain in the gut really,

673
00:42:28.931 --> 00:42:31.720
you know you can feel them cause they are biting on your tissues.

674
00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:36.070
I mean if you have too many hookworms they can cause things like diarrhea and

675
00:42:36.071 --> 00:42:39.940
the most serious side effects and the side effect that makes them a sort of a

676
00:42:39.941 --> 00:42:42.940
public health enemy is that they can give you an emia.

677
00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:45.750
So if you have too many years

678
00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:49.390
<v 13>you lose quite a bit of blood to these parasites. Well you know,</v>

679
00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:52.030
if you take too many hookworm which are not going to, if you come to us,

680
00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:54.070
the worst thing you're going to get is anemia.

681
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:56.500
But it's not like you wake up one morning and you're drained to blow,

682
00:42:57.550 --> 00:43:00.110
very slow to develop and it's very easy to deal with Jasper.

683
00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.910
It's kind of just gone for it. You know, it's a very sort of like um,

684
00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:05.170
how boy move to the scientific community.

685
00:43:05.171 --> 00:43:10.060
I think they believe that I'm premature of not FDA approved and offering this to

686
00:43:10.061 --> 00:43:12.790
the public. You don't know what it is. You don't know its purity.

687
00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.070
<v 12>It's not safe.</v>

688
00:43:14.071 --> 00:43:18.270
But I've talked to several clients who had really severe allergies and asthma.

689
00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:22.070
They say they've just achieved these great results and desperate also says he

690
00:43:22.071 --> 00:43:26.600
seen success with that with a few multiple sclerosis patients and several. Yeah,

691
00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:28.020
<v 13>crumbs. Do these patients too,</v>

692
00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:31.230
like how many people do you think that you have infected?

693
00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:32.730
That's about 85 right now.

694
00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:36.540
How is business isn't everything that doesn't necessarily is adequate,

695
00:43:36.541 --> 00:43:41.541
but I honestly don't know why I don't wake up in the morning with my front

696
00:43:41.761 --> 00:43:46.620
garden 20 deep with people with ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, allergies.

697
00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:51.480
I just don't know why I'm not completely buried the way he sees it.

698
00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:53.520
People are scared. Well,

699
00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:56.670
they're the people who are coming from a point of view of what I learned in

700
00:43:56.671 --> 00:44:00.450
kindergarten about clean drinking water and sewers to them.

701
00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:04.050
Worms and parasites are so repulsive that there's nothing good to be said about

702
00:44:04.051 --> 00:44:08.880
them, but I can make you better. It's simple. It's cheap.

703
00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:12.810
I mean, for God's sake, these organisms fall out my rear end every day,

704
00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:14.340
a half a million at a time.

705
00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:18.030
The raw material is human excrement for God's sake.

706
00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:21.300
All people have to do is open their minds.

707
00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:23.100
<v 4>You</v>

708
00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:24.720
<v 13>are you really that scared of a little warm</v>

709
00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:32.723

710

look them. Thank you. Hookworm. Thank you.

712
00:44:44.881 --> 00:44:48.660

724
00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:32.850
Hello, I'm Janna. Boom. Right. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab. Today's topic,

725
00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:36.990
parasites, where we have already learned that parasites can be good.

726
00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:39.510
Sometimes Harris' sites can of course be very bad,

727
00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:43.150
that also parasites can affect human behavior. Making this,

728
00:46:43.151 --> 00:46:47.370
some of us a little lethargic or solving our real allergies.

729
00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:50.670
Here's the question to consider though. Can they not just affect our behavior?

730
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.040
Can they control our behavior and different question in time? Yeah.

731
00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:57.250
And you know, we were, we were thinking about this question, you know,

732
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:58.680
in the abstract doing some research,

733
00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:03.890
but then things got kind of real when our producer Ellen Horn called in late to

734
00:47:04.551 --> 00:47:05.240
work one day.

735
00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:08.690
<v 8>Hey Lulu. It's Alan. I'm just got home from the, that um,</v>

736
00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:12.470
I've been waiting on chest x rays, um, blood work from my cat,

737

739
00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:24.170
I've met Lewis, he's a very sweet kid. He's a darling,

740
00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:28.160
but moose has a digestion problems.

741
00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:34.090
And this one day I had to take her to the vet and as I was putting her into the

742
00:47:34.091 --> 00:47:35.410
kitty carrier,

743
00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:40.570
<v 8>she managed the scratch me with her back claws and like a bloody wound on my</v>

744
00:47:40.731 --> 00:47:45.320
hand. Her back claws are like totally poop covered. So I'm kind of worried.

745
00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:47.420
I have, I have six months pregnant.

746
00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:52.300
<v 16>The very first thing that they tell you when you get pregnant is stay away from</v>

747
00:47:52.301 --> 00:47:57.280
cat poop. So after it happened, I called my when by CC. Are you ready for me?

748
00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:01.510
Yeah, she told me to rush right down to her office to apply pretty profusely.

749
00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:06.070
It did. Wait a second. Why? What's so scary about cat poop? Well,

750
00:48:06.071 --> 00:48:11.071
it turns out that cat poop can have in it this tiny parasite called Toxoplasma

751
00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:15.520
Gondii. But what is the threat to the baby if it gets to the baby?

752
00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:17.200
It can cause miscarriage.

753
00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:22.240
It can cause stillbirth and it can also cause seizures, blindness.

754
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:26.100
So you're, you're, you're freaking out at this point. Yeah.

755
00:48:26.101 --> 00:48:28.590
I'm kind of freaking out at this cranium small head.

756
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:35.540
My midwife said there's probably nothing to worry about. So she took my blood.

757
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:36.980
That's probably the better arm.

758
00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:42.590
Can you say question and she sent me home.

759
00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:47.970
The turnaround time for the test is between two and three days. Okay. Okay.

760
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:51.170
So I'm looking on the Internet at home.

761
00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:53.960
I proceed to get myself even more freaked out.

762
00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:56.880
A bunch of things about tax or plus markets.

763
00:48:57.110 --> 00:49:00.200
One of the things that I found was this lecture by Robert Spolsky.

764
00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:02.270
<v 17>Okay. Example I'm talking about here.</v>

765
00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:04.590
<v 16>He's a neuroscientist who we've had on the show</v>

766
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:08.210
<v 17>a lot. It has to do with a parasite called Toxoplasma.</v>

767
00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:11.540
<v 16>And um, I just decided that I was going to call them up.</v>

768
00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:15.470
Hello and ask a few questions. Okay. So what's the deal with Toxo?

769
00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:20.870
And he proceeded to tell me one of the most amazing feats of mind control that

770
00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:26.480
I'd ever heard. What'd he tell you? Well,

771
00:49:26.481 --> 00:49:29.920
the first thing he told me is that toxo doesn't actually want to

772
00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:33.990
<v 18>me and me. Yes, it really has wandered off into the wrong county.</v>

773
00:49:33.991 --> 00:49:35.250
If it winds up in a human,

774
00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:39.900
it wants to be inside Mousse for totally mysterious reasons,

775
00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:44.970
at least to me, talk so can only reproduce sexually in the gut of cats.

776
00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:51.920
So it's there in mooses intestines that the toxoplasma meet and puck up.

777
00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:54.690
Then they lay eggs.

778
00:49:56.350 --> 00:50:01.350
Next Moose takes a trip to the backyard where she ichecks those eggs in her

779
00:50:01.381 --> 00:50:03.600
pursue what's out there. Now when the cat feces,

780
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:06.330
step two says the Polski as that, you know,

781
00:50:06.331 --> 00:50:10.460
maybe a week later a rat will come along and eat the cat poop.

782
00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:15.030
Now toxo has a problem. It's stuck inside a rat.

783
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:17.160
It really wants to be inside a cat.

784
00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:22.580
But rats totally freak out whenever they so much as even smell the cat. It's,

785
00:50:22.590 --> 00:50:25.410
it's a hardwired aversion and talk.

786
00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:30.260
Sue's evolutionary challenge has been to figure out how to get rodents inside

787
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:31.370
cat stomachs.

788
00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:36.440
<v 16>Here is where the mind control comes in and it's kind of hard to believe but</v>

789
00:50:37.231 --> 00:50:39.000
this is what [inaudible] says happens.

790
00:50:39.090 --> 00:50:42.550
<v 18>Toxo starts off in the stomach of the Roden,</v>

791
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:47.930
takes about six weeks to migrate its way up to the brain and once it's in there

792
00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:50.870
it finds this particular region called the Amygdala,

793
00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:55.920
which is like command central for fear and anxiety and hair,

794
00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:56.690
all of that.

795
00:50:56.690 --> 00:51:01.070
It also finds this other region kind of right next door where a very different

796
00:51:01.071 --> 00:51:03.260
emotion, less sexual arousal.

797
00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:08.730
And what talks though seems to be able to do is to somehow

798
00:51:11.170 --> 00:51:15.790
cross the wires. This may be some horrifically simplified soundbite,

799
00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:19.800
but what I think is going on is the toxo knows how to make happier and smells

800
00:51:19.801 --> 00:51:24.500
sexy. What to rodents, which that is so light,

801
00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:27.040
bulk, totally bizarre,

802
00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:32.070
but toxo makes rodents like the smell of cats and thus they approach and thus

803
00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:38.980
they are more likely to wind up in the cat stomach. That's rough. Yeah.

804
00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:43.630
In all other ways. The retina is totally normal, normal olfaction,

805
00:51:43.690 --> 00:51:45.070
normal social behavior,

806
00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:46.630
<v 16>just hot for cats.</v>

807
00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:54.640
I start to wonder, well, this really likes the microphone. I love cats. Yeah.

808
00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:57.740
Is it possible that toxo this is wonderful,

809
00:51:57.830 --> 00:52:02.600
is what's been drawing me to cats. That's why we let her put her for everywhere.

810
00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:07.700
<v 18>I asked him pure speculation, but people who think about this stuff,</v>

811
00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:12.790
who view it as not just purely speculative to the notion that talks so can

812
00:52:12.831 --> 00:52:16.070
produce some sort of attraction to cats and humans.

813
00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.900
They don't think that's all that crazy.

814
00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:23.120
<v 16>Wait, so you're saying that like the crazy cat lady could be toxoplasma? Well,</v>

815
00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:26.000
no one's really studied that yet. Testing, testing,

816
00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:30.170
but there are scientists out there that are making the case that talks. Oh,

817
00:52:30.171 --> 00:52:31.530
can really change you. Okay.

818
00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:35.880
<v 18>Probably the most interesting established link is between Toxo and</v>

819
00:52:35.881 --> 00:52:38.040
schizophrenia. Dr Tare. Yup.

820
00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:41.370
There's actually been the last count,

821
00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:46.400
54 studies on Toxoplasma in people with schizophrenia and other psychosis.

822
00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:49.050
That's Dr. Fuller Torrey.

823
00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:52.770
He works at the Stanley Medical Research Institute that sponsors a lot of these

824
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.160
studies. Well,

825
00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:56.820
I've been doing research on schizophrenia since the early seventies and he

826
00:52:56.821 --> 00:52:59.940
thinks there's a link. Yeah, not a huge effect. The very,

827
00:52:59.941 --> 00:53:04.320
very small risk of schizophrenia simply because schizophrenia is very rare.

828
00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:06.240
<v 16>But why would it cause schizophrenia to begin with?</v>

829
00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:08.790
Is it trying to cause schizophrenia?

830
00:53:08.850 --> 00:53:11.520
Is that you imagine if the toxo was sort of lost in the brain.

831
00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:13.140
If it thinks it's in a rat brain,

832
00:53:13.170 --> 00:53:16.410
maybe it's just trying to do what it usually does to rats,

833
00:53:16.411 --> 00:53:19.500
but in humans it has a very different effect. Nice.

834
00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:21.570
And one of the reasons he thinks this might be true,

835
00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:26.610
this connection between Toxoplasma and schizophrenia is because of a historical

836
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880
<v 19>length.</v>

837
00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:31.880
The fact that what we now call schizophrenia was quite rare until the late part

838
00:53:33.541 --> 00:53:34.560
of the 18th century.

839
00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:39.660
And then during the 18 hundreds schizophrenia increased very rapidly.

840
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:45.000
Why? This was the first time when we started to keep catches pets.

841
00:53:46.570 --> 00:53:49.720
They first were adopted by the, um,

842
00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:54.100
kind of east Greenwich village types in parish,

843
00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:57.550
the artists, and it was really considered kind of weird,

844
00:53:57.551 --> 00:54:00.940
but it's the kind of thing that if you were an artist or writer or something

845
00:54:00.941 --> 00:54:01.361
like that,

846
00:54:01.361 --> 00:54:06.361
you started to do a mini kind of spread the London where the writers and artists

847
00:54:06.611 --> 00:54:10.300
kept it there. And then starting in about the 1840s,

848
00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:12.880
he had started to become a little bit more popular.

849
00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:17.170
And then in the 1860s and seventies, there was what called a cat.

850
00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:20.950
Crazy cats were all over bleeding cards.

851
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:26.430
The first cat show was at London in 1870 and then Madison square garden I 1880.

852
00:54:28.810 --> 00:54:31.030
It became very fashionable to have a cat,

853
00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:35.840
<v 16>we should say. I mean, he'll agree at this point it's just a theory. Okay.</v>

854
00:54:35.841 --> 00:54:40.580
But is there any evidence that toxo can actually control our behavior like it

855
00:54:40.581 --> 00:54:41.810
does with the rats? Well,

856
00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:46.040
there are some scientists out there who believe that toxo may affect something

857
00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:47.690
more common to all [inaudible]

858
00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:52.040
<v 18>here's another one of those gimme a break. That's Robert Sapolsky. Again,</v>

859
00:54:52.070 --> 00:54:57.070
science fiction branches to the story to different groups independently have

860
00:54:57.291 --> 00:55:02.291
seen people who are toxo infected have two to four times the likelihood of dying

861
00:55:02.781 --> 00:55:04.130
in car accidents.

862
00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:06.560
<v 16>Really? Yeah. And I asked him why</v>

863
00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:11.620
<v 18>insofar as toxo makes rodents get really imprudent about cat smells,</v>

864
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:16.610
maybe toxo is making all sorts of mammals get imprudent about anything that

865
00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:21.110
they're normally a skittish about like your body hurdling through space at a

866
00:55:21.111 --> 00:55:21.900
high speed.

867
00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:25.800
<v 16>So in the end it might be possible,</v>

868
00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:30.900
might be possible that toxo is guiding our emotions

869
00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:34.200
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

870
00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:36.930
<v 16>changing who we are in some basic way.</v>

871
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:42.020
And if you consider that toxo might just be one of thousands of tiny little

872
00:55:42.021 --> 00:55:45.770
parasites inside us pulling our strings from the inside.

873
00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:49.060
<v 18>Well that thought is pretty creepy.</v>

874
00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:54.390
Even if the entire lesson with toxo is a small subset of infected people now

875
00:55:55.661 --> 00:56:00.550
have one half of 1% more likelihood of one to drive really recklessly.

876
00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:01.180
Um,

877
00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:06.180
even lurking in that one half of 1% are some serious implications for thinking

878
00:56:06.221 --> 00:56:07.270
about freewill.

879
00:56:09.110 --> 00:56:12.140
We haven't a clue the biology lurking in the background.

880
00:56:12.141 --> 00:56:15.020
That makes freewill seem a little bit suspect.

881
00:56:18.330 --> 00:56:21.540
Either way. Whatever happened with your test about

882
00:56:21.850 --> 00:56:24.130
<v 16>this is me with my midwife,</v>

883
00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:27.060
<v 5>Berry winter, my absence. She's giving me the news,</v>

884
00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:31.870
whatever we find out from the Toxo test that you have had past infection with

885
00:56:31.871 --> 00:56:33.040
toxoplasma

886
00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:35.443
<v 2>positive,</v>

887

<v 5>you're positive. Yeah, but my midwife says that the baby's going to be okay.</v>

The baby look like she's small. No, she looks like she's a nice size too.

00:56:46.671 --> 00:56:48.350
A little bit on the larger size,

00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:53.390
so not a baby I'd be worried about and I believe her.

Thanks, Helen. Sure.
