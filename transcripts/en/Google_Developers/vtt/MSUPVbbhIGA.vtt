NANDINI STOCKER: Hi, I'm Nandini
from Google's Conversation

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.170
Design Team, here to
give you some tips on how

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.060
to design your
own voice and chat

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.000
UIs using Actions on Google.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.130
Before we dive in, let's
have a conversation

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.170
about conversation.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.760
Consider this.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.670
All human inventions
start as ideas.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.790
By definition, conversation
is the exchange

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.220
of ideas by spoken words.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.940
And by definition, civilization
is the most advanced stage

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.590
of human social development.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.470
It's the tangible expression
of our common understanding

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.650
and values, which is
expressed through language.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.010
And language is molded and
refined by conversations.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.980
A conversation is a contract
between two participants

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.500
with a mutual investment
in the outcome.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.920
But all of that is
really hard to codify.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.770
Building natural
human-to-computer conversations

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.030
is hard.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.880
But that's because
human-to-human conversations

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.100
are only deceptively easy.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.540
People are not
going to change how

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.430
they converse any time soon.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.610
So the key to closing that
gap between modern interfaces

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.740
and thousands of
years of evolution

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.740
is to use what we know to
be true about human-to-human

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.640
conversation to teach our
computers to talk to humans,

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.480
and not the other way around.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.870
So the key to building
a good voice interface

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.600
is not to fall into the
trap of simply converting

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.850
a GUI into a VUI.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.700
Obviously, I can't teach you
an entire design discipline

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.880
in a few minutes.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.600
But I can give you five protips
to set you up for success.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.560
Let's design a simple number
guessing game along the way.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.800
Here we go.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.930
Number one, leverage your brand
and give yourself a persona.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.600
I don't mean a caricature
or mascot necessarily,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.650
but you can do that too to
make it even more accessible.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.640
A persona is more than that.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.600
It's the consistent character
captured by the voice

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.370
and interactive experience.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.460
It's the face of that
experience for the user.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.190
First, list the core
attributes of your brand

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.840
and what you stand for.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.060
Come up with the
corresponding attributes

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.490
that can be conveyed through
design elements and, of course,

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.250
the voice dialogue itself.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.970
For example, if your brand
is known for speed, something

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.300
we at Google are known for,
some attributes of the design

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.030
might be to be intuitive
and data-driven,

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.570
since both of those elements
cut out steps for the user.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.180
Some voice attributes for
the actual dialogue wording

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.110
might be engaging, or apt, or
approachable, since those also

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.870
tighten up the dialog by
removing ambiguity or making

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.230
it easier for the user to have
confidence in the interaction.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.390
Write a short style
guide covering things

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.990
like pace, tone, energy
level, vocal attributes,

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.020
and the overall impression
that you're shooting for.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.110
Try to create a simple biosketch
of a character that might

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.790
embody all of these attributes.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.220
Give it a name, if you want.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.300
Also, there's a practical reason
for creating a persona as well.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.960
It's a good grounding
mechanism for you long-term.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.510
Designers and developers
will come and go,

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.300
or multiple people could
work on it at once.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.080
It'll give everyone something
to fall back on for consistency.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.600
Finally, don't forget
to identify yourself

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.540
as a separate entity from
the Google Assistant.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.840
That means greet the user.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.490
Number two, think outside
the box, literally.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.670
It's tempting to draw out a
conversation path visually,

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.910
and plug in the dialog, and
then dive right into the code

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.280
or start stringing
together blocks of context

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.850
to write a working agent, and
then back into the experience

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.020
iteratively.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.580
We don't recommend this.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.700
You can, but I promise you it
will save time and give you

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.970
a much richer experience to
map out the core conversation

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.950
paths ahead of time.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.770
This doesn't mean just
the so-called happy path.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.310
It doesn't mean
error paths either.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.900
Instead, write out
your core experiences

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.880
like you would a screenplay.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.850
This can be as scrappy as
acting it out and documenting it

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.070
on paper or create an
interactive prototype

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.090
you tweak and play with until
you're ready to start coding.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.910
And then, when you draw
out your initial vision,

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.170
keep it at a high level,
where the boxes present

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.330
entire dialogs or user
intents, but leave out

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.180
the individual wording you'll
use in the interaction.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.110
Number three.

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.490
Context.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.440
Here are just some
types of context

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.110
you can consider and
infuse into a conversation

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.880
to make it more meaningful.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.000
Where's the user?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.430
What are they doing?

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.430
What type of device are
they interacting on?

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.960
How was the experience
influenced over time?

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.560
Where is the user's
frame of mind in relation

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.660
to what they're trying to do?

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.500
Try to cater to their intent,
not to a specific feature.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.820
Number four.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.790
Speech recognition
technology isn't perfect,

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.711
but it's getting
better all the time.

00:04:47.711 --> 00:04:49.210
So for the most
part, you might want

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.650
to treat that as a black box
that will continue to improve.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.080
You have to, of course, be
aware of its limitations,

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.510
but try to step back and
look at the interaction

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.420
from the user's perspective
when something goes wrong.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.280
You don't have to try
to steer the user back

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.050
to the original
question if they don't

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.610
get recognized immediately.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.370
There are so many reasons
they might not have been.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.190
People hardly ever say nonsense.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.620
Try to take those
so-called errors

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.580
and make them into another
meaningful turn in the dialog.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.490
Finally, I leave you
with a challenge.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.250
This new world of conversation
designed for machines

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.290
opens up a great
deal of opportunity

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.780
that hasn't existed before
for us to use technology

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.640
to advance our lives.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.580
Sure, as you get started,
create some games.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.640
But I urge you to think
bigger eventually.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.580
Help give someone access to
information or technology

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.130
that they couldn't use before
because of a physical, mental,

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.280
or an economic disadvantage.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.430
We're excited to help you do
that with Actions on Google.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.590
Check out the description
for some resources.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.720
And we can't wait to
see what you create.
