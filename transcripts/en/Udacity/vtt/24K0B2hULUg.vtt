00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.210
Have you ever wondered why people lie?

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.870
Or what is some people love sex
and others not so much?

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.160
Why does some people kill people,
but others will risk their lives

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.180
to save the life of a stranger?

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.760
Why is some people outgoing?
And why is some people shy?

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.500
Why is that you salivate
at the smell of your favorite food?

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.660
And really, why is it that we can remember
random childhood life events,

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.630
but we can't remember what
we had for breakfast this morning?

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.360
Well these are just a few of the questions
that psychologists have asked

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.510
and provided answers to over the years.
Psychology is so much more

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.640
than a therapist sitting on a couch,
talking to a person.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.040
It's the real science behind understanding
people and their thoughts and behaviors.
