on the part of people and it really just
 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.870
on the part of people and it really just
means that which we have enmity toward

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880
means that which we have enmity toward
 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.190
means that which we have enmity toward
which we hold as fearful separate that

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
which we hold as fearful separate that
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.830
which we hold as fearful separate that
we feel really terribly alienated from

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840
we feel really terribly alienated from
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.660
we feel really terribly alienated from
and so it could be a person it could be

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670
and so it could be a person it could be
 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.420
and so it could be a person it could be
a force within ourselves it could be a

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430
a force within ourselves it could be a
 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.390
a force within ourselves it could be a
habit it could be just a life situation

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400
habit it could be just a life situation
 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.109
habit it could be just a life situation
like suffering or getting ill or

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119
like suffering or getting ill or
 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.139
like suffering or getting ill or
something like that so the four enemies

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149
something like that so the four enemies
 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.600
something like that so the four enemies
which make up the kind of arc of the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610
which make up the kind of arc of the
 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.609
which make up the kind of arc of the
book are first of all outer enemies so

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619
book are first of all outer enemies so
 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.520
book are first of all outer enemies so
those are people who have hurt us or

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530
those are people who have hurt us or
 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.160
those are people who have hurt us or
threaten us or have hurt those when we

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170
threaten us or have hurt those when we
 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.830
threaten us or have hurt those when we
care about so it's kind of the obvious

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840
care about so it's kind of the obvious
 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.410
care about so it's kind of the obvious
more conventional meaning of enemies and

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420
more conventional meaning of enemies and
 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.569
more conventional meaning of enemies and
then inner enemies which is the second

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579
then inner enemies which is the second
 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.139
then inner enemies which is the second
are those forces that when they overtake

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149
are those forces that when they overtake
 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.940
are those forces that when they overtake
us so it's not a question of just

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950
us so it's not a question of just
 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.210
us so it's not a question of just
feeling angry

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220
feeling angry
 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.060
feeling angry
or greed or jealousy but when we get

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070
or greed or jealousy but when we get
 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.070
or greed or jealousy but when we get
lost in them especially when they lead

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080
lost in them especially when they lead
 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.760
lost in them especially when they lead
to action which is often a regrettable

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770
to action which is often a regrettable
 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.680
to action which is often a regrettable
they function as enemies because they

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690
they function as enemies because they
 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.800
they function as enemies because they
just take us over and take us to a place

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810
just take us over and take us to a place
 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.710
just take us over and take us to a place
that might be really painful

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720
that might be really painful
 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.190
that might be really painful
the third enemy is the secret enemy in

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200
the third enemy is the secret enemy in
 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.090
the third enemy is the secret enemy in
this construct which is the construct of

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100
this construct which is the construct of
 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.090
this construct which is the construct of
self and other the way we feel that

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100
self and other the way we feel that
 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.440
self and other the way we feel that
we're not part of an interconnected

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450
we're not part of an interconnected
 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.780
we're not part of an interconnected
universe that we're a separate were

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790
universe that we're a separate were
 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.690
universe that we're a separate were
alone we're independent we need to be in

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700
alone we're independent we need to be in
 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.830
alone we're independent we need to be in
control we need to be all-powerful

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840
control we need to be all-powerful
 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.270
control we need to be all-powerful
because we don't see ourselves as part

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280
because we don't see ourselves as part
 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.360
because we don't see ourselves as part
of a whole and then the fourth enemy is

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370
of a whole and then the fourth enemy is
 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.410
of a whole and then the fourth enemy is
the super secret enemy which sometimes

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420
the super secret enemy which sometimes
 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.440
the super secret enemy which sometimes
is called self preoccupation Bob in this

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450
is called self preoccupation Bob in this
 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.290
is called self preoccupation Bob in this
book has been calling it self-loathing

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300
book has been calling it self-loathing
 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.540
book has been calling it self-loathing
I really think of it as a kind of

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550
I really think of it as a kind of
 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.630
I really think of it as a kind of
hopelessness where we try and try and

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640
hopelessness where we try and try and
 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.540
hopelessness where we try and try and
try to be happy but we may be doing it

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550
try to be happy but we may be doing it
 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.550
try to be happy but we may be doing it
in all the wrong ways very selfishly

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560
in all the wrong ways very selfishly
 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.229
in all the wrong ways very selfishly
very much from a cut-off place and

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239
very much from a cut-off place and
 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.000
very much from a cut-off place and
natural place of generosity or caring

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010
natural place of generosity or caring
 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.490
natural place of generosity or caring
and so we get more and more unhappy we

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500
and so we get more and more unhappy we
 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.620
and so we get more and more unhappy we
dislike ourselves even more and then we

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630
dislike ourselves even more and then we
 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.090
dislike ourselves even more and then we
just kind of feel defeated

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100
just kind of feel defeated
 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:40.470
just kind of feel defeated
so those are the four enemies

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480
 
 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.540
