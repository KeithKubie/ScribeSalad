DON DODGE: Hello, everyone.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.650
I'm Don Dodge, and this
is Google Root Access.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.790
Today I'm with Kevin Rose, and
we're here at Google Ventures.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.360
And Toaster the Wonder
Dog is here--

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.680
KEVIN ROSE: Wandering around.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.725
DON DODGE: He'll probably
jump in at some point.

00:00:14.725 --> 00:00:16.846
Kevin, you've been an
entrepreneur, an angel

00:00:16.846 --> 00:00:20.520
investor, and now a VC.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.160
How's the transition, and what
do you like about being a VC?

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.950
KEVIN ROSE: I think the biggest
thing for me is just

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.929
the exposure to a whole wide
range of companies that you

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:30.670
wouldn't have as an angel.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.820
When you have multiple partners
bringing in deals to

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.280
look at, you get exposure to
different categories, like

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.640
whether it's health care
investments or hardware

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.210
investments, or just things that
are outside of my normal

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.820
comfortable zone of
consumer internet.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.830
And it's a lot of fun to see all
these different start-ups

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.270
and just to get to
meet more people.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.340
DON DODGE: So as an angel
investor, you make all those

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.083
decisions yourself.

00:00:56.083 --> 00:00:58.080
You're sort of on your own.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.970
How do you step outside the
comfort zone and invest in

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.569
places where you don't
have that experience?

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.690
KEVIN ROSE: Well I think that
for me, I always try to stay

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.300
focused on what I'm
good at, which I

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.810
believe is consumer internet.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.000
I come from a consumer internet
background as far as

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.700
building those types
of companies.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.750
So if you take a look at my
investments, it tends to be

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.190
web-based or mobile-based
products that I would use.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.371
So I'd say 95% of the time, the
investments that I make

00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:34.890
are because I have a personal
connection to that product,

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.440
and I use it on a daily basis.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.910
And so for me, it's just trying
to stay within that

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.810
while, at the same time, seeing
these other investments

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.930
and learn from the partners
and understand how they

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.050
evaluate companies and how that
differs from how I do it.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.120
DON DODGE: So which
comes first?

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.960
Is it that you use the product
first and get engaged with it,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.312
or you meet the entrepreneur and
then you use the product

00:01:57.312 --> 00:01:58.800
and then you invest?

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.135
How does that happen?

00:02:00.135 --> 00:02:02.590
KEVIN ROSE: Well, I think that
it really depends on what

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.640
stage you hear about
the company.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.530
Oftentimes it'll be
about the idea.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.530
So and so is building this idea
for whatever it may be, a

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.860
new dating service or a new
take on this or that.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.621
And if the idea catches your
attention, and it sounds like

00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:20.808
something exciting, then you'll
try and connect up with

00:02:20.808 --> 00:02:23.240
the meeting with the
entrepreneur.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.630
I've had it happen to me the
flip side of that as well,

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.090
where you meet an entrepreneur,
and you sit down

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.990
with them, and you talk product,
and you realize that

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.010
the idea that they're currently
working on might not

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.240
be the one that they win with,
but at some point in time,

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.510
this person's going to
do amazing things.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.290
So it really depends
on the situation.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.340
DON DODGE: So it's all
about the team.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.420
Every investor that I talk to
says they make their decisions

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.560
based on the team, the
product, the market.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.776
So how do you go through that
prioritization of when you're

00:02:56.776 --> 00:02:57.692
making an investment?

00:02:57.692 --> 00:02:58.608
What do you do?

00:02:58.608 --> 00:03:02.510
KEVIN ROSE: Yeah, I think that
for me it has to come down to

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.080
does the person have a vision
for somehow impacting,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.380
disrupting, or changing the
world in a big way.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.554
And I think that I've met a lot
of entrepreneurs that have

00:03:14.554 --> 00:03:16.160
the technical chops.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.580
They can go, they can
scale websites.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.770
They understand agile
developments.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.360
They have no problem getting
ideas out there and

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.090
iterating on them.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.250
But they might not have the true
product instincts that I

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.330
think you need to build
something great.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.400
And so for me, I always look
for, typically, someone on the

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.482
founding team has to have
a strong product vision.

00:03:42.482 --> 00:03:43.600
And that's important.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.930
So what that means is that I've
seen a handful of really

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.550
strong teams that will create
alternatives to

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.820
existing sites today.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.860
Like I saw an idea for an
alternative version of

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.880
Pinterest that very much looked
like Pinterest, felt

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.780
like Pinterest, but
it was applied

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.032
to a different vertical.

00:04:00.032 --> 00:04:02.730
And the problem I have with
something like that is that

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.420
these people aren't going
to be innovating.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.710
They're just copying someone
else with a slightly different

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:08.080
take on it.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.420
And oftentimes those businesses
really don't

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.820
succeed, because they're just
trying to keep feature parity

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.440
with someone out there that is
really doing the innovation.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.650
And so I think innovation, a
strong product team, is the

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.900
most important thing.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.502
DON DODGE: I had an investor
ask me this morning, as a

00:04:28.502 --> 00:04:32.850
matter of fact, about Drew
Houston and Dropbox.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.658
And I remember in 2007, I was at
the Y Combinator Demo Day,

00:04:37.658 --> 00:04:40.406
and there were hundreds of
investors there, very

00:04:40.406 --> 00:04:41.765
prominent investors.

00:04:41.765 --> 00:04:44.940
And we all passed, because--

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.845
well, in my case it was because
Microsoft was doing

00:04:48.845 --> 00:04:52.000
things in that area, and there
were a bunch of other

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.380
companies that were doing it,
so it just didn't seem that

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.462
different or interesting
to me.

00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:59.960
Yet here we are five years
later, and Dropbox is worth

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.540
billions of dollars.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.530
So what do you think we
all missed there?

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.982
Or did you see Dropbox
back then?

00:05:06.982 --> 00:05:09.690
KEVIN ROSE: Yeah, I saw
Dropbox back then.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.790
Like you, I wasn't terribly
excited about it.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.920
I don't know that you--

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.540
time will tell whether or not
you actually missed or not.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.380
Maybe you did hit dead on.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.210
And the issue I think that we
all had is that we knew that

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.190
at some point in time, the
big players would make a

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.320
move into the space.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.170
And they did.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.540
They just now recently--

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.885
Google's launched
Google Drive.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.910
What's that going to
mean for Dropbox?

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.070
Maybe you made the right call.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.890
I think that one of the things
that Drew was very good at is

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.760
he was able to quickly
launch a product and

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.100
get that early traction.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.220
And so he has the base
of users now.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.680
He is the big player
in this base.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.650
But I do believe that as others
with iCloud and you

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:04.920
name it enter into this shared
cloud-based storage, it's just

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.440
going to be a war
to the bottom.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.340
Everyone's going to condense
the pricing down.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.616
And whoever has the largest
volume and has a scale will be

00:06:13.616 --> 00:06:15.355
able to get the most attractive
pricing and

00:06:15.355 --> 00:06:16.180
ultimately win.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.460
And I think that it's going
to be a tough road

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.080
for him going forward.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.300
Nothing to knock him as an
entrepreneur, because he's

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.705
done amazing things
and obviously

00:06:24.705 --> 00:06:26.170
built a great company.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.140
But I would not want
to be in his shoes.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.775
I think it's going to be a tough
battle over the next

00:06:30.775 --> 00:06:31.960
couple years.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.200
One I did miss on, though, to
your point about just missing

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.790
investments in general,
Pinterest.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.750
Pinterest was one that they gave
me a term sheet, and then

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.150
I had the option to invest
in a $5 million cap.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.490
And I said no to it.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.020
There were two or three other
players in the space.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.060
There was no clear winner.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.010
If you meet Ben as an
entrepreneur, he's clearly a

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:59.030
really brilliant guy, but he's
more of a deep thinker and not

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.780
necessarily a big, outgoing,
exciting--

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.710
he doesn't get you pumped up
about what he's doing.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.260
He's just very thoughtful
about what he's doing.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.970
And so I had left the
meeting thinking,

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:15.850
smart guy, cool product.

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.430
Didn't know how quickly he was
going to continue to innovate

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:19.020
on the product.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.100
Didn't know if there
was a clear winner.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.940
And so I just passed on it.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.103
DON DODGE: And it's probably
something you

00:07:23.103 --> 00:07:24.020
don't use every day.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.470
KEVIN ROSE: It's not something
I use every day.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:26.920
DON DODGE: So that's the
key right there.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.840
If it's your personally excited
about it, and you see

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.420
the value, and you want to
use it, then that puts

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:32.700
you over the edge.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:32.980
KEVIN ROSE: Right.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:33.880
Oh, absolutely.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.990
I'd used it a few times,
thought it was OK.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.180
My feedback to him, I had some
general product feedback

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.180
around repinning and things
of that nature.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.700
And you're always going
to miss deals.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:48.640
It's just going to happen.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.005
You'll always be able
to look back.

00:07:50.005 --> 00:07:52.160
But think about how many
deals you say no to.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.690
I say no to so many deals.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.970
I would say out of 100 deals
that I see, I probably say yes

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.290
to maybe one of them.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:01.632
It's going to happen.

00:08:01.632 --> 00:08:03.590
You're bound to have a
couple in there that

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:04.700
you're going to miss.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.990
DON DODGE: So I tell
entrepreneurs that VCs say no

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:11.176
99% of the time,
and so do you.

00:08:11.176 --> 00:08:12.550
And they said, what?

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.526
And I said, you probably have a
stock portfolio, might have

00:08:15.526 --> 00:08:19.000
five stocks in it and maybe
three or four mutual funds.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.960
There are over 5,000 stocks.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.986
So by picking five, you
said no to 99.99% of

00:08:26.986 --> 00:08:28.610
the stocks out there.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:31.538
So when I tell them that they
sort of say, oh, OK.

00:08:31.538 --> 00:08:32.432
I get it.

00:08:32.432 --> 00:08:34.145
So you're going to pass.

00:08:34.145 --> 00:08:35.580
KEVIN ROSE: I say something
very similar.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.539
And I oftentimes use the
Pinterest example.

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:42.309
It's like, I'm not always going
to be-- just don't take

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:46.920
me saying no as like, oh,
god, this person that--

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.244
I remember when I was raising
money in the past, I had a

00:08:50.244 --> 00:08:52.972
couple investors, like
venture capitalists

00:08:52.972 --> 00:08:53.970
that I was a fan of.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.840
And they just didn't
quite get it.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.746
And you walk away from those
meetings and you just feel

00:08:57.746 --> 00:08:58.598
really frustrated.

00:08:58.598 --> 00:09:01.230
And you're like, gosh, man, I
really would have liked to

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:07.010
have that stamp, that seal
of approval from this

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:08.610
person who I respect.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:12.030
But it's just how it goes.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.380
Not everyone is always going to
get your vision on day one.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.000
DON DODGE: So how
do you say no?

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.480
That's one of the hardest things
to do as an investor.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.880
Because by nature, we're
very optimistic people.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.106
We want to see things
happen, and we want

00:09:26.106 --> 00:09:27.380
to help build companies.

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.430
But we have to say no.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.460
So how do you say no?

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.090
KEVIN ROSE: Well, it
really depends on--

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:38.790
oftentimes I do share with them
that for me, personally,

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.840
it has to do with would I use
the product every single day.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.830
And if I don't see it applying
to me, I might think--

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.198
and also the scale
of the business.

00:09:47.198 --> 00:09:50.550
I don't want to do an investment
in something that I

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.280
think is going to
be a $25 million

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.670
to $50 million business.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.570
I'm looking for the next
Facebook, the next Pinterest,

00:09:56.570 --> 00:10:00.220
the next big, multi-billion
dollar business.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.910
And it's not to say there
aren't a bunch of great

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:03.660
companies in there.

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.790
But if I want to see a return
for my LPs and investors and

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.230
everyone involved, I want to
get those big, big hits.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:14.070
So oftentimes I'll take a look
at a business, and I'll say,

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.910
this is going to be an amazing
lifestyle business.

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.590
You'll be able to pay yourself
six figures.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.043
It's going to be awesome.

00:10:21.043 --> 00:10:24.260
But it's a 10-person company.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:24.700
Go run it.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.716
And if it's your passion and
you're passionate about it and

00:10:26.716 --> 00:10:28.200
you love it, have fun with it.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.490
Enjoy it.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:30.720
Build it into something great.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.030
It doesn't have to be a
billion-dollar business.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.640
But that's just not the type
of investing that I go for.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.810
And so sometimes it's just
explaining that.

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:43.560
Other times it's explaining that
I don't see myself using

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.040
it every single day.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.620
But I'm just not their target
demographic, so I wouldn't

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:48.710
make an investment.

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:50.870
And then oftentimes it has
to do with how much

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:52.180
free time you have.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.530
There's only so much
time in the day to

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:55.420
spend with these companies.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.900
And I want to make sure that
when I do investments, I will

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.540
be super excited to spend as
much as possible to help these

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.371
companies out.

00:11:01.371 --> 00:11:04.020
And if there's not that really
good connection there, then

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.000
it's better just to pass.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.818
DON DODGE: So a lot of
entrepreneurs pick their

00:11:09.818 --> 00:11:13.830
investors based on how they can
help them and add value.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:16.530
So what are some of the ways
that you can help companies

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.520
that you invest in?

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.430
KEVIN ROSE: Oftentimes I sit
down with companies.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.930
And even before talking about
making an investment, I want

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:27.100
to see if there's a good
product sync there.

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:33.242
So I would say that my strengths
lie in product, when

00:11:33.242 --> 00:11:38.830
it comes to helping define UI,
UX for whether it's web or

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:42.380
mobile or you name it;
guerrilla marketing--

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.260
I love trying to figure out
really sticky, useful ways

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.200
that companies can get the word
out there with spending

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.380
very few marketing dollars.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:54.520
And so oftentimes if there's
something I really like, I'll

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.880
see a product, I'll play with
it, I'll take notes, I'll

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.420
write down a page full of
little, subtle questions I

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.620
have about the product.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.580
And the I'll sit down with the
entrepreneur and say, hey,

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.350
obviously you know
I'm an investor.

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.190
Let's talk about the product
first and foremost.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.720
And we sit down, and we discuss
all the different

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.560
points about what they're
trying to create, what's

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.980
working, what's not.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.710
And you'll see if there's a good
connection and synergy

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:18.360
between you and the
entrepreneur.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.550
And if they like some of the
advice that you're throwing

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.630
out there, then--

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:24.790
that's kind of what happened
with Pinterest.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.320
I sat down with Ben, and
we did a product

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.800
brainstorming session.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.675
I threw out some ideas that he
actually ended up implementing

00:12:30.675 --> 00:12:32.260
into the product later.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.840
And so he thought there was
a connection there, and we

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.320
decided to work together.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.870
I didn't end up making an
investment, but we worked

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:40.930
together on the product.

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:43.270
So that's how I like to approach
it, I think, is to

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:46.082
see if there's that connection
and if we have a good working

00:12:46.082 --> 00:12:46.490
relationship.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:50.670
Because after all, it really is
a partnership that you're

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.250
entering in with this person.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:56.493
It's like a multi-year marriage
that you're creating

00:12:56.493 --> 00:12:58.130
with another entrepreneur.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.670
DON DODGE: So from a Google
Ventures perspective, now

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:02.830
you're a part of a bigger
organization

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:04.760
that has more assets.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.750
What are some of the ways that
Google Ventures adds value to

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:08.900
companies or helps them?

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.340
KEVIN ROSE: This is an
easy one for me.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.080
Because I took money from
Google Ventures.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.880
You made the investment
to Google Venture

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.320
when I was at Milk.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.867
And I remember you saying,
hey, you should check out

00:13:17.867 --> 00:13:18.360
Google Ventures.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.220
They really offer something
unique and different.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.070
And really hadn't seen behind
the scenes what Google

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:24.490
Ventures was all about.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:30.800
Typically, you think about big,
more strategic venture

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.360
funds that come out of big
corporations, like AOL

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.480
Ventures or Nokia's Venture
arm or you name it.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.740
And you think, oh that's just a
side pool of money that they

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.410
try and make investments to
further their own brand.

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:48.630
Google Ventures being an
independent, standalone

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:51.280
venture capital firm that just
happens to have Google as the

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.534
single LP is very unique in that
we can make investments

00:13:56.534 --> 00:13:58.789
in things that are even
competitive with Google.

00:13:58.789 --> 00:14:01.412
And I think that Google believes
that when we go out

00:14:01.412 --> 00:14:04.610
and make investments into
technology companies and they

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:07.420
flourish, it's just better
for Google overall.

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.070
More people using computers and
search and devices and the

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:12.200
web is a better thing
for Google.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:16.050
And so that was exciting to
see, that there was that

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:18.300
church and state that was
happening between Google

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.600
Ventures and Google.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:25.275
But the other piece of it being
the components that had

00:14:25.275 --> 00:14:27.970
been built out inside of
Google Ventures from a

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:34.080
recruiting standpoint, from a
design standpoint, scaling--

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.192
you look at the firepower that
Google Ventures has to bring

00:14:38.192 --> 00:14:38.810
to the table.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.180
So if you're having issues with
recruiting, we have three

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.830
full-time recruiters that go out
there and help place real

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.110
people into companies.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:49.660
That was one of the biggest
challenges we had at Milk, was

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.475
finding high-quality engineers
to join the team.

00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:55.610
And just those different
resources, then you look at

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:56.840
the partners.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:00.890
And these aren't just partners
that have graduated with an

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:03.532
MBA and don't have any
real-world experience.

00:15:03.532 --> 00:15:06.670
We have co-founder of Android,
co-founder of Excite.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:08.270
You've got some real people
that have created

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.440
some amazing things.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:15.710
And so before I even joined
Google and when I was at Milk,

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:19.940
and I realized all the value
that they could bring, it was

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.850
a no-brainer to open
up with the round.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:23.725
We actually had closed our round
and we went back and

00:15:23.725 --> 00:15:25.714
opened it back up just to
let Google Ventures in.

00:15:25.714 --> 00:15:26.632
DON DODGE: Yeah, I remember.

00:15:26.632 --> 00:15:28.470
Thank you.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:32.570
Most start-ups say that hiring
people is a huge

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.330
problem, and design.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:39.470
Even very prominent start-ups,
names I won't mention, came to

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:41.710
me and said, we need help
finding designers.

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:43.350
We need some design help.

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.942
Those happen to be the two
things that Google Ventures

00:15:45.942 --> 00:15:49.020
focuses on, not by
coincidence.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:49.740
KEVIN ROSE: Yeah.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.270
It makes sense.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.880
I think high-quality designers
are the new

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.090
high-quality engineers.

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:57.205
It's like the hard thing
to come by now.

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:05.030
I think the bar has really been
raised, partly due to

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:06.090
Apple's success.

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:09.340
And the attention to detail
that they put on design I

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.450
think require a level of fit and
finish and polish that we

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:14.440
hadn't seen before.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.790
The fact that when people
install mobile applications,

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:21.490
oftentimes they give it one
shot, and if they don't like

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:24.430
it, and if you remove an
application, the hurdle to get

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:26.740
that person to then go back
to the app store, find the

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.850
application again, reinstall
it, and try

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:30.610
it again is so high.

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:33.430
So you have to really put a lot
of extra time and thought

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:37.940
into your design in making not
only beautiful and elegant

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.320
apps, but also easy-to-use
apps.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.490
DON DODGE: So that user
experience, that first-time

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.890
experience with the app
can make or break it.

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:45.100
KEVIN ROSE: Oh, absolutely.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:49.750
Back in the Web 2.0 days, you'd
roll something out there

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:51.070
as quickly as possible.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:55.505
Users were very forgiving, and
you'd polish it on the fly.

00:16:55.505 --> 00:16:58.110
You'd roll in updates every
month, two months, and it was

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:01.015
OK if certain things weren't
fully thought out.

00:17:01.015 --> 00:17:03.126
And I think that in the
app world, that's

00:17:03.126 --> 00:17:04.460
a little bit different.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:08.380
DON DODGE: So I say today, it
has never been easier to start

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:12.284
a company, but it's never been
harder to build a business.

00:17:12.284 --> 00:17:15.114
And what I mean by that is it's
cheap to start a company.

00:17:15.114 --> 00:17:16.797
You can do it pretty quickly.

00:17:16.797 --> 00:17:20.200
Yet getting the user traction
and getting a revenue model,

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.580
building a business is much,
much harder, because there's

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.520
so much competition.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.890
Have you found any ways that--

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:29.320
you mentioned guerrilla
marketing and

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.790
helping things go viral.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.244
Are there any secrets there,
or is it just keep trying

00:17:34.244 --> 00:17:35.710
things until it works?

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:44.690
KEVIN ROSE: Well, it really
depends on the app, but

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:47.020
ultimately it comes down in
to how can you turn your

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.160
customers into true
brand advocates

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.770
for what you're doing.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:55.740
And sometimes there are tricky
ways to do that.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:02.140
Other times there are ways that
you can make it seem as

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.100
part of the utility.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.970
On Instagram, one of the ways
that they spread so quickly is

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:10.040
they created all these easy
hooks into all the various

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:10.750
social networks.

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:14.003
And people thought, oh, I want
to share this beautiful photo

00:18:14.003 --> 00:18:15.500
out with my friends
and family.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.770
So of course I'm going to tweet
it, Facebook it, Tumblr

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:20.270
it, you name it.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:23.630
And I think that just thinking
about what those hooks might

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:26.940
be for your own product
is really important.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.680
I saw a product the other day
that had these really clever

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:34.500
quotes throughout the experience
that were kind of

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.230
catchy and cool.

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:37.450
And it had a little
bird next to it.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.690
And you could just tap it, and
it would make this beautiful

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:42.054
animation occur where it would
tweet out that quote and then

00:18:42.054 --> 00:18:45.190
put a little hashtag
to the game.

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:47.630
And the quotes kind of didn't
make sense, but it was

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:48.500
cool in that way.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.060
You wanted to tweet up these
weird funky sounding quotes,

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.350
and you were on the inside.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:55.307
And it maybe gave you this
feeling of being in on the

00:18:55.307 --> 00:18:58.330
know, on something cool that
not many people knew about.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:02.040
And so you go and visit the
hashtag, and there's just

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.170
thousands of people tweeting
these really funky, weird

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:07.660
little quotes about the game
to try and hook you in.

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:11.480
That was a very creative way of
tying in social to get some

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.290
distribution.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:15.930
I think it really-- obviously
it's on a

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:16.950
product-by-product basis.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:22.190
I worked with Fab, with Jason
over there, on ways in which

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:26.020
you encourage users to come in
with monetary incentives,

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:29.420
whether it's $10 off, whether
it's three friends buy this

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.500
item and you get it for free,
trying out those different

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:35.890
ways and seeing which ones are
going to bring in real

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:39.060
lifelong customers into
your product.

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:44.650
It's just understanding which
different levers you have to

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:48.828
pull to be able to get that
customer and get them to be

00:19:48.828 --> 00:19:51.830
that advocate, I think is
an important thing.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:53.764
DON DODGE: So you see hundreds
and hundreds of start-ups

00:19:53.764 --> 00:19:55.580
every year.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:20:00.036
What kinds of things are
exciting you now, that look

00:20:00.036 --> 00:20:00.980
interesting?

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:04.270
KEVIN ROSE: I believe that--

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:07.200
the thing that I'm fascinated
on recently

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.930
that hasn't yet hit--

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:10.264
well there's a couple things.

00:20:10.264 --> 00:20:11.746
I'm actually getting
ready to write a

00:20:11.746 --> 00:20:12.570
TechCrunch post about this.

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:13.790
But there's a couple things.

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:17.410
One, I believe that we
haven't seen the end

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:19.030
of new social networks.

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:25.610
And I think that we have defined
a very loose, kind of

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:27.290
tastemaker-like following
graph.

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:28.902
So you have celebrities that
have these millions of people

00:20:28.902 --> 00:20:32.730
that they don't know that are
following their accounts.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:36.210
It's like a one-to-many blast.

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:39.340
You have business relationships
which are

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.960
defined via LinkedIn.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.850
You have personal relationships
with services

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:48.350
like Path and Facebook
and things like that.

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:50.970
And then I believe the one that
we haven't tapped into

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:53.390
yet is the neighborhood graph.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:56.180
And I think that the fact that
we still don't really know who

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.170
our neighbors are--

00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:59.485
I'm in San Francisco, and I
couldn't tell you who lives to

00:20:59.485 --> 00:21:00.620
my right and to my left.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:01.910
I see them every once
in a while.

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:04.020
I may wave to them, but I have
no idea who they are.

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:06.090
I have no way to communicate
with them.

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:07.790
I have no way to tell them
about alerts that are

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:08.765
happening in the neighborhood.

00:21:08.765 --> 00:21:13.915
I have no way to potentially
engage with commerce with

00:21:13.915 --> 00:21:16.615
them, meaning selling off
garage-sale style

00:21:16.615 --> 00:21:18.120
items in real time.

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.860
I think that we will define the
neighborhood graph, and it

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:24.840
will turn into something pretty
unique and great.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.710
I've seen some companies making
some headway in this.

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:29.758
I think Nextdoor.com
is the one that

00:21:29.758 --> 00:21:31.296
has the most traction.

00:21:31.296 --> 00:21:32.546
I've been tracking
that company.

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:37.560
I believe that we're in the
very early days of the

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.940
quantified self.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.780
And so I think devices like
the Nike FuelBand, the

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:45.133
Fitbits, even Google Glass,
things of that nature where

00:21:45.133 --> 00:21:51.440
you can track and use technology
to enhance physical

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.140
performance and things
of that nature.

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:55.420
I think Nike's making
some really--

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:59.450
Nike's CEO was quoted a year ago
talking about how the last

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:02.586
10 years were about style and
design and the next 10 years

00:22:02.586 --> 00:22:04.600
for Nike are going to
be about technology.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.870
A couple days ago they announced
a shoe that will

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:10.410
tell you at the end of playing
basketball how many inches you

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:13.030
jumped in total and what
your highest jump was.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.710
I think that devices in general
are going to come

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:21.790
online for the first time,
whether it be apparel, whether

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:23.850
it be my microwave.

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:27.710
There's a lot of technology that
we live with that isn't

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:31.224
yet connected to the
backbone, isn't

00:22:31.224 --> 00:22:34.130
connected to the internet--

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:35.935
devices that aren't talking
to each other.

00:22:35.935 --> 00:22:39.190
I think Nest is a great example
of Google Ventures

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.950
portfolio company that is doing
great things in bringing

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:44.330
the thermostat online
for the first time.

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:46.515
I think that there's just so
many other potential places

00:22:46.515 --> 00:22:49.970
that you can apply that
type of technology.

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:55.030
So that's some of the stuff that
I just keep top of the

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:57.760
mind and track as it occurs.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.010
DON DODGE: At South by Southwest
this year, location

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:02.250
seemed to be the thing.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:07.152
So there was Highlight and
Plansy and echoecho and many

00:23:07.152 --> 00:23:10.160
other applications that
were all about--

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:13.070
mobile applications that would
allow you to find where your

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:16.210
friends were, or where people
with like interests were

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.600
located near you when they
came into proximity.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.714
It was hot during South by
Southwest, and now I'm not

00:23:22.714 --> 00:23:23.658
hearing so much about it.

00:23:23.658 --> 00:23:26.018
Is that an area that you think
is interesting, or

00:23:26.018 --> 00:23:26.490
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:28.970
KEVIN ROSE: I don't
like that area.

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:32.220
I made an investment in
foursquare several years ago

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:35.670
and Gowalla several
years ago, but I

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:36.960
haven't touched it since.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.050
I think that there's
check-in fatigue.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:44.160
I think the automatic matching
of people based

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.032
on interests is--

00:23:46.032 --> 00:23:47.940
I don't know that I'm ever--

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:52.170
again, I could totally be wrong
here, but personally,

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:54.615
I'm never in that mode.

00:23:54.615 --> 00:23:59.460
I feel like the best
applications and services just

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:03.050
enhance a natural instinct
that's already there.

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:06.920
And I don't feel like I've ever
had the natural urge to

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:10.250
go off and try and find people
with similar interests.

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:14.370
I don't know that just because
someone is standing across the

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:19.538
street waiting in a brunch line
and also likes web design

00:24:19.538 --> 00:24:22.180
that I would want to randomly
walk up to that person.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.970
DON DODGE: Or green
tea or whatever.

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:24.030
KEVIN ROSE: Yeah.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:25.880
I don't know that--

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.010
maybe in the dating
world, but I just

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:29.260
can't see that applying--

00:24:32.506 --> 00:24:35.690
it's a tough space.

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:40.820
I see what they're going for,
but I've never used a service

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:44.835
where I've thought, oh my
gosh, this is so great.

00:24:44.835 --> 00:24:48.090
For a mobile service to really
be successful in my eyes, it

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:50.460
has to be something that I want
to pull out and use two

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.770
to three times per day.

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:53.570
If I don't want to take my phone
out of my pocket and use

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:56.195
it two to three times per day,
I'm most likely not going to

00:24:56.195 --> 00:24:58.015
invest in it if it has to do
with social or mobile.

00:24:58.015 --> 00:25:00.020
And I don't know that Highlight
or any of these

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.970
other services have really
turned me on enough to where I

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:05.170
want to make that happen.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:06.570
DON DODGE: So you trust
your own instincts.

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:07.057
KEVIN ROSE: For sure.

00:25:07.057 --> 00:25:09.492
DON DODGE: And it goes back to
if you use it every day and

00:25:09.492 --> 00:25:11.440
you get excited about it, then
you probably [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.390
KEVIN ROSE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:18.080
DON DODGE: How does a first-time
entrepreneur, a new

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.972
entrepreneur, get to you or
get to Google Ventures?

00:25:20.972 --> 00:25:22.900
How do they get on
the radar screen?

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.150
KEVIN ROSE: I think that there's
a handful of different

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:27.680
events that we put together.

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.730
We have the start-up lab.

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:32.170
You'll hear about various
different Google Ventures

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:34.090
meet-ups and parties and
things like that.

00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:37.110
There's also reaching out.

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:41.110
Oftentimes there's two or three
degrees of separation--

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:42.496
it happens every single day.

00:25:42.496 --> 00:25:44.880
I'll have a friend that knows
a friend that forwards me a

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:45.820
deck to check out.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.440
Or I'm out there.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.210
If there's something really
cool, I can't tell you--

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:52.005
oftentimes I'll just go through
my Twitter @ replies.

00:25:52.005 --> 00:25:53.830
And someone will be like, hey,
I'm starting this new thing.

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:54.900
Here's a link to it.

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:55.750
Check it out.

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:58.160
Sure, I'll click on it and
see what it's all about.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.790
So I'm always scouring the net
looking for different things.

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:03.700
I've gotten recommendations
that have come through

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:08.090
AngelList, through friends,
through random people who see

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:09.670
me in an elevator.

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:12.260
You name it, they've come in.

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:16.240
But then again, some of the
partners are obviously

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.170
extremely busy at
Google Ventures.

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:20.490
And if you're not finding
traction in finding your way

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:23.220
in, look through all the
different associates that are

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:24.550
on the Google Ventures
website.

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:27.736
They are constantly scouring
and looking

00:26:27.736 --> 00:26:28.450
for the next thing.

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:31.150
So that might be an easier
way to get in.

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:33.806
DON DODGE: So you said you
recently invested in Rally,

00:26:33.806 --> 00:26:36.080
which I think you found
through AngelList.

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:40.232
I invested in a company called
Space Monkey that I saw at the

00:26:40.232 --> 00:26:41.218
launch conference.

00:26:41.218 --> 00:26:45.660
So conferences, people referring
companies to you,

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.630
AngelList, those are the
traditional ways--

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:49.480
KEVIN ROSE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:52.220
I'll be going to TechCrunch
Disrupt and doing

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.140
some judging there.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:56.402
And so I'll be checking out all
the different companies

00:26:56.402 --> 00:26:58.150
that are there.

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:03.260
Every single time I walk through
the demo halls there,

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:07.520
somebody grabs me and shows
me something cool.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:11.370
It's a very casual thing.

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:13.525
I can't tell you the number of
different channels that I've

00:27:13.525 --> 00:27:14.350
gotten, from even--

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:16.660
I have a stack of letters
over there.

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.455
I didn't even know
I had mail--

00:27:18.455 --> 00:27:18.940
DON DODGE: Paper letters?

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:19.390
KEVIN ROSE: Paper letters.

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:22.300
I had no idea that I even got
mail at Google, and then I

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:24.830
found this little fat little
thing, and there's paper

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:27.288
letters of somebody trying to
pitch their company, like

00:27:27.288 --> 00:27:29.256
different various start-ups.

00:27:29.256 --> 00:27:30.732
DON DODGE: Interesting

00:27:30.732 --> 00:27:32.810
KEVIN ROSE: It's old-school,
but it might work.

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:33.797
Who knows.

00:27:33.797 --> 00:27:35.050
DON DODGE: Interesting.

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:37.638
Well, Kevin, thank
you very much.

00:27:37.638 --> 00:27:39.506
This has been a great
conversation.

00:27:39.506 --> 00:27:42.610
And I hope we can do
it again soon.

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:42.910
KEVIN ROSE: Cool.

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:44.760
Thanks for having me.
