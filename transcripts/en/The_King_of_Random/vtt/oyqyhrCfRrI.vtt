00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.270
Hey guys welcome back, thanks for joining us today on the king of random not too long ago!

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.390
We had a video showing you how to build a flamethrower out of a used fire?

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:10.829
Extinguisher and in that video I gave a short demonstration of how to breathe fire today

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.549
I'm going to explain how to minimize the risk if you're going to try breathing fire yourself

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.479
I'm going to be demonstrating two different methods of breathing fire one is with cornstarch

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.029
and one is using lamp oil the other supplies that I have with you are a couple of dish towels one full size towel a

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.909
Gallon of water and a stick that I'm going to make into a torch

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.329
Corn starch as a powder is not nearly as flammable as the lamp oil

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.270
It's easier to use because there's not as much preparation and there's not as much danger to swallowing it or breathing it in although you

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.259
Definitely want to avoid doing both of those things now for both the lamp oil and the corn starch

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.129
We're going to need some fire that we can hold and control so the first step is to build a torch

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.480
Let's take one of our rags and cut it into thinner strips. I'm gonna cut this into about thirds

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.739
With this strip we can tie it around our stick and our torches almost done

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.599
We'll soak the cotton in lamp oil and light that and that will work as a torch that will resist going out from the wind

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:58.680
Once our torch is burning

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.359
We're going to want a way to safely put it out

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.379
So I'm going to soak this towel in water and have that near me so when I'm done breathing fire

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.169
I can just drop the torch into it and cover it with the wet towel

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.648
Water evenly distributed throughout the whole town

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.729
We go at this point once our torch is assembled. We're ready to try using the cornstarch. Here's what I'm gonna

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.659
Do I'll light the torch on fire then we'll take a scoop of cornstarch and put it in my mouth

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.159
I'll stand up and I'll blow the cornstarch out of my mouth through the flames

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.228
And I'm explaining that I'll now because once I have a mouthful of cornstarch. I won't be able to talk much here we go

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.190
Oh

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.650
Now my whole mouth is full slightly damp cornstarch from that's disgusting

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.150
Gross let's do again

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.719
It's really unpleasant, I don't like cornstarch in my mouth

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.570
But it lights on fire well enough

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.410
We have some coffee creamer leftover from try it our fire extinguisher flamethrower, so I'm gonna see if this works with coffee creamer

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.279
Horse all right, I think it wasn't quite as good of a flame as with the cornstarch

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.260
But I don't hate having it in my mouth as much because it doesn't clump up nearly as badly

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.370
And it's got like a lot of sugar taste to it so that's a plus there you go

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.709
We had pretty good results there with the cornstarch now

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:32.790
We're gonna move on to the lamp oil lamp oil which is also called liquid paraffin is a clear oil that burns fairly easily

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.609
Lamp oil is a petroleum product. That's often used for fire breathing because unlike other more refined petroleum products

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.100
It doesn't easily get absorbed into the tissues in your mouth

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.589
There's a few main things that we need to make sure we're being safe about the first is to not swallow or breathe in oil

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.380
That can be extremely harmful or fatal the others

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.579
We don't want to have this stuff dripping down our face while we're reading this stuff out because we really don't want to catch our

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.350
Face on fire it's no fun so before we go on to moving the oil we're going to do a little bit of practice

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.749
Using water when we're breathing fire with oil

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.450
we really only need a very small amount at a time only a

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.429
Tablespoon or two what we're gonna do with the water is practice to make sure we can hold it in our mouths and then spit

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.420
It out without having any urge to swallow it or breathe it in what I'm gonna

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.159
Do is put a little bit of water in my mouth and then hold my mouth shut and just practice holding it in there

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.920
Still being able to breathe in and out I'm going to pluck off the back of my throat so they're not accidentally swallowing or breathing

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.930
Where I don't want

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.339
The next thing we want to practice is how to spit the water out you don't want to spit it in a nice little stream

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.440
You actually wanted to sort of spray everywhere that'll help it atomize and really catch on fire better like this

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:55.479
You'll also may notice that when you spit it like that it starts dribbling down your face this brings us to our next safety precaution

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.190
We'll have a damp rag

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.349
and
We'll just either hold it or leave it right on our shoulder so that anytime we get any oil on our face

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:06.639
We can quickly wipe it off now that we've practiced by using water, and we have our wet rag

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.519
We're ready to start using oil and the torch alright

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.210
I'm going to put a little bit of oil in my mouth like I said before it's only one or two tablespoons

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.159
You don't need a huge mouthful

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:19.989
And if you do you'll probably end up triggering your gag reflex or almost swallowing neither of those things are good

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.560
So you use less oil at first if you think you want to build up to a little bit more at a time?

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.959
You can do that. I'll put some in my mouth

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.470
I'll set the oil container down away from where I'm going to be breathing fire

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:34.749
I'll make sure I'm holding my wet rag in one hand and the torch in the other and then I'll spin it out through the

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:35.210
flames

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.560
I'll hold the flames starting about a foot and a half away from my face

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.649
And as I breathe I'll pull a torch farther away. I don't want to get the fire too close to my body here goes

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.509
There you go, let's get a little bit more oil and try again

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.389
You can probably see that before I breathe and in between each breath on to the fire

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.280
I'm wiping my mouth off with the rag

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.930
This is just to keep any oil off in my face because I don't want to risk my face like a fire

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:30.199
Seen it happen that had a wet cloth, so he like was able to put it out quickly, but he lit his face on fire

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.770
The lamp oil has very little smell and almost no taste whatsoever

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.369
But it does still leave a very oily feeling on the inside of your mouth

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.090
It's not super pleasant, but I actually strongly prefer it to the cornstarch

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:05.479
They're having two different methods of breathing fire cornstarch and lamp oil I am NOT a big fan of the cornstarch method

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:09.258
I know it's a lot safer, but I hate the feeling of having cornstarch in my mouth

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:14.088
It just instantly gums up and sticks to your teeth and mouth and gums and lips and everything

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:17.208
It's just awful using the oil is its own sensation

00:07:17.209 --> 00:07:20.119
It does make the inside of your mouth feel very oily of course

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:21.379
It doesn't have any flavor

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:26.928
But it's still a little bit odd to have it in there the oil of course is much more dangerous to use you need to

00:07:26.929 --> 00:07:29.208
Make sure you don't leave it in you need to make sure you don't swallow it

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:34.368
Always practice with water to make sure you can easily hold the liquid in your mouth without accidentally breathing in or swallowing

00:07:34.369 --> 00:07:40.428
I've also found that it really helps if you're holding the liquid in your mouth to keep your face pointed down so if you do

00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:46.849
accidentally start to breathe or swallow it doesn't immediately go down the lung - if you're trying to fire breathing make sure you have the

00:07:46.849 --> 00:07:50.509
Right safety equipment be sure you've got a wet towel and wet washcloth standing by

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.469
Put out your torch or anything that you might light on fire that you don't want to be on fire

00:07:54.739 --> 00:07:57.679
Fire breathing is a pretty cool trick and be learned in just a few minutes time

00:07:57.679 --> 00:08:03.109
I hope I don't need to say this but never try and use anything more flammable than lamp oil don't use lighter fluid

00:08:03.449 --> 00:08:11.239
Definitely don't use gasoline because that's explosive when it lights because you could really really badly hurt yourself even with the lamp oil you

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.580
to be absolutely sure you take precautions

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.120
Not get it on yourself if you ever get any on your clothes

00:08:16.699 --> 00:08:21.129
Stop change clothes immediately. You can get it on your face use your wet rag

00:08:21.229 --> 00:08:26.559
Wipe it all off so your face can't catch on fire. It's your face. You don't want your face to be on fire

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.919
Thanks for joining us in this video today, and we look forward to the next one talk to you then

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.220
Like having a mouth full of what?

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.580
Yeah, now it's drag

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.289
