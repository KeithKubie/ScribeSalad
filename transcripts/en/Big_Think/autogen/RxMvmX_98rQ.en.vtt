acting instead of holding back that's
 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.090

you are building more confidence so

you are building more confidence so
you're building and replenishing your

because you're having these experiences
 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.430
because you're having these experiences
that are are necessary some failures

that are are necessary some failures

necessary and then the ability to
 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.180
necessary and then the ability to
recover from failures necessary but we

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190
recover from failures necessary but we
 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.980

never never I learned the ability to

have grit and determination unless we're
 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.110
have grit and determination unless we're
recovering from failure so really when

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120
recovering from failure so really when
 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.650
recovering from failure so really when
when in doubt act
