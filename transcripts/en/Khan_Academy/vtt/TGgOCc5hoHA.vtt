00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.330
We're asked to determine
a function of the form y

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:11.150
equals a sine of bx or y
is equal to a cosine bx

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.160
represented by the graph below.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.400
So we need to figure out
maybe what the a's are,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.816
what the b's are,
and whether this

00:00:17.816 --> 00:00:19.720
is a sine or a cosine function.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.420
So let's see what
clues there are.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.240
So the first thing
that I notice is

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.260
that whatever this function
is, when x is equal to 0,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.080
it does not equal 0.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.440
It is equal to negative 2.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.410
So based on that,
based on what we

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.240
know about sine and
cosine functions,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.590
do you think that this is
going to be of the form y

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.030
is equal to a sine
of bx or of the form

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.314
y is equal to a cosine of bx?

00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:49.230
Without even knowing
what the a's and b's are,

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.460
do you think this is going to
be a sine function or cosine

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.720
function?

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.470
Well, let's think about
what sine of 0 is.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.700
If you take sine
of 0, we already

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.489
know that that is equal to 0.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.490
What is cosine of 0?

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.020
Cosine of 0 is equal to 1.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.260
So it would be very hard--
and especially in this form,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.400
it would be impossible--
if sine of 0

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.510
is 0, to multiply 0 by
something to get to negative 2.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.580
So it can't be a sine
function of this form.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.920
You might say, well,
the cosine of 0 is 1.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.310
But here, it's negative 2.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.030
But at least if
you have a 1, you

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.140
can then multiply
it by something

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.000
to get to a negative 2.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.280
So what we now know is that
we are at least of this form.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.459
But now we have to figure
out what the a's and b's

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:43.500
are going to be equal to.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:53.490
We know that this function is
y is equal to a cosine of bx.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:05.100
So the next question I ask
you is what is a going to be.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.870
Well, let's think about it.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.600
We already saw if we
just had cosine of bx,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.620
when x is equal to 0,
cosine of b times 0

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.280
would just be cosine of 0.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.910
And it would get us to 1.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:19.750
But we're not 1.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.850
We're at negative 2.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.940
It looks like [? it ?]
took a cosine function,

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.830
and at least, when
x is equal to 0,

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.570
we multiplied it by negative 2.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.290
So this should be negative 2.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.590
So now we have a little
bit more filled in

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.740
of what we actually have.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:45.440
We know that it's y is equal
to negative 2 cosine of bx.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.500
And this gels with what we see
right over here, the amplitude

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.440
here.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.760
You see that the difference
between the maximum value

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.968
and the minimum value, or
the minimum and the maximum

00:02:53.968 --> 00:02:56.684
is 4, 1/2 of that is 2.

00:02:56.684 --> 00:02:58.100
Or another way you
think about it,

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.140
we're varying 2 from
this center point.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.202
And over here, if you
think about the amplitude--

00:03:03.202 --> 00:03:04.660
the amplitude is
the absolute value

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.430
of this number right over here.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.000
The amplitude is equal
to the absolute value

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.090
of this negative 2,
which is indeed equal 2.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.660
So it's consistent so far.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.510
Now let's think
about what b here is.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.340
And maybe we can
use our knowledge

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.290
of what the period of
a periodic function

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.496
is to think about
what b might be.

00:03:28.496 --> 00:03:29.620
Well, let's look over here.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.230
What is the period of
this periodic function?

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.120
Well, let's draw one period.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.459
So if we use this as our
starting point-- or one cycle,

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:43.000
I should say.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.980
Let's draw one cycle.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.310
If you view that as our
starting point, at 2 pi over 3,

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.430
we have completed that cycle.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.170
And then we could
start the next cycle.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.870
We repeat the
pattern over again.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.840
Then you start the next cycle.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.112
So based on that,
what is the period?

00:03:59.112 --> 00:04:00.570
Well, it's the
length that you need

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.120
to go in x to
complete one cycle.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.100
So that length right over
there, you see, is 2 pi over 3.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.850
So the period is 2 pi over 3.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.260
And given that the period
here is 2 pi over 3,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.420
can you figure out
what b is going to be?

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.236
Well, the period
of this is going

00:04:25.236 --> 00:04:34.560
to be equal to 2 pi over
the absolute value of b.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.700
And you can solve
this multiple ways.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.270
You can multiply both sides by
3 and the absolute value of b.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.650
And you would be left
with the absolute value

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:50.400
of b is equal to 3,
which means that b could

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.200
be equal to positive
or negative 3.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.780
And so you might say,
well, Sal, what do I use?

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.176
Does b equal positive
3 or negative 3?

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:02.550
And so the next
question I'll ask

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.880
you is, for a
cosine function, do

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.900
you get different
values if you were

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:24.980
to make this a cosine of 3x
or a cosine of negative 3x?

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.144
Do you get different values?

00:05:28.144 --> 00:05:30.310
Well, if you play with the
unit circle a little bit.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.600
So I'm going to draw
a little rough unit

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.200
circle right over here.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.870
Remember, cosine
is the x-coordinate

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.600
where we intersect
the unit circle.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.990
And if we go in the
positive angle direction,

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.787
if we go in that direction, our
x-coordinate-- it starts at 1,

00:05:47.787 --> 00:05:49.370
and then it gets a
little bit shorter.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.494
If we go in the negative
direction, it starts at 1,

00:05:51.494 --> 00:05:53.380
and then it gets a
little bit shorter.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.480
And so you can experiment
this with a good bit.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.080
But you'll see
that cosine of 3x--

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.650
and this is only
the case for cosine,

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:05.710
not for sine-- cosine of 3x is
equal to cosine of negative 3x.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.700
So you can actually pick either
positive 3 or negative 3.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.930
But for simplicity in
this case right over here,

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.010
I'll just go with
the positive 3.

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.920
So this could be the
graph of-- and now we

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.690
get our drum roll-- y is
equal to negative 2 times

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.020
the cosine of-- I said I
wouldn't do the negative--

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.190
the cosine of positive 3x.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.077
And we are done.
