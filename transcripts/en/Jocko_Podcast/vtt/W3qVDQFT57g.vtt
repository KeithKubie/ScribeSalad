1
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:02.400
Yeah,

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.420
<v 1>10 years,</v>

3
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.370
10 years.
He's a long time,

4
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:12.750
a decade.

5
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.380
And in many ways it seems so far in the past

6
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.650
in some ways.

7
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.480
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.700
<v 1>It doesn't seems so far away at all.</v>

9
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.200
It isn't hard to remember being deployed in Ramadi,

10
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:39.840
Iraq in the summer of 2006

11
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.343
<v 0>okay.</v>

12
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.310
<v 1>And yes,
sometimes that seems like a distant place,</v>

13
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.050
a long time ago,
Britain,
yet.

14
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.023
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.050
<v 1>Sometimes it feels like we were just there yesterday.</v>

16
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.130
The sweltering heat,
the dust,
the danger,

17
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.320
the crystal clear focus on our mission when we had,

18
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.860
but one purpose in our lives to close with and destroy an evil enemy bent on

19
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:15.600
destroying us and our way of life.

20
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.790
And it doesn't take much

21
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.910
for the mind to return there,
to regain that mindset,

22
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.420
to get into the combat mode.

23
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.333
And remember,

24
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.770
remember the operations out in the city,

25
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.170
remember the tracer rounds in the night sky explosions,

26
00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:46.340
shaking the earth,

27
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.020
the weight of body armor and weapons and gear on our shoulders.

28
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.600
Remember the stress and the violence and the sweat and the blood.

29
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.110
And remember the eval,

30
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.190
the pure evil that infected the city and committed savage,

31
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.940
vile.
And disgusting acts of mortal sin.

32
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:14.150
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

33
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.160
<v 1>Murder,
rape,</v>

34
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:17.140
<v 0>okay.</v>

35
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.973
<v 1>And torture</v>

36
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.890
and inside that dark world.

37
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.220
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

38
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.520
<v 1>Homeworld world ripped apart by war or world war.</v>

39
00:02:27.521 --> 00:02:31.060
Sometimes humanity seemed all but lost.

40
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.623
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

41
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.790
<v 1>That is where we got to see and experience the polar opposite,</v>

42
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.400
the counter to all that darkness.

43
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.890
Against that backdrop of evil.

44
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.540
We young men.

45
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.200
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

46
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.490
<v 1>we band of brothers.</v>

47
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.640
We got to witness light and life and love so strong that it makes the darkness

48
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:04.780
feed and makes the evil cower and hide it's wretched face.

49
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.990
Evil bows down when it sees the bond we developed with the soldiers and marines,

50
00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:13.430
we fought alongside

51
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.770
evil cannot contest the bond

52
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.370
we formed with our brothers seals

53
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.050
with whom we become so close that there is no stronger force in the world.

54
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:34.210
Nothing more powerful,
nothing more meaningful than knowing that these men,

55
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.620
these frog men,

56
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.850
that we would do anything for each other.

57
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.440
We saw powerful acts of heroism and courage on an almost daily basis,

58
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.200
which reassured us solemnly that good would triumph over evil.

59
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.800
And amongst all that glory,

60
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.060
there were a few men,
the true heroes,

61
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.270
the ones that rose above the rest of us to symbolize and personify courage and

62
00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:17.350
faith at selflessness and love.

63
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.880
Mark Allen Lee was one of those rare men,

64
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.570
one of those heroes,

65
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.210
one of the few men in my life that I literally described as a sinked.

66
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.280
That is who mark was a mighty warrior who's ferocity and combat was perfectly

67
00:04:47.601 --> 00:04:51.410
balanced by faith and humor and compassion.

68
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.340
The man that left his mark on everyone that he met,

69
00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.490
a mark of happiness and positivity and of humility and of joy.

70
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
A man whose love for his family and friends were so unbounded.

71
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.870
It's so limitless

72
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.060
that you could actually feel it emanating from his heart.

73
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:24.543
<v 0>Okay.</v>

74
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.263
<v 1>And now</v>

75
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.680
he has left his mark on the world.

76
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.133
Mark Lee.

77
00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:37.723
<v 0>Okay.</v>

78
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.050
<v 1>Mark Allen Lee,</v>

79
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.580
when faced with fear,
who else could bring a smile

80
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.830
when faced with sadness?

81
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.790
<v 0>Okay,</v>

82
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.350
<v 1>who else could bring laughter</v>

83
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.730
when faced with heat?

84
00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.620
Who else could bring love

85
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.650
and when faced with death,
who else could stand and say,

86
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.350
take me Lord,
not my brothers.

87
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.510
I will be their shield now from def.
Take me.

88
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.000
Hey,
let them live on.

89
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.340
And that is what mark did

90
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.310
full of youth and energy and courage and humor

91
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.540
and full of love.

92
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.043
He stood,

93
00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.910
he stood against evil and he stood against death and he gave his life

94
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.170
for his brothers.

95
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.050
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

96
00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.720
<v 1>And for our freedom</v>

97
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.060
on August 2nd

98
00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:05.453
<v 0>yeah.</v>

99
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:10.360
<v 1>2006
in all Ramadi,
Iraq,</v>

100
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.890
10 years ago.

101
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.013
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

102
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.970
<v 1>10 years ago.</v>

103
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.180
And in those 10 years,

104
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.770
<v 0>okay.</v>

105
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.980
<v 1>Think of all that has happened in our lives.</v>

106
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.980
Big events like marriages,
children born birthdays,

107
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.310
new houses,
new jobs,
new careers

108
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:50.470
in small events.
Uh,
morning,

109
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.580
surf session

110
00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:57.040
launch with your buddies at weekend in the mountains.

111
00:07:58.330 --> 00:07:58.620
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

112
00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.640
<v 1>A cold ice tea on a hot summer's Day.</v>

113
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.730
Smile
or laugh,

114
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:16.010
life,
joy,

115
00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:20.550
happiness.

116
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.480
And every moment of that happiness is a gift.

117
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.230
A gift,

118
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:42.700
a gift given to us by mark who sacrificed everything for us.

119
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:45.730
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

120
00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.820
<v 1>Who gave up his own precious smile.</v>

121
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:50.550
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

122
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.770
<v 1>So we could all have ours.</v>

123
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:56.971
Now.

124
00:08:56.971 --> 00:09:01.971
I can tell you without a shred of doubt that on this day today,

125
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.970
mark would not want tears.
He would not want sadness,

126
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.950
he would not want sorrow.

127
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:16.970
He would want smiles and laughter and joy because that was his gift to us.

128
00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.030
Every smile,
every laugh,

129
00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:30.660
every ounce of life and love is all a gift

130
00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:37.980
from a warrior,
a friend,

131
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.350
a comedian,
a son,

132
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:47.850
a brother
I hero,

133
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:52.883
<v 0>saint.</v>

134
00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:03.790
<v 1>And what do we owe mark</v>

135
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:08.620
for mark?

136
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:10.190
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

137
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:15.190
<v 1>Each and every one of us must relish the gift that he gave to us and cherish</v>

138
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:17.540
each and every day.

139
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:18.860
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

140
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:23.860
<v 1>While remembering the incredible man that gave us this gift</v>

141
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:28.620
<v 0>of life</v>

142
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:36.833
<v 1>and too,</v>

143
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:38.240
<v 0>okay,</v>

144
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:42.720
<v 1>the seals
that are listening,</v>

145
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:44.900
the frog,
man,

146
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:51.250
you owe mark what we owe all of our fallen brothers the grave commitment to

147
00:10:52.611 --> 00:10:53.750
carry the fire.

148
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.820
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

149
00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.670
<v 1>To hold the torch and hold it high,</v>

150
00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.210
to take the fight to the enemy.

151
00:11:01.211 --> 00:11:05.590
Every chance you get without mercy and without remorse

152
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:10.680
until they are vanquished

153
00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:14.710
and there is peace.

154
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:26.450
Thank you mark.
We will never forget you.

155
00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:33.050
God bless Mark's family.
God bless the teams.

156
00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.240
God bless America,

157
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:39.830
and God bless Mark Allen Lee.
