00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.640
take this opportunity you know let's see
where this might end up and what I have

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650
where this might end up and what I have
 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.340
where this might end up and what I have
discovered through this whole process is

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350
