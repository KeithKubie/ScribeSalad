00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In this problem, we're considering droplets of water that have a mass of 1 gram here,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and they're falling a distance of 1.5 m.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
When we measured their final speed, we found that they were going at 4 m/s,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
which is less than we expect. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now we have to figure out how much work was done by air resistance

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
in order to slow down this 1 g drop of water to 4 m/s.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The first thing we know is that the total work done on the drop of water

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
must be equal to its change in kinetic energy.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That's just the work-energy theorem. What's the total work equal to?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Well, it's just equal to the work done by gravity minus the work done by friction.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We know that the work done by gravity is just equal to 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
the force of gravity times the distance it acts over,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and we also know that the change in kinetic energy is just equal to

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
the final kinetic energy minus the original kinetic energy.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Since the drops starts at rest, we know that they have no original kinetic energy.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
This term we can cross out.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Now we can plug in mg for the force of gravity,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and we can use 1/2 mv final squared for the final kinetic energy.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Solving for the work done by friction, I get this equation here.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Finally, when I plug in all my numbers here,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I get that the work done by friction on a single drop of water has to be equal to 0.007 J.                                     Good job.
