00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.420
The Poincare's Conjecture is what I'd like to talk about and it is one of

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.210
seven kind of maths

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.880
questions, maths problems which were picked by the clay institute in well in the year 2000 as kind of the the

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.959
biggest outstanding problems in maths the kind of Real Massive unanswered questions.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.910
And they they picked a list of seven things and for each one. There is a million-dollar prize

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.020
That they literally have that money waiting for people and of these seven problems only one of them so far has been solved.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.120
And it was the poincare conjecture

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.100
So the poincare conjecture which was put up by poincare and

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.940
I forget around the turn of the last century around 1900 was a particular

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.468
conjecture as a guess and we were and he claimed that there were these certain relationships between

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.759
Geometry and Topology so I can try and explain a little bit about what the poincare conjecture is

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:57.269
It's from an area of math called Topology which is to do with kind of shape and how things fit together in space.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.949
And but it's essentially about

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.938
Spheres, so a common idea in topology is the idea of deforming things, so I've got here a cube.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.960
Which is made out of dough and in topology we can sort of

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.299
kind of move things around a little bit.

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.449
It's sometimes called rubber sheet geometry so I could take this Cube.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.089
And I could kind of mess around with it.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.110
And I could round it off like that using my hands and I can get a sphere

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.880
pretty much near enough.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.210
So that's that the sphere the theory is that you're allowed to squash things stretch things

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:31.979
And all that kind of thing

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.559
But you're not allowed to punch holes in things you're not allowed to make a hole and you're not allowed to close up a hole

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.220
So because of this the  number of holes that something has is very important, so this sphere has zero holes

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.949
I guess you could also have something like this donut

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.750
Which has exactly one hole in it?

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.180
And you can't get from a sphere to a donut

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.540
by deforming it without kind of closing up this hole or by cutting it here and straightening it out and

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.729
Squashing that sausage into a sphere

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.489
And you're not allowed to cut and you're not allowed to stick so

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.599
the kind of things that are different from each other spheres are different from

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.440
Donuts which are different again from like a pretzel with two holes in it or something with three holes in it or or

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.470
Any number of holes this is the kind of maths that I studied at university for a very long time and did some very difficult?

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:27.209
Maths So on Poincare was a French mathematician who posed this conjecture he suggested that if you have an object which

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.598
Doesn't have any holes in it so first condition no holes

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.110
Second condition is that it is kind of small

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.880
It's not it doesn't go on forever in any direction, so it's it's kind of finite

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.309
You could maybe put it in a box and close the lid then

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.149
It's a sphere or at least it can be made into a sphere and in two dimension while in three dimensions

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.230
Which is where we live this seems like a fairly sensible statement, but poincare a suggested that this would hold in any number of dimensions

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.190
So you can take this is a three-dimensional sphere

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.410
But you could have a two-dimensional sphere would be a circle you can also go up and have a four-dimensional sphere which

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.789
You'd have to pretty much imagine, but it's it's sort of a sphere with an extra dimension

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.190
it's it's got a fixed radius in this one has a fixed radius in three different directions, but the

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.489
Four-Dimensional sphere has another direction in which it's still this size and any number of dimensions above that

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.130
And then you know it's it's counterproductive to try and imagine those things because it really does hurt your brain

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.540
but this conjecture

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.040
Exists as a mathematical statement, and he posed this in the 1900s

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:40.049
but didn't have a proof for it and the the actual proof of this took quite a long time, so the

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.730
1960s and 70s

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.630
Lots of Topology was happening what people were developing new tools for doing topology and they managed to prove

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.119
During that time the case of five dimensions and above, but there was still

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.089
four dimensional spheres to think about

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.540
And this was sort of still unsolved and lots of people had a go at this and it turns out it took different

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:10.559
approaches I guess to solve this particular thing so in the 1980s there was some work done and a

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.759
Completely separate conjecture was made by a guy called William Thurston

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.639
Which was about kind of four dimensional things and shapes and it turned out that that was quite closely related to it?

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:26.788
But that wasn't proved either and it took until I think 2003 at which point a mysterious

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:33.448
cumin appeared on the internet which had proof of Thurston's conjecture which also proved

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:40.979
The poincare conjecture for this unknown four dimensional case and it was very exciting everyone was sort of scrambling to try and try and find

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.099
Whether this was a real proof or not because the poincare conjecture having been around for so long

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:54.749
Was one of the most falsely proved results in the history of maths like it's had more wrong proof attempts than any other

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.870
Statement which is brilliant because it means people are trying really hard to solve. It actually this is one of the nice things about the

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.599
I'm thinking the nice things about the this archive that instantly got his work

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.240
Spread to everybody I guess in the old days

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.340
Maybe these things would be sent out as preprints which of course I remember those old days well

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:19.139
But I don't know if he would have had the resources to spread it would have taken a lot longer for people to realize that

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:24.778
That this stuff was out there the mathematical community dived on this paper and checked it and verified that

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:27.028
It was in fact a proof of what it claimed to me

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:30.689
And it was but I remember when Ben chow said this is amazing stuff

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:36.838
We're gonna now have a seminar and we met several hours a week, and we're going to study this and each chapter

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:38.969
This was it was about a seven or eight

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.719
chapter

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:43.259
Paper, we're each assigned to chapter

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:47.369
but it turned out that to understand a chapter took huge amounts of work, the

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:51.629
Mathematician that had put this paper up was called grigori perelman. He was from Russia

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:56.579
And he was awarded a fields medal. Which is like maths equivalent of a nobel prize

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.569
He was also

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:04.139
Of course awarded the the millennium prize of a million dollars and he for various reasons

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:07.109
I guess declined both of those things he didn't necessarily

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.299
Want them the fact that he did made an absolutely huge media storm everyone was interested Suddenly

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.229
And he he could have had any job anywhere in the world after he did this

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:20.009
But he didn't want to take it, and he's a bit of a you know

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:24.088
He wear his hair is funny, and he lives with his mother and sent Petersburg or something

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:29.219
I've actually never met him mathematician that solves difficult question wasn't news

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:34.769
But mathematician that solved difficult question and doesn't want a million dollars was suddenly huge news for about a year after

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.289
After he put these papers out

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:40.109
I remember was november of 2002 because I remember I

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.759
With a bunch of people who were really into RicCi flow in San Diego and those papers came out

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:50.318
And we instantly just focused on trying to understand those those those papers

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:54.129
And they're very very difficult about the for the year after that Pearlman

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.349
Did sort of a world tour I know some friends in Berlin he came to visit them?

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:04.720
Near Berlin he came to mit and gave some talks, and he did a bit of a tour

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.999
And if I wasn't busy teaching and didn't just didn't have the time to really

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:14.919
Well, maybe I should have done it, but any I didn't go to see him at any of these talks

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:22.060
if we knew that he was going to just immediately let's say after a year go back and go back into

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:26.799
Staying away from from publicity it would be fun to meet him. I guess I've simplified

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.960
It here and is a little bit more complicated to define specifically what I mean by each of these things

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.489
But hopefully that gives you a rough idea of the kind of maths that it's talking about

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.190
there are a lot more kind of

00:07:39.319 --> 00:07:39.889
difficult

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:46.629
blackboards full of squiggly numbers you know there are different ways of doing math one way you can take some big problem like that and

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:51.909
Say, I'm going to do just focus on that the danger of that is you don't you don't solve it and then?

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:57.940
You know that's not so good or you can look at many many different problems. I like to look at many different problems

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:04.989
I'm not focusing on one particular one, but he would take that problem in fact from what I understand from friends who knew him

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:11.080
He announced at some point. I forget exactly when many years before he actually came out with these papers

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.300
I'm Gonna use ritchie flow to try to

00:08:14.539 --> 00:08:20.169
Solve to try to solve the poincare Conjecture, and he just without I don't know if he was doing any teaching at the time

00:08:20.389 --> 00:08:23.288
But living in St.. Petersburg, and then he did it

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:29.349
If you haven't seen it already we've got a video about Ricci flow and RicCi flow

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:35.530
Surgery which is kind of like the Golden bullet that helped them solve the poincare conjecture if you haven't seen them yet

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:39.249
Maybe go and have a look I'll have links everywhere in all the usual places

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:43.929
We've also got a video about another one of the millennium problems the Riemann hypothesis

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:47.410
So maybe you could go and watch that video that one hasn't been solved yet

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:50.379
So there's a million dollars there for you if you can crack it
