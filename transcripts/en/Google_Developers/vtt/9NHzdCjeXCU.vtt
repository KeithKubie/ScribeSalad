ANDREW PEARSON: Windsor Circle
is a retention automation

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.320
platform for retailers.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.700
We basically help
retailers get more

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.510
from their existing customers.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.840
We do this through
big data integrations,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.880
through retention analytics, and
then by powering abandoned cart

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.634
recovery, and retention
marketing campaigns

00:00:23.634 --> 00:00:26.050
to help them get more value
from their existing customers.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.754
One of the real
problems that we aimed

00:00:31.754 --> 00:00:33.170
to solve in the
very beginning was

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.150
helping marketers get access to
all this amazing data they have

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.660
about their customers,
products purchased, and so on.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.840
And we thought that
once given the data,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.650
marketers can do
incredible things with it.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.030
Well, it turns out that many
marketers are incredibly busy,

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.510
some of this is new to them.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.500
And so it was a really
important moment in our company

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.570
to realize that we actually
should wrap around the services

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.970
layer to make sure that
we provided best practice

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.019
coaching, and delivered some
of that extra value of helping

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.711
them to actually use that data,
and teach them how to do it.

00:01:08.711 --> 00:01:11.210
BRAD MCGINITY: The first version
of Windsor Circle's pricing

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.740
model was one where
we just guessed.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.550
We started at a thousand
dollars a month,

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.050
and if we thought
somebody might pay more,

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.080
we quoted them higher.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.850
And if we thought they would
pay less, we quoted them lower.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.690
From there, we were able to
then understand the return

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.780
on investment we were
generating for customers,

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.920
and really standardized that
into a formula where we've now

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.980
been able to ensure
that everybody

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.660
gets a great return
on investment.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.410
And smaller customers pay us
less than we started with,

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.650
and larger customers
pay us more.
