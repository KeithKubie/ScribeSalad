Ever since <i>Frozen</i> came out
and blew kids' (bleep) minds

00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:06.039
with its
catchier-than-cooties music,

00:00:06.073 --> 00:00:08.742
adults have been speculating
about Queen Elsa's sexuality.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:10.811
-Of course they have. Uh...
-(laughter)

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:12.813
Of course they have.
I think some adults

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:14.815
have been speculating
<i>really hard.</i>

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:17.117
-(laughter)
-I mean, you know, she's not...

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.452
if you look at... you know,

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:20.087
she's not interested
in male suitors,

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.822
she sings about keeping
her emotions hidden,

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:23.857
she's <i>super</i> into construction...

00:00:23.891 --> 00:00:25.359
-uh...
-(laughter)

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:27.694
So for <i>Frozen 2,</i> fans want
Disney to give Queen Elsa

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:29.363
a lady love to go with it.

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:31.198
Uh, the #GiveElsaAGirlfriend
movement

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:32.866
was started
by a 17-year-old blogger,

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.802
and even the voice of Elsa,
Adele Dazeem, chimed in...

00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:37.905
-(laughter)
-with her support.

00:00:37.938 --> 00:00:39.940
So it looks like <i>Frozen 2</i>

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:42.709
could be a charming lesbian
love story-- though no word

00:00:42.743 --> 00:00:45.145
who will voice the couple's
matching French bulldogs.

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:47.915
-(laughter, applause)
-Comedians...

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:50.117
since...

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.387
#GiveElsaAGirlfriend
is going so well, uh...

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.389
And I think
it's a (bleep) awesome idea

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:56.957
which they should totally do.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.392
Why wouldn't they?

00:00:58.425 --> 00:01:01.295
Um, I would like you to come up
with another fictional character

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:03.764
and update them.
Jessica.

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:07.835
Um, #SisterWives2
GastonAndThemTriplets.

00:01:07.868 --> 00:01:11.471
-All right, points. All right.
-(cheering, applause)

00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:13.040
Rhys Darby.

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.341
S...

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:15.342
(laughter)

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:16.543
Someone...

00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:17.778
Ha-Hashtag...

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:18.912
(laughter)

00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:22.549
#SomeoneCallAnUber
ForBilboBaggins.

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:22.649
(laughter, applause)
