1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,700
One of the striking features of human
female reproduction is menstruation.

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,520
It's uncomfortable.
It's sometimes painful.

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,420
Why did it evolve?
There are four hypotheses.

4
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:20,421
One is that the evolve to
eliminate parasites introduced
with copulation evolve

5
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:22,560
to save energy.

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,370
Yeah.

7
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:28,630
Or it may have evolved to protect the
uterus from inflammation or is a byproduct

8
00:00:28,631 --> 00:00:29,860
of maternal fetal conflict.

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:33,390
Yeah.

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,500
Here are those major hypotheses sketched
out on a bit more detail and I'd like

11
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:38,940
to make a few comments about them.

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,800
The first one is the menstruation
evolved to get rid of pathogens that were

13
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:51,321
brought in with a sperm and so the
claim is that is protecting the uterus

14
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:53,610
against colonization by pathogens.

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,480
The problem is that menstruation occurs
weeks after copulation and this problem

16
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:04,390
of having sperm borne pathogens is
not unique to species. That ministry,

17
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,590
there are many species that
don't menstruate that would
have the same problem.

18
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,740
The second idea is that
menstruating conserves energy
and the administration and

19
00:01:14,811 --> 00:01:19,040
resorption is energetically less costly
than maintaining a differentiated

20
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,590
endometrium.
However,

21
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:25,820
maintaining a differentiated
differentiated endometrium
is not the alternative

22
00:01:25,821 --> 00:01:26,900
and other species.

23
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,390
It also would not allow for Avi Elation
or sperm transport or sperm capacitation.

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,310
So a third hypothesis is that
menstruation is actually not adaptive.

25
00:01:40,311 --> 00:01:43,340
It is a consequence of
spontaneous decidual lization.

26
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:47,900
So the real issue then becomes spontaneous
decision realization and we'll go

27
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:50,720
into that in a minute to
explain exactly what that is.

28
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:56,060
Now that is consistent with known con
known consequences if does of decidual

29
00:01:56,061 --> 00:01:58,370
lization and uh,

30
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:04,040
in the paper we're allying all on this
is the argument that the authors were

31
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:04,874
making.

32
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:10,570
So the problem then is to explain why
decidual ization became spontaneous.

33
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:17,730
A fourth possibility is that the uterus
is being preconditioned by menstruation

34
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,460
and that is protecting uterine tissues
from hyper inflammation and from

35
00:02:22,461 --> 00:02:27,461
oxidative stress that are associated
with deep placentation in humans with the

36
00:02:27,621 --> 00:02:30,170
deep,
deep invasiveness of plantation.

37
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:31,560
Okay.

38
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,090
So this claim ignores why ministration
may have evolved in ancestral primate

39
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:41,091
species and administrating non primates
that don't have the deep invasion.

40
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,640
Yeah.

41
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,930
And it may ignore the benefits that
spontaneous decision realization might

42
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:47,381
provide.

43
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:51,820
So what we're going to do is we're going
to really focus on spontaneous decidual

44
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:52,654
ization

45
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,340
okay.

46
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,920
First a bit of a refresher
on the human menstrual cycle.

47
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,300
It has a follicular phase
and the luteal in the ovary.

48
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,430
During the follicular phase, the
follicles mature. During the luteal phase,

49
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:08,710
the Corpus luteum is
secreting progesterone.

50
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,780
What that does in the uterus is
that in the proliferative phase,

51
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:17,650
the superficial endometrium is
shed and flip operation begins.

52
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,350
Then in the luteal phase,

53
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,860
that's the secretory phase where the
endometrium continues to deliver to

54
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:25,480
differentiate and proliferate.

55
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,610
The hormone levels in the follicular phase
are dominated by estrodial all and in

56
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:34,560
the luteal phase by progesterone,

57
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,530
menstruation starts on day one.
So that's the follicular phase.

58
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,950
[inaudible] occurs on day 14.

59
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,940
And then decision realization begins.

60
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,960
So decidual ization is the transformation
of the endometrium stimulated by

61
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:59,601
progesterone under maternal control to
prepare it to receive the implanting

62
00:03:59,641 --> 00:04:03,540
embryo when for gesture
or own is withdrawn.

63
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,520
The differentiated endometrial stromal
cells undergo apoptosis and that leads to

64
00:04:08,521 --> 00:04:09,354
menstruation.

65
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:17,820
We know that ministration
evolved three times.

66
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,030
It's indicated here in red,

67
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,123
and

68
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,600
that includes the primates over here,
some bats,

69
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,940
and interestingly the elephant shrews.

70
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:36,750
So other things that ministry include
chimpanzees and givens and uh,

71
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,660
orangutans and mechanics
and some of the monkeys,

72
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,010
as well as several bats.
And the elephant. Shrew.

73
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,830
What features do these organisms share?

74
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,670
They all have spontaneous
decision realization.

75
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,230
They have invasive Hema
Correale presentation.

76
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,200
They have extended meeting periods.
They have spontaneous ovulation.

77
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:15,280
That means Oblation,
which is not induced by meeting itself.

78
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:16,790
Okay.

79
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,000
And they have one or two
well-developed offspring per pregnancy.

80
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:22,580
So they have a few,

81
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,270
we'll develop relatively
large offspring per pregnancy.

82
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,520
So the three groups in
which menstruation occurs,

83
00:05:31,521 --> 00:05:36,260
all have hemo Correale Placentas,
menstruation is here in red.

84
00:05:36,261 --> 00:05:40,090
So here is, uh, the elephant shrew.

85
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,990
You are humans and here are
the free tail vats. Okay.

86
00:05:44,991 --> 00:05:49,070
So they all have hemo Correale placentas,
highly invasive placentas.

87
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,083
Okay.

88
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,780
The real issue appears to be
spontaneous decision realization.

89
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,240
So in mammals that don't menstruate,

90
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:02,260
decidual [inaudible] occurs when the
embryo implants in mammals that men's

91
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:05,480
straight decidual lization is spontaneous.

92
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:09,920
That means that it's under maternal
control and it occurs independently of the

93
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:12,950
presence of an embryo.
So why did it evolve?

94
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:14,630
Yeah.

95
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:14,811
Well,

96
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:18,950
one hypothesis is that it's a maternal
response that protects the mother from

97
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:20,090
the invasive embryo.

98
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,700
Another hypothesis is
that it's a mechanism that
allows the mother to discard

99
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:29,000
defective embryos.
These are not mutually exclusive.

100
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,610
So if you have spontaneous decision
realization administration,

101
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:39,130
it is one way of flushing a defective
embryo out of the female reproductive

102
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:40,064
tract.

103
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:41,660
Yeah.

104
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,660
We know that there are other features
of quality control built into the female

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,010
reproductive tract. There is a treasure
and they're spontaneous abortions.

106
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,793
Yeah.

107
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,070
Oh, city Katriza starts about the third
month of pregnancy. At that point,

108
00:06:58,071 --> 00:07:03,050
there are about 7 million oh sites
in the newly formed ovaries by birth.

109
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:06,650
There are about a million
by men are about a thousand.

110
00:07:06,651 --> 00:07:09,590
And by menopause they're nearly none left.

111
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:15,460
So a Trecia does seem to target both
nuclear and mitochondrial mutations and it

112
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:20,741
appears that there's at least a tendency
for the damaged eggs to be eliminated

113
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,990
and the less damaged eggs to be kept.

114
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:25,800
Yeah.

115
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,800
Spontaneous abortions or miscarriages
are relatively frequent estimates of the

116
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:35,310
proportion of pregnancies that ended in
early unrecognized abortion range from

117
00:07:35,311 --> 00:07:40,020
30 to 75% clinically
recognized pregnancies,

118
00:07:40,021 --> 00:07:43,830
character, uh, miscarry, and
about 10 to 20% of cases,

119
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:46,470
most of which have
chromosomal abnormalities.

120
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,640
About 70% of gestations diagnosed with
ultrasound is twins are singletons when

121
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:57,720
they are delivered.
So in all of these cases,

122
00:07:57,721 --> 00:08:02,721
there is some kind of selections it's
going on in the reproductive tract.

123
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:03,870
Prior to birth,

124
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:09,060
spontaneous abortion may function to
both eliminate defective embryos and to

125
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:13,890
reduce the reproductive cost of twins.
So to summarize,

126
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,980
ministration evolved at
least three times in mammals,

127
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,950
always in lineages that
have invasive placentation,

128
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,720
it appears to be a byproduct of
adaptations to protect the mother in fetal

129
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:25,860
maternal conflict.

130
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,760
It may also have evolved as
a quality control mechanism,

131
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,400
and the key mechanism is decidual
lization that is spontaneous rather than

132
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,390
triggered by meeting.
