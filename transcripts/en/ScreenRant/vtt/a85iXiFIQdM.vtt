00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:12.630
Most movies are not ambiguous narratives but
instead easily understood with their comprehensible

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.630
chronology.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.090
However, not all movies are created equal
and whether it be through alternative dimensions,

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.200
time travel mishaps or just lazy storytelling,
there are still plenty of films that leave

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.270
audiences bewildered by the start of the closing
credits.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:32.199
Here are 10 Famous Movie Timelines that Make
No Sense.

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:33.199
.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.438
The Fast and the Furious franchise
The Fast and Furious began as a fun action

00:00:35.438 --> 00:00:36.438
flick with likable characters and awesome
car racing scenes.

00:00:36.438 --> 00:00:37.438
It has since become one of the most popular
franchises around thanks to its increasingly

00:00:37.438 --> 00:00:38.438
ridiculous stunts and endearing cast of characters
with driving skills and close familial bonds.

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:40.649
The timeline seemed simple enough until Han
showed up in the fourth film, Fast and Furious,

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.161
even though he died in the third film, Tokyo
Drift.

00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:44.161
Tokyo Drift initially feels like a standalone
film as it does not feature Paul Walker’s

00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:45.161
Brian but instead a teenager named Sean.

00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:48.210
However, Vin Diesel's Dom shows up in the
third film to tell Sean that Han used to hang

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.330
with his crew.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.530
This is news to viewers as Han did not appear
in the first film.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.219
It is not until a few films later that audiences
are given enough information to figure out

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.850
that Tokyo Drift takes place between Fast
&amp; Furious 6 and Fast 7.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.850
The chronology makes even less sense considering
the characters in Tokyo Drift use flip phones

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:04.850
after the characters in the sixth film carry
around smartphones.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.330
It is an unnecessary skew on the Fast and
Furious timeline but is easily forgiven by

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.330
audiences.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.430
Hot Tub Time Machine 2
The first Hot Tub Time Machine has plenty

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.750
of flaws with its time travelling logic.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.140
In the film, four guys accidentally go back
in time to a weekend ski trip in 1986.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.100
While three of them look like their younger
self to everyone else, Jacob played by Clark

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.620
Duke walks around looking like his current
self because he was not alive yet.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.410
That alone makes little sense in the time
travelling rules, but let us take a look at

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.540
the much more nonsensical timeline in the
sequel.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.490
The film opens to show Nick, played by Craig
Robinson as a famous music producer and performer

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.780
who in their version of the present has released
famous songs such as “Smells like Teen Spirit”

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.780
and “Mmmbop”.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.670
While amusing, this would be impossible as
Rob Corddry’s Lou is the only one who stayed

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.550
in the past at the end of the first film thus
making it impossible to steal and release

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.550
other musician’s song as his own.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.250
The rest of the plot gets even sillier when
Lou is shot and jumps in the hot tub to go

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.250
back in time and catch the shooter.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.740
Only he ends up going into the future to find
the killer.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.420
This shouldn’t make a difference since the
shooting has already happened and is not being

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.420
prevented.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.819
Things get worse when they return to the present
and see that it was their future actions that

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.040
caused the shooting in the first place.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.420
None of it makes any sense but neither did
making a sequel to Hot Tub Time Machine.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.420
The Butterfly Effect.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.420
In 2004, after years of playing a goofball
on That 70’s Show, Ashton Kutcher made his

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.420
foray to serious acting with the drama The
Butterfly Effect.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.420
The film is dark, entertaining and has timelines
that are a bit of a head scratcher.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.420
Kutcher’s character plays a man who has
had a difficult life made even more troubled

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.420
with his ability to time travel.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.420
While audiences can easily accept time travel
as a rational way to push along a plot, The

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.420
Butterfly Effect does not seem to understand
its own chronology and limits for Ashton’s

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.420
character Evan.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.400
One particularly confusing moment is when
Evan finds himself in prison and attempts

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.780
to prove to his religious cellmate that he
is able to speak to God.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.540
He does this by returning to his childhood,
piercing his hands and returning to show his

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.120
cellmate scars resembling stigmata.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.960
The problem with this is that after Evan goes
back in time to hurt himself, the timeline

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.150
would have shifted because of those actions.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.990
However, Evan manages to return to the prison
with his cellmate amazed by the stigmata.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.540
Evan would have had those scars once he walked
into the prison because he changed the timeline

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.540
as a child.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.100
The change would only be known by Evan, and
this is also assuming his actions did not

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.560
alter his path to prison.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.430
The Butterfly Effect has many moments similar
to this in a wacky timeline that proves time

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.990
travel is not a substitution for a cohesive
and reasonable plot.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.990
The Purge
Horror films are not always required to make

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.990
the most logical sense, but they also rarely
stray too far from a basic premise.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.990
For a frightening home invasion flick, The
Purge is rather audacious in its plot.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.900
The 2013 film sets the events of movie nine
years into the future.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.770
In those nine years, America has enacted a
yearly purge that allows law abiding citizens

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.420
to commit any crime without consequence.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.810
Murder seems to be the primary desire for
the general public and since enacting the

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:24.810
new purge law, the unemployment and crime
rate have dropped significantly.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.050
The timeline does not make sense for The Purge
in relation to how quickly everything changed

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.390
in nine years.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.580
How did America adapt so easily and quickly
to the rules and tradition of The Purge?

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.340
Furthermore, how did citizens become accustomed
to cold blooded murder in such a short time?

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.910
Even worse is that in Purge: Election Year,
the main character’s family is killed in

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.569
a purge that takes place in 2010.

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:46.569
The Purge may be an entertaining and chilling
film but without setting the events of the

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:47.569
purge into the much more distant future, the
believability and justification for the timeline

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:48.569
in unlikely.

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:49.569
Friday the 13th Franchise
Even for a Slasher franchise, The Friday the

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:50.569
13th timeline is over-the-top with its completely
nonsensical timeline.

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.740
Jason Voorhees’s origin story begins when
he is just eleven years old in 1957.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.210
The physically deformed Jason is cruelly teased
as a camper at Camp Crystal Lake.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.440
Since the counselors were too busy with each
other to pay attention to Jason while he was

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.360
swimming in the lake, he drowns and every
counselor that ever works at Camp Crystal

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.360
Lake again pays for that mistake.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.819
Jason first appears in the second film which
takes place in 1981.

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.239
How did this ghostlike entity age even though
he died as a child?

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.150
Since they never found his body, could it
be assumed that he did not die that day but

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.060
hid away for almost 25 years before exacting
his revenge on a new set of counselors?

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.900
If that is the case, why is he basically immortal?

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.490
The films get even stranger when you factor
in Jason X, in which it is stated that he

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.630
is in a frozen stasis for 455 years after
being placed in the chamber in 2010.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.789
This would make Jason 64 at the time of being
frozen.

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.449
The man sure is spry for someone nearing retirement
age.

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:37.449
Rage and revenge must be good for your health.

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:38.870
These inconsistencies are just a few in a
franchise full of timeline issues.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.153
Planet of the Apes
The twisty timeline in Tim Burton’s Planet

00:04:41.153 --> 00:04:42.153
of the Apes is enough to give most viewers
a headache.

00:04:42.153 --> 00:04:45.259
In the original Planet of the Apes, the twist
ending was a classic, but the remake, if you

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.950
can call it that, did not use a simple twist
ending but rather one that just didn’t make

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.169
any sense.

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.680
Mark Wahlberg plays an astronaut named Leo
who lands on a planet called Ashlar in the

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.650
year 5021 where humanoid apes run the world
and treat humans as slaves.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.659
When Leo returns back to the past and lands
in Washington D.C., the Lincoln memorial has

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:08.060
been replaced with a monument of the ape commander
from Ashlar, General Thade.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.370
How could this be?

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.699
How is it that the future could alter the
past?

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:16.909
Rather than giving audiences an even more
shocking twist ending than the original, the

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:20.809
film does not provide any answers about the
timeline and leaves audiences confused.

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:21.809
Looper Looper is one loopy movie that is full
of mind bending situations.

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:22.809
Just as any film about time travel has more
explaining to do, Looper does not explain

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:23.809
all that much.

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:24.809
Joseph Gordon Levitt plays a man named Joe
who is working for the mob in a distant future

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:25.809
where time travel is possible.

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:26.809
He is one of the few Loopers who are sent
to the future and past to eliminate people.

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:27.809
He does a great job but the bad guys decide
to close the loop and has the future Joe sent

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:28.809
back in time to be killed.

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:31.330
The main issues with the timeline for Looper
are the inconsistencies such as old Joe remembering

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.479
things that happened to his 25 year-old self,
but 25 year-old Joe not remembering events

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:38.099
from his 10 year-old self.

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.789
Pairing that with multiple timelines that
are impossible based on choices that are made

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:46.599
by other characters and actions made by Joe,
Looper has a timeline that seems to do its

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:48.909
best throwing audiences through a loop.

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:53.850
Back to the Future II
There is no disputing that the Back to the

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.009
Future films are classics but since the franchise
deals with time travel, the films open themselves

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:56.009
up for ridicule for its perplexing timelines
and unlikely realities.

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:01.069
In Back to the Future II, Marty and Jennifer's
head into the future thirty years to 2015.

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:04.520
Once they are there, they see their older
selves and their children.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.080
However, just as Doc’s dog Einstein disappears
momentarily to test the time machine in the

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.889
first movie, this would mean Marty and Jennifer
would not be around in 1985.

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:17.099
Making it impossible for them to have the
kids they are seeing.

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:21.500
We can assume that they return to 1985 with
their children’s existence being proof of

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.500
that.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.360
It does not explain why they try to hide from
their future selves as their future selves

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.969
would expect them to appear since they were
the ones who travelled in the future thirty

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:31.889
years before and would remember doing it.

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:32.889
It may seem nitpicky and Hollywood time travel
rules are never certain but thinking about

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:36.369
the events in Back to the Future II is certainly
mind boggling.

00:06:36.369 --> 00:06:37.369
Sin City: A Dame to Kill for

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:38.369
The movie Sin City is based on a graphic novel
by Frank Miller and has a unique timeline.

00:06:38.369 --> 00:06:39.369
Just like the graphic novel, the stories within
the film were not told in chronological order

00:06:39.369 --> 00:06:40.369
making it difficult to understand who is dead,
who is angry, and who allies are until you

00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:41.369
examine the film later and reorganize the
proper linear story.

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:42.369
It is tricky but still possible.

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:43.369
The sequel, A Dame to kill for does not achieve
that same possibility.

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:44.369
When considering the first film, the second
film does not seem to make sense even if viewers

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:45.840
watch it as standalone stories that need to
be sorted like a puzzle.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.569
There are characters who should be dead or
two characters who have never met, or somehow

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:51.840
forget they know each other.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.419
There are far too many instances of faulty
timelines to even begin to note them all.

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:57.889
Sin City: A Dame to Kill For was not a commercial
success which may be due in large part of

00:06:57.889 --> 00:06:58.889
its illogical timeline.

00:06:58.889 --> 00:06:59.889
X-Men Apocalypse
Keeping a clear and understandable continuity

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:00.889
for a film based on a comic book series is
not a small feat, especially with its multiple

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:01.889
reboots and spin-offs.

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:02.889
The X-Men franchise may be the guiltiest of
inconsistencies with a muddled sense of character

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:03.889
history.

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:04.889
X-Men Apocalypse seems most intent on causing
audience’s confusion.

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:05.889
Magneto is shown in 1983 as a fairly young
man and played by Michael Fassbender.

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:10.039
Yet Magneto managed to endure Auschwitz as
a child nearly forty years prior.

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:11.039
Fassbender is not the only one in the prequel
cast to look young.

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:14.659
The entire cast is supposed to have aged twenty
years even though the actors were cast only

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:15.659
five years prior.

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:16.659
Speaking of aging, what about Jubilee?

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:17.659
Even with recasting and being relegated to
the sidelines as a glorified extra, she always

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:18.659
seems to be in high school no matter what
year the films are set.

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:20.249
There is also the disconnection between the
events in Days of Future Past and Apocalypse.

00:07:20.249 --> 00:07:25.779
Mystique captured Wolverine and was a villain,
but in Apocalypse, Wolverine is free and Mystique
