00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.253
So far we have discussed a number
of technical solutions to deal with

00:00:05.253 --> 00:00:06.489
cyber threats.

00:00:06.489 --> 00:00:09.638
But these solutions have to
be considered in a context of

00:00:09.638 --> 00:00:11.530
an organization.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.080
For example, what are my cyber assets?

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.472
What kind of risks do they face?

00:00:17.472 --> 00:00:22.052
Do the technical solutions really
reduce this risk significantly?

00:00:22.052 --> 00:00:25.660
Are there people and process issues?

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.980
These topics come under what we
call managing cyber security,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.670
and cyber security management is
going to be the focus of this lesson.
