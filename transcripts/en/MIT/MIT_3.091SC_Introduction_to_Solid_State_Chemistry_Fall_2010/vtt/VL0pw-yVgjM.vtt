00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.620
PROFESSOR: We had a staff
meeting yesterday, and we

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.540
decided that what we're going
to do is, we'll start with

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.080
defects and solids.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.620
We didn't examine you on it
with the last celebration.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.510
So we'll pick it up with
defects, and we'll go through

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.210
to the end of solutions,
acid-bases.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.980
So the stuff that we covered on
Monday, the nomenclature of

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.540
organics, we're going
to leave out.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.750
Because you don't have enough
time with the recitations to

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.420
really dig into that,
and I think it's--

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.770
with the test being on a Monday
this time, and not on a

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.710
Wednesday, the schedule is
little bit of out of balance

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.800
from the way I'd
like it to be.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.170
But I thought having the third
celebration the Wednesday

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.700
before Thanksgiving
was not wise.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.580
I know that a number of you
are going to be in transit

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.240
that on Wednesday.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.990
But let me remind you that
Wednesday, we will have a

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.040
full-blown lecture.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.250
I'm going without
any slow down.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.660
So next Wednesday, we will
start biochemistry.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.770
So those of you who are not
here, please make sure that

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:30.840
you have viewed the lecture.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.660
Because when you return on
Monday, you will have no idea

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.900
what's going on.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.370
And it'd be a good idea not to
blow biochemistry, because on

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.400
the final exam--

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.590
if you fail the final,
it's not good.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.440
It's really not good.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.270
So just to be clear, we're going
to start with defects

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.260
and solids, and go through, and
end with acids, bases, and

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.060
solution chemistry.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.310
OK.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.380
So today I want to start to get
some mileage out of what

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.460
we learned on Monday.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.890
I want to talk today about one
of the applications of organic

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.530
chemistry, and that's
polymers.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.430
So we're going to take two
lectures on polymers, and then

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.260
we'll feed into biochemistry,
and you'll see a very natural

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.830
progression from what we're
doing now into the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.360
biochemistry.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.490
So let's begin with a little
bit of reflection on what

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.910
we've done so far.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.330
Up until now, we've looked at
various solid structures.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.220
We've started with single atoms.
We looked at crystals,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.560
disordered crystals,
and so on.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.510
We've looked at compounds,
and we've even

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.300
looked at small change.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.350
We looked at alkanes,
straight chain

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.860
alkanes, branched alkanes.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.260
And we've looked at
network solids.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.540
Here is a regular network.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.140
This is the structure of
graphite, for example.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.760
Nice, ordered crystalline
structure.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.640
Diamond grows in three
dimensions without abatement.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.480
We've looked at disordered
networks,

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.440
such as silicate glasses.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.450
So that's what we've looked
at up until now.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.700
What I want to talk about
today is polymers.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.440
Polymers are macromolecules.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.000
These are long chain
molecules.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.550
By long, we're talking about
thousands and thousands of

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:18.860
repeat units.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.260
And this is the distinguishing
feature between macromolecules

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.040
that are found in
the body, versus

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.780
macromolecules that are man-made.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.990
Mother Nature is a
polymer engineer.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.510
We are a macromolecular
organism.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.140
This is all polymer.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.860
It's all polymer.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.755
The changes in shape is all
elasticity in a polymer.

00:03:40.755 --> 00:03:45.870
And inside, of course, I've got
a ceramic skeleton, which

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.630
keeps the frame in place.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.660
But this is all polymers.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.520
But the difference here is,
this is not a repeat unit.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.960
Whereas when we have a man-made
structure, it's the

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.320
same repeating chemical
structure.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.170
And the other thing I want to
say at the beginning is their

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.160
importance in commerce.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.160
Polymers are found
everywhere today.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.900
Trash bags, auto parts.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.460
And in culture, they're
absolutely

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.880
essential to culture.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.870
Let's think about it.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.250
When you play that DVD, that
DVD is information

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.220
embedded in a polymer.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.010
The magnetic drags.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.180
What are magnetic drags?

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.310
These are polymers that have
been coated with gammaferic

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.690
oxide or some other
magnetic material.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.605
Without polymers we couldn't
have the modern era.

00:04:34.605 --> 00:04:38.310
And if you go back before the
DVD, with the CD, before that

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.400
was magnetic tape and
cassette, and

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.760
before that was this.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.270
You might see some
of these around.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.180
This is an old way of
presenting musical

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.820
information.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.160
This is the phonograph record,
photograph recording.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.570
And this is information that is
scribed into a platter, and

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.330
it's made of polyvinyl
chloride.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.210
That's why you hear
the term vinyl.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.440
Why is Virgin, the big Virgin
enterprise, called Virgin?

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.670
Because Virgin Records, when
they made their platters, they

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.460
started with virgin vinyl,
not recycled polymer.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.280
And so their platters would
lie flat on the turntable.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.150
Whereas some of them you
buy, you put them

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.290
down, and they warp.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.900
It's OK, because the needle
would still track, but it

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.570
looked kind of--

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.120
playing like this.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.640
And it's too bad that
we've lost this.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.590
Because this gives rise to the
real estate possibility for

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.310
artwork, and liner notes, and so
on, that you don't get when

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.970
you download something
for $0.99.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:38.750
OK?

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.570
So an electromechanical device
moves along here, and jiggles

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.840
in the grooves, and those
mechanical wigglings get

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.790
converted into energy that
ultimately gets fed through

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.340
the loudspeakers.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.900
And now let's talk about
visual information.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.590
Daguerre invented halide
photography in the early

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.890
1800s, but we didn't get
motion pictures.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.470
Cinematography had to wait for
the advent of polymers,

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.020
because only when we could make
material that would come

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.850
out miles long on which we
could coat with halide

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:24.470
photosensitive emulsion, could
we imagine images flashing

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.380
past us faster than the
persistence of vision.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.980
You need-- what's the
persistence of vision?

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.970
Around a twentieth
of a second.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.690
Motion pictures are 24
frames a second.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.400
So you couldn't have glass
plates on which you've got

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.170
halide film zipping past
at 24 frames a

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.470
second for 90 minutes.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.110
So only with the advent of
polymers did we have the birth

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.920
of cinematography.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.070
So what I'm talking about
here changed the world.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.610
It changed the world, and gives
birth to the fantastic

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.740
access that we have
to information.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.870
And now, of course, as things
move digitally, and they

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.050
dematerialize, you're going
to see a shift away.

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.490
But all this stuff was
enabled by the

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.700
advent of polymer chemistry.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.870
So with that as a motivator,
let's dive in.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:15.910
This is good stuff.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.010
It's really, really good.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.180
So now the payback comes.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.570
You know, all those little
lessons about, where's the

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.580
electron, where's the orbital,
you know, who wants to learn

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:24.070
that stuff.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.840
You have to learn it!

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.900
If you're going to write the
great novel, you've got to

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.870
learn how to spell.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.470
All right.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:33.830
So let's go.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.040
So the polymer, it comes
from the Greek poly,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.770
meaning may, right?

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:42.990
Poly is many And the mer,
the mer is this repeat

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.620
unit, if you like.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.700
Many units, many units.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.000
So let's take a simple
example.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.740
Last day we studied
polyethylene.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.300
So polyethylene looks
like this.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.090
Double bond, one, two, three,
four, four hydrogens.

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:02.705
So this is just ethylene.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.560
And what I can do with ethylene,
is I can react it.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.650
Ethylene's a gas, room
temperature.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:17.230
Put it into a reactor and expose
it to an initiator.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:18.830
And the initiator
is a radical.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:19.700
You know what the radical.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.240
It's something that's got
this unpaired electron.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.710
It's very active.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:29.240
And the radical sees a unit of
ethylene, which I'm going to

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.670
write like this.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.710
We don't need to put the
120 degrees now.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:38.020
And what the ethylene does, is
this radical attacks this

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.830
double bond and figures, well,
it's better to have two single

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:41.970
bonds than one double bond.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:44.030
Reacts the double bond,
breaks it, and

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.250
then forms the following.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:52.920
The radical now bonds to the
ethylene, breaks that double

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:57.690
bond, and transfers the unpaired
electron to the end.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:01.810
But now this thing is itself a
radical, and it's swimming in

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.180
a gas of ethylene.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:10.150
So now a second C2H4 comes up
against this, and it's turned

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:15.850
into the following, are now C
C C C C, one, two, three,

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:17.580
four, one, two, three, four.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.480
And so on.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.740
And this can go without limit,
until we shut down the

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.560
reactor, or we introduce
something that terminates,

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.690
that will cap this.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:28.220
All right?

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.090
So this is the beginning
of it.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.920
And what you see is attachment,
attachment,

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.060
attachment, breaking
of double bonds.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.870
And so we have a repeat
unit here.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.920
This repeat unit, the mer unit,
is this ethylene unit,

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:46.390
and it can go to a value of
n that is very, very high.

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:49.490
What kind of numbers can
we expect to get?

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:53.900
We can have numbers here
where n takes values--

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.100
and these aren't hard and fast,
but just to give you

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.020
some idea--

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:01.640
you could have a, you know the
oxymoron jumbo shrimp.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.420
You could have a short
chain polymer.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.590
A short chain, long chain.

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:07.980
You know?

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.290
Boy, you're really dead today.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:10.010
What's the matter with you?

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:10.960
Sleep deprived?

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.240
You've--

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:12.510
All right.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:15.890
So n can go up to
about 10,000.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:19.920
Now what's the atomic mass of
this, just as representative?

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.140
This is 2 times 12 is 24,
25, or 26, 27, 28.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:30.060
28's roughly 30, so 30 times
10,000, you've got 300,000.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:34.670
That's 300,000 grams per mole.

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:37.620
This means you can have
molecular weights on the order

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:44.480
of a million grams per mole
for one molecule.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.760
And by the way, the polymer
people, they come from a

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.150
different branch of science.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:50.820
So they don't use this
grams per mole.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:55.740
Instead of grams per mole, they
like to use the word, the

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.030
dalton, as a unit of measure.

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:00.650
So you might see in the pollymer
literature, you'll

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:05.340
see the polymer with so many
kDa, kilodaltons, thousands of

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.920
grams per mole.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.740
That's the nomenclature
you will see.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.060
OK.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.610
Now, what are the properties of
these things going to be?

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:17.675
Oh wait, I'm going to
show you something.

00:11:17.675 --> 00:11:18.820
To give you a sense.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.570
You need to be awakened.

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.550
So let me give you a sense
of just how long

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:24.940
these molecules are.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.520
So I'm going to give you a
little mechanical model here.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.230
I'm going to put up here
so we get some--

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:31.655
So what I've got here is
just a pull chain.

00:11:31.655 --> 00:11:35.110
If you go in the basement, you
might see these pull chains.

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:39.690
They're just made of brass,
little brass balls, and then

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:41.920
they've got links
between them.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.850
And when you cut them-- you buy
them by the foot at the

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:46.030
hardware store.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:51.230
You put it on a light, you can
turn the light on and off by

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:52.820
toggling up and down.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:57.760
So I'm going to say, let's say
this distance here represents

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.800
the distance between
mer units.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.280
This distance could be
between 2 mer units.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.670
And I figured, let's see,
I've got 40 feet here,

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:07.610
and I did the math.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:11.220
So this thing here, with the
40 foot pull chain, has a

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.510
polymerization index--

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:15.700
let's call this the
polymerization index.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:26.330
So my polymerization index, I
calculated it for this thing.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.610
It's on the order
of about 3,000.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:30.920
So that's pretty good.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.020
It's right in the
middle of this.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.190
It's actually--

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:38.250
this qualifies as a
bona fide polymer.

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:41.880
So let's take a look at
what happens here.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.150
This is one molecule.

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:04.420
So what do you know about

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.070
interactions between molecules?

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:09.180
Now, in the liquid state,
what's this going to be?

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.640
Is it going to be fluid, or
is it going to be viscous?

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.480
It's going to be viscous.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.580
Look, this is one molecule, and
it entangles with itself.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.450
Now, to make a liquid, I have
thousands of these things

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.200
swimming around, above their
crystallization--

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.410
oh, crystallization
temperature.

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:27.420
Freudian slip.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.790
Above their solidification
temperature.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:32.180
When they solidify,
are they going to

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.760
form an ordered solid?

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.775
One of these at each
lattice site?

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.040
Probably not.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.820
They're probably going to
form disordered solids.

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.800
So most of the polymers that
we encounter are probably

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.260
going to be disordered.

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:59.920
How is this held together
when it forms a solid?

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.290
It's polyethylene.

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:03.100
Well, what's your menu?

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.120
Is it ionic bonding?

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.810
Is it metallic bonding?

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:09.700
Is it hydrogen bonding?

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.400
How is it held together?

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.070
Weak van der Waals.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:15.380
Weak van der Waals bonds.

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:16.705
But look at the surface area.

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:23.560
So this is what it looks like.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.290
See, and it entangles, is even
entangles with my clothing.

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:27.790
It just grabs onto everything.

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:28.620
All right.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.820
Actually, why don't we--

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.665
David, let's cut
to the screen.

00:14:37.646 --> 00:14:39.840
So here we are.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.420
This is it.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.950
This is the polymer.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:47.380
And every once in a while,
a polymer will do

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.460
something like this.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.410
It'll say, you know, I still,
even though I'm in this big

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:56.350
long chain molecule I still
want to try to order.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:00.470
Because I read in 3091 that
ordering lowers the free

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.500
energy of the system...

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.180
So what it does, it
starts doing this.

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:08.970
And can you see when it starts
doing this, that it

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:11.720
starts to take on--

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.520
if you walked into the room
just now, and this were

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.950
blowing up really high, you
might see just this little

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.250
snippet and say, wow.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.920
This thing is starting to look
like a cubic array isn't it?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.040
This is a really good model.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.720
It's a really good model,
because this

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.470
is what really happens.

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:39.730
And so that decreases the
energy of the system.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.040
The bonds are greater there.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.540
So what's that going to do to
the mechanical properties?

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:45.890
Going to strengthen it, yeah.

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:47.690
It's going to make
things stiffer.

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:51.050
Instead of being this soft,
squishy polymer, it's going to

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.240
have some stiffness to it.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.730
And you've come up across
that stuff.

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:58.250
The most notable one
being the CD case.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:00.400
The people that make those, I'd
like to bring them here

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.570
and sit them down and teach
them some polymer science.

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:04.790
Those things are so brittle.

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:05.580
They crack, right?

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:07.380
There's only two classes
of jewel cases.

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.450
Those that are cracked, and
those that will crack.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:15.020
Because these people don't
know what they're doing.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:15.350
OK.

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:20.370
So now let's have some
time here to codify

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:21.980
what we've just see.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.050
So first of all, we suspect that
they're going to be solid

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:28.210
at room temperature.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:29.080
Dominantly.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.200
We can engineer them to be
liquid, but dominantly solid

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.430
at room temperature.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:38.305
And van der Waals
bonds abundant.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:44.430
OK.

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:47.516
And the liquid, as a liquid,
we expect viscous liquid.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:56.550
Good.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:57.450
Got that down.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:00.430
What else to have to know?

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.260
Let's do calculation here.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.800
So I did one here where I said,
what's this distance?

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.300
We saw last day that this
distance, carbon-carbon,

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.720
remember, we're looking at
single bond, double bond.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.000
A single bond carbon-carbon is
about 1.5 angstroms. So this

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.480
is 1.5 angstroms. The distance
between successive mer units

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:23.820
is about 3 angstroms. And so
if you take something 3

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:28.940
angstroms, and you make it this
number of mer units, I

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:35.940
came up with a polymerization
index of 3571 when this thing

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.790
weighs 10,010 kilodaltons.

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:45.040
And so then that means that
you'd end up with a length,

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:56.690
molecular length is on the order
of 10,714 angstroms,

00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:00.800
which is on the order of 1
micrometer, which then makes

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:05.410
it greater than the wavelength
of visible light.

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:11.340
So this is really a different
type of matter.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.190
And we can go there.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:17.470
We've talked about viscous, so
I'm going to remind you of two

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:18.710
observations here.

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:22.550
Viscous liquids, amorphous
solids.

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:25.090
If you put those two ideas
together, what

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:27.090
else can we call upon?

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:28.410
We can go back to this.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.870
Yeah.

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:38.120
Remember this?

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:41.520
What's this?

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.510
This is super-cool liquid,
super-cool viscous liquid.

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:48.720
This is the solidification
temperature, which in the case

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:53.030
of liquid to amorphous solid
is the glass transition

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:54.320
temperature.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.180
And here we have the excess
volume, right?

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.220
This is the volume, and then
there's some crystalline

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:01.780
volume, and so on.

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:02.240
Right?

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:06.860
I can cool at a second
rate, and I get this.

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:12.930
So this is slow cool,
this is fast cool.

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:14.970
We have a Tg up here.

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:20.030
Tgf I'll call Tg fast,
and Tgs, Tg slow.

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:21.780
So that'll give me a
different volume.

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:25.490
So this is volume fast
and volume slow.

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:26.100
All right?

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.650
And since I know that density is
equal to mass over volume,

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:34.340
so therefore v fast
is greater than--

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:38.540
I observe v fast is greater
than v slow, so therefore

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:48.290
density of the fast cool must
be less than the density of

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:51.030
the slow cool.

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:52.460
Now I'm going to put
some names on here.

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.850
I'm going to call this the
cooling curves for

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:56.560
polyethylene.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.030
These are the cooling curves
for polyethylene.

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:01.620
So this, down here, gives me--

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:06.340
this is now high-density
polyethylene, and up here is

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.620
low-density polyethylene.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:10.230
Same thing, just different
processing.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.740
So faster cooling quenches
in more free volume.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:24.250
And since volume is a measure
of disorder, right?

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:28.040
What's the difference between
great disorder and

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.720
not-so-great disorder?

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.540
David, again cut to the
projector, please?

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.520
Forgive me, the document
camera?

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.680
So the difference between
high disorder and

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.350
low disorder is this.

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:46.100
This is the order, here.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:49.710
So what that tells me is that in
high-density polyethylene,

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:54.190
there is a greater percentage
of zones like this.

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:56.710
And we just reasoned that this
is going to give stiffness and

00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:00.950
so on, and sure enough, for the
low-density polyethylene,

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:05.170
low-density polyethylene is used
in things like food wrap,

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:08.460
things like stretch and seal,
where you can pull because you

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:12.510
can move those macromolecules
relative to one another

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:16.160
without fracturing the material
to stretch it over.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:21.420
Whereas the high-density
polyethylene is used in such

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:25.140
things as milk jugs,
where you want a

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.860
little bit of stiffness.

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:31.490
Polyethylene milk jugs are
still kind of floppy, but

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:33.380
there's a little bit
of stiffness to it.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:36.590
The other thing is, because the
low-density polyethylene

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:42.310
is dominantly amorphous, with
almost none of this second

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:46.190
zone here, it's transparent
to visible light.

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:48.350
But now, let's think about
what's going on here.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.960
Where I've got this chain,
and then all of a

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.712
sudden I get to this.

00:21:53.712 --> 00:21:55.240
All right?

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.030
So this is clear
and colorless.

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:58.320
Right?

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.240
It's a high band gap material.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.190
There's no free electrons.

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.730
It's going to be transparent
to invisible light.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:07.940
So this is transparent to
visible light all along.

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:13.890
But can you see that because I
have this zone of ordering,

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:18.280
the density of matter here is
different, and so therefore,

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:25.960
when a photon comes in, the
index of refraction--

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.610
now, you know, this is one
of those days where n is

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:28.190
going to come up.

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:31.120
So here n is the polymerization
index.

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.010
Here it's index of refraction.

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:34.630
So maybe we'll use a
different color.

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:35.450
How about that.

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:36.200
All right?

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.880
So the green n is index
of refraction.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:46.630
So the index of refraction
in the amorphous zone, is

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:50.330
different from the index of
refraction in the partially

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:52.680
crystalline zone.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:57.410
So index of refraction varies
from zone to zone.

00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:00.880
Even though each zone is clear
and colorless, can you see

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.640
that this boundary between the
ordered and in the disordered

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.100
zone acts like an interface?

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.120
And what happens when you have
an interface with a different

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.350
index of refraction?

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:11.450
It scatters light.

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:15.220
And as a result, the milk
jugs, they appear white.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.940
You can't see through them,
even though they're

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:21.170
constituted of the same
continuous material.

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:24.770
But there's these density
fluctuations, because this is

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:26.830
a higher density than this.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:30.210
So you can rationalize
all of this stuff.

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:33.110
OK.

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:35.370
So this is what we would
call partial

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:37.750
crystallization in this zone.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:48.290
And that gives rise
to the changes.

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:50.100
Now, how would we distinguish
these?

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:53.890
What technique would I use to
see if I've got order in this

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:56.860
polymer, that I don't
know anything about?

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.530
How do I interrogate
atomic order?

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:02.550
What technique would I use?

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:03.740
X-ray defraction.

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:05.260
Thank you.

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:06.780
Back to the slides,
please, David.

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:14.480
I'll find you the piece.

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.940
This is called polyethylene,
but remember last day, the

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:22.680
IUPAC notation for this
is ethyne, so

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.140
this becomes polythene.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:28.100
And in the UK, it's known as
polythene, and there's a

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.850
Beatles song, Polythene Pam.

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:32.590
The only reason--

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:33.950
I put up here for two reasons.

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:36.840
One is, it has something
to do with polymers.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.400
At least they knew something
about polymers.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.560
It's apparently, they must have
been in a drug haze at

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.460
this period in their careers.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.440
This is absolutely terrible.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.970
Some of your parents probably
adore the Beatles.

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:53.140
If you want to provoke a
conversation at Thanksgiving,

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:56.000
pull out this one and ask them
to talk about the lyrics here.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.030
But this is just garbage.

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:57.650
This is garbage!

00:24:57.650 --> 00:24:59.730
This should be trash bag,
is what it should be.

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:02.470
But evidently, this woman used
to show up at parties dressed

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:05.080
only in a polythene bag,
a see-through polythene

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.260
bag, I might add.

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.520
So this is a paean to her.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.650
Anyways, it's bad.

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:12.580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:12.850
Anyway.

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:13.930
So here we are.

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:18.150
This indicates chrystalline
polyethylene.

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:20.740
Here you can see
the C2H4 unit.

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:26.530
And it's attempting to try to
occupy, as these beads line up

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:31.280
here, they're trying to
set up a faux lattice.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.470
And this is what
you might see.

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:36.060
And towards the end of the
lecture, I'll show you a

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.830
transmission electron micrograph
where you can see

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:43.530
this by dying it with
different colors.

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:43.820
OK.

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.360
So now here's some
x-ray defraction.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.000
So this is crystalline, where
they zoomed in on one of these

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.160
zones, and they've just
gotten the defraction

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.490
pattern from that zone.

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:55.430
And you see Bragg peaks.

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:57.400
And then this is in the
amorphous region.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.500
it's not featureless.

00:25:58.500 --> 00:25:59.810
There's one broad peak.

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:02.100
Why one broad peak?

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.500
Because even though there's no
long-range order, you have

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:05.280
short-range order.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.570
You know that you've got a
carbon on either side, you've

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:08.710
got hydrogens and so on.

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:11.880
So that short range order gives
you the broad peak.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.410
But look at C here.

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:15.130
Isn't this interesting?

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:22.720
That if you have a polymer that
has both some order and a

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:26.400
lot of disorder, if you take the
x-ray defraction pattern

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:32.410
more broadly, more globally, you
get the additive spectrum.

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:36.940
So you can see that this is
amorphous, but there are some

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:39.950
zones of crystallinity.

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:44.610
And that's the additivity power
of x-ray defraction that

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:46.650
allows us to interrogate.

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:51.130
So now let's talk in a little
more fine structure about

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:52.820
molecular architecture.

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:57.115
So tailoring molecular
architecture.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:02.590
And why are we doing this?

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:05.050
Because we want to engineer
these materials for desirable

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:05.660
properties.

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:10.010
Like CD cases that break after
about one or two uses, OK?

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:12.990
Of polymers.

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:15.100
Actually, there's probably a
business opportunity there.

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.870
You start a company where
you make jewel cases

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:18.830
that actually work.

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:20.890
People might be willing to pay,
you know, a penny more

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:22.340
for something that works.

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:22.740
All right.

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.280
So how do we change this?

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:28.060
What I'm going to show is a
whole bunch of cartoons of

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:28.710
architecture.

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:30.200
But how do we control this?

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.970
It's processing.

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:33.590
It's processing.

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:37.100
Processing and in the
synthesis algorithm.

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.310
I'm assuming I already have
polyethylene, so how am I

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:40.460
going to tailor it?

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:41.830
It's in the processing.

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:45.300
And so what I can do, is
I've got a number of

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.920
levers I can move.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:53.240
One is the composition of the
polymer, and the second one

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.810
is, I can use catalysis.

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:59.940
I already hinted at that last
day in talking about gasoline.

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.500
How do you start with petroleum
and get octane and

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.280
not heptane and so on?

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:11.040
By playing with cataylsis, we
can direct certain forms. You

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.220
can actually preferably
synthesize a certain

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:17.920
architecture by using
catalysts.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.680
So let's look at these
variables.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.600
First one is composition,
obviously.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.640
If you change the composition
of something, you can very

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.950
much expect to change
its properties.

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:30.490
So what do we have here?

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:32.080
We can--

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:36.960
here's a simple example
I can start here with.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.210
This is ethylene.

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:47.890
Or I can put a chlorine
here, so this now

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:50.420
becomes chloride, right?

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:53.020
This will become, what's the
radical, is vinyl, so this is

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:56.800
vinyl chloride.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.810
So if I polymerize this, this
becomes polyethylene.

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:01.470
If I polymerize this,
this becomes

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:03.940
polyvinyl chloride, PVC.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:08.470
Which is why you heard the
fellows from Blue Man Group at

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:13.130
the beginning banging on PVC
tubing to make their music.

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:13.410
All right.

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:18.270
So I use a pure, in other
words, only one mer.

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:20.050
It's pure polyethylene.

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:21.460
This it's called
a homopolymer.

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:31.830
Only one mer type in use.

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:35.950
If I want to make the polymer
analogy of an alloy--

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:40.040
in ally metals, alloy has more
than one metal mixed in, or a

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.340
metal can even have nonmetals
mixed in.

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:46.085
Then the polymer term
is called copolymer.

00:29:46.085 --> 00:29:48.640
I'll call this a copolymer.

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:55.730
And a copolymer has greater
than one mer type.

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:59.700
So for example here, this could
just be polyethylene.

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:04.800
Whereas here, an example would
be polyethylene, and then the

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:10.100
notation is hyphen lowercase c
hyphen, which is an indication

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:13.040
of the fact that you're
making a copolymer.

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:17.420
And this copolymer has mer units
of ethylene, and mer

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:19.430
units of vinyl chloride.

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:22.630
So this is a copolymer
of polyethylene

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:24.430
and polyvinyl chloride.

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:27.960
And then we can start looking
at the various ways of

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.380
arranging these.

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.590
So we can start with, for
example, we can have a

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:45.680
sequence of random mer types.

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.960
So as you're going down the
chain, you get either an

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:53.120
ethylene, or a vinyl chloride.

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:58.050
So this is called a random
copolymer, and it's designated

00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:01.400
polyethylene-r-polyvinyl
chloride.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:05.560
And actually, I think I've got
a cartoon showing this.

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:06.250
Yeah.

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:10.600
So A and B are different
mer types.

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.150
And so a random copolymer
just has A, B, B,

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:15.330
A, A, A, B, A, whatever.

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:18.770
And this is controlled in
the synthesis process.

00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:24.200
So I can take the same mix of
A and B, in other words, the

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.980
same two mer types,
but mix them in

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.390
an alternating sequence.

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:29.730
So they're very regular.

00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:35.040
It's 1 mer of ethylene, and
then one mer of vinyl

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.540
chloride, alternating all the
way down the backbone.

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:40.760
So this gives you a regular
copolymer, and it's designated

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:42.140
A for alternating,
because we've

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:45.030
already used R for random.

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:48.580
So instead of a sequence of
random, we have a sequence of

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:54.210
alternating mer types.

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:55.500
So that would be, in this case,

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:59.165
polyethylene alternating PVC.

00:31:59.165 --> 00:32:00.940
So that's two of them.

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:05.320
And then you see the block
copolymer shown.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:13.520
And in that case, the
mers grouped into--

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.860
they call them blocks, even
though it's a line.

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:17.790
You know, maybe it's like
walking down the street.

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:19.480
I've walked down one block.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:23.950
So this is one block, and then
there's the next block.

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:26.720
They're grouped into blocks.

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:32.750
So in that case, we have the
block copolymer, lowercase b,

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:35.030
and then PVC.

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:38.470
And what you see
there is a run.

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:39.720
A run of--

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:45.260
So all of the A's are
grouped, and then we

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:47.090
have all of the B's.

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:50.310
And this is actually an artist's
misconception.

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:54.060
In point of fact, most block
copolymers that you find, this

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:56.180
is the stuff they use for
the soles of your

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:57.110
sneakers and so on.

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:58.650
They're block copolymers.

00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:00.730
They're usually just
a diblock.

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:03.620
There's usually just two
different mer types.

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:07.320
One half of the macromolecule
is one mer type, the other

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:10.770
half of the macromolecule
is the other mer type.

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:14.250
Sometimes you might find a
triblock, where you might find

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:16.690
block A, block B, and then
another block A.

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:20.210
But this is a pentablock and
he's even got ellipses here as

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:21.350
though this thing keeps going.

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:23.230
There's no commercial product
that looks like that.

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:26.430
It's usually a diblock,
occasionally a triblock.

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:27.060
OK?

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:30.500
And then the last thing you can
do, as is shown up here,

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:33.270
is what is known as the graft.

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:37.280
And in the graft, the thing that
distinguishes the graft

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.750
is mers grouped into blocks.

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:50.310
In this case, a long side
chain of other mer.

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:53.470
So that's different from side
group that we saw last day.

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:55.570
These are long macromolecular
chains.

00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:59.130
So you see here the primary
backbone is A, and then you

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:02.890
have this very, very long
macromolecular chain of B.

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:07.625
And this is called the
graft copolymer.

00:34:07.625 --> 00:34:10.730
So that would be polyethylene,
could be the backbone, and

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:14.180
then long side chains of
polyvinyl chloride.

00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:18.070
And all of these have their
different architectures.

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:20.310
And I think I have an
example here of one.

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:22.540
This one, I think I mentioned
last day, when we were looking

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:25.920
at the butadiene.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:28.520
So this is hard-sided luggage.

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.850
And if you go to grandma's
house, and she hasn't gotten

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:34.390
into the digital age, and isn't
an old hipster with a

00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:38.800
cell phone, she's still got
the old hard plastic

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.680
telephone, it's made
of this stuff.

00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:44.830
ABS, which is acrylonitrile
butadiene styrene.

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:48.880
And the backbone is butadiene,
and then you have--

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.400
OK, so here's the backbone.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.130
It's long butadiene, which
we saw last day.

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:55.970
And then you've got side
chains of two types.

00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:58.740
And this is just indicating
A, A, but this is a

00:34:58.740 --> 00:34:59.750
macromolecule.

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:03.210
This might be 3,000 units long,
whereas this is 10,000

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:04.110
units long.

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:06.390
And this might be 2,000
units long.

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:09.590
So you have side chains of
acrylonitrile and side chains

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:11.650
of polystyrene.

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:14.650
And that's the hard plastic.

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:18.300
It's coming back, because
people want luggage that

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:21.980
doesn't destroy their
contents anymore.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:23.760
So that's coming back.

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:24.040
OK.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.940
So this is what we can do
in terms of composition.

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:31.570
Let's look at, also, the
side group arrangement.

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:33.840
And this is called tacticity.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:38.290
Tacticity, which is the
equivalent of what we saw last

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:39.600
day as stereo isomerism.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:50.730
Remember, I showed you the cis
and trans on the butadiene.

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:56.230
On the cis, you've got, in one
case, you've got whatever the

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:57.120
functional group is.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:01.370
I'm going to put A, A, B, B.

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:05.660
And then so this is the cis
version, or I can do a trans

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:09.630
version, which is instead,
I'll put in A up here

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:10.900
and an A down here.

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:13.450
I'll put a B up here
and a B down here.

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:15.090
So this is a trans version.

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:18.410
So imagine the analogy
for polymers.

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:19.380
So let's look at that.

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:22.160
It's easier to see it, and then
we can just document it.

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:25.430
So here's three different
polymers, all right?

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:28.780
So I'm going to start
with the lowest one.

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:32.460
This is called isotactic,
because this is vinylchloride.

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:35.890
There's vinyl chloride
by itself.

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:38.160
There's the vinyl radical
from ethylene.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.930
And then we tack on chlorine.

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:42.580
And now when we polymerize,
we're going to break this

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:45.920
double bond in order to link
this carbon to the neighbor.

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.350
So now the backbone only has
single bonds, right?

00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:50.830
You start with the double bonded
precursor, and now

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:52.950
you've got this chain
of single bonds.

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:53.220
Right?

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.390
But look at the chlorine.

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:57.460
The chlorine could either be
below, or it could be above.

00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:58.720
Well, in this case,
the chlorine is

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.410
always below the chain.

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:03.680
So this is called isotactic
polyvinyl chloride.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:06.830
Now this one, you know, they're
trying to mix two

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:07.540
things at once.

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:09.980
I would have shown this
with vinyl chloride in

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.090
all three, but OK.

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:13.830
So imagine now, in this case
it's syndiotactic.

00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:17.090
This happens to be polystyrene,
because this is

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:21.840
vinyl benzine, or what's
the other way to

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:25.360
call it, phenyl ethylene.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.410
You can have either way.

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:26.680
All right?

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:30.830
So you can say you're putting a
phenyl group onto vinyl, or

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:33.850
you're putting onto the
ethylene, or vice versa.

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:36.930
But the radical, this thing here
is called styrene, and

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:39.040
we're going to break that double
bond and away we go.

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:43.720
So this is the benzine ring, and
it alternates from above

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:44.840
the chain to below the chain.

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.610
Above the chain to
below the chain.

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:49.010
So in this, this is called
syndiotactic.

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:52.040
And the top one is a
polypropylene, so you start

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:55.250
with propylene, that has
the double bond here.

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:59.020
It's got three carbons and the
methyl group coming out, and

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:02.940
so you break that double bond
and make the chain.

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:05.600
And it seems to be on a random
basis where that

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:06.540
methyl group appears.

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:08.750
Sometimes above the chain,
sometimes below the chain.

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:13.830
So those are three different
ways of arranging, so three

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:15.060
different tacticities.

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:25.710
So we've got isotactic, we've
got syndiotactic, and we've

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:28.620
got atactic.

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.370
So the way to remember them,
isotactic obviously means,

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:33.590
everything's on the same side.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:35.500
And when I'm talking about the
same side, what is it?

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:38.580
Same side of the backbone.

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:41.390
And we're talking about
the position of

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:43.380
functional groups, right?

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:44.560
That's what this is all about.

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.440
The positioning of functional
groups.

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:59.450
In other words, a methyl, or a
benzine, or what have you.

00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:01.230
So same side of backbone.

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:06.050
Atactic is random, and then by
elimination, this one must

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:09.970
mean alternating,
above and below.

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:11.870
On opposite sides
of the chain.

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:14.580
And these have different
propensities for

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:15.470
crystallization.

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:16.960
Which of these three--

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:20.650
imagine that all three of them
were polyvinyl chloride.

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:24.770
Which of the three, atactic,
syndiotactic, isotactic, would

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:29.010
be most favorable from the
standpoint of partial

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:32.730
crystallization, to loop
back and forth?

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:37.870
The one that's most regular,
so the isotactic one has.

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:40.060
OK.

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:41.220
Third one.

00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:44.930
Third one is the backbone
configuration.

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:56.290
This is the configuration of
the main chain, all right?

00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:59.276
And this is called
conformality.

00:39:59.276 --> 00:40:03.510
You see, they have different
words for everything that came

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:04.850
from a different heritage.

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:09.040
So to me, it answers
the question, how

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.503
distended is the chain?

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:18.690
And we saw this last day, when
we looked at what happens when

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:23.050
we start with something like
this, where we have staggered

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:27.440
or eclipsed, remember,
orientation of

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.480
the hydrogens here.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:32.860
In the case of staggered,
we get the lower.

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:35.640
Both of these are straight
chains, because if you start

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:38.180
at one end, you move
monotonically all the way down

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:40.010
the chain to the other end.

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:41.640
There's no branching here.

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:47.250
But one of them, the lower one,
has staggering of that

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:49.660
carbon-carbon bond, with
the result, things

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:51.190
form this giant loop.

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:54.550
So in polymers, imagine this,
instead of being 36 units

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:57.490
long, imagine it being
3,600 units long.

00:40:57.490 --> 00:40:59.390
So now you can have
things to do this.

00:41:02.115 --> 00:41:04.540
You can even take a little
break here and

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:06.500
crystallize and so on.

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:13.980
So how do I distinguish that
from something that does this?

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:15.600
So how distended is the chain?

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:20.020
This one here is as distended
as it can be, and others can

00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:21.480
be much more coiled.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.430
So this one is called
linear chain.

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:30.500
This is branch chain.

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:32.460
Now, this is not graft.

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:34.960
Don't confuse this with
the graft copolymer.

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:38.920
Graft copolymer means, I have
one mer down the backbone, and

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:41.300
a second mer off to the side.

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:42.490
That's a graft copolymer.

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:43.640
This is a homopolymer.

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:46.630
A homopolymer that has
different branches.

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:50.030
So all of these, let's put
this here to remind us.

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:53.710
These are homopolymer
cartoons.

00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:55.520
Homopolymers that haven't
changed anything.

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:56.890
So this is something
that actually

00:41:56.890 --> 00:41:58.500
has different branches.

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:04.180
So this is branched chain,
branch chain architecture.

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:06.170
Good.

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:10.790
So which one of these is going
to be harder to crystallize.

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:12.760
Which one is-- well, obviously,
I've given it away,

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:15.470
I put that little piece of
crystallinity in there.

00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:19.130
Can you see that when these two
solidify, that the one on

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:21.380
the right, because it's got
these branched chains with the

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:22.980
covalent bonds sticking out.

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:24.320
It's not going to
pack as well.

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.120
And if it doesn't pack as well,
it's going to have a

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:28.250
higher free volume.

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:30.430
If it's got a higher free
volume, it's got a higher

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:31.330
degree of disorder.

00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:33.970
So the branched chains
have a greater

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:36.000
propensity for disorder.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.710
So let's put that down.

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:42.020
Branched chain, harder
to crystallize.

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:51.080
And crystallize, it's not a
giant crystal or polycrystal.

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:54.030
We're talking about the degree
to which we can get that

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:55.200
amount of ordering.

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:59.330
And then the last one I want to
show you is, here's three

00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:00.820
different chains.

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:04.042
1, 2, and 3.

00:43:04.042 --> 00:43:08.560
And what we're going to do is
we're going to cross-link.

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:11.080
We're going to form bridges.

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:12.660
These are covalent bridges.

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:17.290
These are not hydrogen bonds.

00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:19.180
These are not weak van
der Walls bonds.

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:22.830
These are strong covalent bonds,
all the way along here,

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:26.100
linking backbone to backbone.

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:27.420
So this is cross-linked.

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:37.080
And what do you think the
mechanical properties of this

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:38.270
are going to be?

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:42.320
If I want extend this, like
stretch and seal, I can pull

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:46.150
chain number three relative to
chain number one quite easily,

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:52.630
until this covalent bond has
bent over as far as it can,

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:54.070
and then what happens?

00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:56.160
I can't pull it anymore.

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.660
And what happens when
I let it go?

00:43:58.660 --> 00:43:59.910
It springs back.

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:02.570
So this imparts elasticity.

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:05.850
This makes the polymer
rubbery.

00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:08.230
Cross-linked polymers
are rubbery.

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:10.040
But you know, the polymer
people, they

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.770
want elevated words.

00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:14.030
If you say to a polymer person,
oh, so you've made a

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:15.430
rubber, they cringe.

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:16.490
They want to have
a fancy word.

00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:19.040
They call this an elastimer.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:22.060
It's got the word mer in it,
so they're happy, and it's

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.110
elastic, so it's an elastimer.

00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:25.450
Rubbery.

00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:27.600
So how are we going to make
these cross-links?

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.080
What are we going to have to
look for as an architectural

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:33.150
feature to make cross-links?

00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:34.662
We look at the backbone.

00:44:34.662 --> 00:44:38.680
If we've got a backbone going
like this, all these

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:40.900
carbon-carbon bonds, and
down here I've got

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:42.390
carbon-carbon bonds.

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:49.210
If I break one of these bonds
in order to go up in this

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:52.220
direction, I've broken
the chain.

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:55.790
So how am I going to have the
bonding capability to form a

00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:59.420
covalent bridge between chains
without breaking the very

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:01.400
chain I'm trying to link?

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:05.810
What feature am I going to have
to have in the chain?

00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:08.820
I need, after polymerization,
to still

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:11.090
have some double bonds.

00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:14.300
And if I've got still double
bonds in the backbone after

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:15.760
polymerization--

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:17.460
and now would I do that?

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:20.510
I have to have a double bond to
break in the first place.

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:24.050
So what would happen if I
started with a unit that had

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:25.420
two double bonds in it?

00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:28.450
That way, I give up one double
bond in order to make the

00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:30.600
chain, and I still have
a second double bond.

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:36.120
That's why the rubber
has butadiene.

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.130
The diene has two double bonds,
after polymerization,

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:42.410
still has one double bond, and
now what I can do is break

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:46.210
this double bond and this double
bond, and link them.

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:47.190
But if I link them,
they're going to

00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:48.930
be too close together.

00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:50.260
They're going to be
scrunched in.

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:52.560
I want to have some
play, here.

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:53.650
I want to make this rubbery.

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:54.810
So what do I do?

00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:56.290
I put a spacer in here.

00:45:56.290 --> 00:45:57.760
What do I use as a spacer?

00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:58.655
An atom.

00:45:58.655 --> 00:46:00.670
And what kind of an
atom do I need?

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:03.890
I need an atom that's capable
of making one,

00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:05.910
two covalent bonds.

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:07.620
What am I going to choose?

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:11.660
What atom do you know likes
to make linkages?

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:19.140
How did we make silicate?

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:21.390
What's the linker in silicate?

00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:22.280
Oxygen.

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:25.280
You could use oxygen, but I want
to make this thing even

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:28.105
farther apart, and a little bit,
you know, oxygen's small

00:46:28.105 --> 00:46:29.300
and it's got too
much strength.

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.810
If I want to make it weaker,
but something that behaved

00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:35.080
like oxygen, sulfur, I'd
go down one row in

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:36.270
the periodic table.

00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:37.460
So I'd put a sulfur in here.

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:40.880
And if I wanted to do a really
good job, I'll put a sulfur

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:43.620
here, since I got a double bond
from both sides, I'll put

00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:47.010
two sulfurs, and make a
disulfide linkage, and now

00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:49.810
I've got the making of rubber.

00:46:49.810 --> 00:46:51.060
Disulfide linkage.

00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:57.680
And again, the feature, I have
to start with the backbone

00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:00.800
that has a covalent
bond at the end.

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:03.120
OK.

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:08.170
Well, let me tell you a little
bit about the birth of rubber.

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:09.325
It started here in
Massachusetts.

00:47:09.325 --> 00:47:13.500
It started just across the
river, in Roxbury.

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:16.720
Nathaniel Hayward discovered
that rubber treated with

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:19.090
sulfur was not sticky.

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:20.570
If you take natural rubber--

00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:22.330
you ever work with
natural rubber?

00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:23.130
It's very sticky.

00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:24.790
You can't do anything with it.

00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:28.740
And Hayward reasoned that by
playing with the sulfur, he

00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:30.700
could-- he didn't understand
the molecular architecture.

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:34.430
But he learned that by playing
with sulfur, and introducing

00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:38.090
sulfur to the rubber, he lost
the stickiness and he got an

00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:40.470
enhanced elasticity.

00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:46.530
So Charles Goodyear came to
Boston from Ohio to meet with

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:52.150
Hayward, and he learned about
disulfide linkage and so on.

00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:54.490
Took the idea back to Ohio.

00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:57.580
And one day in the laboratory,
he was trying to prepare a

00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:00.690
batch of sulfonated rubber.

00:48:00.690 --> 00:48:03.240
And it was a laboratory
accident.

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:06.610
He knocked over the vessel
containing this sulfonated

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:09.810
rubber, and it landed
on a hot stove.

00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:12.640
Things were powered by fire.

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.600
Landed on a hot stove, and then
by heating it, he gave

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:18.510
birth to the process
of vulcanization.

00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:22.490
And hence was born the American
rubber tire industry,

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:26.280
by that accident, starting with
the trip to Roxbury to

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:27.580
learn about this.

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:30.550
And you could have done it all
with what you learned today.

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:33.280
You're just about 150
years too late.

00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:33.860
OK.

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:35.960
I will see you on Friday.
