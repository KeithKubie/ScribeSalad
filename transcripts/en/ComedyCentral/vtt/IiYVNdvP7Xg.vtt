00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.613

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.615
Okay.

Thank you for tuning in to uh...

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.956
The Legends of Comedy.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.124
(tape recorder clicks)

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:26.025
- That's was fantastic.

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:27.460
You did a great job.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.395 align:start size:97% position:3%
There were a lotta hard
hitting questions in there.

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:30.229
- Well you wrote them.

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:31.363
You wrote all of 'em.

00:00:31.363 --> 00:00:33.566 align:start size:88% position:13%
Can I ask you something
off the record?

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:34.634

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:36.903
(tape recorder clicks)

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:38.871

intern interview you

00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:40.740
about your comedy career?

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.876
Couldn't you have
a friend do it?

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:43.709
- I'm an adult.

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:45.210
I don't have friends.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.478
- Gotta love that friend, right?

00:00:46.478 --> 00:00:48.881 align:start size:84% position:16%
The friend who
doesn't pay his taxes?

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:50.149
If you're thinking about
your own friend group,

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:51.250
you can't figure out who it is.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.285
Uh. Spoiler alert.

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:53.486

00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:00.793

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:03.329

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:12.439
(phone chimes)

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.807
(phone beeps)

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:16.943

(audience cheers loudly)

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:28.521
- See the reality it is.

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:30.656 align:start size:84% position:16%
Oil is sold in dollars
globally, right?

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:33.759 align:start size:84% position:16%
And that's what keeps
our currency having
purchasing power.

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:34.861
People complain about wars.

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:36.428
But

00:01:36.428 --> 00:01:38.164
that's the only thing that
maintains our way of life.

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:39.431
Ya know.

00:01:39.431 --> 00:01:40.467

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:41.701

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:44.603
Listen, I gotta

00:01:44.603 --> 00:01:45.438

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:47.339
(soft music)

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:50.509
Actually, I should probably...

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.946
(bottle top opens)

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:55.348
Relax.

00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:57.316 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's not like it's
coming outta your pocket.

00:01:57.316 --> 00:01:59.352
(soft music)

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:00.186
Hey Errol.

00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:01.020
You made it.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.822
- Yeah. Just got here.

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:04.057
- Cool. I'll...

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:07.860
I'm glad you're feeling...

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.961
- Oh! David!

00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:10.363
How you doin' my man?

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:12.831 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'd shake but I got my
hands full with $20 bourbon

00:02:12.831 --> 00:02:13.732
and hot babe ass.

00:02:13.732 --> 00:02:15.067
Right babe?

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:16.669 align:start size:84% position:16%
She's mad because I
won't buy her a drink.

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.304
What're you workin' on?

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:20.739
- Um, thinkin' of launching
a Twitter parody account.

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:21.674
- [Man] Ugh!

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:22.842
- Maybe, Vine.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.210
- Ooh!

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.578
Well, ya know it's alright man.

00:02:26.578 --> 00:02:28.013
It takes time for some people.

00:02:28.013 --> 00:02:29.014
I mean, look at uh

00:02:29.014 --> 00:02:30.215
Judge Judy.

00:02:30.215 --> 00:02:32.418
87 years old got the
number one show on TV.

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:34.554
Two hundo mill duh-lor-ez

00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:36.689
And all she does is decide
who pays the electric bill.

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.858
That could be you.

00:02:38.858 --> 00:02:40.426
- Yeah. You're right.

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:41.694
- I'm wearin' a $1000 suit,

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:42.928
you're wearing a
performance fleece.

00:02:42.928 --> 00:02:43.862
You don't have to
tell me I'm right.

00:02:43.862 --> 00:02:44.697
I know I'm right.

00:02:44.697 --> 00:02:45.531
Right babe?

00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:46.766
(slow music)

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:47.833
I don't think she
speaks English.

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:49.168
Ever hear of Stevie Wonder?

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:50.002
- Yeah

00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:51.203
- Would you believe that

00:02:51.203 --> 00:02:52.838 align:start size:84% position:16%
that guy never learned
how to read music?

00:02:52.838 --> 00:02:54.207
- Wow that's impressive.

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:55.441
- Yeah I know.

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:57.009 align:start size:84% position:16%
I only say things
that are impressive.

00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:00.179
I'm gonna go talk to
somebody over here.

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:03.049
(light piano music)

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.853
(phone clicks and tones)

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:09.289
(phone buzzes)

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:11.090
(phone beeps)

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.725
(phone buzzes)

00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:14.126
(phone chimes)

00:03:14.126 --> 00:03:14.961
- Hmm.

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:16.295
(light piano music)

00:03:16.295 --> 00:03:17.130
Good time.

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:20.867
(metal clanging)

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:24.403
- Same time next week.

00:03:24.403 --> 00:03:25.370
- No.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.239
I got a another Craigslist job.

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.576
It's a little more dignified.

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:30.810
- What is it?

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.246
- Nude house cleaner.

00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:36.415

00:03:36.415 --> 00:03:37.383

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:38.451
