00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
&gt;&gt; I'm Matt Kind from Scotland.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.660
&gt;&gt; I'm Ramir.
I'm from Sri Lanka.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.890
&gt;&gt; I'm a very young activist and I'm hoping
to change the world.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.900
&gt;&gt; We're here at the world economic forum
to give, uh, the voice of

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.310
the youth, the younger generation and what
I think how chief companies

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.480
and individuals can do to make the world a
better place is that they

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.200
can think about things that they most cared
about when they were youth

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.570
like us and then put that into perspective
and actually be the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.260
difference that they want the world to see.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.470
&gt;&gt; And I believe that the best thing is that
countries should start

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.940
thinking about gay and lesbian attitudes in
a way that's not

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.960
prejudice, that's not discriminatory, and
start seeing them as people

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.460
and a natural part of human condition and
also to stop discriminating

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.170
against HIV positive people because there's
a lot of that goes on.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.880
So that's us.
Bye, Egypt.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.899
&gt;&gt; See ya.
